The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This application generally relates to waveguide polarizers, and methods of making and using same.","In general, guided-wave polarizer technology converts a circularly-polarized wave into a linear-polarized wave while maintaining orthogonality of the two possible senses of each polarized wave. For example, a guided-wave polarizer may convert a left-hand, circularly-polarized (LHCP) wave into a horizontal (H) linearly-polarized wave; alternatively, such a polarizer may convert a right-hand, circularly-polarized (RHCP) wave into a vertical (V) linearly-polarized wave. As is known in the art, such polarization conversion is based on decomposing circularly polarized waves into a superposition of two orthogonal, linearly polarized waves, in phase quadrature. Whether the composite field is LHCP or RHCP depends on which of the two linear components lags behind the other. A guided-wave polarizer advances or delays one of the field components by 90 degrees of phase relative to the other, bringing the two linear components into phase with one another, resulting in a linearly polarized composite wave. A guided-wave polarizer may also convert a linearly polarized wave into a circularly polarized wave, by the reverse process. Tolerances and errors in the conversion process typically result in some ellipticity of the wave, regardless of the desired polarization.","Many different structures have been developed to modify the polarization of a wave. One simple structure for converting from linear polarization to circular polarization is a hollow rectangular waveguide with a width that is slightly different from its height. A linearly polarized wave is introduced at a 45-degree angle relative to the waveguide; the wave is decomposed into two superimposed orthogonal linear TE10 modes (dominant modes) within the waveguide. As the two modes propagate through the waveguide, they will experience different cut-off frequencies and phase velocities as a result of the different width and height. The length of the waveguide is chosen such that one of the modes accumulates a 90-degree phase delay relative to the other mode across the length of the waveguide. The sense of the resulting circular polarization depends on the relative orientation of the linear polarization used to excite the two orthogonal modes, and the waveguide. Although this technique is relatively simple, only waves having a wavelength matched to the length of the particular waveguide will accumulate the 90-degree phase delay, resulting in a useful bandwidth of less than 1%.","Alternatively, as illustrated in , another common approach is the use of a dielectric slab polarizer , such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,607,849 to Purcell et al. Polarizer  includes a hollow cylindrical waveguide body , formed of a conductive material, having a slab  of dielectric material disposed therein. In this case it is useful to consider the incident linear TE01 mode as the superposition of two orthogonal TE01 modes , , each at half the power of the composite mode. This places one of the component modes  parallel to slab  and the other component mode  perpendicular to slab . The parallel mode  strongly couples to slab , in which it experiences a reduced phase velocity that is inversely proportional to the square root of the dielectric constant of slab . The dielectric constant, thickness, and length of slab  are selected such that parallel mode  accumulates a total phase delay of 90 degrees with respect to the perpendicular mode  as the two modes propagate through polarizer .","One drawback of polarizer  is that differential phase shift induced by slab  monotonically increases with frequency. For example,  is a plot of the calculated differential transmission phase of the dielectric slab polarizer of  as a function of normalized frequency. To perform the calculation, the polarizer was modeled and its performance simulated using a High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS), commercially available from Ansoft (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Based on the calculation, it can be seen that the differential transmission phase increases monotonically with frequency. The bandwidth of polarizer  may be defined as the frequency range over which the differential transmission phase is within 90 degrees plus or minus some tolerance value, for example, plus or minus five degrees, divided by the center frequency of that frequency range. Using such a definition, the marginal performance that can be achieved with the dielectric slab polarizer of  is limited to a bandwidth of less than about 4-5%.","Another drawback of polarizer  is that parallel mode  must propagate within slab . As such, the dissipative loss of the parallel mode  will be greater than the loss of the perpendicular mode , because dielectric materials produce more Ohmic loss than conductive materials. Dielectric slab  is also susceptible to outgassing and to damage, requiring the power of the incoming wave to be maintained below the damage threshold of the dielectric material. Additionally, polarizer  may only meet performance requirements within a relatively narrow temperature range of operation, because (a) the dielectric constant of slab , and thus the accumulated phase delay of mode , varies with temperature, and (b) the coefficient of thermal expansion of slab  may be substantially different than that of cylindrical waveguide body , potentially damaging polarizer  if exposed to temperatures outside of an acceptable range. Furthermore, repeatability of the dielectric material properties and dimensions may be poor, causing performance to vary from polarizer to polarizer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","200","210","200","221","222","210","221","222","221","222","261","262","263","261","263","221","222","251","252","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","310","320","300","351","352","300","351","352"]},"Polarization conversion can alternatively take place on an unguided, free-space wave with the use of multi-layer grids of linear or meander-line gratings. These structures tend to be relatively large and costly from a material standpoint.","Thus, prior art polarizers suffer from a number of deficiencies, including low bandwidth, high loss, low power handling capability, and\/or large size.","Embodiments of the invention provide high power waveguide polarizers with broad bandwidth and low loss, and methods of making and using same. Specifically, embodiments of the invention provide a compact waveguide polarizer that includes a hollow waveguide body and at least one ridge, for example, a pair of ridges, three ridges, or two pairs of ridges, disposed along the interior of the waveguide body. Each ridge includes on its upper surface a plurality of spaced projections, such as cylindrical or rectangular posts, or serrations. The ridges and spaced projections together produce a broad band differential phase shift between two orthogonal modes propagating through the waveguide body. Specifically, the spaced projections provide a small capacitive reactance that offsets the inductive loading of the lower portions of the ridges. As a result, a mode propagating parallel to the ridges accumulates a phase delay relative to a mode propagating orthogonal to the ridges that is substantially independent of wavelength over a relatively wide bandwidth. The differential phase delay may easily be tuned by adjusting the length of the projections. The bandwidth of the polarizer may in some embodiments be enhanced by configuring the projections so as to have a narrower width than the width of the ridge on which they are disposed. Additionally, the polarizers may be inexpensively fabricated, are compact, have no dielectric losses, may accept high power fields, and may be used in a wide variety of environmental conditions.","Under one aspect of the present invention, a waveguide polarizer includes a hollow waveguide body having an interior surface; a first ridge disposed on the interior surface of the hollow waveguide body and having an inward-facing surface; and a first plurality of projections disposed on the inward-facing surface of the first ridge. The projections of the first plurality may in some embodiments have a width and a length, wherein the width is narrower than a width of the first ridge, and wherein the length is tunable.","Some embodiments further include a second ridge disposed on the interior surface of the hollow waveguide body opposite the first ridge, the second ridge having an inward-facing surface; and a second plurality of projections disposed on the inward-facing surface of the second ridge. The projections of the second plurality may in some embodiments have a width and a length, wherein the width is narrower than a width of the second ridge, and wherein the length is tunable.","Some embodiments still further include third and fourth ridges disposed on the interior surface of the hollow waveguide body, the third ridge and the fourth ridge each having an inward-facing surface; a third plurality of projections disposed on the inward-facing surface of the third ridge; and a fourth plurality of projections disposed on the inward-facing surface of the fourth ridge. The third and fourth ridges may in some embodiments each have a height that is shorter than a height of the first and second ridges, and may be disposed orthogonally to the first and second ridges. The projections of the third and fourth pluralities may in some embodiments have a length that is shorter than the length of the projections of the first and second pluralities.","In some embodiments, the length of the projections is tuned so as to induce about a 90-degree phase delay in a first mode propagating in a plane parallel to the first ridges relative to a second mode propagating in a plane perpendicular to the first ridge.","The projections may include cylindrical posts. Alternatively, the projections may include rectangular posts. The projections may include screws.","The waveguide polarizer may have a bandwidth of at least 30% about a center wavelength. For example, the waveguide polarizer may have a bandwidth of at least 50% about a center wavelength.","The first plurality of projections may comprise between four and fifty projections.","In some embodiments, each projection comprises a conductor. The conductor may include a metal selected from the group consisting of aluminum, magnesium, zinc, titanium, steel, chromium, and gold.","The hollow waveguide body may have a substantially symmetrical cross section.","The first ridge may be formed integrally with the waveguide body. The first ridge has a height and a length. The height may be substantially uniform along the length. Alternatively, the height may vary along the length. The width of the first ridge may vary along the length.","In one embodiment, the first ridge has a length that is approximately equal to a wavelength of a mode propagating through the waveguide body.","Under another aspect of the present invention, a method of forming a waveguide polarizer includes providing a waveguide body having an interior surface; providing a ridge; providing a plurality of projections having a width that is narrower than a width of the ridge; coupling the ridge to the interior surface of the waveguide body, the ridge having an inward-facing surface; coupling the plurality of projections to the inward-facing surface of the ridge; and tuning a length of the projections.","Coupling the plurality of projections to the inward-facing surface of the ridge may include screwing each projection into the ridge. Tuning the length of the projections may include selecting a depth to which the projections are screwed into the ridge based on a phase delay to be induced in a mode propagating parallel to the ridge relative to a mode propagating perpendicular to the ridge.","Embodiments of the invention provide waveguide polarizers having significantly improved performance relative to the prior art polarizers described above. First, the inventive waveguide polarizers have a significantly broader bandwidth than previously achieved with slab, stepped ridge, or septum polarizers, for example. This broader bandwidth is achieved, in part, by providing, within a hollow cylindrical waveguide body, at least one ridge, for example, a pair of ridges, that include a plurality of spaced projections on their upper surfaces. As described in greater detail below, the projections may be cylindrical or rectangular posts, or serrations, for example, that protrude from a lower portion of the ridges. Like the ridges discussed above with respect to , the inventive ridges induce a differential phase delay in orthogonal modes traveling through the waveguide body. However, the spaced projections modify the wavelength dependence of the phase delay induced by the ridges, significantly broadening the bandwidth of the polarizer. Specifically, whereas the ridges of  induce a phase shift that increases monotonically with frequency, as illustrated in , the inventive ridges induce a phase shift that remains substantially constant over a wide frequency range, thus significantly broadening the bandwidth of the polarizer.","Additionally, in some embodiments, the waveguide polarizer may be constructed entirely of conductive materials, e.g., metals, thus avoiding the use of dielectric materials such as discussed above with respect to . As such, the polarizers may be reliably and inexpensively manufactured from a variety of suitable materials that may be used in harsh conditions, and are not susceptible to significant outgassing, in contrast to dielectric materials. Additionally, the polarizers are highly efficient because they do not cause ohmic losses. Moreover, the polarizers may be constructed so as to have easily tunable differential phase delay characteristics, allowing them to be easily modified during or after fabrication for operation with a wide variety of bandwidths.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","410","421","422","431","432","421","422","410","441","442","431","432","441","442","421","422","430","430","421","422","400"]},"In the embodiment illustrated in , ridges ,  are integrally formed with hollow waveguide body , and projections  are formed separately from ridges ,  and are coupled thereto. Ridges ,  have a substantially uniform height along their length, as well as a substantially uniform width along their length. In other embodiments, the height and\/or width may vary along their length. Projections  all have substantially the same length as one another, and each plurality of projections ,  includes the same number of projections . In other embodiments, projections  may have different heights from one another (e.g., the heights of projections  may vary relatively smoothly along ridges , ). Hollow waveguide body , ridges , , and projections  are constructed of one or more conductive materials, such as a metal, for example aluminum, magnesium, zinc, titanium, or steel, which optionally may be coated with another conductor, e.g., with chromium, gold, platinum, or silver.

As the frequency of the wave propagating through waveguide body  increases, the difference between the guide wavelengths \u03bb, \u03bbdecreases. As such, a waveguide polarizer containing ridges ,  alone, similar to that described further above with reference to , would exhibit a differential transmission phase that decreases monotonically with frequency. As can be seen from the second term of Equation 1, the differential transmission phase \u0394\u03c6is proportional to the number of projections n, the length of the projections l, and the resonance frequency of the projections f. Thus, a waveguide polarizer containing projections  alone would exhibit a differential transmission phase that increases monotonically with frequency. As can be seen from Equation 1, the frequency dependencies of ridges ,  and projections  oppose each other; that is, one decreases with frequency, while the other increases with frequency. Phrased differently, the projections provide a periodic capacitive loading that offsets the inductive loading provided by the ridges. As a result, the total differential transmission phase \u0394\u03c6is substantially independent of frequency within a wide frequency range, thus providing a polarizer having significantly broader bandwidth than the prior art polarizer of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 1A-2B","FIG. 4B","FIGS. 1B and 2B","FIGS. 5B"],"b":["451","452","400","421","422","431","432","421","422","410","400","431","432","400","6","7"]},"As can readily be seen from Equation 1 above, the differential transmission phase depends, among other things, on the product of the number n of projections , and the length lof projections . Based on such a relationship, it can be appreciated that the number n of projections  may be reduced proportionally as the length lof the projections is increased; conversely, the length lof projections  may be reduced proportionally as the number n of projections is increased. However, the length lof projections  is preferably less than one quarter of the guide wavelength \u03bbin the plane parallel to ridges , , because such a length would correspond to the resonant frequency f. Moreover, the length of the projections lcannot be decreased to zero, which would cause the second term of Equation 1 to vanish, yielding a ridge-only waveguide polarizer such as illustrated in . Additionally, the efficiency of waveguide polarizer  depends, in part, on the spacing between projections . For example, if projections  are spaced at \u00bc of the guide wavelength \u03bbfrom one another, reflections from the projections will destructively interfere, yielding a theoretical 100% transmission through the waveguide. However, it may be useful to space projections  at less than \u00bc of the guide wavelength \u03bbfrom one another, enabling a larger number n of projections to be included in waveguide  so that the length of the projections may be reduced. As such, the number, length, and spacing of the projections are interdependent parameters that may be selected based on the desired operating wavelength(s) of the waveguide, the desired size of the waveguide, and the desired throughput of the waveguide.","In some embodiments the waveguide polarizer may include four or more, five or more, ten or more, twenty or more, or even fifty or more projections disposed upon each of first and second ridges. For example, the waveguide polarizer may include between four and fifty projections, or between four and forty projections, or between four and thirty projections, or between four and twenty projections, or between four and ten projections, on each of the first and second ridges. For example, the waveguide polarizer may include four, or five, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten, or eleven, or twelve, or thirteen, or fourteen, or fifteen, or sixteen, or seventeen, or eighteen, or nineteen, or twenty projections, on each of the first and second ridges. In some embodiments, the projections have a length that is less than \u00bc of a guide wavelength, e.g., between \u00bc and 1\/1000, or between \u00bc and 1\/100, or between \u00bc and 1\/50, or between \u00bc and 1\/20, or between \u00bc and 1\/10, or between \u00bc and \u215b, or between \u215b and 1\/1000, or between \u215b and 1\/100, or between \u215b and 1\/50, or between \u215b and 1\/20, or between \u215b and 1\/10, or between 1\/16 and 1\/1000, or between 1\/16 and 1\/100, or between 1\/16 and 1\/50, or between 1\/16 and 1\/20, of a guide wavelength. In some embodiments, the projections are spaced apart from one another by \u00bc of a guide wavelength, or between \u00bc and 1\/50 of a guide wavelength, e.g., between \u00bc and 1\/25, or between \u00bc and 1\/20, or between \u00bc and 1\/16, or between \u00bc and 1\/10, or between \u00bc and \u215b, or between \u00bc and \u2159 of a guide wavelength.","For example,  illustrates waveguide polarizer  which includes waveguide body , first and second ridges , , and first and second pluralities of projections , .

In waveguide polarizer , each of the pluralities of projections ,  includes four projections , whereas waveguide polarizer  illustrated in  includes ten projections  in each plurality of projections , . Projections  may be constructed so as to have a proportionally greater length lthan projections , thus offsetting the reduced number n of projections , as discussed above with respect to Equation 1. As such, waveguide polarizer  may be constructed to be of overall shorter length than waveguide polarizer , because it need not accommodate as many projections as waveguide polarizer  to accomplish a similar phase delay between modes ,  as they propagate through waveguide polarizer  as waveguide polarizer  provides. Additionally, projections  may in some embodiments have a width that is narrower than a width of ridges , .","As illustrated in , ridges ,  each additionally include first, second, and third steps , ,  of varying heights. In one embodiment, steps ,  each have a length of \u00bc of the guide wavelength in the plane parallel to the steps, and step  has two \u201csegments,\u201d each of which has a length of \u00bc of the guide wavelength in the plane parallel to the steps, so that ridges  and  each have a length that is approximately equal to the guide wavelength, e.g., approximately equal to a wavelength of a mode supported by waveguide body . One projection  is positioned on each of steps ,  and on each of the two segments of step , so that the projections  are spaced at intervals of \u00bc of the guide wavelength from one another. Such an arrangement may enable the ridge\/projection assemblies to provide the desired 90-degree polarization rotation over the span of a single guide wavelength, enabling the waveguide polarizer to be significantly more compact than is possible for prior art waveguide polarizers such as those described above. Waveguide body  may have a length that is approximately as long as ridges , , or alternatively may have a length that is longer than ridges , , as is illustrated. In one embodiment, waveguide body  is slightly longer than ridges , , e.g., at least about 5% longer than the ridges.","It will be appreciated that ridge\/projection assemblies such as illustrated in  are optional, and may in some circumstances enhance the efficiency of a waveguide polarizer. The height of ridges ,  may vary along the length of the ridges in ways other than that illustrated; for example, the height may vary smoothly along the length.

In other embodiments, where the projections and ridges are formed separately from one another, the projections may be coupled to the ridges using any suitable method, such as with an adhesive, or a latching mechanism, or with welding. For example, a series of cavities may be defined in the inward-facing surfaces of ridges, and the projections inserted into the cavities. The projections may be held in place via friction, or may be secured using any suitable mechanism. For example, the cavities may be threaded, and the projections may be screws that are threaded to match the threads of the cavities. Or, for example, the cavities may be smooth, and the projections may be screws that create their own threads as turned. Or, for example, the projections may be screws that are self-tapping, obviating the need to form cavities in the ridges. In embodiments in which the projections are screwed or otherwise inserted into the ridges, their length relative to the ridge may be tunable, and the depth to which the projections are screwed or inserted into the ridges may be based on a phase delay to be induced in a mode propagating parallel to the ridges relative to a mode propagating perpendicular to the ridges, e.g., as discussed above with reference to Equation 1.","The waveguide polarizers of the present invention may be incorporated into a wide variety of systems. For example, circularly polarized signals are generally preferred for transmitting and receiving signals to and from satellite systems, because circular polarization obviates the need to align the ground-based antennas with that of the satellite antenna, as may be required for linearly polarized signals. This is especially true when used with Earth terminals that are mobile, viewing multiple satellites, or when the space segment is not in a geostationary orbit, causing the orientation of a linear polarized signal to constantly change. However, signal processing performed terrestrially or on a satellite is typically performed using linearly polarized waves, requiring the use of a waveguide polarizer to convert the circularly polarized received\/transmitted signal into a linearly polarized signal for processing. Additionally, to achieve high-capacity links, some systems encode different signals in both of the linear components of the circularly polarized waves, requiring high-polarization purity over the entire band of operation. When used in phased arrays that have large element counts, size and weight of the components in the antenna are also important parameters.","Various embodiments of the inventive waveguide polarizers may be employed as an interface between a circularly polarized antenna, e.g., a phased-array antenna or reflector antenna, and signal processing components, e.g., linearly polarized filters, amplifiers, and beam-formers. Because the waveguide polarizers are characterized by high bandwidth, low loss, compact form, durability, low residual ellipticity, and ease of manufacture, they are more suitable for use in such environments than the prior art polarizers discussed above, which may have too narrow a bandwidth, high sensitivity to environmental conditions, low reproducibility, high residual ellipticity, and\/or too high of loss to meet the desired performance requirements. The inventive waveguide polarizers may be used both in ground-based systems and in satellite-based systems, to convert circularly polarized transmitted and\/or received signals into linearly polarized signals for processing.","For example,  illustrate perspective and plan views of an embodiment in which waveguide polarizer  of  is coupled to conical feedhorn  and to rectangular waveguide . Assembly , ,  may be positioned, for example, in a satellite, an airplane, or in a ground-based system, which may be mobile or may be fixed. Assembly , ,  may be used alone, may be part of a phased array incorporating a plurality of such assemblies, or may be part of a reflector antenna. In some embodiments, waveguide polarizer  is coupled to waveguide , and feedhorn  is omitted. In other embodiments, waveguide polarizer  is coupled to feedhorn , and waveguide  is omitted. In some embodiments, both the satellite and the airplane or ground-based system include assembly , , .","Conical feedhorn  is configured to receive circularly polarized signals of both senses (LHCP and RHCP), and may be constructed using any design and materials known in the art. Those of skill in the art will recognize that in embodiments in which waveguide polarizer has a cross-section that is not circular, e.g., that is rectangular, feedhorn  may be constructed to have a shape that is other than conical, e.g., rectangular, to more efficiently feed waves into waveguide polarizer .","Waveguide polarizer  is configured to receive a circularly polarized signal from conical feedhorn , and is configured to induce an approximately 90 degree phase delay in that signal, e.g., as described above, to provide a linearly polarized signal. Rectangular waveguide  is configured to receive that linearly polarized signal, and to transmit that signal to other components, such as a filter. As illustrated in , aperture  of rectangular waveguide  may be positioned at a 45 degree angle with respect to the first and second ridges ,  and first and second pluralities of projections ,  of waveguide polarizer . The 45 degree angle allows the incident field to be split between orthogonal modes , , which propagate along waveguide  for processing by other components. In embodiments where assembly , ,  receives a signal having substantially only a single sense of circular polarization, waveguide  receives a signal having substantially only a single linear polarization. In embodiments where assembly , ,  receives a signal having both senses of circular polarization, each of which senses contains different information, waveguide  receives a signal having two linearly polarized orthogonal modes, each of which contains different information.","Assembly , ,  may also transmit signals. For example, waveguide polarizer  may receive a linearly polarized signal from waveguide , may convert that signal to a circularly polarized signal, and may provide that circularly polarized signal to feedhorn  for transmission.","Although the above-described embodiments include a single pair of ridge\/projection assemblies, other configurations are possible. For example, as illustrated in , waveguide polarizer  may include a first pair of ridges ,  with pluralities of projections ,  respectively disposed thereon, and a second pair of ridges ,  with pluralities of projections ,  respectively disposed thereon. In one embodiment, the projections of the pluralities ,  have the same length as one another, but a different length than the projections of the pluralities , . The widths of any or all of the projections may be narrower than the widths of the respective ridges on which they are disposed. Additionally, the pair of ridges ,  may have the same height and width as one another, but a different height and\/or width than the pair of ridges , . In the illustrated embodiment, ridges ,  have a greater height than ridges , , and the same width. Alternatively, any of the ridges may have different heights and\/or widths from any or all of the other ridges, and any of the pluralities of projections may have different lengths and\/or widths than any or all of the other pluralities of projections. The different heights and\/or widths of the ridge pairs and\/or the different lengths and\/or widths of the pluralities of projections may induce different phase delays in orthogonal modes ,  as the modes propagate along waveguide .","Alternatively, as illustrated in , waveguide polarizer  may include a pair of ridges ,  with pluralities of projections ,  respectively disposed thereon, and a single ridge  with a plurality of projections  disposed thereon. In one embodiment, the projections of the pluralities ,  have the same length as one another, but a different length than the projections of plurality .

In the illustrated embodiment, ridges  and  have a greater height than ridge , but the same width. Alternatively, any of the ridges may have different heights and\/or width from any or all of the other ridges, and any of the pluralities of projections may have different lengths and\/or widths than any or all of the other pluralities of projections. In some embodiments, the projections have a narrower width than the ridge on which they are respectively disposed. The different internal dimensions of waveguide  in the planes respectively parallel to modes ,  provided by the different heights of the ridges, the different lengths of the pluralities of projections, and\/or the absence of a ridge opposite ridge  may induce different phase delays in modes ,  as those modes propagate along waveguide .","Alternatively, as illustrated in , waveguide polarizer  may include a single ridge  with a plurality of projections  disposed thereon. The different internal dimensions of waveguide  in the planes respectively parallel to modes ,  provided by ridge , projections  may induce different phase delays in orthogonal modes ,  as the modes propagate along waveguide .","Any suitable number of ridge\/projection assemblies may be provided within a waveguide polarizer, according to various embodiments of the present invention. For example, as illustrated in , waveguide polarizers may have one, or two, or three, or four ridge\/projection assemblies disposed within a waveguide body. Alternatively, waveguide polarizers may have more than four ridge\/projection assemblies disposed within a waveguide body, for example, five, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten, or more than ten ridge\/projection assemblies. Additionally, the ridge\/projection assemblies may have any suitable configuration, and need not be limited to the uniform ridge\/cylindrical projection embodiments illustrated in . For example, the ridges may have a uniform height, or may have a height that varies along the ridge length, e.g., smoothly or stepwise, and\/or may have a width that varies along the ridge length, e.g., smoothly or stepwise. Or, for example, the projections may be cylindrical, rectangular, square, or serrations. Any suitable combination of ridge shape and projection shape may be used, including shapes not specifically described herein.","As discussed above with reference to ridges ,  illustrated in , in some embodiments the width of the ridges may vary along their length. For example,  illustrates ridge\/projection assembly  that may be used in place of ridges , . Ridge  includes steps  and \u2032 that have lengths of \u00bc of the guide wavelength and step  that has a length of \u00bd of the guide wavelength, which may be thought of as having two segments that are each \u00bc of the guide wavelength as discussed above with respect to . A projection  is disposed on each of steps  and \u2032, and on each segment of step , so there are two projections  disposed on step . Projections  have a width that is narrower than the step on which they are respectively disposed, and in the illustrated embodiment, have the same length as one another, although alternatively at least one projection  may have a different length than at least one other projection . Steps , \u2032 are not only shorter than step  (have a reduced height relative to step ) but also have a reduced width. Varying both the width and the height of steps , \u2032 may in some circumstances enhance the bandwidth of a waveguide polarizer incorporating ridge\/projection assembly , as well as reduce the number of higher-order modes excited within the waveguide polarizer.  illustrates a perspective view of waveguide polarizer  that includes first and second ridge\/projection assemblies  disposed opposite one another on the inner surface of waveguide body . Note that the wall of waveguide body  is omitted for clarity from .","The provision of additional steps of varying heights and\/or widths may further enhance the performance of a waveguide polarizer. For example,  illustrates ridge\/projection assembly  that may be used in place of ridges , , and that includes steps , , . . .  having projections , , . . .  respectively disposed thereon, with two projections disposed on central step . Assembly  is arranged substantially symmetrically, with steps  and  being about the same height and width as one another; steps  and  being about the same height and width as one another, and being taller and wider than steps  and ; steps  and  being about the same height and width as one another, and being taller and wider than steps  and ; and step  being taller, wider, and longer than steps  and . The projections have substantially the same width as one another, which width is narrower than the width of any of the steps in assembly . However, at least some of the projections have different lengths from each other. Specifically, projections  and  are about the same length as one another; projections  and  are about the same length as one another and are longer than projections  and ; projections  and  are about the same length as one another and are longer than projections  and ; and projections  and  are about the same length as one another and are longer than projections , . Varying both the width and the height of the various steps and projections may in some circumstances enhance the bandwidth of a waveguide polarizer incorporating ridge\/projection assembly , as well as reduce the number of higher-order modes excited within the waveguide polarizer.","In one illustrative embodiment, a ridge is provided that is similar to that illustrated in  but which contains 15 steps (indexed as 1, 2, . . . 15) that are arranged symmetrically and have the dimensions listed Table 1, and the projections respectively disposed thereon are cylindrical posts (indexed as a, b, . . . o) having the lengths listed in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Step Dimensions (inches)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Step","Width","Height","Length"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1, 15 (shortest steps at","0.016","0.010","0.016"]},{"entry":[{},"ends of ridge)"]},{"entry":[{},"2, 14","0.024","0.014","0.022"]},{"entry":[{},"3, 13","0.034","0.020","0.032"]},{"entry":[{},"4, 12","0.048","0.029","0.046"]},{"entry":[{},"5, 11","0.069","0.041","0.065"]},{"entry":[{},"6, 10","0.098","0.059","0.093"]},{"entry":[{},"7, 9","0.140","0.084","0.133"]},{"entry":[{},"8 (central-most step of","0.200","0.120","0.380"]},{"entry":[{},"ridge)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Post Dimensions (inches)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Post","Length"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"a, o (shortest posts at ends of ridge)","0.007"]},{"entry":[{},"b, n","0.010"]},{"entry":[{},"c, m","0.014"]},{"entry":[{},"d, l","0.020"]},{"entry":[{},"e, k","0.029"]},{"entry":[{},"f, j","0.042"]},{"entry":[{},"g, h","0.060"]},{"entry":[{},"i, i (two central posts on central step of ridge)","0.085"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In this example, the projections each have a width of 0.040 inches, and the total length of ridge  is 1.194 inches. In one embodiment, a waveguide polarizer having a pair of ridges  configured as listed in Tables 1 and 2 disposed opposite one another on the inner surface of a waveguide body having a length of 2 inches and an inner diameter of 0.710, was calculated to have a bandwidth of approximately 51%. It should be appreciated that the performance of such a waveguide polarizer is not highly sensitive to the width of the projections or to the length of the waveguide body, so long as the waveguide body is about as long as, or slightly longer than, the ridges .","In some embodiments, the ridges may be omitted entirely, and the waveguide body instead shaped to dimensionally perturb the ridge in a similar fashion to a ridge. For example, if the waveguide body is rectangular with a height and a width, wherein the height is smaller than the width, the smaller dimension along the height may provide a similar function to a pair of ridges. Analogously, if the waveguide body is elliptical with a major axis and a minor axis, wherein the dimension along the minor axis is smaller than the dimension along the major axis, the smaller dimension along the minor axis may perform a similar function to a pair of ridges. The waveguide body can alternatively be deformed to provide one or more ridge-like structures.","Additionally, the lengths of the projections may be \u201cde-tuned\u201d to provide dual-band performance. Specifically, in many of the embodiments described above, the length of the projections may be selected to give as wide a bandwidth of performance as is desired, for example so that the \u201ccombination\u201d curve illustrated in  is made as flat as possible over a desired bandwidth range. Increasing the lengths of the projections from such a length may cause the lower portion of \u201ccombination\u201d curve to drop further below 90 degrees. At such a length, the \u201ccombination\u201d curve may provide a 90 degree phase shift both at a relatively high frequency, and at a relatively low frequency. As such, the waveguide polarizer may be used to induce a 90-degree phase shift in two different bands\u2014one centered at the relatively high frequency, and the other centered at the relatively low frequency. Such a configuration may thus increase the amount of information that the waveguide polarizer is capable of processing.","While preferred embodiments of the invention are described herein, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made.
