title: Risk mitigation in data center networks using virtual machine sharing
abstract: A method employing resource orchestration algorithms may find a fewest number of working data centers (DCs) to guarantee K-connect survivability and a fewest number of virtual machines (VMs) among the DCs using an overlay network representing a physical optical network. The overlay network may exclude certain topological features of the physical optical network. An intra-request VM sharing method may share VMs among DCs allocated for an aggregation request. An intra-request VM sharing method may share VMs among DCs represented in the overlay network and among multiple aggregation requests.

No. 14\/102,313 filed Dec. 10, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates generally to data center networks and, more particularly, to risk mitigation in data center networks using virtual machine sharing.","2. Description of the Related Art","As more applications and workloads are moving to online network computing resources, also generally referred to as \u2018the cloud\u2019, geographically distributed data centers (DCs) are being deployed across wide-area networks, including optical networks. Such data centers may provide various instances of virtual machines (VMs) that may individually instantiate a computing environment, such as a server operating system, for example. Cloud applications may rely on distributed DCs for improved user experience. However, some cloud service providers may not own optical network infrastructure and may count on network providers to optically interconnect distributed DCs. Some network providers may be unwilling and\/or unable to expose their full network topology information to cloud service providers.","Many cloud applications in distributed DCs are arranged in an aggregation communication pattern, whereby an aggregation DC collects data processed at distributed DCs and outputs final results to users. Cloud applications can make physically dispersed VMs operate logically as one DC by collecting results from dispersed VMs at an aggregation DC. Other applications, such as cloud search and data backup, for example, can allocate VMs close to data stored in distributed DCs and provide results at an aggregation DC for access by users. In certain instances, complicated communication patterns can be constituted by scheduling a sequence of data aggregations.","Due to the reliance on distributed DCs and aggregation DCs, survivability in the face of various risks, such as network outages, DC failure(s), and\/or equipment failure, among other examples, is becoming an important issue for cloud applications. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an overlay framework that enables cloud service providers to control cloud network connections and optimize resource orchestration, yet enables network operators to offer network services while retaining detailed network topology information.","In one aspect, a disclosed method includes identifying a smallest M number of data centers (DCs) in an overlay network for K-connect survivability associated with an aggregation request for an aggregation DC and a smallest V number of virtual machines (VMs) among the M DCs. When K-connect survivability is satisfied for the M number of DCs, the method may include determining a number of VMs at each of the M DCs, including determining a number of working VMs and a number of protecting VMs, respectively. The method may also include generating a VM-share table according to the aggregation request. A minimum number of shared protecting VMs may be calculated for a set of risks associated with each of the M DCs. The method may further include updating the number of working VMs and the number of protecting VMs based on the minimum number of shared protecting VMs for each of the M DCs. The value K may represent a minimum number of DCs that remain accessible to the aggregation DC. The overlay network may represent a physical network.","In particular embodiments, the method operation of determining that K-connect survivability is satisfied may include determining the number of VMs at each of the M DCs for the aggregation request, calculating a current value of an integrated factor I for each of m DCs that are unselected, sorting the m DCs according to I, and adding a DC from the m DCs having a lowest value for I to the M DCs.","Additional disclosed aspects for identifying a smallest M number of data centers (DCs) for K-connect survivability include an article of manufacture comprising a non-transitory, computer-readable medium, and computer executable instructions stored on the computer-readable medium. A further aspect includes a management system comprising a memory, a processor coupled to the memory, and computer executable instructions stored on the memory.","The object and advantages of the embodiments will be realized and achieved at least by the elements, features, and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","In the following description, details are set forth by way of example to facilitate discussion of the disclosed subject matter. It should be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the field, however, that the disclosed embodiments are exemplary and not exhaustive of all possible embodiments.","Throughout this disclosure, a hyphenated form of a reference numeral refers to a specific instance of an element and the un-hyphenated form of the reference numeral refers to the element generically or collectively. Thus, as an example (not shown in the drawings), widget \u201c12-1\u201d refers to an instance of a widget class, which may be referred to collectively as widgets \u201c12\u201d and any one of which may be referred to generically as a widget \u201c12\u201d. In the figures and the description, like numerals are intended to represent like elements.","In U.S. application Ser. No. 14\/102,313, a K-connect survivability concept is disclosed that may guarantee resource availability under a wide range of risks for cloud applications. Two resource orchestration schemes are disclosed that may implement the K-connect survivability concept in an overlay framework for optical network virtualization: a risk-based scheme and a delay-based scheme. The resource orchestration schemes may identify a fewest number of data centers for guaranteeing K-connect survivability, where K represents a minimum number of DCs that remain accessible from an aggregation DC.","As described in further detail herein, the previous K-connect survivability concept is expanded to focus on VM allocation in the overlay framework with the objective of minimizing a total number of VMs allocated to the overlay network. Thus, in addition to K-connect survivability, a given number of VMs connecting to an aggregation DC for any failure at any time is also satisfied by the methods described herein using VM sharing among DCs in the overlay framework. The following parameters in Table 1, which are integers greater than zero, are used herein with respect to K-connect survivability using VM sharing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Parameters used for K-connect survivability using VM sharing."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Parameter","Description"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"K","A minimum number of DCs that remain"]},{"entry":[{},{},"accessible to an aggregation DC"]},{"entry":[{},"L","A number of shared risk groups (SRGs) in an"]},{"entry":[{},{},"overlay network"]},{"entry":[{},"M","A minimum number of working DCs for"]},{"entry":[{},{},"satisfying K-connect survivability"]},{"entry":[{},"N","A number of shared risk groups (SRG)"]},{"entry":[{},"V","A total number of VMs connecting to a DC for"]},{"entry":[{},{},"any failure at any time"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"A K-connect survivability (KCS) may be defined by a scenario where at least K number of DCs (out of M original working DCs) are reachable from an aggregation DC (DC) for an arbitrary risk, such as, but not limited to, network outages, DC failure(s), and\/or other types of equipment failure (also referred to herein collectively as \u201crisk events\u201d). For the purposes of the present disclosure, it may be assumed that DCdoes not fail. A risk event may result in multiple failures that may occur at DC sites (e.g., due to power outages, natural disasters, and\/or system maintenance) or in networks (due to fiber cuts). For cloud applications requesting a fixed number of VMs V, K-connect survivability using VM sharing may satisfy an aggregation request specifying V while minimizing a total number of VMs allocated to DCs in the overlay framework. It is noted that the number of VMs allocated to the overlay framework may be determinative for a bandwidth of network connections with the overlay framework, since each VM may be associated with a certain amount of bandwidth consumption.","As will be described herein, an overlay framework is presented that interconnects distributed data centers by virtualized optical networks. Survivable resource orchestration algorithms, based on the network information provided by the virtualized optical networks, such as shared risk groups (SRG) and delay, are disclosed. The disclosed resource orchestration algorithms may find a fewest number of working DCs to ensure K-connect survivability and a fewest overall number of VMs to satisfy the requested value for V. Resource orchestration algorithms disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 14\/102,313 may provision the fewest number of working DCs based on SRG information provided for overlay networks, where physical network topology may be unavailable and routing for connections may not be possible. In addition to satisfying K-connect survivability, the fewest number of VMs may be allocated within the overlay network to satisfy the requested value for V.","Turning now to the drawings,  illustrates an example embodiment of overlay framework , which may be based on optical network virtualization. In , overlay framework  is shown including overlay network , software defined-network (SDN) application programming interfaces (APIs) , and physical network . As shown, overlay network  may comprise connections  between DCs , where a bandwidth of connections  may be adjustable using optical network virtualization. In , an underlying optical network, represented by physical network , may be an optical transport network (OTN) and\/or a flexible optical data plane (e.g., flexible transceivers) configured to adjust the bandwidth of connections.","In , overlay network  is shown comprising virtualized DCs  and connections . In certain embodiments, DCs  may correspond to physical DCs ; for example, DC_ - may represent DC_A -, DC_ - may represent DC_F -, DC_ - may represent DC_E -, and DC_ - may represent DC_C -, while DC_B - and DC_D - may not be explicitly included in overlay network . In other embodiments, DCs  may include computing resources from one or more physical DCs , and may represent virtualized DCs; for example, DC_ - may represent at least portions of DC_A - and DC_B -, etc. It will be understood that other arrangements and configurations of mapping DCs  in physical network  to DCs  in overlay network  may be practiced in different embodiments. Furthermore, connections  may represent virtualized connections having a given capacity for transporting data. As shown, connections - and - may represent low capacity connections, connections - and - may represent mid capacity connections, while connections - and - may represent high capacity connections. Although connections  are shown in overlay network connecting two DCs , connections  may be physically implemented using various network topologies, and may actually represent physical connections that include different nodes and\/or network segments. However, to a cloud service provider using overlay network  as an operational network platform, the actual physical topology may remain hidden and\/or may change over time.","Cloud service providers may have a centralized controller (not shown in the drawings) that manages VMs at DCs interconnected by overlay network . The centralized controller (also referred to herein simply as \u201cthe controller\u201d) may obtain network information, such as delay and SRG of connections, and may request the bandwidth of connections through network application programming interfaces (APIs) with the help of network control and management tools, such as software-defined networks (SDN). As shown in overlay framework , SDN APIs  may represent software tools for enabling a user (e.g., a cloud provider) of overlay network  to query network information. It is noted that overlay framework  may enable network providers of physical network  to keep detailed physical network topology information hidden, while allowing cloud service providers to easily set up cloud services, to perform resource orchestration, and to flexibly increase or reduce the bandwidth of connections. The cloud providers may use SDN APIs  to query certain specific attributes for DCs  and\/or connections  in overlay network , without having knowledge of the specific network topology of physical network , and\/or without direct interaction with hidden components in physical network , such as intermediate network devices along connection paths  that are not included in overlay network .","Referring now to , example embodiments of aggregation requests  and corresponding protection schemes are illustrated in diagram form. The controller may receive cloud aggregation requests and may perform resource orchestration. In one example embodiment. As shown in , aggregation request - may illustrate how aggregation DC- handles a basic aggregation request, for example, via the controller, by aggregating data from DC-, DC-, and DC-. More complicated aggregation requests may be generated using a combination of basic aggregation requests and\/or sets of basic aggregation requests.","Guaranteeing K-connect survivability may save network cost by jointly considering information from physical networks and DCs. In  separate (blind) protection - shows an example where sindicates risk i and network connections may be blindly protected by providing path-disjoint connections (dotted lines) from aggregation DC-. In , K-connect survivability for K=2 (i.e., 2-connect survivability) may be guaranteed by protecting against risk events at DCs separately from the network connections, which may result in 6 connections in separate protection -. In , joint protection - illustrates, by using shared risk group (SRG) information from underlying optical networks, how 2-connect survivability may be guaranteed by finding network connections and DCs that can be jointly protected. For example, risks Sand Smay be joined in one SRG, risk Sand Smay be joined in a second SRG, and risks Sand Smay be joined in a third SRG. In joint protection -, significant savings in network resources may be achieved by having 3 connections, representing a savings of 3 protection connections as compared to .","Using SDN APIs  (see ), a subset of DCs with minimum delay may be identifiable when multiple subsets of DCs that satisfy K-connect survivability exist. A delay of an aggregation request may be given by a total delay of connections between the subset of DCs and the aggregation DC (DC). It is noted that DCmay be allocated to a DC that is relatively near to users or relatively near to a particular subset of DCs, depending on specific applications.","Referring now to , an example embodiment of overlay network  for K-connect survivability using VM sharing is illustrated in diagram form. Overlay network  may include 6 DCs, given by DC-, DC-, DC-, DC-, DC-, and DC-. Overlay network  is shown to provide an overlay framework for aggregation requests  described below with respect to .","Referring now to , example embodiments of aggregation requests  and corresponding joint protection schemes are illustrated in diagram form. As shown in , aggregation request - illustrates an aggregation request for DC=DC-, while aggregation request - in  illustrates an aggregation request for DC=DC-. In aggregation request -, DC- is associated with shared risks Sand S, DC- is associated with shared risks Sand S, and DC- is associated with shared risks Sand S. In aggregation request -, DC- is associated with shared risks Sand S, and DC- is associated with shared risks Sand S.

Thus, the total VMs for an aggregation request with K-connect survivability may be given by V*M\/K. However, when VMs are shared among DCs associated with the aggregation request, referred to as intra-request VM sharing, the number of allocated VMs may vary among the DCs.
