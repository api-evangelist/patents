title: Method and system for streamlining voting process
abstract: A method and system for streamlining a voting process performed by a web application is provided. As the web application may require that a voting action is effectuated after the user is registered to vote and also has supplied valid credentials, a voting application may be configured to intercept a request from a user to effectuate voting process directed to the web application, access credentials of the user stored by the web-based social networking application, and provide these credentials to the web application, such that the web application can process the request to effectuate voting process by registering the user to vote and storing the vote information for the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates to the technical fields of software and\/or hardware technology and, in one example embodiment, to system and method for streamlining voting process.","A web-based social networking application may provide means for executing other web application within its context without leaving a web site provided by the web-based social networking application. For example, a web-based social networking application may provide a so-called canvas, within which a web application may be executing.","Computer-implemented method and system for streamlining voting process provided by a web application is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of an embodiment of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","As used herein, the term \u201cor\u201d may be construed in either an inclusive or exclusive sense. Similarly, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is merely to mean an example of something or an exemplar and not necessarily a preferred or ideal means of accomplishing a goal. Additionally, although various exemplary embodiments discussed below may utilize Java-based servers and related environments, the embodiments are given merely for clarity in disclosure. Thus, any type of server environment, including various system architectures, may employ various embodiments of the application-centric resources system and method described herein and is considered as being within a scope of the present invention.","A web application executing in the context of a web-based social networking application may be configured to present one or more web pages containing various information. The web application may be a social awareness application, such as, e.g., \u201cChangemakers\u201d\u00ae provided by Ashoka. The web-based social networking application may be \u201cFacebook\u201d provided by Facebook, Inc. A web-based social networking application may provide a so-called canvas page, on which to run a web application provided by a third party provider. A web application may be provided on a cloud-based computing platform. While two distinct entities may be providing, respectively, a web application and a web-based social networking application, a third entity may be providing a voting application (also termed a voting platform) that uses the canvas provided by the web-based social networking application to permit user interaction with the web application without requiring a user to leave the social networking web site.","Method and system are described for providing enhanced user experience to users who access a web application that is executing in the context of a web-based social networking application and who attempt to exercise the voting functionality of the web application. The web application, e.g., \u201cChangemakers\u201d\u00ae may serve, to a browser application executing on a client computer system controlled by a user, a web page that includes a visual control termed \u201ca vote button.\u201d A vote button may be configured to detect a click associated with the vote button and cause the web application to update the voting data for an item associated with the vote button. In order to process a voting action (or merely a vote) submitted by a user, the web application may require a user to submit valid credentials first. The web application may then perform operations for registering the user to vote, and only after confirming that the user has been registered to vote within the web application, accept and process voting process by the user. In one example embodiment, a voting application provides functionality that streamlines the voting process performed by the web application. As the web application may require that a voting action is effectuated after the user is registered to vote and also has supplied valid credentials, the voting application may be configured to intercept a request from a user to effectuate voting process directed to the web application, access credentials of the user stored by the web-based social networking application, and provide these credentials to the web application, such that the web application can process the request to effectuate voting process by registering the user to vote and storing the vote information for the user. In some embodiments, the credentials of the user stored by the web-based social networking application are distinct from credentials of the user stored by the web application. A notification of the successful vote by the user may be propagated to a news feed of the user provided by the web-based social networking application.","An example computer architecture  for streamlining a voting process performed by a web application may be described with reference to . As shown in , a computer system  hosts a voting platform . The voting platform  uses a canvas  provided by the web-based social networking application  to permit user interaction with a web application  executing on a computer system  without leaving the social networking web site associated with the web application . The web-based social networking application  may be executing in a browser application and receive. In one embodiment, the voting platform  exchanges information with the canvas  via web-based interaction. The web application  exchanges information with the voting platform  via one or more application programming interfaces (APIs). An example method and system for streamlining a voting process performed by a web application may be implemented in the context of a network environment  illustrated in .","As shown in , the network environment  may include client systems  and  and a first provider's computer system . The first provider's computer system , in one example embodiment, may host a social networking application , such as, e.g., Facebook\u00ae. The client systems  and  may run respective browser applications  and  and may have access to the first provider's computer system  via a communications network . The communications network  may be a public network (e.g., the Internet, a wireless network, etc.) or a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), Intranet, etc.).","Also shown in  are a second provider's computer system  hosting a web application  (e.g., Changemaker\u00ae) and a third provider's computer system  hosting a voting platform . As mentioned above, the voting platform  may be configured to provide functionality that streamlines the voting process performed by the web application  while it is being accessed via a web page provided by the social networking application . In one embodiment, the voting platform  may be configured to intercept a request from a user to effectuate voting process directed to the web application , access credentials of the user stored by the social networking application , and provide these credentials to the web application , such that the web application  can process the request to effectuate voting process by registering the user to vote and storing the vote information for the user. The third provider's computer system  hosting a voting platform  may be termed as intermediary provide system, as it may be utilized as an intermediary between the first provider's computer system  the second provider's computer system . Some example modules of the voting platform  are illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","310","320","310","320","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","400","260","300"]},"As shown in , the method  commences at operation , when the communications module  of  receives a request from a user to effectuate a vote action in a web application, the web application executing in the context of a web-based social networking application.
