{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates generally to the field of computer technology, and in a specific example embodiment, to a return fraud protection system.","Retail stores lose a significant portion of revenue annually due to fraudulent behavior, such as stolen merchandise or fraudulent returns. For example, it is not uncommon for an individual to enter a store, pick up an item, pretend that they have previously purchased the item and then attempt to return the item without a receipt. It is difficult for a retailer to monitor the behavior of every customer that enters a given store.","In addition, due to the competitive nature of the retail environment, most retailers are forced to maintain relatively liberal return policies that allow merchandise to be returned without a receipt under certain conditions. Thus, retailers have been unable to effectively prevent or even discourage such fraudulent merchandise returns.","Although the embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.","In various embodiments, a method and a system for determining a return fraud at a store are described. The return fraud protection system has a video recording module, a face capture module, a face icon generator module, and an entrance video clip module. The video recording module records a video at an entrance of the store. The face capture module captures a face of a customer entering the store from the video. The face icon generator module generates a face icon comprising the face of the customer. The entrance video clip generator module generates a video clip of the customer entering the store, associates the video clip of the customer with the corresponding face icon, and provides a client device with a list of face icons with corresponding video clips.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112","100","102","132","106","107","110","116","132"]},"For purposes of the present embodiment, the terms \u201csites\u201d and \u201cpremises\u201d refer to any location to be monitored, whether residential, commercial, public, or secured. Further, the term \u201ca\u201d is generally used in the present disclosure to mean one or more. Still further, the terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201coperatively coupled\u201d mean connected in such a way that data may be exchanged. It is understood that \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201coperatively coupled\u201d do not require a direct connection, a wired connection, or even a permanent connection. It is sufficient for purposes of the present embodiment that the connection(s) be established for the sole purpose of exchanging information.","The client device  is connected to the computer network . The client device  can include, but are not limited to, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile computing device, a mobile smart phone device, and so forth. A network interface means is provided to enable the client device  to send and receive data to and from the computer network .

In another example, the client device  includes a programmatic client, such as a client application (not shown) configured to communicate with the web server  via the computer network . The web browser  may be used to display some or all of the information and monitoring data provided by gateway .","The computer network  can include a local area network (LAN) where Gigabit Ethernet switches are used to switch data. In another example, the computer network  includes a wide area network, such as the Internet. In general, computer network  may be a public network or private network, a single network or a combination of several networks. In most embodiments, computer network  may be, but is not required to be, an IP-based network. In some embodiments it may be desirable for all or a portion of network  to include publicly available networks, such as the Internet, to avoid the need for installing, purchasing, or leasing additional infrastructure.","The web server  may also connect to the computer network  both to receive and transmit data. The web server  may also be referred to as a web-based host. The web server  is connected to the computer network  by a means of a network interface. The network interface can take the form of a network interface card (not shown) installed in the web server  to enable data to be sent and received to and from the computer network  by the web server .","In one embodiment, the web server  identifies the gateway  for the client device  to communicate with, so as to monitor and\/or control the security devices connected to the gateway .","In another embodiment, the web server  may provide server-side functionality, via the computer network , to the client device . The client device  may enable users that utilize the network system  and more specifically, the web server , to view monitoring data (e.g. audio\/video feed) from security devices connected to the gateway  over the computer network . These transactions may include transmitting, receiving (communicating) and processing data to, from, and regarding monitoring data and users of the network system . The data may include, but are not limited to audio, video, picture, metadata, camera configuration data, client device configuration data, and network data monitoring data. The web server  can provide other functions including storing monitoring data to an internal or external disk storage device (not shown), playing back recorded monitoring data, among others.","In one embodiment, the web server  may include a directory of gateways and the location of corresponding connected security devices. The web server  is described in more detail below with respect to , B, and C. As such, the web server  may correlate the gateway  to the cameras , , and  in the retail store . In one embodiment, the correlation may be generated pursuant to pre-defined settings or configuration based on user profile, organization topology, hierarchy, bandwidth and other factors. For example, a user at client device  may be a manager responsible for stores located on the West coast. If sites A and B are on the West coast, the web server correlates gateway  to retail store . As such, based on the user profile and the organization topology, the user can access only gateway  to obtain monitoring data from sites A and B. In other words, the user does not have to communicate directly with several gateways to monitor all security devices attached to the corresponding gateways. In another embodiment, the web server  may correlate gateway  with other gateways. In yet another embodiment, the other gateways may be correlated with other gateways.","Generally, the gateway  includes a processor-based device that operates to monitor conditions at the retail store . For example, the gateway  can be configured to analyze the monitoring data, to detect alarm conditions at the retail store , to capture information relating to such alarm conditions, and to send such monitoring information to client devices ,  and .","The gateway , located at the retail store , is connected by way of a local area network LAN  to local client devices  and . The client device  may be located at an item return location or a merchandize return desk of the retail store . The client device  may be located at a security location or a security desk of the retail store .","The client devices  and  each may include a web browser  similar to the web browser  of client device . The web browser  may be configured to communicate with gateway  and retrieve monitoring data (video clips) from gateway .","In one embodiment, the client device  at the item return location in the retail store  alerts the client device  of a customer attempting to return an item without a receipt at the item return location of the retail store . The client device  at a security office location of the retail store  receives a list of face icons with corresponding video clips in response to the alert from the client device . The client device  then notifies the client device  of a potential return fraud based on the video clip of the customer entering the store from the list of face icons.","Security devices (e.g. monitoring devices and controlling devices) may include cameras , , and  connected to the gateway  via LAN . Monitoring devices include, for example, sensors, microphone, cameras. The gateway  is not limited to connecting to any specific type or model of sensors or monitoring devices. Any sensor may be used, depending on the desired type and level of protection. Examples include, without limitation, microphones, cameras, magnetic contact switches, audio sensors, infrared sensors, motion detectors, fire alarms, occupancy sensors, and thermal sensors. For illustration purposes, the retail store  in  includes a camera  at the entrance of the retail store , a camera  at the item return location of the retail store , and a camera  at each merchandize aisle of the retail store .","In one embodiment, the camera  is positioned at the entrance of the retail store  such that it can capture the video of a customer walking into the retail store  and capture the face of the customer.","In one embodiment, the camera  is positioned at the return desk of the retail store  such that it can capture the video of a customer at the item return location of the retail store  and capture the face of the customer.","In one embodiment, the camera  is positioned at a merchandize aisle of the retail store  such that it can capture the video of a customer walking in that corresponding merchandize aisle and capture the face of the customer.","For illustration purposes, the gateway  may also be connected to controlling devices in the retail store  that include devices that can be controlled such as a HVAC system (e.g. heater\/air conditioning system including thermometer, smoke sensor, thermostat), a gate\/door lock, a camera positioning system (e.g. tilt, pan).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C"],"b":["200","200","202","206","208","210","228","212","202","200","112","206","200","102","106","110","208","200","200","208","200","210","208","228","200","228","212","200","206","208","210","200","200","200","200","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["200","200","213","214","215","213","104","108","200","214","213","214","213","215"]},"In another example, the gateway  also includes an access control API , an access control module , and access control drivers . The access control API  provides an interface to the web browser  or a client application  of a client device to receive and send data from an access control device (e.g., a door access at a monitored site) connected to the gateway . The access control module  enables the client device to receive data (e.g., time and ID log of the door access at the monitored site) from the access control device via the access control API . In another embodiment, the access control module  enables the client device to send data to the access control device (e.g. open, close, lock door) to the access control device via the access control API . The access control drivers  include one or more drivers for different brands or manufacturers of access control devices.","One advantage of one of the embodiments of the gateway  is the ability to easily connect additional devices or third-party devices. This is illustrated with respect to other API , other module , and other drivers . As such, the gateway  is not limited to any particular manufacturer of devices or brand of devices. The gateway  allows for easy expansion and plug-in features using additional APIs, corresponding modules, and corresponding device drivers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["228","200","228","200","104","102","106","107"]},"In one embodiment, the web-based monitoring application  includes a communication module  and a remote devices management module . The communication module  enables communication between the gateway  and the client devices , , and . The remote devices management module  enables the client devices , , and  to monitor and\/or control the monitoring or controlling devices (e.g., cameras , , ) connected to the gateway .","For example, the communication module  includes a user authentication module , a user access policy module , a web server authentication module , and a transport module .","The user authentication module  authenticates a user at the client device based on a user profile of the user. An example of user authentication may include verifying the username and password provided by the client device with a predefined user profile. The predefined user profile may be stored in the storage device  or at the web server .","The user access policy module  limits or grants the user at the client device access to the monitoring and\/or controlling devices connected to the gateway . For example, a user with limited privilege may have access to the monitoring data to a particular site (e.g., first floor only) or a specific monitoring device (e.g. HVAC only). On the other hand, a user with executive privilege may not only be able to view monitoring data, but also to control security devices from more sites.","The web server authentication module  authenticates a communication between the gateway  and the web server . For example, the gateway  transmits a unique token to the web server  for authentication prior to establishing the secured communication. Those of ordinary skills in the art will recognize that other means of authentication between the gateway  and the web server  may be used.","The transport module  enables peer-to-peer communication between gateways. As such, a client device communicating with one gateway at a first location is also able to communicate with another gateway at a second location.","For example, the remote devices management module  of the web-based monitoring application  includes an analytics module , an event aggregation module , an event-based control module , and a client-based control module .","The analytics module  analyzes audio\/video, and other detected changes from the monitoring devices and generates events based on the analysis. For example, the analytics module  is capable of determining how many people have entered or left an activity zone (e.g., a room, a hallway) in a video feed, the direction of the movement of individuals in a video feed, the temperature of individuals in a video feed, facial recognition of individual in a video feed, and so forth. Events are generated based on the analysis and predefined user-configured settings. A user at the client device is able to configure the conditions for generating an event from the web browser  of the client device .","The event aggregation module  aggregates events generated from the analytics module . For example, events generated based on the analysis and predefined\/user-configured settings are aggregated in a log stored in a storage device attached to the gateway , in a storage device attached to another gateway, in a storage device attached to the web server , or in a storage device connected to the client device.","The event-based control module  communicates a command to at least one controlling device connected to the corresponding gateway based on an event identified in event aggregation module  based on an event configuration. For example, an event comprises a temperature of a room reaching a predefined maximum temperature. The event-based control module  may communicate to the HVAC system to turn on the air conditioning system for the room if such event an occurs.","The client-based control module  communicates a command to one or more controlling devices of the corresponding gateway based on a command initiated and communicated from the client device. For example, a user at the client device may initiate a command to pan a camera connected to the gateway . Such a command would be communicated to the camera via the client-based control module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["209","200","209","102","106","107","132"]},"In one embodiment, the return fraud protection application  includes a video recording module , a face capture module , a face icon generator module , a face icon matching module , an entrance video clip generator module .","In another embodiment, the return fraud protection application  also includes a bar code module , an aisle identifier module , an aisle camera identifier module , and an aisle video clip generator module .","The video recording module  enables recording of video from the cameras , , and . In one embodiment, the video recording module  captures video from the entrance of the retail store , at the return desk of the retail store , and at a merchandize aisle of the retail store . The video recording module  includes for example video capture software.","The face capture module  captures a face of a customer entering the retail store  from the video recorded by the entrance camera . The face capture module  can also capture the face of the customer at the item return location in the retail store . A face capture software captures the face in a frame of the video from the camera . In one embodiment, the face capture module  does not necessarily include a facial recognition algorithm to determine a unique pattern of the face of the customer. The face capture module  may be configured to determine and delineate a face of a person (e.g., a customer walking in the retail store ) in the frame of the video.","The face icon generator module  generates a picture icon or a face icon of the captured face of the customer as provided by the face capture module .","The entrance video clip generator module  generates a video clip of the customer entering the retail store . In one embodiment, the entrance video clip generator module  associates the video clip of the customer entering the retail store  with the corresponding face icon. The entrance video clip generator module  further provides the client devices , , and  with a list of face icons with the corresponding video clips. An example of a list  of face icons and corresponding video clips is illustrated in . For example, a customer face icon  is shown next to a key frame of a video clip  of the corresponding customer entering the retail store . Similarly, a customer face icon  is shown next to a key frame of a video clip  of the corresponding customer entering the retail store . As such, when the frame of the video clip  is clicked on, the corresponding video clip is played on the client devices , , and .","In another embodiment, the key frame may be selected from a most relevant frame showing the customer entering the store. For example, an algorithm determines the most distinguishable (e.g. clearest, most relevant) key frame of the customer from the video clip. For example, an algorithm may analyze the motion of the body from the customer entering the store and determine the most relevant key frame based on the position of the body. One or more key frames may be provided as part of the list .","For example, the system may capture the face of each member of a family or a group of people entering the storing at the same time. As such, the customer face icon  may include the face of a parent along with a corresponding key frame  that includes all members of the family. Similarly, the customer face icon  may include the face of a child accompanying the parent along the same corresponding key frame  that includes all members of the family. In one example, although the parent is not carrying the returned item, the child may be carrying the returned item. In such scenario, the list  would provide the same key frame for both the customer face icon of the parent and the customer face icon of the child.","In one embodiment, the entrance video clip generator module  provides the client devices , , and  with the list of face icons of the faces of the customers as shown in  entering the retail store  after the opening of the retail store  and before the closing of the retail store  in a same day.","The customer service representative at the return desk location only needs to retrieve video clips of customers who have entered on the same day that they are attempting to return their item without a receipt. As such; the entrance video clip generator module  only needs to generate video clips as far back as the time the retail store  opened that same day.","In one embodiment, the customer service representative at the return desk reviews the list  of  when a customer is attempting to return an item without a receipt. The customer service representative manually makes the determination from viewing the list  and the video clips of whether the customer previously entered the store without the returned item in hand that same day.","In another embodiment, the entrance video clip generator module  receives from the client device  at the return desk a notification of a customer attempting to return an item without receipt at the item return location in the retail store  (typically, customer service area). In response, the entrance video clip generator module  provides the client device  with the list  of face icons of the faces of the customers entering the retail store  within a predetermined amount of time (e.g., within the last ten minutes, one hour, and so forth) from receiving the notification from the client device . A customer service representative may manually activate the notification at the client device . For example, the customer service representative may press on a particular icon or button if the customer is attempting to return an item without a receipt.","Furthermore, the face icon matching module  matches the face of a customer captured at the item return location in the retail store  from camera  with the face of a customer captured at the entrance of the retail store  from camera . In one embodiment, the face of the customer entering the store and the face of the customer at the item return location in the store are captured on the same day. In another embodiment, the face icon matching module  provides one or more of the closest matched face icons of customers at the item return location and the entrance of the retail store.","In one embodiment, the entrance video clip generator module  matches the captured face of the customer at the entrance with the captured face of the customer at the return desk. The entrance video clip generator module  then provides the client devices , , and  with a video clip of the customer with the matched face entering the retail store . The face matching may be performed, for example, by using a facial recognition algorithm.","The bar code module  identifies an item or a product based on a bar code of the item being returned at the item return location in the retail store . For example, the customer service representative at the return location may scan or manually enter the bar code or any other identifiable marking on the item using a keypad or a bar code scanner attached to the client device . In one embodiment, the storage device  of gateway  may store a table (not shown) of bar code identifications along with corresponding item\/product identifications, aisle identification, and camera identification. In another embodiment, the table may be stored in another device such as in the web server  or the client device .","The aisle identifier module  identifies an aisle in the retail store  corresponding to the identified item from the bar code module . In one embodiment, the aisle identifier module  consults the table in the storage device  to determine the aisle in the retail store  where items similar to the item being returned is stored or displayed. For example, an item identified as a toy may be typically located in a particular aisle of a toy section of the retail store .","The aisle camera identifier module  identifies a camera associated with the aisle in the retail store . For example, there may be at least one camera placed at each aisle in the retail store . Or there may be a camera aimed at several aisles in the retail store . Accordingly, the aisle camera identifier module  identifies the camera associated with the identified aisled.","The aisle video clip generator module  generates a video clip of the identified aisle in the retail store  within a predetermined amount of time from the time the item is being returned at the item return location in the retail store . For example, the aisle video clip generator module  may generate a video clip of the last ten minutes from the identified camera at the client device . As such, the customer representative at the return desk or the security officer associated with the retail store  can monitor and determine whether the customer was indeed taking an item off the shelves in the corresponding aisle of the returned item. In one embodiment, the security officer is located either in the retail store  or located off site. In another embodiment, the security officer at an offsite location may be able to monitor several retail stores from a client device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["110","110","302","310","302"]},"In one embodiment, the web-based gateway management application  includes a gateway directory manager , a user authentication module , and a gateway authentication module . The gateway directory manager  identifies a gateway associated with a user profile. For example, a user may only be able to access a particular gateway or a particular set of devices connected to a gateway. As such, a West coast manager of an organization may be able to access monitored sites only from West coast stores of the organization. In contrast, a user with higher privileges may be able to access more gateways and devices. As such, the CEO of an organization with stores throughout the U.S. may be able to view monitoring data from all the stores in the U.S.","In another embodiment, the gateway directory manager  includes a service manager module  to enable add-on services to the user at the client device. For example, the add-on services include, but are not limited to, remote storage, remote audio, two-way audio, dynamic backup, or reporting based on the user profile.","The user authentication module  authenticates the web server  with the user at the client device based on the user profile. For example, the web server  verifies the username and password of the user at the client device.","The gateway authentication module  authenticates the identified gateway. For example, the web server  receives a unique token from the identified gateway to authenticate the identified gateway prior to establishing secured communication between the web server and the gateway.","The storage device  may be used to store user profiles, tokens from gateways, a directory of gateways with corresponding devices, services from the gateways, a directory of gateways associated with a user profile, and a directory of connected security devices associated with a user profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506","508"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704","706","708"]},"In one embodiment, a client device at a security office location is alerted of a customer attempting to return an item without a receipt at the item return location.
