{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to a CAPTHCA method and a system thereof.","CAPTCHA\/Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a technique for challenge-response tests used in computing environment. CAPTCHAs can be deployed to protect systems vulnerable to e-mail spam and automated postings, by running a challenge-response test on the systems, for example, a user's computer or smart phone. CAPTCHA can also be used to prevent or at least make it harder for machines to automatically download files.","The process usually involves a server asking a user to complete a test which the server is able to generate and send to the user's user equipment and then, upon a reply from the user equipment, determine whether the user has inserted the right answer to the test. The test is supposed to be easy to solve for a human but not a computer. Because computers are supposed to be unable to solve the CAPTCHA, any correct solution received by the server is presumed to be originating from a human, thus distinguishing humans from computers. A common type of CAPTCHA requires that the user types in letters and\/or digits displayed in a distorted image that appears on a screen before e.g. registration, downloading and login to provide a secure environment for the application service providers.","It is also known that the evolution of CAPTCHAs has led to a form of advertising\/advertisement (often abbreviated as \u201cAd\u201d). In essence, the core concepts and purpose of CAPTCHAs will remain unchanged. Instead of seeing a distorted image that contains generated characters, an image or video containing advertisements may be displayed.","In video-based CAPTCHA solutions, a CAPTCHA text is embedded into 5\u02dc10 seconds flash video. Users need to identify the floating CAPTCHA text in the video and input the text. A company named NuCaptcha provides this CAPTCHA solution, as can be seen via http:\/\/www.nucaptcha.com, retrieved on Feb. 23, 2011. However, there is a problem that users immediately may recognize and remember the CAPTCHA characters in the Ad video without having to and\/or wanting to see the whole Ad video. Although he\/she has to submit CAPTCHA answer after the video has ended, users may not like to wait for 5\u02dc10 seconds, so they may choose to skip the video by scanning other webs. Thus, the purpose of advertising will not be achieved effectively. Moreover, many user equipments cannot show videos of certain formats, e.g. flash video, simply because they lack a compatible decoder. Users of such user equipments would not be able to solve the CAPTCHA, since they could not even see the video.","Another kind of CAPTCHA advertising is based on image. In this solution, the CAPTCHA text is some words comprised in an Ad picture. These solutions usually either do not force the user to type in advertisement words or contains only advertisement without randomly generated and distorted characters. The former may make users have the chance to ignore advertisement, and the latter may be easier hacked by some Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image recognition technologies.","Therefore, a CAPTCHA method and system with improved advertising effect and security is needed.","To this end, one object of the invention is thus to provide an improved CAPTCHA method and system which may achieve better advertising effect and security.","The object is according to a first aspect of the invention achieved by providing a CAPTCHA method executed by a CAPTCHA system which comprises the steps of: receiving a CAPTCHA request comprising category information of an application service from an application server; responding to the application server with a token identifying the CAPTCHA request and a CAPTCHA image comprising a distorted advertisement word associated to the category information and a series of randomly generated and distorted characters, both the advertisement word and the characters being a CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by a user via a user equipment connected to the application server; receiving from the application server the token and a CAPTCHA answer submitted by the user; and verifying the token and the answer and returning to the application server a result of the verification.","The category information may comprise an industrial group attribute of an advertisement word provided by an advertiser or the industrial group attribute of the application service provided by an Application publisher.","The CAPTCHA image may be generated based on the industrial group attribute.","The advertisement word may be associated with the application service via the same industrial group attribute.","The method may comprise the step of allowing the Application publisher to add or delete a license for using CAPTCHA for each application service and the corresponding category information of the application service; and allowing the advertiser to add or delete the advertisement word and the corresponding category information of the advertisement word.","The CAPTCHA answer and the token may be stored in a cache, and fetched only once and removed from the cache instantly.","The token and the CAPTCHA image may be transmitted to the application server or further to the user equipment over an air interface or a physical interface.","The method may comprise the step of charging for the advertisement with different charging policies comprising bid for ranking.","The object is according to a second aspect of the invention achieved through a method for generating a CAPTCHA image by a CAPTCHA system, which comprises the steps of: obtaining an advertisement word from an advertisement database based on category information contained in a CAPTCHA request; generating a first CAPTCHA image with a series of randomly generated and distorted characters; and generating a resultant CAPTCHA image by comprising a distorted advertisement word and the first CAPTCHA image, both the advertisement word and the characters being a CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by a user via a user equipment connected to an application server.","The object is according to a third aspect of the invention further achieved through a CAPTCHA system, which comprises a database configured to provide information comprising an advertisement word; and a CAPTCHA processing unit configured to receive a CAPTCHA request comprising category information of an application service from an application server; respond to the application server with a token identifying the CAPTCHA request and a CAPTCHA image comprising a distorted advertisement word associated to the category information and a series of randomly generated and distorted characters, both the advertisement word and the characters being a CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by a user via a user equipment connected to the application server; receive from the application server the token and a CAPTCHA answer submitted from the user equipment by the user; and verify the token and the answer and return to the application server a result of the verification.","The category information may comprise an industrial group attribute of an advertisement word provided by an advertiser or the industrial group attribute of the application service provided by an Application publisher.","The CAPTCHA processing unit may be configured to generate the CAPTCHA image based on the industrial group attribute.","The advertisement word may be associated with the application service via a same industrial group attribute.","The CAPTCHA answer and the token may be stored in a cache of the CAPTCHA system, and fetched only once and removed from the cache instantly after being fetched.","The CAPTCHA processing unit may be configured to allow the Application publisher to add or delete a license for using CAPTCHA for each application service and the corresponding category information of the application service; and to allow the advertiser to add or delete the advertisement word and the corresponding category information of the advertisement word.","The CAPTCHA processing unit may be configured to charge for the advertisement with different charging policies comprising bid for ranking.","The token and the CAPTCHA image may be transmitted to the application server or further to the user equipment over an air interface or a physical interface.","The object is according to a fourth aspect of the invention further achieved through a computer program product, which comprises a computer readable medium with computer executable instructions, which when executed by a CAPTCHA system causes the CAPTCHA system to perform the method of the invention described above.","The advantageous effects the invention lie in that, an efficient advertisement effects may be achieved with good security by comprising Ad Words and original CAPTCHA characters, thus it is enabled that users are required to type Ad words with a series of original randomly generated and distorted CAPTCHA characters. With an increasing number of CAPTCHA users, both publishers and advertisers may have greater commercial interests from the invention. Simultaneously, application services may be provided securely and smoothly without interruption or delay caused by some malicious programs that obstructs the use of the service for user for which the application services are intended.","Embodiments of the invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanied drawings. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments and specific details set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description.","A CAPTCHA system as described in the following requires that a user type in letters and\/or digits corresponding to letters and\/or digits displayed in a distorted image that appears before him on a screen and can be used for example in a web application. For safety, the user must input right characters to get a service provided by the web application. Simultaneously, the user gets a deeper impression on what he has written or typed. Thus CAPTCHA text comprising a series of randomly generated and distorted characters and a distorted advertisement word is provided.","The advertisement word comprises at least one word which is associated with a service, a product, a company, or any other objects for advertisement or business purpose. The advertisement word could therefore be, but is not limited thereto, at least a part of a company name (such as \u201cEricsson\u201d), a trademark associated with a product (such as \u201cXperia PLAY\u201d), a trademark associated with a technology (such as \u201cLTE\u201d), or a slogan associated with a company (such as \u201cTaking you forward\u201d).","Both the randomly generated characters and the advertisement word may be distorted by any image distortion algorithm known to the skilled person, such as KCAPTCHA and is in this embodiment executed by the CAPTCHA system.","Since the distorted advertisement words act as a part of CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by users, it will be remembered by users more easily. Simultaneously, the randomly generated and distorted characters are used together with the distorted advertisement word to provide better security.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},"In step , a CAPTCHA system receives a CAPTCHA request from for example an application server (AS).","Category information of an application service provided by the application server is contained in the request. The Category information refers to the information indicating classification of the application service provided by the application server, and the Category information may be defined by an application publisher. The Category information contains industrial group attributes. The Industrial group attributes may be used for determining which industrial group different advertisement words or different application services belong to. In a broad sense, the industrial group may refer to, for example, \u201celectronics industry\u201d, \u201cagricultural industry\u201d, \u201cautomotive industry\u201d, \u201ctravel agent services industry\u201d, \u201cbookstore industry\u201d, \u201cmusic industry\u201d, \u201cfood industry\u201d, \u201cfashion industry\u201d and \u201cairline industry\u201d. It may further refer to a group subdivided in above industrial groups according to various criterions as needed, for example, company names such as \u201cEricsson\u201d, \u201cHUAWEI\u201d, \u201cZTE\u201d can belong to an industrial sub group classified under \u201celectronics industry\u201d called for example \u201ccommunication equipment manufacturers\u201d or for example subgroups \u201cmobile phones\u201d, \u201claptop\u201d, under \u201celectronics industry\u201d or \u201ccommunication equipment manufacturers.","The CAPTCHA system may be embodied as a single or multiple networking physical devices, such as computer(s), server(s), or other computing devices connected to e.g. the Internet or an intranet that may implement the CAPTCHA and advertising functions of the invention.","In step , upon the request, the CAPTCHA system responds to the AS with a token and a CAPTCHA image.","The CAPTCHA image is generated by comprising a distorted advertisement word associated to the category information and a series of randomly generated and distorted characters. Both the CAPTCHA characters and the advertisement word are the CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by users via a user equipment connected to the application server. The user equipment serves as user client  shown in  and may comprise a mobile telephone, a laptop, a desktop and a tablet\/slate\/pad, etc.","The token is a unique identifier generated by the CAPTCHA system to identify a whole interaction session including a series of requests and responses as shown in  established between the CAPTCHA system, Application Server, and user client. For example, the token is a 32-bit string generated by some algorithms, such as MD5, random algorithm, based on the current time in microseconds. For example, the token can be generated as a string of \u201c22b82cbe6b7876be213162554f74cb07\u201d. The token comprises an advertisement ID number searched from a database (e.g., Ad database) based on the category information in the request. The advertisement ID number is used for searching the advertisement word from the database.","The token and the CAPTCHA image may be transmitted to the AS and further to the user equipment over an air interface or a physical interface depending on the different network environment.","In an embodiment of the invention, the CPATCHA system may provide Ads more efficiently by classifying both Application publishers and advertisers into different groups according to category information, such as industrial group attributes. In other words, the CAPTCHA image may be generated based on the industrial group attributes. With different industrial group attributes, the CAPTCHA images with different advertisements corresponding to the different industrial group will be provided to the user.","In the context, Application publishers or Publishers may be developers and application server owners\/application service providers\/website owners who want to use CAPTCHA in their applications or websites. Advertisers may comprise companies, institutions which want to promote their advertisement word using CAPTCHA.","The application service and the corresponding advertisement may be associated by the same industrial group attribute. When an Application publisher requests the CAPTCHA from the CAPTCHA system, the corresponding Ad in conformity with the industrial group the provided application service belongs to will be provided.","For example, an application service provides online selling of mobile phones, and it is registered with \u201cmobile phone\u201d industrial group in the CAPTCHA system. The Ad words of \u201cSamsung Galaxy\u201d, \u201cHTC Desire\u201d and \u201cXPERIA ARC\u201d have also been registered with \u201cmobile phone\u201d industrial group. When the application server posts a CAPTCHA request, the result CAPTCHA image comprising a series of randomly generated and distorted characters and the corresponding distorted Ad words above will be provided by the CAPTCHA system.","The CAPTCHA system may allow the publishers to set different industrial group attributes for their application services, and may allow the advertisers to register their advertisement words and set their industrial group attributes. For example, a manufacturer of electronic user equipment like mobile phones and laptops may register one or more Ad words and assign each one of them to more than one industrial group attributes, like \u201cmobile phones\u201d and \u201claptops\u201d.","In step , the CAPTCHA system receives the token and a CAPTCHA answer submitted from the user equipment by the user via the AS.","In step , the CAPTCHA system verifies the CAPTCHA answer as well as the token and returning a result of the verification to the AS.","The result of the verification may be a plain string which indicates if the CAPTCHA answer from the user is correct or not. If the result is True, i.e., the CAPTCHA was successfully verified, the user will be allowed to access some service or information provided by the AS. If the result is False, i.e., the CAPTCHA was not successfully verified, the user may not be allowed to access the service or information provided by the AS. Alternatively, the user may be allowed to have a fixed number of attempts, e.g. five, to input a new CAPTCHA answer to a new CAPTCHA image sent from the CAPTCHA system. If an answer from the user has been wrong five times in a row, the service or information will be denied to be accessed by the user for a predetermined time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As an example, a Client browser running on a user equipment (serving as user client ) requests the web page of a certain service. An application server (AS)  processes the request, and sends a CAPTCHA request to a CAPTCHA system  with advertisement functions. In the CAPTCHA system , a CAPTCHA processing unit  processes the CAPTCHA request and gets a corresponding Ad from an Ad DB . Then, the CAPTCHA system  gives back a CAPTCHA image comprising a series of randomly generated and distorted characters with a distorted Ad word, and a token which identifies this CAPTCHA request to the user equipment via the AS . After the client browser loads a web page with the CAPTCHA image, a user inputs CAPTCHA answer information via the user equipment and submits the answer with the token. The AS  sends the CAPTCHA answer with the token to the CAPTCHA system  for verification. When the CAPTCHA system  verifies the CAPTCHA answer and the token, it then responds with a result to the AS . The AS  checks the response. If it is true, i.e. the answer received from the client browser is right, generally the user will be allowed to access some service or information; otherwise, the AS  may for example ask the user to try again.","The AS  can be configured to allow a fixed number of attempts, e.g. five. If an answer from the client browser has been wrong five times in a row, the AS  may be configured to deny the service for the client browser for a predetermined time, e.g. ten minutes, by blocking application requests from the user equipment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Below, a CAPTCHA REST API to get a CAPTCHA image is shown for illustrating the message format and related parameters as an example.","When getting a CAPTCHA image, the REQUEST FORMAT is for example an HTTP GET message having a format as indicated by the message:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Response Parameters"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","Value","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["token","String","The token that identifies the challenge.

The CAPTCHA system gets an Id number of corresponding advertisement from the database, e.g., an advertisement database containing information for advertising, by this category information. And then the CAPTCHA system generates a token with advertisement Id number which may be encrypted by some encryption algorithm such as MD5. The work flow and the output of the token generation module are shown in .","Returning to , the CAPTCHA system may further comprise a CAPTCHA image generation module which provides a resultant CAPTCHA image of the invention to the users.","With reference to  showing the work flow and the output of the CAPTCHA image generation module, when a request for CAPTCHA from the application server is coming, the CAPTCHA system gets advertisement words from the Ad database  by Ad ID number in the token. The CAPTCHA system generates a traditional CAPTCHA image with randomly generated and distorted characters. Then, a resultant CAPTCHA image which comprises randomly generated and distorted characters and distorted Ad word will be generated, as shown in .","Substantially simultaneously, the CAPTCHA answer is constructed and stored in a Cache in the CAPTCHA system.","Then the resultant CAPTCHA image will be returned to the user via the AS.","As an example, the resultant CAPTCHA image may be generated according to the method  shown in . In the method, in step , the CAPTCHA system obtains an advertisement word from an advertisement database based on category information contained in a CAPTCHA request. In step , a first CAPTCHA image with a series of randomly generated and distorted characters is generated by the CAPTCHA system. Then, in step , a resultant CAPTCHA image, as shown in , is generated by comprising a distorted advertisement word and the first CAPTCHA image containing the series of randomly generated and distorted CAPTCHA characters. Both of the advertisement word and the CAPTCHA characters are CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by users via a user equipment connected to the application server. The number of distorted characters is in  five, but it may of course in other embodiments be more or fewer as long as it is at least one.","With reference to  again, the CAPTCHA system may further comprise a verify module. When the user submits his\/her answer of the resultant CAPTCHA image, together with the token, via the AS, the CAPTCHA system checks them with the answer stored in the Cache and provides a result.","In an embodiment, with reference to , when the CAPTCHA system receives an answer together with the token from the AS, it will verify the token to insure the uniqueness of the CAPTCHA request, and then verify the CAPTCHA answer by the true answer stored in the cache, i.e. make a comparison of the CAPTCHA answer with the true answer. Preferably, for the security reason of avoiding back-attack, the stored answer and the token may be fetched only once and removed from the cache instantly afterwards.","In an embodiment of the invention, returning to  again, the CAPTCHA system may further comprise an administration module. A prologue of the procedure for advertisers and publishers may be comprised. The administration module may allow the advertisers to upload their advertisements with category information, e.g., industrial group attribute, to the database, and allow the publishers to upload their services with their category information to the database. The administration module may manage advertisements with category information uploaded by advertisers and application services with category information uploaded by Application publishers.","The administration module may further allow the publishers to add or delete a license for using CAPTCHA for each application service and the corresponding category information for the application service; and the administration module may allow the advertisers to add or delete the advertisement (such as Ad words, Ad URL, Ad image) and the corresponding category information for the advertisement.","For example, if the advertiser wants to set the industrial group attributes of his Ad words to be for example \u201cEricsson labs\u201d, he may choose it from the industrial group list if the industrial group attribute, \u201cEricsson labs\u201d has existed in the CAPTCHA system; or, if the industrial group attribute \u201cEricsson labs\u201d doesn't exist, the advertiser may create it in the CAPTCHA system. A publisher may also set the industrial group attribute of his application service for example to be \u201cEricsson labs\u201d, for example, in case that the application service is provided by Ericsson labs. When the application service requests CAPTCHA, the Ad words with the same industrial group \u201cEricsson labs\u201d will be obtained by searching the Ad database.","In a further embodiment of the invention, returning to  again, the CAPTCHA system may comprise a charging module. Charging may occur when a CAPTCHA with advertising function is requested.","Several charging policies for advertising may be applied, such as Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Mille (CPM) (thousand views). Also the advertisers may bid for ranking. For example, given the same industrial group attribute Ads belongs to, the higher price is given, the better chance to be advertised.","As an example, a charging mode for advertising may comprise: when the resultant CAPTCHA image is generated, which advertisement is successfully displayed to the publisher (e.g., application service or server owner) shall be recorded by the charging module; and the corresponding cash will be deducted from the prepaid account of the advertiser, according to the charging policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["20","20","24","20","25","24","25"]},"The CAPTCHA processing unit  may further comprise a first receiving subunit  configured to receive a CAPTCHA request comprising category information of an application service from an application server; a responding subunit  configured to respond to the application server with a token identifying the CAPTCHA request and a CAPTCHA image comprising a series of randomly generated and distorted CAPTCHA characters and a distorted advertisement word associated to the category information, wherein both of the advertisement word and the CAPTCHA characters are intended to be typed by users via a user equipment connected to the application server; a second receiving subunit  configured to receive the token and a CAPTCHA answer submitted from the user equipment by the user; and a verify subunit  configured to verify the token and the answer and return to the application server a result of the verification.","The unit(s), subunit(s) or module(s) mentioned above in the embodiments may be any unit normally used for performing the involved tasks, e.g., a hardware, such as a processor with a memory, software, or the combination thereof.

For example, when executed by the processor , the program module  adapts the CAPTCHA system  to obtain an advertisement word from an advertisement database based on category information contained in a CAPTCHA request. The program module  adapts the CAPTCHA system  to generate a first CAPTCHA image with a series of randomly generated and distorted characters. The program module  adapts the CAPTCHA system  to generate a resultant CAPTCHA image by comprising the first CAPTCHA image and the distorted advertisement word which, together with the series of randomly generated and distorted characters, is a CAPTCHA text intended to be typed by users via a user equipment connected to the application server.","The processor  may not only be implemented as a single Central Processing Unit (CPU), but also two or more processing components inside the CAPTCHA system.
