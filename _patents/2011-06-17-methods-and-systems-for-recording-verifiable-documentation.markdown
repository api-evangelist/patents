No. 13\/163,608 entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Electronic Medical Protocol\u201d, filed on even date herewith; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13,163,161 entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Electronic Medical Source\u201d, filed on even date herewith; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/163,591 entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Assuring Compliance\u201d, filed on even date herewith, the disclosures of which are all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present disclosure relates to collecting, verifying, and processing information. In particular, it relates to methods and systems for recording verifiable documentation.","Clinical trials are some of the most expensive and difficult projects to perform. The average cost of pharmaceutical drug development is estimated to be between $80 million and $800 million depending on complexity and therapeutic area. Despite all of the advances in clinical trial technology, most clinical trial protocols are designed by committees and groups of highly paid people and take months to design. Once the protocol is approved by an appropriate regulatory body, it must be run at study centers all over the world. Each doctor and clinical research coordinator must then interpret the protocol to determine exactly what is required of them and their patients. They must then identify patients who might be appropriate for the study, obtain their consent, and then collect data on those patients over a period of months or years. The difficulty in performing such tasks and the inherent variability in these tasks being performed by hundreds or thousands of people in dozens of countries can lead to poor quality data, fraud, delays, and higher costs.","From a perspective of patients who have volunteered and\/or were selected to be part of the study, the whole study process can be intimidating and confusing. It is not uncommon for the patients to be required to read and sign a 25 page legal document, thereby agreeing to certain terms and conditions of the study without actually understanding what they are signing. Once the patients are signed up for the study, they may be required to consume a pill at certain intervals and\/or may be required to perform certain tasks at home such as answering questions and\/or measuring their own body temperature, to name a few. If the patients fail to follow their instructions, the results from the study become inaccurate.","From a research coordinator's perspective, many hours are spent seeing the patients, asking the patients appropriate questions, performing certain procedures (e.g., drawing blood), dispending pills, instructing the patients. Such activities are then generally followed by processing paperwork. Results obtained from such tasks have to be logged and ultimately entered into a database system for further analysis. Each of these processes can be extremely time consuming.","On the other hand, a clinical research monitor oversees the research study project and can typically find that the research coordinators, doctors, patients, and nurses have not fully complied with the guidance specified in the protocol. Sometimes, lack of full compliance is intentional whereas other times it is unintentional. Non-compliance can result from data entry error, forgery, or lack of understanding, all of which can result in non-usable information for the research study, thereby costing more money to complete the study.","A sponsor spends a lot of money to perform such research studies and is always looking for ways to reduce their costs. One method of lowering such costs is to minimize redundancy and errors (or non-compliance) so that the studies can be performed in a shorter amount of time and without having to redo studies.","According to a first aspect, a method of executing agreements is described, the method comprising: providing an electronic device with a display, wherein the electronic device is loaded with a software application and\/or remotely accessing the software application;

BLUETOOTH\u00ae and Wi-Fi connections may differ in at least the range of connectivity. BLUETOOTH\u00ae connections typically have a range of less than 100 m while Wi-Fi can work as long as connection is available. In addition, BLUETOOTH\u00ae connections are generally only used for device connections and not typically used for Internet access.","Other possible methods of connectivity or network connection between two components or between a component and a server of the system of the present disclosure may include the THUNDERBOLT\u00ae, which is a wired connection that combines data, video, audio, and power.","Other wired or direct connection methods include use of USB 3.0 and USB 2.0. Other wireless methods include use of VoWi-Fi, which is a technology that combines Wi-Fi and VoIP (Voice-over IP) technology; 4G cellular network; and 3G cellular network.","The above paragraphs describe combination of components and functionalities involved in performance of medical or clinical visits and other interactions in connection with the present methods.","People are often faced with reading an agreement (e.g., contracts, terms of service, consent form, medical agreement, clinical agreement, financial agreement, business agreement, government agreement, waiver, disclosure, etc.) and signing such agreement stating their understanding to the terms when executing an agreement or a transaction. However, it is a common problem that such people do not necessarily read their agreement and simply just sign their name where they are asked to sign. Even in cases where they in fact do read the agreement, it can be difficult to determine if they really comprehend what they have read.","By way of example and not of limitation, in certain medical settings (e.g., human clinical trials), the version of the contract (or consent form) can change from time to time due to changes in the clinical trial protocol associated with the human clinical trials. A subject in the clinical trials who has already signed a consent form may be required to sign a new informed consent document during the same study. It can become increasingly difficult for research staff to ensure that a proper version of the document is being used.","The embodiments of the present disclosure describe methods of ensuring a transaction agreement between two or more parties is properly understood and acknowledged. Furthermore, the methods described can provide proof that such parties actually comprehend the agreement.","The term \u201cagreement\u201d is defined herein to refer to, but is not limited to, disclosures, contracts, terms of service, consent forms, or waivers between two or more parties. Such terms are also used interchangeably herein in the present disclosure. The term \u201cagreement provider\u201d is defined herein to refer to the party that creates, selects, or provides the agreement while the term \u201cagreement signer\u201d is defined herein to refer to the party that agrees to the agreement. For example, the agreement provider can be a clinical trials doctor who can select an informed consent document (agreement) from a list of possible informed consent documents and the agreement signer can be a clinical trial subject who will provide his or her consent to participate in the clinical trial by signing the informed consent document.","In an embodiment of the present disclosure, an agreement provider can use an electronic device (e.g., computer, portable computer, tablet computer, smartphone, game console, e-book reader, holographic device, television screen, video screen) that can be configured to display the contract, observe the agreement signer viewing the contract, ensure the agreement signer comprehends the agreement, and electronically record and document the process in which the agreement signer (e.g., a clinical trials subject) goes through when agreeing to the agreement on the electronic device. The combination electronic device and contract is referred to herein as an \u201celectronic consent and contract unit\u201d and can also be referred to interchangeably herein in the present disclosure as an \u201ceConsent\/eContract unit\u201d. With reference to the eConsent\/eContract unit in the present disclosure, the terms \u201cagreement signer\u201d can be used interchangeably with the term \u201csubject\u201d to describe specific exemplary implementations of the electronic consent and contract unit.","More in particular, the electronic device can be configured, by way of example and not of limitation, to display a written agreement or playback an audio, video, or holographic recording of the agreement (or summary of the agreement) on a display such that the agreement signer can read or playback the agreement at his or her own pace. For example, if the agreement comprises a plurality of pages of written documents, the signer can choose to scroll forward or backwards as desired. If the agreement comprises an audio, video, or holographic recording, the signer can choose to replay the playback and\/or stop the playback as desired.","In an embodiment of the present disclosure as shown in , the agreement provider can select a desired agreement () from a list of available agreements. The agreement provider can then load the desired agreement\/module (including but not limited to the text of the agreement; multiple language translations of the text of the agreement; videos, audio recordings, games, questions, answers, and other associated data concerning the contract) onto the electronic device or use the electronic device to access the same content on a remote system.","Upon selection of the desired contract (), the electronic device can be configured to determine if the contract and module are the most up-to-date version () by communicating with, for example, a master library (e.g., eLibrary Database Server ()), as described in further detail in later paragraphs. The electronic device will compare the locally residing version of the contract and module against the eLibrary Database Server (). If the locally residing version is the most up-to-date version, then that version of the contract and module can be loaded on the electronic device (). If there is a more recent version of the contract on the eLibrary Database Server (), then that more recent version of the contract can be downloaded to the electronic device () via wired or wireless methods including, but not limited to, Wi-Fi, BLUETOOTH\u00ae, WiMax, Satellite, MIT-2000, and millimeter wave. Once downloaded to the electronic device, the more recent version of the contract can be loaded on the electronic device ().","Agreement \u201celements\u201d can include the text of the agreement; multiple language translations of the text of the agreements; associated videos, audio recordings, games, questions, answers, and other associated data concerning the contract. The multiple elements can be combined to make up an agreement \u201cmodule\u201d. As shown in , such elements and modules can be stored in the eLibrary unit (), similar to that described in the following paragraphs for an electronic protocol unit (). The modules comprised of several elements form the complete contents of the agreement, which can ultimately be loaded on the electronic device and executed with the eConsent\/eContract unit (). The modules can also have associated meta-data to indicate version numbers (also referred to herein as Version Control ()) of the agreement that can be used, for example, to ensure the most recent version of the elements and\/or modules are being used.","By way of example and not of limitation, the user can be a clinical trial doctor who can use the eConsent\/eContract unit () to select an appropriate Informed Consent Document (ICD) for a volunteer subject desiring to participate in a clinical trial. Since a clinical trial can last from a few months to several years, and the Informed Consent Document can be frequently amended and\/or revised numerous times during the period of the clinical trial, the clinical trial doctor has the responsibility to ensure that the correct and most up-to-date agreement of the consent form has been signed by the clinical trial subject. The Version Control meta-data () stored in the eLibrary () and associated with the Informed Consent Document can ensure that the clinical trial doctor is using the most current and approved version of the agreement document. Once the appropriate Informed Consent Document is selected, the agreement document and associated information can be either transmitted from the eLibrary () to the eProtocol unit () and then to the eConsent\/eContract unit () or can be transmitted directly from the eLibrary () to the eConsent\/eContract unit () in order to perform the Informed Consent Process and then have the Informed Consent Document signed by both the clinical trial doctor and the subject.","Referring back to , the agreement signer will then record and authenticate his or her identifying information () including but not limited to name, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, other government identification documents, address, date of birth, video\/audio\/still images, and biometric authentication (e.g., face recognition, fingerprints, retina scan, voiceprint, iris scan, typing biometrics, hand and finger geometry, signature verification, ear geometry, olfactory biometrics, and behavioral biometrics). Identity cards (including but not limited to driver's license, passport, or other government identification documents) can also be recorded, swiped, or scanned to confirm or further confirm identity of the agreement signer.","As the signer is viewing the agreement as shown in , a video recording device such as a video camera or a webcam () can be configured to visually record (, ) the signer viewing the agreement. Moreover, the video recording device () can be integrated to communicate with the electronic device and further arranged to track face, eye, and gaze movement () of the signer. The camera () can be integrated into the electronic device and\/or can be separate from the electronic device and controlled by the electronic device. For example, the camera () can determine if the signer's face remains in view of the camera () and can automatically move to track the face of the signer to ensure that the face remains within the view of the camera ().","By way of example and not of limitation, if the agreement is a written agreement, the electronic device (with a camera ()) can determine if the signer has actually read the text on the page by following the movement of the signer's eye such that the eye movement corresponds with the wording, sentences (), images, and\/or video that are being read by the signer on the display.","As a consequence of eye and gaze tracking, the signer can be prevented from proceeding to the next page\/section of the contract if the eye and gaze tracking algorithm on the eConsent\/eContract unit () suspects that the signer did not actually read all of the text on a written agreement or did not watch an entire video. A message can be displayed, thereby prompting the signer to read the entire written agreement. Alternatively, the electronic device can also be configured to prevent the signer from advancing to the next page until the eye and gaze tracking confirms that the agreement signer has read the entire section.","In the case of a video or holographic agreement, the camera () can observe the eye movement to ensure the signer is at least watching the display that is showing the video agreement. The time, date, and location (e.g., GPS location) of the video recording of the signer can be captured and attached as meta-data to the recording itself.","Once the recording begins, a summary of the contract can be presented () in text, audio, video, slideshow, hologram, or game format. Following the summary presentation of the agreement, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to present a single page or section (video, presentation slide, audio, hologram, or game) of the contract to the signer. The device can be further configured to enable the signer to increase or decrease the size of the page or section (e.g., zoom in, zoom out), select the signer's desired language for the page or section to be displayed, and\/or have the text read aloud as audio. The page or section of the contract can be adapted to be viewed from beginning to end and can be scrolled back and forth as many times as the signer desires.","The sConsent\/eContract unit () can be further configured such that the signer can highlight ( in ) sections of the text of the presentation and take notes on the electronic device regarding, for example, any questions ( in ) that he or she may have about the contract. Such notes can be written directly on the electronic device (e.g., using a stylus), spoken verbally and recorded by audio, video, or holographic recording, and\/or can be annotated directly within the text or sections of the contract in question.","According to another example of the present disclosure, as the signer begins to read the agreement, a camera () embedded in the eConsent\/eContract unit () (or an external camera controlled by the electronic device) tracks the signer's eye movement () to determine whether or not the subject is actually reading the text of the agreement. If the signer is suspected of not reading the text, then the signer can be prompted to read the text again. If the eye movement shows that the signer is reading the text, then the subject will be allowed to advance to the next page when ready. Once the signer advances to the next page, the camera () again tracks the signer's eye movement and determines whether or not the signer is reading the text.","According to another embodiment, when the signer finishes reading the text, the electronic device can be configured to ask a series of interactive questions () to test the signer's knowledge of the agreement. Such questions can be displayed on the eConsent\/eContract unit () as text, presented as a video, presentation slide, audio, hologram, or game. The answers to such questions can be obtained by typing, clicking buttons, or speaking the answers (using voice recognition speech to text conversion to interpret the answer).","If the subject answers the interactive questions incorrectly, the electronic device can be configured to re-display specific sections of the text of the contract where the answers are located. Pertinent sections of the text can also be highlighted (). The signer is then asked the same question(s) again (). Guiding the subject to the location of the correct answer within the contract can help the signer understand and\/or comprehend the contents of the agreement.","If the signer answers the questions correctly, the electronic device can be configured to present the signer with the next sequential page of the text or section of the contract (). The question and answer sequence (, , ) can be repeated until the end of the contract is reached. Once the end of the contract is reached, the signer can be presented with a summary of the questions and correct answers () to further enforce his or her understanding of the contract.","According to another embodiment, in the case where the signer indicated he or she had questions concerning specific sections of the text or the contract, the electronic device can be configured to address those questions for the signer. For example, the electronic device can be configured to present a list of sections the text or the contract that were annotated by the signer with notes () while reading, viewing, or listening to the contract. The signer can then be provided with an opportunity to have each question answered and addressed by the contract provider (). Such conversation between the subject and the contract provider can be recorded on video using a camera () embedded within or connected to the electronic device.","According to yet another embodiment, the electronic device can be configured to allow both the contract provider and the signer to electronically sign and authenticate their agreement to the contract (). The electronic signature can be, for example, a digital signature directly on the electronic device using a stylus pen. The electronic signature can also be provided by use of a biometric identification process. The signed contract can be printed () on a printer, sent electronically () by email or other electronic messaging system, and\/or stored () for later retrieval (). Such signature can be considered a valid, legally binding, enforceable, and authenticated signature to the agreement.","According to yet another embodiment, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to allow both the agreement provider and the signer to record verbal acknowledgement to a written agreement. For example, the agreement signer can proceed through all of the steps described above; however, instead of a digital or biometric signature, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to record (using audio, video, and\/or holography) the agreement signer and\/or the agreement provider providing their verbal agreement to the terms and conditions of the agreement.","In another embodiment, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to record a verbal agreement between the agreement provider and the signer by recording an electronic or digital signature to that agreement. For example, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to record (using audio, video, and\/or holography) the agreement provider describing the terms and conditions of the agreement, and then allow both the agreement provider and the agreement signer to electronically sign and authenticate their agreement to the contract.","In another embodiment, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to record a verbal agreement between the agreement provider and the signer and to record verbal acknowledgement by both parties to the verbal agreement. For example, the eConsent\/eContract unit () can be configured to record (using audio, video, and\/or holography) the agreement provider describing the terms and conditions of the agreement, and then record the agreement signer and\/or the agreement provider giving their verbal agreement to the terms and conditions of the agreement.","When the signed contract is stored (), the following information and data can be stored together as well: an initial authentication of the signer (e.g., photographs of the signer, biometric identification); an audio, video, and\/or holographic recording showing the signer reading\/viewing the contract, time\/date\/location stamp ( in ) of the amount of time the signer spent going through the entire contract as well as the amount of time the signer spent on each individual text or video sections of the contract; the eye and gaze tracking results documenting the signer's eye movement corresponding to the text or video on a per-page or per-section basis; the list of interactive questions asked and the answers given by the signer; the number of tries it took for the signer to correctly answer each question; and the highlighted text and annotated notes as well as the audio, video, and\/or holographic recording of the contract provider answering such questions and concerns.","The contract and all of the described additional data can be stored on the electronic device and\/or on local and\/or remote databases via, for example, mass storage device, media storage, random access memory, read only memory, magnetic recording, magnetic storage, solid state drive, floppy disc, optical disc drive, internet, hard drive, server, recordable media, memory cards, CD, DVD, tape, tape library, RAID system, magnetic tape drive, magneto-optical disc drive, drum memory, punched tape, holographic memory, removable media, and non-removable media. Such stored data can thereby provide at least some proof and\/or evidence that the signer has read, watched, and\/or listened to the agreement and has a higher likelihood of understanding what he or she has contractually agreed to. The signed contract and all of the additional data can be retrieved by any authorized party (e.g., agreement provider, agreement signer) at any time and downloaded from an electronic device. Similar to the methods used to store such additional data, the authorized party can retrieve such additional data, for example, by way of the Internet, recordable media, and\/or wireless or wired connection.","Although specific example embodiments of the electronic consent and contract unit () were described, other embodiments of the electronic consent and contract unit () are possible. For example, the electronic consent and contract unit () can be a contract between a medical practitioner or a medical institution and a patient for any medical procedure, medical treatment, blood transfusion, laboratory test, surgery, or pharmaceutical treatment. A medical practitioner can include, but is not be limited to, physicians, surgeons, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, chiropractors, or acupuncturists. A medical institution can include, but is not be limited to, a hospital, surgery center, or academic medical center. The contract can further be between a clinical trial investigator and a research subject or between a financial institution and a customer, by way of example and not of limitation, for signing mortgage documents or credit card agreements. A financial institution can include, but is not be limited to, a bank, credit card company, mortgage lender, and credit union. The contract can also be between a business and a customer for signing waivers, between a governmental body and a citizen, such as when an individual is signing a will or trust, and between any two parties when signing any contract or agreement.","Currently, clinical trials such as those performed for drug approval at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can be very specialized as well as difficult and expensive to run. The requirements for protecting human subjects rights and complying with regulatory concerns while validating accuracy and integrity of results (and the process of obtaining these results) obtained from these studies constitute a high burden on all parties involved (including but not limited to the FDA, the sponsor of the clinical trial, the contract research organization who manages the clinical trial, the physician investigator and his or her staff, and the patients and volunteers who participate in the clinical trial).","One embodiment of the present disclosure describes an exemplary integrated system for protocol design that specifically targets the designing, performing, and managing of clinical trials. The integrated system can be utilized to create an electronic protocol that encompasses clinical trial aspects from the beginning of trial planning to the submission of the data and final analysis reports and from the top view of data summary to the detail view of each subject's specific intake of test material, including monitoring and verification, throughout a single clinical trial study and across multiple clinical studies. The electronic protocol can then be used to drive a clinical trial through its entire lifetime.","The integrated system for protocol design described in the present disclosure can be applicable to other programs with strict protocol requirements besides clinical trials. For example, disease management and wellness management generally require protocols, pathways, and guidelines to guide their implementation, high accuracy and integrity of results as well as protection of a subject's privacy and other rights. Many other industries besides the medical field also have programs that may be applicable to the integrated system for protocol design described in the present disclosure. For example, drug manufacturing and high tech manufacturing require high accuracy and integrity of results as well as protection of records and compliance to regulatory rules.","With reference to , creating a protocol for a clinical study may comprise selecting relevant protocol modules (), protocol elements () and protocols () from an electronic library (). The protocols () from the electronic library () may be complete or incomplete protocols and may be from past studies or current studies within the system or from a third-party. The creating of a protocol my comprise selecting a protocol from the electronic library ().","The creating of a protocol may also comprise selecting the relevant protocol elements () for each protocol module () and combining the protocol modules (), protocol elements () and protocol () to design the experimental plan via a electronic protocol unit (). The electronic protocol unit, or eProtocol (), may comprise software, firmware, middleware and hardware system involved in creating a protocol for executing any programs and instructions involved in the performance of the clinical trial study, as well as information such as number of sites, subjects per site, duration of study, subject clinic visit schedule, subject exclusions, data to be collected, and others as shown in .","Each protocol element () of  represents a specific procedure, method, or question that has been shown to be effective in collecting a key piece of information for the clinical study. Protocol elements () are selected and assembled to form a protocol module (), which is a group or a classification of activities required for the clinical study. A protocol is designed by selecting and assembling a plurality of relevant modules. The assembly process may involve a resolution of conflicts between the elements to form modules and between the modules to form the electronic protocol unit ().","For example, in the design of the electronic protocol unit for cardiovascular studies as shown in , a measurement of vital signs can be required at every clinical visit by the subjects as indicated in a vital signs module. Other modules required by the cardiovascular protocol may include the lab test module, the data\/statistics module, the study population module, the study design module, the inclusion criteria module, the exclusion criteria module, the endpoints module, and the objectives module.","The vital signs module selected may be as shown in more detail in . The vital signs module may comprise various elements such as a blood pressure element, heart rate element, body temperature element, pulse element, and respiratory rate element as shown in . Within each element, various additional information regarding the execution of the elements can be present. For example, as shown in , the blood pressure element may contain information regarding the location, best practice, timing, position, data collection units and ranges, and the level of evidence for the suggested information in the element.","Also, if an investigator is unsure if, for example, the recommended respiratory rate measurement method in the element is applicable to the clinical study, the investigator may elect to review the level of evidence as shown in  for a recommendation and compare the context of source of the recommendation or input, which may be the journal article or past study documents. The investigator may select an alternate respiratory rate element based on the review of the level of evidence.","Also, if an investigator is unsure if, for example, the recommended respiratory rate measurement method in the element is applicable to the clinical study, the investigator may elect to review the level of evidence as shown in  for a recommendation and compare the context of source of the recommendation or input, which may be the journal article or past study documents. The investigator may select an alternate respiratory rate element based on the review of the level of evidence.","Similarly, for the design of a diabetes study, selection of the vital signs module containing the blood pressure element, heart rate element, body temperature element, and respiratory rate element can be linked to a specific journal article showing these vital signs to be representative of the general impact of the disease on overall health level of the subject.","Selection of relevant protocol, modules and elements can be accomplished according to different methods. For example, a hierarchical library can be presented with the categories of protocols, modules, and elements offered. A search function can also be included. Choices of protocols, modules, and elements can be offered or removed based on protocols, modules, and elements already selected for the clinical study.","A wizard that presents questions to be answered may be offered to guide the selection of protocols, modules, and elements. The guidance from the wizard can be adjusted based on additional criteria input from the user such as cost, options, and time. For example, to see a wider selection of modules, the module selection can be offered in an order from the least restricting choices to the most restricting choices.","In addition, the system may highlight conflicts created by the combination of the selected protocol, modules, and elements and prompt a resolution of the conflicts. The wizard may suggest additional modules or elements based on the protocol, modules or elements already selected.","The question and answer interaction with the wizard may be delivered on an electronic device (e.g., computer, portable computer, tablet computer, smart phone, game console, e-book reader, holographic device, television screen, video screen) sent by mail or email or asked over the phone by a system that converts the questions to speech and then records and interprets the answers (converts speech to text).","The wizard may have capabilities to accept inputs from multiple users and\/or multiple sessions. For example, a team of doctors and a sponsor's team members may form a protocol design team such that each member of the team may give input as to some or all aspects of the clinical study. One doctor may be an expert in the target disease treatment, and thus can be of good authority to give guidance regarding primary and secondary symptoms to monitor. A member of the drug company sponsor may be a specialist in the dosing. Another member of the team may be a clinical trial specialist who may give input regarding subject selection criteria. Yet another member of the team may be a statistician who may give input on the number of subjects needed in the clinical trial.","The integrated system for protocol design may have a team management feature to manage and authenticate the inputs from various members of the team. An authentication feature may verify the identity of each member of the protocol design team when giving input and may record the date, time, and actual input for audit purposes. A team management feature may identify conflicting inputs from different members and present these conflicts to the members who introduced them for resolution. Alternatively or in addition, the conflicts may be presented to the team leader for resolution. The team management feature may identify missing input. The team management feature may also tag required input from specific members. For example, the sponsor may be tagged with the input for dosing of a drug.","The wizard may be capable of accepting input from an existing complete or incomplete protocol (paper or electronic) into a newly designed electronic protocol. For example, if a follow-on study is desired to match in number of subjects and frequency of dosing as a previous study, the wizard may accept the existing protocol, and, by matching aspects of the existing protocol to protocol elements () and protocol modules () in the electronic library () as shown in , the wizard can guide the user into creating the new electronic protocol that may match the previous study in specified areas. Additionally, if a protocol has already been developed by the sponsor of the clinical trial, the wizard can identify the requirements of the existing protocol and match them to the best-match modules and\/or elements within the eLibrary (). The wizard can then suggest additional modules or elements as necessary for the performance and analysis of the clinical trial.","In one embodiment, the electronic protocol designed by the integrated system may now contain specifications regarding a plurality of additional aspects of the clinical trial including but not limited to the aforementioned elements and modules.","The details, instructions, guidance, requirements, outcomes, and recommendations for performing all of these areas of the clinical trial in accordance with the requirements set forth in the electronic protocol guide the execution and management of the clinical trial by the creation of documentation, in electronic or paper format, utilized in various stages of execution of the clinical trial. As shown in , such documentation may contain sets of structured information configured for use by one or more units such as eSource, eCRF, eConsent, eCompliance, ePRO, eInventory, eStudy Product, eSponsor, eMonitor, eRegulatory, eFinance, eRecruitment, eData, eStatistics, eInvestigator, eLaboratory, eProcedure, ePatient, eDocument, eSafety, and eCTMS.","For example, the eSource can be an electronic data collection system that can be created by the electronic protocol to be used in a clinical trial visit to guide the collection of data.  shows as an example a cardiovascular eProtocol, where information from the vital signs module, the study design module, the inclusion criteria module, the exclusion criteria module, and the lab test module may be used to create an eSource data collection system.","As another example, the eConsent can be a consent form for the clinical trial, which can be presented, possibly in electronic format, to the subject during the first clinical trial visit for signature, then stored again, possibly in electronic format as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["110","110","460","420","420","440","420"]},"Each protocol element () of the electronic library () is based on a level of evidence that includes inputs from a large variety of sources. The weight and conflict resolution of the data from each of the input sources is constantly evolving and learning from outcomes of each use of the integrated system for protocol design.","Examples of input sources to the level of evidence for the elements (), modules (), and protocols () include but are not limited to medical publications, regulatory agency rules and advisories, past studies, past protocols, database websites for past studies, key opinion leaders (KOLs), investigators, doctors, patients, social media, and ongoing study feedback as shown in . The level of evidence for each protocol element (), such as an original document for the source or a summary of multiple documents with appropriate citations, can be readily accessible to aid in the selection of protocol elements () for the design of the electronic protocol.","In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the electronic library (eLibrary) () as shown in  is described, where the electronic library () comprises protocol modules stored in a database () of . These protocol modules may contain best-practice methods for the design, performance, or analysis of a clinical trial, including but not limited to modules of experimental designs, layout, questions, procedures, visit and\/or procedure timing, resources required, the order in which steps are to be performed, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, regulatory requirements, data requirements, and statistical analyses. Each protocol module may be based on one or more previous electronic protocol units () of , which have been executed successfully or based on data from one or more previous clinical studies or a combination thereof. The protocol modules can be accessed, for example, to be used to create or change an electronic protocol unit () during the design, performance, or evaluation of a clinical trial study.","The protocol modules ( in ), protocol elements () and protocols () in the eLibrary () may originate within the system, from the user, or from a third party. Third-party modules may be provided by a third party, who may be a specialist in the field. Protocol modules may be accessible and\/or purchased through an on-line store. The on-line store may have cataloging and searching functions so that the expertise of a specialist may be accessible to many users who would like to design a clinical study. The on-line store may also manage payment of compensation from the user to the system or from the user to a provider of the third party module through the system.","According to an embodiment, each module may be vertically integrated, in that it may contain proposed procedures for a study from the beginning of design to final report submission and may include procedures for source creation, data collection, statistical analysis, recruitment (e.g., provide criteria), compliance verification, consent verification, confirmation of attendance, verification, interim and final reporting format and frequency to various parties, and even billing milestones. For all of the procedure steps, editable and suggested electronic formats may be provided. In one, interactive applications, programs, and instructions may be provided for the procedures.","In an embodiment of the present disclosure, an electronic sponsor unit is described. The electronic sponsor unit may be utilized by a sponsor of the clinical trial study to view interim reports of the study. The electronic sponsor unit may also be used to track progress and milestones, view visitation information of subjects to the study sites, review data monitoring results, review raw and calculated data for the study, and review or revise the electronic protocol. The electronic sponsor unit may comprise specified security features that block identifying information from access by the sponsor.","Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for enhancing collection of data from medical or clinical research visits. During a clinical visit, such as in the context of a clinical trial, paper is still used as the primary means for the initial capture of data. This initial capture of data is also known as source data and the document on which this original data is captured is referred to as a source document. The method of data collection by paper is highly variable and generally involves transcription from paper into an electronic database in order to be used for data analysis. This method of data collection can lead to human errors, missing data, and invalid data as well as fraud since data may be intentionally falsified or modified to meet certain requirements of the study. Monitoring of medical or clinical data can be an expensive and time-consuming process and primarily involves checking the data in the paper records compared to the transcribed data.","The medical or clinical data can be data related to healthcare in general and, for example, clinical trials in particular. In addition, these considerations apply to many clinical interactions including but not limited to disease management and wellness management, many of which may rely upon a protocol, guideline, or pathway to determine the required steps, and which may benefit from the electronic medical source methods and systems of the present disclosure.","By way of example and not of limitation, one embodiment of the present disclosure shows a use of the electronic medical source methods and systems in a clinical trial setting. Other exemplary uses can include, but are not limited to, management of ambulatory care facilities such as medical offices, clinics and others, ambulatory surgery facilities, hemodialysis facilities, rehabilitation facilities, drug abuse treatment facilities, family planning centers, hospitals, home health agencies, hospices, clinical trials clinics, oncology clinics, pharmacies, adult day healthcare centers, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, residential health care facilities, disease management programs, and wellness management programs.","One skilled in the art will recognize that the subject of the clinical visit can be a patient and will also recognize that collection of data can be related to performance of a clinical trial study protocol (e.g., required activities in the protocol) within a specific timeframe. These study related activities include, but are not limited to, answering medical questions; performing a physical examination; dispensing and\/or taking an investigational study product; filling out a diary, scale, or questionnaire; eating a specific study related food or beverage; measuring a body function such as temperature or blood pressure; measuring an anthropomorphic measurement such as weight; performing a test such as an EKG or stress test; and collecting a specimen such as urine, saliva, stool, semen, or blood.","Benefits associated with the methods and systems of the present disclosure can be an increase in reliability and validity of the data collected during a clinical trial and a reduction in the time associated with the data acquisition and in the time required to verify the validity of the data. This can improve clinical study statistics and may decrease cost by decreasing the number of required subjects for a study and\/or the time required to complete the study.","The embodiments of the present disclosure describe the electronic medical source methods and systems that may be utilized to capture clinical data in a structured manner. The electronic medical source may be used to allow a first capture of data to be the only time that data is captured (e.g., no additional transcription or data entry is performed).

Any information from the electronic source unit () and the eStudy Product (, ) can be sent wirelessly to the electronic compliance unit ().","The electronic compliance application can be a software application running on the electronic device () itself, or it can be a software application running on a remote system that can be accessed by way of the internet (or other network connection) using the electronic device. Both cases will be referred to as the electronic compliance unit () in the present disclosure. Such electronic device () can be configured with an embedded camera on the electronic device or a camera that is located external to the electronic device () and connected (wired or wireless) to the electronic device ().","The electronic compliance unit () can be provided to a subject to take home for validating the subject's activities pertaining to the study or the program. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure as shown in , the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to provide the subject with reminders () for activities (e.g., taking medication at a certain time, perform fingerstick blood draw, measure body temperature, complete a scale or questionnaire) to help the subject from forgetting. By way of example, if the subject is required to consume a pill at a certain time, the electronic compliance unit () will remind the subject that it is time to consume a pill. When the subject responds to the reminder, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to authenticate that the subject, and not somebody else, is actually responding to the reminder. The electronic compliance unit () can identify the subject () by using a form of biometric identity authentication including but not limited to a camera and a facial recognition application to match the facial profile with an expected facial profile of the subject.","In an exemplary facial recognition application, the facial recognition application can access a localized database of facial recognition patterns rather than a centralized database. Specifically the electronic compliance unit () (or any of the other units described in this or the related patents) can identify the subject during an initial interaction with the unit. The information about the identity of the subject can be stored in a local database (in addition to a central database) so that when the subject accesses the unit again, the confirmation of identity can occur against the local database only. This can provide a much faster sequence of confirmation of identity as the electronic compliance unit () is not required to access a remote database and not required to search through thousands or millions of profiles in order to confirm the identity of the subject against the central database. By using the local database, there may only be one or a few identities on a single unit.","Alternatively, or in addition to the facial recognition, authentication can also occur by way of biometric authentication including but not limited to fingerprints, retina scan, voiceprint, iris scan, typing biometrics, hand and finger geometry, signature verification, ear geometry, olfactory biometrics, and behavioral biometrics.","As in the previous example where the subject is required to consume a pill, according to another embodiment as shown in , a bar code () label can be affixed to the pill container () to identify the type of pill contained therein. Alternatively or in addition to the bar code (), an RFID chip () can be imbedded into the pill container (). A bar code reader or an RFID scanner can be connected to the electronic compliance unit () such that the subject can scan the bar code () or RFID chip (), thereby ensuring the correct pill is being consumed. The date, time and location (e.g., by way of GPS coordinates) of that instance can also be recorded.","According to another embodiment, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to capture a video or a still recording of the pill and then identify the pill () by its size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or markings by way of size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or markings recognition algorithms. As a result, the specific pill that the subject is about to consume can be identified and recorded, thereby minimizing the chance that an incorrect pill is consumed. Furthermore, if an incorrect pill were to be consumed, such record of consuming the incorrect pill can be stored as proof in the electronic compliance unit ().","According to another embodiment, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured such that the subject can show the bottle (), barcode (), or pill to the camera and ask whether or not this is the correct pill (or bottle associated with the correct pill) to be consumed at that time. The electronic compliance unit () can also be configured to use the barcode (); RFID chip (); and\/or size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or marking recognition algorithms to confirm whether or not a bottle or pill is in fact the correct bottle or the correct pill.","Another embodiment is a compliance management component for the subject. The required schedule for compliance with the study protocol is programmed into the system and, at predetermined time points, an alert can be generated to inform the subject that it is time for him or her to perform a study related activity including, but not limited to, taking an investigational study product' filling out a diary, scale (e.g., survey question with a range of 1-10) or questionnaire; eating or drinking a specific study related food or beverage; measuring a body function (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, weight, blood sugar, etc.); and\/or collecting a specimen (e.g., urine, saliva, stool, semen, blood).","Such compliance management component can also include ability to increase or decrease the frequency of reminders according to compliance rates. The alert can take the form of an audible alert, a tactile alert (e.g., vibration), a visual alert, an olfactory alert, or a gustatory alert. Exemplary methods of delivering alerts can include, but is not limited to, phone calls, emails, text messages, or any other communication methods. Such alerts can vary in timing, intensity, frequency and duration according to the current level of compliance. For example, subjects who are less compliant can receive more intense, more frequent, and longer alerts. When such less compliant subjects improve their level of compliance, the intensity, frequency, and duration of these alerts can be decreased.","According to yet another embodiment, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured such that, once the subject's identity is authenticated, the electronic compliance unit () can video record (), via the camera, the subject performing various activity or activities such as, by way of example and not of limitation, consuming the study product, measuring a body function (e.g., body temperature, blood pressure, weight, blood sugar, etc), and\/or collecting a specimen (e.g., urine, saliva, stool, semen, and\/or blood).","As a result, an authenticated identification of the subject and a visual proof of the subject performing the activity (e.g., consuming the pill), with a date, time stamp, and location stamp (e.g., GPS coordinates) of the activity is recorded and stored in the electronic compliance unit () as evidence. The electronic compliance unit () can use computer vision algorithms to determine whether the recorded motion of the subject matches a general body movement of the expected activity being performed. For example, if the activity involves consuming a pill, a generally expected body movement can comprise the subject's a hand moving toward his or her mouth and inserting an object, followed by drinking of a beverage. Other examples of activities can be, consuming a powder, consuming a liquid, injecting a medication, drawing blood, measuring body functions, measuring body temperature, measuring blood pressure, measuring glucose, answering medical questions, performing a physical examination; dispensing an investigational study product, consuming an investigational study product, filling out a diary, scale, questionnaire, preparing food, consuming food, preparing a beverage, consuming a beverage, applying a cream, applying a gel, measuring weight, measuring height, measuring body size, performing an EKG, performing a stress test, collecting urine, collected saliva, collecting stool, collecting semen, and drawing blood.","In addition, any supplies that may be necessary for completion of the activity can be identified. The electronic compliance unit () can be configured to identify specimen containers by using barcode and\/or RFID scan, or by their size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or markings by way of size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or markings recognition algorithms. As a result, a specific specimen container that the subject is attempting to use can be identified and recorded, thereby minimizing the chance that an incorrect specimen collection container is used.","A person skilled in the art will recognize that some clinical trial protocols specify the consumption of specific foods or beverages. The foods and beverages can be the test product of the study or they can be a special diet (e.g., low carbohydrate diet) specified by the protocol.","According to another embodiment, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to capture a video or still recording of the food and then to identify the food by its size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or markings by way of size, shape, color, pattern, and\/or markings recognition algorithms.","Alternatively, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to scan the barcode (), RFID chip (), or other near-field communication devices to identify the food, food package, or menu. As a result, the specific food that the subject is about to consume can be identified and recorded. Specific algorithms can inform the subject of the caloric value, macronutrient content (e.g., fat, carbohydrate, and protein) and micronutrient content (e.g., vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the food that the subject about to consume. Algorithms can also inform the subject of whether the caloric, macronutrient and micronutrient values will be in compliance with the subject's diet or outside the parameters of the subject's diet for a given time period (e.g., day, week, month, etc.). Alerts can be triggered that can recommend additional or alternative foods to be eaten instead of the current food. Furthermore, such record of consuming the food can be stored as proof in the electronic compliance unit ().","According to another embodiment, a scale can be used to weigh the food before and after consumption. This scale can transmit a wireless or wired signal to the electronic compliance unit () and therefore import the weight of the remaining food. The actual food consumption can be calculated and the caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient contents can be calculated and compared to the allowable values in the protocol.","According to another embodiment, the electronic compliance unit () can record information pertaining to an entire meal being consumed. By way of example and not of limitation, the recording can comprise information pertaining to the rate at which the food is being consumed, the amount of food being consumed, and the number of times food is being consumed per day. Such information can be combined with the information obtained from the compliance assessments described in previous paragraphs and can provide additional analysis on food intake.","According to another embodiment as shown in , the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to keep track of the number of pills consumed () by the subject. Therefore, when the subject returns to the clinic for a follow up visit () and returns the bottle () to the clinic (), the number of pills that are actually remaining in the bottle () can be counted by manually counting () or using an automated counting () device to compare () and can be verified against the number of pills expected to be remaining in the bottle (, ), thus reconciling () the activities logged in the electronic compliance unit ().","According to another embodiment, adjustments to the subject's medical regimen can be made with the information about their level of compliance with the study requirements. This information can be transmitted from the electronic source unit () to the electronic compliance unit () and, after signature authentication by the clinic staff (), can be printed (), sent electronically () by email or other electronic messaging system, and\/or stored () for later retrieval ().","According to another embodiment, the electronic compliance unit () can be configured to present to the subject medical questions, scales, and questionnaires in the form of, for example, text, voice (audio), video, or hologram. In addition, the questions, scales, and questionnaires can be presented by way of a live video with a live human being or an avatar. The electronic compliance unit () can be further comprise an input device that can be configured for the subject to enter answers as touch screen input, text input, voice (audio), video, or holographic recording. Voice, video, or holographic recordings can be transcribed from voice to text. Voice recognition can be used as part of the identity verification process as well.","In addition, the electronic compliance unit () can comprise an alert system which can provide an instant connection to a person via audio, video, or hologram. Such alert system can be triggered if, for example, subjects report a significant new medical problem, technical problem, or reports thoughts of hurting themselves or others.","In addition, all recordings of the subject can be stored by the system for use as source documentation in accordance with the protocol and with regulatory requirements. All of the transcriptions of the subject's input by voice, video, or holography can also be stored for use as source documentation in accordance with the protocol and with regulatory requirements.","In another embodiment of the system, in addition to the subject being presented with medical questions, answer scales, and questionnaires, the electronic compliance unit () can also be configured to provide a running commentary on how the subject feels as well as anything else that the subject desires to mention. Such commentary can be in the form of a log or diary that can be recorded by touch input, text input, video, voice (audio), or holographic recording. The electronic compliance unit () can be configured to record the subjects' commentary for as long as the subject so desires. A transcription of the subject's voice can be provided and the transcription can then be analyzed for key words regarding how the subject feels. In addition, certain responses containing keywords and\/or phrases such as \u201ckill\u201d or \u201csuicide\u201d from the subject can trigger an alert to the research facility or in extreme cases can trigger a call to emergency services such as 911.","The results of the measurements of mHealth devices can be imported directly into the electronic compliance unit () and can be displayed on the electronic device for review by the subject and\/or research staff.

In addition, the doctor or clinical staff may view the data directly on the eCompliance system ().","Once the doctor or other clinical staff has access to the data collected on the eCompliance system (), the data, video, holographic, audio, and still images can be reviewed to determine whether or not the subject has been compliant with the requirements of the protocol.","The eCompliance system () may comprise further security and\/or privacy features. For example, to satisfy FDA requirements for clinical trials, information that can identify the identity of each subject may be blocked from some users of the database [see reference (3)]. For example, tier  users, such as the originator, and tier  users, such as an investigator or clinical research coordinator on site may have access to information that can identify the subject's identity. However, tier  users such as a sponsor would not have access to such identity information. The de-identification of subject data can be done, for example, by blocking access to identity information, such as name and address, and by obscuring or blurring facial images.","Identification of the subject can have several benefits in both the medical clinic setting and in various settings outside of the medical clinic. One skilled in the art will recognize that the majority of clinical trials takes place in medical facilities including but not limited to doctor's offices, health clinics, research clinics, hospitals, emergency departments, radiology facilities, and medical laboratories. One skilled in the art will also recognize that most research subjects will only visit these medical facilities for brief periods of time and will spend most of their time on the clinical trial outside of the medical clinic at their home, place of work, or other locations in the community. Therefore it is important for proper identification of subjects as they are about to perform study related activities both in the medical facilities and outside of these facilities. When subjects are in the research facility, they must appear within a protocol specified window of time (including both date and time) which may be specified for example in the eCTMS. When they do show up, their identity is verified. Such verification can provide a true audit trail of who interacted with the subject, who collected the data, and who performed the study procedures. Moreover, such audit trail will enable regulatory authorities to ensure that the individuals performing the study were properly trained, qualified, and employed to be performing such activities.","According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the electronic device can be configured to further minimize fraud by recording, logging, verifying and authenticating the identity, attendance, and\/or activity of a person. The electronic device loaded with such features will be referred to herein as an \u201celectronic confirmation unit\u201d. The electronic device can further comprise a camera, which can be either a camera that is embedded on the electronic device itself or located externally to the electronic device.","In another embodiment, the electronic device can further comprise a biometric identity device including but not limited to facial recognition, fingerprints, retina scan, voiceprint, iris scan, typing biometrics, hand and finger geometry, signature verification, ear geometry, olfactory biometrics, and behavioral biometrics.","By way of example and not of limitation,  shows a system diagram where a subject that is participating in a clinical research study can visit a research clinic according to a predetermined schedule () set forth in a research protocol (). When the subject arrives at the clinic for the first visit of the research protocol, the clinic staff (e.g., receptionist) can use the camera of electronic confirmation unit () to record a picture or video of the subject's face.","In some instances, a subject should not participate in more than one clinical research study. An example of such instance can be when guidelines (e.g., clinical trial protocols) prohibit a subject from participating in multiple studies at the same time. Yet, some subjects may either knowingly or unknowingly attempt to participate in multiple clinical research studies. In order to prevent a subject from participating in multiple clinical research studies, the electronic confirmation unit can further comprise a biometric identity confirmation application that can reference the patient's biometric identity characteristics against a master clinical studies database (), comprising the biometric identity of other clinical studies participants, by way of example and not of limitation, a facial recognition application that can reference facial characteristics. Such comparison can ensure that the subject is not currently participating in any other studies which prohibits the subject from participating in the study for which the electronic confirmation unit is being used (). The clinical studies database () can be located locally within the electronic confirmation unit () or remotely on a server such that the electronic confirmation unit references the database on the server either via a wired or wireless connection.","According to another embodiment, the electronic confirmation unit () can be implemented in clinics such that when a subject visits the research clinic for subsequent scheduled or unscheduled evaluations (), the subject's identity can be authenticated by the clinic staff upon checking-in by using the biometric identity confirmation (e.g., facial recognition) application. In the exemplary case where facial recognition application is used, since the subject's face (picture or video) and facial characteristics were recorded during a prior visit, the facial recognition application is able to confirm that, in fact, this returning subject is the same subject from the initial visit. Furthermore, a video or still image of the subject visiting the clinic can be recorded with the camera, and the date, time, and location (e.g., coordinates obtained from a GPS) that the subject visited the clinic can be automatically logged by the electronic device to validate that subject's attendance at the clinic on that day. Alternatively, the entire visit of the subject in the clinic can be video recorded, providing further proof that the subject visited the clinic on a given date\/time at a given location.","Through a connection (wired or wireless) to the previously described electronic consent unit (), the electronic confirmation unit on the electronic device can be configured to verify if there are any outstanding or new, agreements and\/or disclosures that need to be signed by the subject. If there are any outstanding or new agreements and\/or disclosures that need to be signed by the subject, then the electronic device can display the agreement through the interactive process using the electronic consent unit, to have the subject sign the agreement.","In some cases, it is desired to authenticate that a particular research staff (e.g., clinical research coordinator, physician, research assistant, etc) authenticate their identity. According to another embodiment, the research staff conducting the visit (e.g., examination, evaluation, etc) with the subject can authenticate by using the facial recognition application of the electronic confirmation unit to authenticate that this research staff is authorized to conduct this visit based on their training and regulatory documentation () (e.g., credentials, authorizations, regulatory status). In addition, the date, time, and location that the research staff was in the clinic with the subject can be automatically logged in the electronic confirmation unit to validate the research staff's attendance at the clinic on that day.","In another embodiment, an electronic device with a display can provide a progress bar and related information, also referred to here as an \u201ceProgress Unit\u201d, for a plurality of usages including but not limited to providing patients information during a medical visit. Any service-business that has a relatively standardized sequence of processes required to complete a service or visit can use the eProgress unit to enhance customer service by providing their customer with real-time information about the sequence of events and the progress toward completion of that sequence of events. Customers may appreciate knowing all of the steps that will occur, the order in which they will occur, and the estimated time that they will be finished. This information can make them less anxious about the procedures and less anxious about when they will be done, and that may increase their satisfaction with the service.","Referring now to , shown here in is a exemplary display () of an eProgress unit for use in a clinical trials clinic. A research subject can be provided with an eProgress unit which displays the sequence of procedures which will be performed and the estimated time at which these procedures will be completed. The sequence of procedures can be displayed in a bar format () with the current procedure highlighted by a symbol (). The current and next procedures can also be displayed in other formats such as text (), pictoral, or other. If there is a delay in the actual performance of any of these procedures, the estimated time () can be automatically recalculated.","In another example as shown in the exemplary display () seen in , in a medical clinic, patients can be provided an eProgress unit which not only displays the sequence of procedures which will be performed as shown in  (e.g. being taken back to the exam room, having their vital signs taken, being examined by the doctor, giving a urine sample), but the eProgress unit can be capable of displaying an automatically updated estimated time () of completion of the visit. In this example, if there is a delay in one of the steps (e.g. the doctor is delayed because of a medical emergency at the hospital), the eProgress unit can automatically update the estimated time and can display an alert () explaining why the estimated time has been updated.","Other exemplary uses of the eProgress unit can include businesses such as automobile repair and\/or oil change centers, eye-care centers, financial services, hair salons, veterinary services, restaurants, repair services, construction services, cleaning services, and travel services.","The examples set forth above are provided to give those of ordinary skill in the art a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the embodiments of the present disclosure, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their disclosure.
