title: Deploying multiple enterprise planning models across clusters of application servers
abstract: An enterprise planning system includes a plurality of application servers, and an administration console to generate a deployment map that associates each of a set of enterprise planning models with a respective set of the application servers. The administration console, either automatically or in response to input from a system administrator, may finely control the allocation of computing resources to enterprise planning. The administrator console may adjust the deployment map based on approaching deadlines for the enterprise planning activities. When administrating a task associated with an enterprise planning activity, the administration console may break the task into a number of jobs, each job associated with a different slice of the model in accordance with the organizational hierarchy defined by the model. Consequently, allocation of computing resources to enterprise planning may be finely controlled, and may be adjusted to meet the current needs within the organizational hierarchy.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to enterprise computing environments, and more particularly, to computing environments for enterprise business planning.","More than ever before, enterprises are charged with establishing accurate forecasts for enterprise operations. Failing to meet established expectations can have significant negative impact on the enterprise in the areas of cash flow, stock price, liquidity, and investor faith, among other areas. Examples of enterprise planning activities for which accuracy is critical include revenue forecasting, inventory management, resource planning, and the like. Enterprise business planning, however, is a difficult and expensive task that often produces inaccurate results.","Conventionally, businesses have taken either a \u201ctop-down\u201d or a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to enterprise planning. In \u201ctop-down\u201d planning, businesses identify fundamental business targets, such as average product price, cost per employee, and the like, and push the targets down through the hierarchical structure of the corporation. In contrast, \u201cbottom-up\u201d planning involves the aggregation of low-level forecasts from the lowest cost centers of an organization. For budget planning, for example, management personnel may be required to periodically forecast expenses, and allocate the expenses to a number of categories, such as advertisement, travel, and salaries. However, the bottom-up forecasts rarely, if ever, reconcile with top-down business targets.","This information has typically been collected using paper or, more recently, electronic forms, such as an electronic template created with a spreadsheet software program. This often leaves the financial department of the enterprise with the difficult task of consolidating uncoordinated plans that have been compiled using inconsistent assumptions and varying business logic.","More recently, large computer systems have been used to collect the data via an enterprise network. The computer systems typically consolidate data collected from the various enterprise users using time-consuming, offline batch processing during \u201coff\u201d hours. This offline consolidation can lead to significant time delays between the collection of the data from a user, and the consolidation of the collected data with other data collected from the enterprise. As a result, such systems often present users an inaccurate view of the actual, aggregated data for the enterprise activity being forecasted. This may lead the users to provide incorrect data, or erroneously modify their input. Furthermore, the users may be unsure as to which numbers are the \u201cright\u201d numbers for the enterprise, and may generally doubt the integrity of the results. This slow process of data collection and offline consolidation can be particularly problematic for a heavily deadline-oriented activity like enterprise planning.","The invention is directed to enterprise planning techniques that improve the accuracy and predictability of budget planning within large organizations. The techniques enable organizations to reconcile corporate financial models and organizational targets with detailed forecasts in real-time.","According to the techniques, an enterprise planning system enables and automates the reconciliation of top-down targets with detailed bottom-up forecasts for an enterprise. Generally, the enterprise planning system provides three stages of enterprise planning: (1) a modeling stage, (2) a contribution stage, and (3) a reconciliation stage. During the modeling stage, high-level enterprise managers or executives, referred to as analysts, define organizational targets, and build planning models for the enterprise. Next, during the contribution phase, a set of defined contributors interacts with the enterprise planning system and provides detailed forecasts in the form of contribution data. During the reconciliation phase, the enterprise planning system automates the reconciliation of the forecast data with the organizational targets.","During this process, the enterprise planning system operates in accordance with the defined model to provide a hierarchical planning process having multiple reconciliation levels. At each level, the enterprise planning system presents the contribution data to enterprise reviewers, as defined by the hierarchical model, and requires that the reviewer reconcile the target data with the forecast data. Each reviewer may, for example, reject or accept the contribution data in view of corporate targets provided by the analysts.","As the contributors provide the contribution data, the enterprise planning system automatically aggregates the contribution data across the enterprise in real-time, and presents the aggregated data to reviewers for acceptance or rejection. This process continues until the contribution data is ultimately approved by the reviewers associated with the highest level of the organizational hierarchy, thereby ensuring that the contribution data from the contributors reconciles with corporate targets.","In one embodiment, a system comprises a plurality of application servers, and an administration console to generate a deployment map that associates each of a set of enterprise planning models with a respective set of the application servers.","In another embodiment, a method comprises generating a deployment map that associates each of a set of enterprise planning models with a respective set of application servers, and processing jobs with the enterprise planning models with the respective sets of application servers.","The invention may offer one or more advantages. For example, the techniques described herein may provide a fine level of control over allocation of computing resources to enterprise planning, either automatically or in response to input from a system administrator. The deployment map may be adjusted to shift the deployment of the models across the application servers based on approaching deadlines for the enterprise planning activities. When administrating a task associated with an enterprise planning activity, the enterprise planning system may break the task into a number of jobs, each job associated with a different slice of the model in accordance with the organizational hierarchy defined by the model. Consequently, the allocation of computing resources to enterprise planning may be finely controlled, and may be adjusted to meet the current needs within the organizational hierarchy.","The techniques may improve the accuracy and predictability of enterprise planning by enabling organizations to reconcile corporate models and organizational targets with detailed forecasts in real-time. The techniques may provide a platform that delivers collaborative, real-time planning capabilities, without requiring offline consolidation and aggregation of forecasts. Because the enterprise planning system can aggregate contribution data in real-time, all users can be presented with an accurate, up-to-date view of the data. The system provides rapid response regardless of the number of enterprise users involved in the planning, thus providing precise planning information.","Further, the architecture described herein can readily scale to thousands of users, and may be designed around best planning practices. In this manner, the system may used to centrally manage all planning information across operating units and systems within the enterprise, thus creating a \u201cplanning hub.\u201d Consequently, users can work from a single pool of planning data, and can be assured of the integrity of the data.","In addition, the techniques promote high user-participation across the enterprise, allowing planning cycles to be reduced, e.g., from months to weeks, and best practices, like rolling forecasting, to be quickly enabled.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","3","4","3","8","4","8","4"]},"During the modeling stage, analysts  also establish corporate targets for each node of the organizational hierarchy. Analysts  then assign one or more enterprise users to each node, such as managers, supervisors, sales representatives, lab managers, or the like, that are responsible for enterprise planning for the corresponding cost center. Each enterprise user may be designated as a contributor  that provides planning data to enterprise system , a reviewer that accepts or rejects contributions from contributors , or both. Contributors  and reviewers  may be authorized users within enterprise , or within other entities coupled to network , such as suppliers  and customers .","Finally, analysts  define a number of templates for collecting spending forecast data from the contributors. Analysts  include the corporate target data in the templates to facilitate reconciliation with the forecast data.","Next, enterprise planning system  enters the contribution phase during which contributors  interact with enterprise planning system  and input detailed forecasts in the form of contribution data. For example, contributors  may provide detailed financial forecasts, revenue forecasts, order forecasts, inventory forecasts, estimated resource requirements, and the like, depending on the particular enterprise planning activity being carried out by enterprise .","During the reconciliation phase, enterprise planning system  automates the reconciliation of the forecast data with the corporate targets provided by analysts . In particular, enterprise planning system  operates in accordance with the defined model to provide a hierarchical planning process having multiple reconciliation levels. As each of contributors  provides his or her contribution data, enterprise planning system  automatically aggregates the contribution data across enterprise  in real-time, and provides access to the aggregated data to reviewers  associated with higher levels of enterprise . In particular, upon receiving contribution data from contributors , enterprise planning system  identifies all higher levels of the organizational model affected by the newly received contribution data, and calculates new aggregate totals at each level in real-time.","Consequently, reviewers  view aggregated data across enterprise  in real-time during the enterprise planning session. At each level, enterprise planning system  ensures that reviewers , as defined by the nodes of the enterprise model, reconcile the target data with the forecast data. Each reviewer  may, for example, reject or accept the contribution data in view of corporate targets provided by analysts . This process continues until the contribution data is ultimately approved by the highest level of the organizational hierarchy, thereby ensuring that the contribution data from contributors  reconciles with corporate targets provided by analysts .","In this manner, enterprise planning system  may provide more accurate enterprise planning than with conventional techniques. For example, enterprise planning system  may improve the accuracy and predictability of enterprise planning by enabling organizations to reconcile corporate models and organizational targets with detailed forecasts. The techniques may provide a platform that delivers collaborative, real-time planning capabilities, without requiring offline consolidation and aggregation of forecasts. Because the enterprise planning system can aggregate contribution data in real-time, all users can be presented with an accurate, up-to-date view of the numbers. Further, the architecture of enterprise planning system  can readily scale to thousands of users, and may be designed around best planning practices. In addition, the techniques enabling high participation by enterprise users, i.e., contributors  and reviewers , allowing accurate planning cycles to be reduced","Enterprise users may use a variety of computing devices to interact with enterprise planning system  via network . For example, an enterprise user may interact with enterprise planning system  using a laptop computer, desktop computer, or the like, running a web browser, such as Internet Explorer\u2122 from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Alternatively, an enterprise user may use a personal digital assistant (PDA), such as a Palm\u2122 organizer from Palm Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., a web-enabled cellular phone, or similar device. Network  represents any communication network, such as a packet-based digital network like the Internet. In this manner, system  can readily scale to suit large enterprises. The enterprise users may directly access enterprise planning system  via a local area network, or may remotely access enterprise planning system  via a virtual private network, remote dial-up, or similar remote access communication mechanism.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["3","3","20","26","40"]},"Web servers  provide an interface for communicating with enterprise user  via network . Web servers  execute web server software, such as Internet Information Server\u2122 from Microsoft Corporation, of Redmond, Wash. As such, web servers  provide an environment for interacting with contributors , analysts , and reviewers  according to software modules , which include analysis module , contribution module , administration (ADMIN) console , and extension manager .","Software modules  may comprise Lotus scripts, Java scripts, Java Applets, Active Server Pages, web pages written in hypertext markup language (HTML) or dynamic HTML, Active X objects, and other suitable modules. Web servers  serve up web pages defined by software modules , and communicate the web pages to computing devices of enterprise users . The web pages may include static media, such as text and graphic imagery, as well as conventional input media such as text entry boxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, and the like, for receiving information from enterprise users .","Software modules  interact with database servers  to access enterprise data  including user data A, model data B, job data C, and configuration data D. Enterprise data may be stored in a number of different forms including one or more data storage file, or one or more database management systems (DBMS) executing on one or more database servers. The database management systems may be a relational (RDBMS), hierarchical (HDBMS), multidimensional (MDBMS), object oriented (ODBMS or OODBMS) or object relational (ORDBMS) database management system. Furthermore, although illustrated separately, enterprise data  could be combined into a single database or other data storage structure. Enterprise data  could, for example, be implemented as a single relational database, such as SQL Server from Microsoft Corporation.","User data A stores information for each of users , including the name, email address, and other contact information for the user. Model data B stores the enterprise planning models defined by the analysts . For example, model database B stores information that defines the reconciliation process developed by analysts , including the number of reconciliation levels, the various \u201cnodes\u201d in the hierarchy, and the contributor  associated with each node. In addition, model data B stores the respective data entry templates of the models for capturing contribution and review data from users . Job data C defines administration jobs for execution application servers , and configuration (CONFIG) data D stores basic configuration data for enterprise planning system .","Application servers  provide an operating environment for execution of business logic modules , enterprise planning extensions , and application programming interface (API) . In addition, application servers  carry out administration tasks as defined by job data C. In other words, job data  provides a mechanism for queuing job descriptions for pending administrative jobs for execution by application servers .","Referring to software applications , analysis module  includes one or more software modules for creating enterprise planning models, such as financial models for enterprise , to control the entire planning process. For example, analysis module  allows analysts  to define the various cost centers, the corresponding owners and the number of reconciliation stages in the enterprise planning process. In one configuration, analysis module  read cost-center structures and ownership from an enterprise resource planning (ERP) database (not shown). In addition, analysis module  allows analysts  to define the \u201ctemplates\u201d for collecting contribution data. A template may comprise one or more multi-dimensional structures that provide an interface for entering and calculating contribution data. For example, the template may define cost centers as a dimension within a data cube for selecting data, with a chart of accounts along the rows, and periods in the columns. Analysis module  stores the enterprise planning models, as well as the corresponding templates, within model data B.","Analysis module  also allows the organization to define a number of mechanisms for automating the budgeting process and ensuring that the contributors  submit their respective contribution data timely, and that templates quickly move through the defined reconciliation stages. For example, using analysis module , the analysts  can define timers for triggering electronic mail messages (emails) to remind the contributors  to access enterprise planning system  and complete a particular template.","Contribution module  include software modules for presenting the templates to enterprise users  designated as contributors , and for capturing contribution data from the contributors . Contribution module  captures and aggregates the contribution data across enterprise  in real-time, and provides access to the aggregated data to reviewers  associated with higher levels of enterprise .","Report generator  includes analytical software modules that generate enterprise planning reports based on the contribution data received from contributors  and stored within model data B. In particular, the analytical software modules allow users , such as analysts  and reviewers , to formulate complex queries for generating reports and performing other data analysis functions on the current data of the enterprise model. These software modules may be web-based modules having a browser interface, or may be stand-alone executable programs.","Business logic modules  execute within the operating environment provided by application severs , and provide functionality for accessing and processing the data stored within databases  in response to software modules . In particular, business logic modules  comprise software routines for implementing the enterprise planning functions, and are invoked by software modules .","Administration console  presents an interface for controlling the clustering of web servers , application servers , and database servers . Administration console  allows the system administrator to control the number of servers used within each cluster. The system administrator may, for example, select one or more servers available within network , and direct administration console  to utilize the servers as, for example, application servers . In this manner, enterprise planning system  may easily scale to support large enterprises having thousands of users .","When administrating a task associated with an enterprise planning activity, administration console  may break the task into a number of jobs, each job associated with a different slice of the model in accordance with the multi-level, organizational hierarchy defined by the particular model. For example, administration console  may separate a particular task into a set of N jobs, where N equals the number of nodes defined within the hierarchy. Administration console  may then distribute the jobs across the set of application servers  for which the model is deployed.","Administration console  provides a job interface for viewing jobs queued for processing by application servers , and viewing the load balancing across the clustered application servers . Administration console  generates job data C to define task for application servers . As jobs are queued within job data C, application servers  read job data C from the database servers , and process the jobs to completion. For example, one type of job involves the \u201ccut-down\u201d process by which the enterprise model defined within enterprise data B is \u201csliced\u201d for each user. During this process, application servers  identify areas of the defined models to which users  are assigned, either as contributors or reviewers. Enterprise planning system  presents the respective slices to each user  to capture contribution data, and to reconcile the contribution data with organizational targets. In this fashion, enterprise planning system  need not communicate the entire model to each of users , thereby reducing communication time as well as resource requirements. Instead, each user  receives only relevant information.","In addition, administration console  allows a system administrator to control the deployment of enterprise planning models across application servers . In particular, analysts  may define a plurality of planning models for enterprise . For example, analysts  may define separate models for revenue forecasting, inventory management, resource planning, managing accounts payable, and the like. Administration console  allows the system administrator to create a deployment map that assigns each model to a set of application servers . In other words, different enterprise models can be deployed on separate application servers , or may share one or more application servers.","Consequently, the system administrator may finely control the allocation of computing resources to enterprise planning, and may adjust the resources to meet the current needs of the enterprise. The system administrator may adjust the deployment map to shift the deployment of the models across application servers  based on approaching deadlines for the enterprise planning activities. Specifically, the system administrator may allocate more computing resources to enterprise models having the earliest deadlines in view of the likely increased activity by users  as the deadlines approach. As another example, the system administrator may adjust the deployment map based on current usage levels for users  participating in the enterprise planning models.","Administration console  allows analysts  to modify an enterprise planning model. For example, analysts  may wish to capture additional contribution data after initiating an enterprise planning activity. To ease the adoption of the changes to the model, administration console  supports node level modification and maintenance of an enterprise planning model. In particular, administration console allows analysts  to check-in and check-out nodes of the model, i.e., to mark the node or otherwise change the state of the node from \u201conline\u201d to \u201coffline.\u201d Consequently, an analyst  can updated a model \u201cslice\u201d associated with the particular offline, rather than interrupting the enterprise-wide planning activity. Other users cannot edit the offline node, i.e., no contribution data or review input can be saved to the respective slot for the node within transactional data area .","However, the enterprise contributors associated with the non-offline nodes may continue to provide and review contribution data for the enterprise planning session. This feature allows modification and maintenance on a per-node basis, and allows the model to remain operational. Accordingly, analysts  can modify the business logic associated with a particular node without taking the entire model offline.","Application servers  typically process model changes made by analysts . Specifically, in the event analysts  modify an enterprise model during the planning activity, application servers  may be used to reconcile contribution and review data received from users  with the updated model. Alternatively, administration console  may direct application servers  to facilitate remote reconciliation on the computing devices of users . Upon authenticating access by users  subsequent to the model change, authentication servers  may \u201cpush\u201d reconciliation jobs to the local computing devices. The remote computing devices reconcile the contribution data and review data of users  with the updated model, and save the reconciled data to enterprise planning system . This may be advantageous in that enterprise planning system  need not be taken offline to update enterprise models, and that computing resources to process the updates can be distributed across the remote computing devices of users .","Extension manager  provides an interface by which a system administrator can install and selectively deploy extensions  to easily provide additional enterprise planning functions to system . In general, three classes of extensions can be added: (1) administration extensions, (2) server-side extensions, and (3) client-side extensions. Administration extensions comprise software modules that execute within, or invoked by, administration console . Consequently, administration extensions are typically used to provide additional administrative functionality, and may generate administration jobs for execution by application servers .","Server-side extensions typically execute within the operating environment provided by application servers. These extensions may be used to facilitate workflow integration, custom initialization, or custom publishing of aggregated contribution data during the planning activity.","In contrast, client-side extensions comprise software modules that execute within the operating environment of the remote computing devices of users , typically within a web browser environment. Contribution module  automatically searches extensions  for newly installed extensions, and downloads the extensions to users  upon their next access. In particular, contribution module  may load and invoke the extension on the remote computing device immediately upon user access, or upon demand. Although client-side extensions typically operate within the operating environment of the remote computing devices, the extensions may interact with server-side components.","To facilitate the incorporation of extensions, enterprise planning system  provides an application programming interface (API)  by which extensions  can directly access and manipulate models within model data B, as well as other components of enterprise planning system . Via extension manager , the system administrator can register new extensions  with system , and define inputs for launching the extensions, e.g., buttons or other graphical icons.","Extension manager  allows the system administrator to selectively deploy extensions based on the role assigned to the particular user . In particular, extension manager  allows the system administrator to assign extensions to all contributors , and to all reviewers . In addition, extension manager  allows the system administrator to assign extensions to different slices of enterprise planning models stored within model data B. In this manner, extensions may be assigned to different cost centers, different business departments, and the like. Furthermore, extensions may be assigned based on the level of a reviewer  within the hierarchy defined by the particular model. For example, reviewers  of a certain level of the hierarchy, e.g., controllers for cost centers, may be required to complete a best-practices extension that provides detailed best practices validation on all aggregated contribution data. Extension manager  may store user-specific extension information within user data A indicating which extensions are assigned to each of users , and possibly setting user-specific properties for the extension. This flexibility advantageously allows an enterprise planning model to be adapted and customized as the enterprise planning session extends deeper into enterprise .","One example of an extension is an extension that provides a wrapper around an off-the-shelf collaborative network-based planning tool, such as NetMeeting from Microsoft Corporation. Instead of rejecting contribution data, a reviewer  can invoke the extension to conference in the subordinate, and directly access model data B to review the contribution data together. Another example is an extension that enables real-time validation of a contribution against other sources. Other examples of extensions include: (1) extensions for customized reporting functions required by certain users  within the hierarchy, (2) extensions for exporting planning data to other applications, e.g., a spreadsheet application, (3) extensions for driving newly developed printing engines, (4) extensions for importing enterprise data, and (5) extensions for interfacing with a document management system.","Extension manager  allows the system administrator to map extensions  to events or messages within system . For example, the system administrator may install a new extension, and require that the extension be invoked upon receiving contribution data from one of contributors  via contribution module . This feature may be particularly useful for deploying best practices validation of contribution data or enforcement of other enterprise requirements. As another example, an extension may be used to enforce reconciliation of top-down corporate targets with bottom-up forecasts within a predefined defined percentage, e.g., ten percent. As another example, an extension may be used to reduce forecasts to a certain level or by a particular percentage. Accordingly, uniform decreases in forecasts can easily be required and enforced across enterprise .","In one embodiment, extensions  may comprise software modules that conform to the component object model (COM). Consequently, an ActiveX client may be easily used to invoke extensions . Each extension  may provide one or more common interfaces for invocation and control, e.g., by contributor module  or administration console .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["50","18","6","9","50","52","54","56","58","18","50","3","54","56","52"]},"In one embodiment, calculation engine  comprises a forward calculation engine  wrapped in an Active X object built in an array-based language. Template  comprises an Active X control that includes any necessary drivers for entering and manipulating budget forecast data. Template  includes a stand-alone data cube  containing the top-down target data, and the bottom-up contribution data, and allows all calculations to be performed locally. Therefore, after the download is complete, each contributor  can modify his or her respective contribution data within template , and perform calculations without accessing enterprise planning system . As ActiveX components, calculation engine , template  and data cube  are maintained locally via computing device . As such, the contributor  will only experience network delays when template  and calculation engine  are initially downloaded, as well as when template  is saved at the end of a session.","To interact with enterprise planning system , each of contributors  uses browser  to interact with template  to provide respective contribution data, e.g., by completing cells of a displayed grid, and viewing the dynamic changes that occur to calculated items within the grid. Because calculation engine  is resident within web browser , the cell entries do not have to be resubmitted to enterprise planning system , recalculated, and then re-posted to the web browser  via network . If the contributor  wishes to end the planning session, but has not finished the process, the contributor  can save template  and data cube  to enterprise planning system . When the contributor  wishes to continue the planning session, he or she can access enterprise planning system , at which time the appropriate template  and data cube  will be loaded in web browser  for further editing. When the contributor  is satisfied with the budget data entered within template , the contributor  can submit the data to enterprise planning system . As each contributor  provides his or her contribution data, or accepts the contribution data, enterprise planning system  automatically aggregates the contribution data across enterprise  in real-time, and provides access to the aggregated data to reviewers  associated with higher levels of enterprise .","In similar fashion, each of reviewers  interacts with enterprise systems  via web browser  executing upon his or her remote computing device . Each reviewer  may reject or accept the contribution data in view of corporate targets provided by the analysts . This process continues until the contribution data is ultimately approved by the reviewers associated with the highest level of the organizational hierarchy, thereby ensuring that the contribution data from the contributors reconciles with corporate targets.","In one embodiment, web browser  includes inline compression module  for automatically compressing communication to enterprise planning system , and decompressing communications received from the system. In particular, inline compression module  automatically intercepts outgoing buffers transmitted from web browser  to system  via the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), and automatically compresses the buffers prior to transmission. Similarly, inline compression module  intercepts incoming HTTP buffers, and determines whether the buffers are compressed. If the buffers are compressed, inline compression module  automatically decompresses the buffers, and forward the decompressed buffers to web browser . In this manner, inline compression module  seamlessly compresses and decompresses communications between computing device  and enterprise planning system , leading to possible efficiency gains within system .","In one embodiment, enterprise planning system  makes use of a single active server page (ASP) to receive the compressed HTTP buffers, and direct the compressed buffers to appropriate business logic modules  for decompression and processing. A header with each HTTP buffer may include a byte count or other information indicating whether the buffer is compressed, and an identifier for an appropriate business logic module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","42","62","63","62","18","63"]},"More specifically, database servers  store contribution data received from contributors  in transactional data area , and publish the contribution data from transactional data area  to relational data area , e.g., on a periodic basis. Transactional data area  includes a number of slots  that are hierarchically related in accordance with the enterprise model. Transactional data area  includes a set of contribution slots  to store contribution data received from contributors , and a set of aggregations slots  to store aggregated data calculated from the contribution data in real-time and in accordance with the hierarchy defined by the model. Consequently, transactional data area  includes a transaction slot  for each of the enterprise contributors  to store the contribution data received from the respective enterprise contributor. In addition, transaction data area A associates each reviewer  with at least one of the aggregation slot  for each reviewer . For example, an enterprise model may have N hierarchically arranged nodes, each node defining at network user and designating the user as one of a contributor and a reviewer. In this configuration, transactional data area comprises N slots, including an aggregation slot for each reviewer and a transaction slot for each contributor defined by the model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["66","70","1","5","8"]},"Each node of Level  has a corresponding contributor  that is responsible for entering contribution data. Similarly, each node of Levels I, II is associated with a reviewer  for reconciling the contribution data in view of the corporate targets defined by analysts . For simplicity,  illustrates one of the contributors, Andy associated with Outlet A, and two reviews: Peter associated with Region , and Guy associated with the node. In this example, Guy is the Chief Financial Officer for Pizza Palace, Inc. and is responsible for the overseeing all regions. Guy, therefore, is listed as an \u201cowner\u201d of root node  and as a \u201creviewer\u201d for all Regions \u2013. Peter is a middle level manager charged with overseeing Region . As such, Peter is listed as the owner of Region  and reviewer for Outlet A. Andy, a manager of a local pizza store, is listed as the owner for Outlet A.","Each node of hierarchy  is associated with one or more corresponding templates within model data B, depending upon the node's level within the hierarchy. For example, each outlet within Level III is associated with a single template for capturing forecast information. At Level II, each region is associated with the templates of its corresponding child nodes, i.e., the outlets within the region. Root node  of hierarchy  is, therefore, associated with all of the templates for the company.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["62","70","62","66","66","6","70"]},"Similarly, transactional data area  includes aggregations slots  for each node of Levels I, II, i.e., root node  and the nodes corresponding to Regions \u2013. Each aggregation slot  stores aggregated contribution data for its child nodes, as defined by hierarchy  and represented in  by arrows. For example, aggregation slot  corresponds to root node , and stores aggregated data calculated by totaling all data received from Regions \u2013. As another example, aggregation slot , corresponding to Region , stores aggregated data calculated from contribution data for Outlets B\u2013D. In this manner, transactional data area  provides an accurate, up-to-date view of data for all levels of the model, thus facilitating enterprise-wide planning.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["3","8","3","80"]},"Analysts  also define an organizational hierarchy for controlling the enterprise-wide planning process (). For Pizza Palace, for example, analysts  may define an organization hierarchy having fourteen nodes as illustrated in . Analysts  assign one or more enterprise users to each node, and designate each user as a contributor, reviewer, or both. In addition, analysts  may designate one of the users associated with each node as an owner of that respective node.","Upon receiving the organizational hierarchy, application servers  of enterprise planning system  processes the model in view of the hierarchy to \u201cslice\u201d the model for each defined user. In other words, application servers  apply the hierarchy to the model as if the hierarchy were an additional dimension, and identifies a respective portion of the model for which each user can access. Application servers  associate each node in the hierarchy with a slice across the other dimensions of the model. By slicing the model in this manner, enterprise planning system  need not communicate the entire model to the remote computing device of the user, but need only communicate the relevant portion of the one or more data cubes of the model.","In addition, application servers initialize enterprise data , including creating the appropriate number of aggregation slots  and contribution slots  of transactional data area , as well as creating create the tables and relationships of relational data areas .","Next, analysts  interact with the enterprise planning system  to provide target data for the enterprise (), and contributors  interact with the system to provide detailed forecasts in the form of contribution data (). Upon receiving the contribution data, application servers  update contribution slots  of transaction data areas  to store the contribution data, and update aggregation slots  in real-time to store aggregate totals for each of the upper levels nodes of the enterprise hierarchy.","In this manner, the aggregate totals are readily available for reviewers  across enterprise . Consequently, reviewers  can access enterprise planning system , and immediately provide review input either rejecting or accepting the contribution data and the aggregate totals in view of the target data provided by analysts  (). During this process, application servers  periodically publish contribution data and aggregate data from transactional data area  to relational data area  () for creation of analytical reports and other statistical analysis by report generator  (). Enterprise planning system  repeats the reconciliation process until the contribution data and aggregate totals are accepted by the high-level reviewer of the organizational hierarchy ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["3","6","99","26","42","100","26","56","54","6","102"]},"Upon receiving new or updated contribution data from the contributor  (), application servers  update the respective contribution slot to store the contribution data (). Next, application servers  selectively update the aggregate totals of aggregation slots  for any parent aggregation slots related to the updated contribution slot. In particular, application servers  identifies the immediate parent aggregation slot for the updated contribution slot based on the defined hierarchical model (), calculates new aggregate totals for the parent slot based on the updated contribution slot (), and stores the new aggregate totals to the parent slot (). Application servers  repeat this process until all related higher-level aggregation slots have been updated ().","In one embodiment, application servers  organize transactional data area  as a single table having a set of rows. Each row corresponds to a respective node in the defined organizational hierarchy. Application servers  store respective contribution data or aggregation data within each row, and may store the data as a row that contains a single \u201cblob\u201d of data. Specifically, application servers  may write the data for a given row as a single string or text or binary data. In one embodiment, each row is stored as packed text that conforms to the extensible markup language (XML). The packed XML describes each cell for the slice of the model that pertains to the user associated with the row, as well as the current value for the cells. When initializing transactional data area , application servers  extract metadata from the one or more data cubes of the model, and create an XML representation of each \u201cslice\u201d of the model within the respective slot.","When updating the contribution data, the XML may be generated by the remote computing device of the user. The remote computing device may generate the XML, and communicates the XML as part of the HTTP buffer, either in compressed or uncompressed form. Alternatively, application servers  may generate the XML.","To update the aggregate totals in real-time, application servers  parse the XML for the respective parent aggregation slots to quickly retrieve current values for the cells, and replace the packed XML with a new entry having updated aggregate totals. The aggregate data may be stored in XML form as a linear array having a set of cells to store the aggregate totals. Consequently, application servers  may retrieve the linear array from one aggregation slot, overlay the array with the array of a parent aggregation slot, and quickly recompute the aggregate totals for the parent slot.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["26","62","63","26","26","6","9"]},"To publish the data, application servers  pass the contribution data of each contribution slot  to identify a set of date elements and respective values (). As described above, each slot  may contain packed XML describing a slice of the enterprise planning model. Application servers  decompress the packed XML, and identify the contained cells of the data cubes of the model, as well as the current values for the cells.","Next, based on the model, application servers  select one or more tables from relational data area  that correspond to the parsed contribution data (). For example, application servers  may identify a Sales table to store forecasted product sales.","Finally, application servers  write the parsed data into the identified tables of relational data area .

The hierarchy, as described above, includes five sales regions, with Region  having 3 pizza stores (Outlet B\u2013Outlet D). The hierarchy represents the workflow of the corporation and, therefore, may be intuitive to the contributors. Furthermore, each contributor has a limited view such that left frame  only displays the portion of the hierarchal model  for which the particular contributor has access. Because Guy is a high-level executive defined as a reviewer for all five regions, he can view the entire hierarchy.","Right frame  and left frame  cooperate in that when a user selects a node in the hierarchy within left frame , right frame displays the details of the selected node and its children. More specifically, right frame  displays tables detailing the selected node and each of its children. Each table shows: a) a node name, b) an operating state for the node, c) a time of last modification to the template, d) whether the budget template has been opened by the owner of the node, e) a name of the owner\/reviewer, f) whether the budget template has been reviewed, and g) actions that the user may take on the node.","At the bottom level in the hierarchy, each node has three workflow states: a) NS\u2014the budget has not been started, b) WIP\u2014the budget is a \u201cwork in progress\u201d such that the owner has input some data but has not finished, and c) LOCKED\u2014the owner has submitted the budget for review.
