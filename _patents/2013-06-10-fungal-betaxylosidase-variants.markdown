There is great interest in using lignocellulosic feedstocks where the plant cellulose is broken down to sugars and subsequently converted to desired end products, such as organic chemical precursors. Lignocellulosic biomass is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed in a saccharification process to sugars that can be subsequently converted to various products via fermentation. The major fermentable sugars obtained from lignocelluloses are glucose and xylose. For economical product yields, a process that can effectively convert all the major sugars present in cellulosic feedstock would be highly desirable.","The present invention provides beta-xylosidase variant enzymes suitable for use in saccharification reactions.

The headings provided herein are not limitations of the various aspects or embodiments of the invention that can be had by reference to the specification as a whole. Accordingly, the terms defined below are more fully defined by reference to the specification as a whole.","As used herein, the terms \u201cisolated\u201d and \u201cpurified\u201d are used to refer to a molecule (e.g., an isolated nucleic acid, polypeptide, etc.) or other component that is removed from at least one other component with which it is naturally associated.","As used herein, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a polymer of deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides in either single- or double-stranded form, and complements thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201ccellulase\u201d refers to any enzyme that is capable of degrading cellulose. Thus, the term encompasses enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cellulose (\u03b2-1,4-glucan or \u03b2-D-glucosidic linkages) to shorter cellulose chains, oligosaccharides, cellobiose and\/or glucose. \u201cCellulases\u201d are divided into three sub-categories of enzymes: 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan glucanohydrolase (\u201cendoglucanase\u201d or \u201cEG\u201d); 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase (\u201cexoglucanase,\u201d \u201ccellobiohydrolase,\u201d or \u201cCBH\u201d); and \u03b2-D-glucoside-glucohydrolase (\u201c\u03b2-glucosidase,\u201d \u201ccellobiase,\u201d \u201cBG,\u201d or \u201cBGL\u201d). These enzymes act in concert to catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulose-containing substrates. Endoglucanases break internal bonds and disrupt the crystalline structure of cellulose, exposing individual cellulose polysaccharide chains (\u201cglucans\u201d). Cellobiohydrolases incrementally shorten the glucan molecules, releasing mainly cellobiose units (a water-soluble \u03b2-1,4-linked dimer of glucose) as well as glucose, cellotriose, and cellotetrose. \u03b2-glucosidases split the cellobiose into glucose monomers.","As used herein, the term \u201cwild-type\u201d refers to naturally-occurring organisms, enzymes and\/or other proteins (e.g., non-recombinant enzymes).","As used herein, the terms \u201cenzyme variant\u201d and \u201cvariant enzyme\u201d are used in reference to enzymes that are similar to a reference enzyme, particularly in their function, but have mutations in their amino acid sequence that make them different in sequence from the wild-type or another reference enzyme. Enzyme variants can be made by a wide variety of different mutagenesis techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In addition, mutagenesis kits are also available from many commercial molecular biology suppliers. Methods are available to make specific substitutions at defined amino acids (site-directed), specific or random mutations in a localized region of the gene (regio-specific) or random mutagenesis over the entire gene (e.g., saturation mutagenesis). Numerous suitable methods are known to those in the art to generate enzyme variants, including but not limited to site-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA using PCR, cassette mutagenesis, gene synthesis, error-prone PCR, shuffling, and chemical saturation mutagenesis, or any other suitable method known in the art. After the variants are produced, they can be screened for the desired property (e.g., high or increased; or low or reduced activity, increased thermal and\/or alkaline stability, etc.). In some embodiments, \u201cvariant xylosidases\u201d (also referred to as \u201cvariant xylosidase enzymes\u201d and \u201cxylosidase variants\u201d) find use. These variants are similar to a reference enzyme (e.g., wild-type xylosidase), particularly in their function, but have mutations in their amino acid sequence that make them different in sequence from the wild-type or another reference (e.g., another variant) xylosidase.","As used herein, \u201ccombinatorial variant\u201d refers to any variant that has a combination of two or more mutations (e.g., substitutions). In some embodiments, the combination of mutations results in changes in enzyme activity (e.g., improved thermostability, improved thermoactivity, improved specific activity, etc.). In some embodiments, combinatorial variant xylosidases find use.","The terms \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cimproved properties,\u201d as used in the context of describing the properties of a beta-xylosidase (e.g., beta-xylosidase variants), refers to a beta-xylosidase polypeptide that exhibits an improvement in a property or properties as compared to another beta-xylosidase and\/or a specified reference polypeptide. Improved properties include, but are not limited to such properties as increased protein expression, increased thermoactivity, increased thermostability, increased pH activity, increased stability (e.g., increased pH stability), increased product specificity, increased specific activity, increased substrate specificity, increased resistance to substrate or end-product inhibition, increased chemical stability, reduced inhibition by glucose, increased resistance to inhibitors (e.g., acetic acid, lectins, tannic acids, and phenolic compounds), and altered pH\/temperature profile.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cimproved thermoactivity\u201d or \u201cincreased thermoactivity\u201d refers to an enzyme displaying an increase, relative to a reference enzyme, in the amount of beta-xylosidase enzymatic activity (e.g., substrate hydrolysis) in a specified time under specified reaction conditions, for example, elevated temperature. Exemplary methods for measuring beta-xylosidase activity are provided in the Examples herein. In addition, cells expressing and secreting the recombinant proteins can be cultured under the same conditions and the beta-xylosidase activity per volume culture medium can be compared.","As used herein, the term \u201cimproved thermostability\u201d or \u201cincreased thermostability\u201d refers to an enzyme displaying an increase in \u201cresidual activity\u201d relative to a reference enzyme. Residual activity is determined by (1) exposing the test enzyme or reference enzyme to stress conditions of elevated temperature, optionally at lowered pH, for a period of time and then determining beta-xylosidase activity; (2) exposing the test enzyme or reference enzyme to unstressed conditions for the same period of time and then determining beta-xylosidase activity; and (3) calculating residual activity as the ratio of activity obtained under stress conditions (1) over the activity obtained under unstressed conditions (2). For example, the beta-xylosidase activity of the enzyme exposed to stress conditions (\u201ca\u201d) is compared to that of a control in which the enzyme is not exposed to the stress conditions (\u201cb\u201d), and residual activity is equal to the ratio a\/b. An enzyme with increased thermostability will have greater residual activity than the reference enzyme. In some embodiments, the enzymes are exposed to stress conditions of 55\u00b0 C. at pH 5.0 for 1 hr, but other cultivation conditions, such as conditions described herein, can be used. Exemplary methods for measuring residual beta-xylosidase activity are provided in the Examples herein.","As used herein, the terms \u201cendoglucanase\u201d and \u201cEG\u201d refer to a category of cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4) that catalyze the hydrolysis of internal \u03b2-1,4 glucosidic bonds of cellulose.","As used herein, \u201cEG1\u201d refers to a carbohydrate active enzyme expressed from a nucleic acid sequence coding for a glycohydrolase (GH) Family 7 catalytic domain classified under EC 3.2.1.4 or any protein, polypeptide or catalytically active fragment thereof.

Due to deletions, insertions, truncations, fusions, and the like that must be taken into account when determining an optimal alignment, the amino acid residue number in a test sequence determined by simply counting from the N-terminus will not necessarily be the same as the number of its corresponding position in the reference sequence. For example, in a case where a test sequence has a deletion relative to an aligned reference sequence, there will be no amino acid in the variant that corresponds to a position in the reference sequence at the site of deletion. Where there is an insertion in an aligned test sequence, that insertion will not correspond to a numbered amino acid position in the reference sequence. In the case of truncations or fusions there can be stretches of amino acids in either the reference or aligned sequence that do not correspond to any amino acid in the corresponding sequence.","As used herein, the terms \u201cnumbered with reference to\u201d or \u201ccorresponding to,\u201d when used in the context of the numbering of a given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence, refers to the numbering of the residues of a specified reference sequence when the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is compared to the reference sequence.

It is intended that the term encompass overexpression of endogenous, as well as heterologous proteins.","As used herein, the term \u201crecombinant\u201d refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that does not naturally occur in a host cell.

Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found in identical form within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all as a result of deliberate human intervention. Thus, \u201crecombinant\u201d or \u201cengineered\u201d or \u201cnon-naturally occurring\u201d when used with reference to a cell, nucleic acid, or polypeptide, refers to a material, or a material corresponding to the natural or native form of the material, that has been modified in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature, or is identical thereto but produced or derived from synthetic materials and\/or by manipulation using recombinant techniques. Non-limiting examples include, among others, recombinant cells expressing genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise expressed at a different level. \u201cRecombination,\u201d \u201crecombining\u201d and generating a \u201crecombined\u201d nucleic acid generally encompass the assembly of at least two nucleic acid fragments.

Nucleic acids hybridize due to a variety of well-characterized physico-chemical forces, such as hydrogen bonding, solvent exclusion, base stacking and the like. As used herein, the term \u201cstringent hybridization wash conditions\u201d in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments, such as Southern and Northern hybridizations, are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, 1993, \u201cLaboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes,\u201d Part I, Chapter 2 (Elsevier, New York), which is incorporated herein by reference. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length, low to very high stringency conditions are defined as follows: prehybridization and hybridization at 42\u00b0 C. in 5\u00d7SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 200 \u03bcg\/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or 50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting procedures.

As noted, in some embodiments the comparison is between the entire length of the two sequences, or, if one sequence is a fragment of the other, the entire length of the shorter of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison and determination of sequence identity can be determined by a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection, as well-known in the art. When optimally aligning sequences and determining sequence identity by visual inspection, percent sequence identity is calculated as the number of residues of the test sequence that are identical to the reference sequence divided by the number of non-gap positions and multiplied by 100. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.","Two sequences are \u201caligned\u201d when they are aligned for similarity scoring using a defined amino acid substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM62), gap existence penalty and gap extension penalty so as to arrive at the highest score possible for that pair of sequences. Amino acid substitution matrices and their use in quantifying the similarity between two sequences are well known in the art (See, e.g., Dayhoff et al., in Dayhoff [ed.], ,\u201d Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, Natl. Biomed. Res. Round., Washington D.C. [1978]; pp. 345-352; and Henikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:10915-10919 [1992], both of which are incorporated herein by reference). The BLOSUM62 matrix is often used as a default scoring substitution matrix in sequence alignment protocols such as Gapped BLAST 2.0. The gap existence penalty is imposed for the introduction of a single amino acid gap in one of the aligned sequences, and the gap extension penalty is imposed for each additional empty amino acid position inserted into an already opened gap. The alignment is defined by the amino acid position of each sequence at which the alignment begins and ends, and optionally by the insertion of a gap or multiple gaps in one or both sequences so as to arrive at the highest possible score. While optimal alignment and scoring can be accomplished manually, the process is facilitated by the use of a computer-implemented alignment algorithm (e.g., gapped BLAST 2.0; See, Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402 [1997], which is incorporated herein by reference), and made available to the public at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Website). Optimal alignments, including multiple alignments can be prepared using readily available programs such as PSI-BLAST (See e.g., Altschul et al., supra).","The present invention also provides a recombinant nucleic acid construct comprising at least one beta-xylosidase variant polynucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide which encodes a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, and\/or 55, wherein the polypeptide is capable of catalyzing the degradation of cellulose.","Two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences that have 100% sequence identity are said to be \u201cidentical.\u201d A nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence are said to have \u201csubstantial sequence identity\u201d to a reference sequence when the sequences have at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99%, or greater sequence identity as determined using the methods described herein, such as BLAST using standard parameters.","As used herein, the term \u201cpre-protein\u201d refers to a protein including an amino-terminal signal peptide (or leader sequence) region attached. The signal peptide is cleaved from the pre-protein by a signal peptidase prior to secretion to result in the \u201cmature\u201d or \u201csecreted\u201d protein.","As used herein, a \u201cvector\u201d is a DNA construct for introducing a DNA sequence into a cell.

An \u201cexpression vector\u201d has a promoter sequence operably linked to the DNA sequence (e.g., transgene) to drive expression in a host cell, and in some embodiments a transcription terminator sequence.","As used herein, the term \u201cexpression\u201d includes any step involved in the production of the polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, and post-translational modification. In some embodiments, the term also encompasses secretion of the polypeptide from a cell.","As used herein, the term \u201cproduces\u201d refers to the production of proteins and\/or other compounds by cells. It is intended that the term encompass any step involved in the production of polypeptides including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, and post-translational modification. In some embodiments, the term also encompasses secretion of the polypeptide from a cell.","As used herein, the term \u201coperably linked\u201d refers to a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the coding sequence of the DNA sequence such that the control sequence influences the expression of a polypeptide.","As used herein, an amino acid or nucleotide sequence (e.g., a promoter sequence, signal peptide, terminator sequence, etc.) is \u201cheterologous\u201d to another sequence with which it is operably linked if the two sequences are not associated in nature.","As used herein, the terms \u201chost cell\u201d and \u201chost strain\u201d refer to suitable hosts for expression vectors comprising DNA provided herein. In some embodiments, the host cells are prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells that have been transformed or transfected with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques as known in the art. Transformed hosts are capable of either replicating vectors encoding at least one protein of interest and\/or expressing the desired protein of interest. In addition, reference to a cell of a particular strain refers to a parental cell of the strain as well as progeny and genetically modified derivatives. Genetically modified derivatives of a parental cell include progeny cells that contain a modified genome or episomal plasmids that confer for example, antibiotic resistance, improved fermentation, etc. In some embodiments, host cells are genetically modified to have characteristics that improve protein secretion, protein stability or other properties desirable for expression and\/or secretion of a protein. For example, knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient. Knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In some embodiments, host cells are modified to delete endogenous cellulase protein-encoding sequences or otherwise eliminate expression of one or more endogenous cellulases. In some embodiments, expression of one or more endogenous cellulases is inhibited to increase production of cellulases of interest. Genetic modification can be achieved by any suitable genetic engineering techniques and\/or classical microbiological techniques (e.g., chemical or UV mutagenesis and subsequent selection). Using recombinant technology, nucleic acid molecules can be introduced, deleted, inhibited or modified, in a manner that results in increased yields of beta-xylosidase variant(s) within the organism or in the culture. For example, knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient. Knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In some genetic engineering approaches, homologous recombination is used to induce targeted gene modifications by specifically targeting a gene in vivo to suppress expression of the encoded protein. In an alternative approach, siRNA, antisense, and\/or ribozyme technology finds use in inhibiting gene expression.","As used herein, the term \u201cintroduced\u201d used in the context of inserting a nucleic acid sequence into a cell, means transformation, transduction, conjugation, transfection, and\/or any other suitable method(s) known in the art for inserting nucleic acid sequences into host cells.

Residual activity is determined by (1) exposing the test enzyme or reference enzyme to stress conditions of elevated temperature, optionally at lowered pH, for a period of time and then determining beta-xylosidase activity; (2) exposing the test enzyme or reference enzyme to unstressed conditions for the same period of time and then determining beta-xylosidase activity; and (3) calculating residual activity as the ratio of activity obtained under stress conditions (1) over the activity obtained under unstressed conditions (2). For example, the beta-xylosidase activity of the enzyme exposed to stress conditions (\u201ca\u201d) is compared to that of a control in which the enzyme is not exposed to the stress conditions (\u201cb\u201d), and residual activity is equal to the ratio a\/b. A test enzyme with increased thermostability will have greater residual activity than the reference enzyme. In some embodiments, the enzymes are exposed to stress conditions of 55\u00b0 C. at pH 5.0 for 1 hr, but other cultivation conditions can be used.","As used herein, the term \u201cculturing\u201d refers to growing a population of microbial cells under suitable conditions in a liquid or solid medium.","As used herein, the term \u201csaccharification\u201d refers to the process in which substrates (e.g., cellulosic biomass) are broken down via the action of cellulases to produce fermentable sugars (e.g. monosaccharides such as but not limited to glucose).","As used herein, the term \u201cfermentable sugars\u201d refers to simple sugars (e.g., monosaccharides, disaccharides and short oligosaccharides), including but not limited to glucose, xylose, galactose, arabinose, mannose and sucrose. Indeed, a fermentable sugar is any sugar that a microorganism can utilize or ferment.","As used herein the term \u201csoluble sugars\u201d refers to water-soluble hexose monomers and oligomers of up to about six monomer units.","As used herein, the term \u201cfermentation\u201d is used broadly to refer to the cultivation of a microorganism or a culture of microorganisms that use simple sugars, such as fermentable sugars, as an energy source to obtain a desired product.","As used herein, the term \u201cfeedstock\u201d refers to any material that is suitable for use in production of an end product. It is intended that the term encompass any material suitable for use in saccharification reactions. In some embodiments, the term encompasses material obtained from nature that is in an unprocessed or minimally processed state, although it is not intended that the term be limited to these embodiments. In some embodiments, the term encompasses biomass and biomass substrates comprising any suitable compositions for use in production of fermentable sugars. In some embodiments, the feedstock is \u201cpre-treated\u201d before and\/or while it is being used as a substrate in a saccharification reaction.","The terms \u201cbiomass,\u201d and \u201cbiomass substrate,\u201d encompass any suitable materials for use in saccharification reactions. The terms encompass, but are not limited to materials that comprise cellulose (i.e., \u201ccellulosic biomass,\u201d \u201ccellulosic feedstock,\u201d and \u201ccellulosic substrate\u201d). Biomass can be derived from plants, animals, or microorganisms, and may include, but is not limited to agricultural, industrial, and forestry residues, industrial and municipal wastes, and terrestrial and aquatic crops grown for energy purposes. Examples of biomass substrates include, but are not limited to, wood, wood pulp, paper pulp, corn fiber, corn grain, corn cobs, crop residues such as corn husks, corn stover, grasses, wheat, wheat straw, barley, barley straw, hay, rice, rice straw, switchgrass, waste paper, paper and pulp processing waste, woody or herbaceous plants, fruit or vegetable pulp, distillers grain, grasses, rice hulls, cotton, hemp, flax, sisal, sugar cane bagasse, sorghum, soy, switchgrass, components obtained from milling of grains, trees, branches, roots, leaves, tops, wood chips, sawdust, shrubs, bushes, seed pods, vegetables, fruits, and flowers and any suitable mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the biomass comprises, but is not limited to cultivated crops (e.g., grasses, including C4 grasses, such as switch grass, cord grass, rye grass, miscanthus, reed canary grass, or any combination thereof), sugar processing residues, for example, but not limited to, bagasse (e.g., sugar cane bagasse, beet pulp [e.g., sugar beet], or a combination thereof), agricultural residues (e.g., soybean stover, corn stover, corn fiber, rice straw, sugar cane straw, rice, rice hulls, barley straw, corn cobs, wheat straw, canola straw, oat straw, oat hulls, corn fiber, hemp, flax, sisal, cotton, tops, stems, leaves, seed pods, fruit pods, or any combination thereof), fruit pulp, vegetable pulp, distillers' grains, forestry biomass (e.g., wood, wood pulp, paper pulp, recycled wood pulp fiber, sawdust, hardwood, such as aspen wood, softwood, or a combination thereof). Furthermore, in some embodiments, the biomass comprises cellulosic waste material and\/or forestry waste materials, including but not limited to, paper and pulp processing waste, municipal paper waste, newsprint, cardboard and the like. In some embodiments, biomass comprises one species of fiber, while in some alternative embodiments, the biomass comprises a mixture of fibers that originate from different biomasses. In some embodiments, the biomass may also comprise transgenic plants that express ligninase and\/or cellulase enzymes (See e.g., US 2008\/0104724 A1).","A biomass substrate is said to be \u201cpretreated\u201d when it has been processed by some physical and\/or chemical means to facilitate saccharification. As described further herein, in some embodiments, the biomass substrate is \u201cpretreated,\u201d or treated using methods known in the art, such as chemical pretreatment (e.g., ammonia pretreatment, dilute acid pretreatment, dilute alkali pretreatment, or solvent exposure), physical pretreatment (e.g., steam explosion or irradiation), mechanical pretreatment (e.g., grinding or milling) and biological pretreatment (e.g., application of lignin-solubilizing microorganisms) and combinations thereof, to increase the susceptibility of cellulose to hydrolysis. Thus, the term \u201cbiomass\u201d encompasses any living or dead biological material that contains a polysaccharide substrate, including but not limited to cellulose, starch, other forms of long-chain carbohydrate polymers, and mixtures of such sources. It may or may not be assembled entirely or primarily from glucose or xylose, and may optionally also contain various other pentose or hexose monomers. Xylose is an aldopentose containing five carbon atoms and an aldehyde group. It is the precursor to hemicellulose, and is often a main constituent of biomass. In some embodiments, the substrate is slurried prior to pretreatment. In some embodiments, the consistency of the slurry is between about 2% and about 30% and more typically between about 4% and about 15%. In some embodiments, the slurry is subjected to a water and\/or acid soaking operation prior to pretreatment. In some embodiments, the slurry is dewatered using any suitable method to reduce steam and chemical usage prior to pretreatment. Examples of dewatering devices include, but are not limited to pressurized screw presses (See e.g., WO 2010\/022511, incorporated herein by reference) pressurized filters and extruders.","In some embodiments, the pretreatment is carried out to hydrolyze hemicellulose, and\/or a portion thereof present in the cellulosic substrate to monomeric pentose and hexose sugars (e.g., xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and\/or any combination thereof). In some embodiments, the pretreatment is carried out so that nearly complete hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and a small amount of conversion of cellulose to glucose occurs. In some embodiments, an acid concentration in the aqueous slurry from about 0.02% (w\/w) to about 2% (w\/w), or any amount therebetween, is typically used for the treatment of the cellulosic substrate. Any suitable acid finds use in these methods, including but not limited to, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and\/or sulfuric acid. In some embodiments, the acid used during pretreatment is sulfuric acid. Steam explosion is one method of performing acid pretreatment of biomass substrates (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,461,648). Another method of pretreating the slurry involves continuous pretreatment (i.e., the cellulosic biomass is pumped though a reactor continuously). This methods are well-known to those skilled in the art (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,457).","In some embodiments, alkali is used in the pretreatment. In contrast to acid pretreatment, pretreatment with alkali may not hydrolyze the hemicellulose component of the biomass. Rather, the alkali reacts with acidic groups present on the hemicellulose to open up the surface of the substrate. In some embodiments, the addition of alkali alters the crystal structure of the cellulose so that it is more amenable to hydrolysis. Examples of alkali that find use in the pretreatment include, but are not limited to ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide. One method of alkali pretreatment is Ammonia Freeze Explosion, Ammonia Fiber Explosion or Ammonia Fiber Expansion (\u201cAFEX\u201d process; See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,171,592; 5,037,663; 4,600,590; 6,106,888; 4,356,196; 5,939,544; 6,176,176; 5,037,663 and 5,171,592). During this process, the cellulosic substrate is contacted with ammonia or ammonium hydroxide in a pressure vessel for a sufficient time to enable the ammonia or ammonium hydroxide to alter the crystal structure of the cellulose fibers. The pressure is then rapidly reduced, which allows the ammonia to flash or boil and explode the cellulose fiber structure. In some embodiments, the flashed ammonia is then recovered using methods known in the art. In some alternative methods, dilute ammonia pretreatment is utilized. The dilute ammonia pretreatment method utilizes more dilute solutions of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide than AFEX (See e.g., WO2009\/045651 and US 2007\/0031953). This pretreatment process may or may not produce any monosaccharides.","An additional pretreatment process for use in the present invention includes chemical treatment of the cellulosic substrate with organic solvents, in methods such as those utilizing organic liquids in pretreatment systems (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,556,430; incorporated herein by reference). These methods have the advantage that the low boiling point liquids easily can be recovered and reused. Other pretreatments, such as the Organosolv\u2122 process, also use organic liquids (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,465,791, which is also incorporated herein by reference). Subjecting the substrate to pressurized water may also be a suitable pretreatment method (See e.g., Weil et al. (1997) Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol., 68(1-2): 21-40 [1997], which is incorporated herein by reference). In some embodiments, the pretreated cellulosic biomass is processed after pretreatment by any of several steps, such as dilution with water, washing with water, buffering, filtration, or centrifugation, or any combination of these processes, prior to enzymatic hydrolysis, as is familiar to those skilled in the art. The pretreatment produces a pretreated feedstock composition (e.g., a \u201cpretreated feedstock slurry\u201d) that contains a soluble component including the sugars resulting from hydrolysis of the hemicellulose, optionally acetic acid and other inhibitors, and solids including unhydrolyzed feedstock and lignin. In some embodiments, the soluble components of the pretreated feedstock composition are separated from the solids to produce a soluble fraction. In some embodiments, the soluble fraction, including the sugars released during pretreatment and other soluble components (e.g., inhibitors), is then sent to fermentation. However, in some embodiments in which the hemicellulose is not effectively hydrolyzed during the pretreatment one or more additional steps are included (e.g., a further hydrolysis step(s) and\/or enzymatic treatment step(s) and\/or further alkali and\/or acid treatment) to produce fermentable sugars. In some embodiments, the separation is carried out by washing the pretreated feedstock composition with an aqueous solution to produce a wash stream and a solids stream comprising the unhydrolyzed, pretreated feedstock. Alternatively, the soluble component is separated from the solids by subjecting the pretreated feedstock composition to a solids-liquid separation, using any suitable method (e.g., centrifugation, microfiltration, plate and frame filtration, cross-flow filtration, pressure filtration, vacuum filtration, etc.). Optionally, in some embodiments, a washing step is incorporated into the solids-liquids separation. In some embodiments, the separated solids containing cellulose, then undergo enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzymes in order to convert the cellulose to glucose. In some embodiments, the pretreated feedstock composition is fed into the fermentation process without separation of the solids contained therein. In some embodiments, the unhydrolyzed solids are subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzymes to convert the cellulose to glucose after the fermentation process. In some embodiments, the pretreated cellulosic feedstock is subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzymes.","As used herein, the term \u201clignocellulosic biomass\u201d refers to any plant biomass comprising cellulose and hemicellulose, bound to lignin. In some embodiments, the biomass may optionally be pretreated to increase the susceptibility of cellulose to hydrolysis by chemical, physical and biological pretreatments (such as steam explosion, pulping, grinding, acid hydrolysis, solvent exposure, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). Various lignocellulosic feedstocks find use, including those that comprise fresh lignocellulosic feedstock, partially dried lignocellulosic feedstock, fully dried lignocellulosic feedstock, and\/or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, lignocellulosic feedstocks comprise cellulose in an amount greater than about 20%, more preferably greater than about 30%, more preferably greater than about 40% (w\/w). For example, in some embodiments, the lignocellulosic material comprises from about 20% to about 90% (w\/w) cellulose, or any amount therebetween, although in some embodiments, the lignocellulosic material comprises less than about 19%, less than about 18%, less than about 17%, less than about 16%, less than about 15%, less than about 14%, less than about 13%, less than about 12%, less than about 11%, less than about 10%, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, or less than about 5% cellulose (w\/w). Furthermore, in some embodiments, the lignocellulosic feedstock comprises lignin in an amount greater than about 10%, more typically in an amount greater than about 15% (w\/w). In some embodiments, the lignocellulosic feedstock comprises small amounts of sucrose, fructose and\/or starch. The lignocellulosic feedstock is generally first subjected to size reduction by methods including, but not limited to, milling, grinding, agitation, shredding, compression\/expansion, or other types of mechanical action. Size reduction by mechanical action can be performed by any type of equipment adapted for the purpose, for example, but not limited to, hammer mills, tub-grinders, roll presses, refiners and hydrapulpers. In some embodiments, at least 90% by weight of the particles produced from the size reduction have lengths less than between about 1\/16 and about 4 in (the measurement may be a volume or a weight average length). In some embodiments, the equipment used to reduce the particle size reduction is a hammer mill or shredder. Subsequent to size reduction, the feedstock is typically slurried in water, as this facilitates pumping of the feedstock. In some embodiments, lignocellulosic feedstocks of particle size less than about 6 inches do not require size reduction.","As used herein, the term \u201clignocellulosic feedstock\u201d refers to any type of lignocellulosic biomass that is suitable for use as feedstock in saccharification reactions.","As used herein, the term \u201cpretreated lignocellulosic feedstock,\u201d refers to lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been subjected to physical and\/or chemical processes to make the fiber more accessible and\/or receptive to the actions of cellulolytic enzymes, as described above.","As used herein, the term \u201crecovered\u201d refers to the harvesting, isolating, collecting, or recovering of protein from a cell and\/or culture medium. In the context of saccharification, it is used in reference to the harvesting of fermentable sugars produced during the saccharification reaction from the culture medium and\/or cells. In the context of fermentation, it is used in reference to harvesting the fermentation product from the culture medium and\/or cells. Thus, a process can be said to comprise \u201crecovering\u201d a product of a reaction (such as a soluble sugar recovered from saccharification) if the process includes separating the product from other components of a reaction mixture subsequent to at least some of the product being generated in the reaction.","As used herein, the term \u201cslurry\u201d refers to an aqueous solution in which are dispersed one or more solid components, such as a cellulosic substrate.","As used herein, \u201cincreasing\u201d the yield of a product (such as a fermentable sugar) from a reaction occurs when a particular component of interest is present during the reaction (e.g., beta-xylosidase) causes more product to be produced, compared with a reaction conducted under the same conditions with the same substrate and other substituents, but in the absence of the component of interest (e.g., without beta-xylosidase).","As used herein, a reaction is said to be \u201csubstantially free\u201d of a particular enzyme if the amount of that enzyme compared with other enzymes that participate in catalyzing the reaction is less than about 2%, about 1%, or about 0.1% (wt\/wt).","As used herein, \u201cfractionating\u201d a liquid (e.g., a culture broth) means applying a separation process (e.g., salt precipitation, column chromatography, size exclusion, and filtration) or a combination of such processes to provide a solution in which a desired protein (such as beta-xylosidase, a cellulase enzyme, and\/or a combination thereof) comprises a greater percentage of total protein in the solution than in the initial liquid product.","As used herein, the term \u201cenzymatic hydrolysis\u201d, refers to a process comprising at least one cellulases and at least one glycosidase enzyme and\/or a mixture glycosidases that act on polysaccharides, (e.g., cellulose), to convert all or a portion thereof to fermentable sugars. \u201cHydrolyzing\u201d cellulose or other polysaccharide occurs when at least some of the glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharides present in the substrate are hydrolyzed, thereby detaching from each other the two monomers that were previously bonded.","It is intended that the enzymatic hydrolysis be carried out with any suitable type of cellulase enzymes capable of hydrolyzing the cellulose to glucose, regardless of their source, including those obtained from fungi, such as spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., , and , as well as those obtained from bacteria of the genera and . Cellulase compositions typically comprise one or more cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase enzymes. In some cases, the cellulase compositions additionally contain hemicellulases, esterases, swollenins, cips, etc. Many of these enzymes are readily commercially available.","In some embodiments, the enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out at a pH and temperature that is at or near the optimum for the cellulase enzymes being used. For example, the enzymatic hydrolysis may be carried out at about 30\u00b0 C. to about 75\u00b0 C., or any suitable temperature therebetween, for example a temperature of about 30\u00b0 C., about 35\u00b0 C., about 40\u00b0 C., about 45\u00b0 C., about 50\u00b0 C., about 55\u00b0 C., about 60\u00b0 C., about 65\u00b0 C., about 70\u00b0 C., about 75\u00b0 C., or any temperature therebetween, and a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.5, or any pH therebetween (e.g., about 3.5, about 4.0, about 4.5, about 5.0, about 5.5, about 6.0, about 6.5, about 7.0, about 7.5, or any suitable pH therebetween). In some embodiments, the initial concentration of cellulose, prior to the start of enzymatic hydrolysis, is preferably about 0.1% (w\/w) to about 20% (w\/w), or any suitable amount therebetween (e.g., about 0.1%, about 0.5%, about 1%, about 2%, about 4%, about 6%, about 8%, about 10%, about 12%, about 14%, about 15%, about 18%, about 20%, or any suitable amount therebetween.) In some embodiments, the combined dosage of all cellulase enzymes is about 0.001 to about 100 mg protein per gram cellulose, or any suitable amount therebetween (e.g., about 0.001, about 0.01, about 0.1, about 1, about 5, about 10, about 15, about 20, about 25, about 30, about 40, about 50, about 60, about 70, about 80, about 90, about 100 mg protein per gram cellulose or any amount therebetween. The enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out for any suitable time period. In some embodiments, the enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out for a time period of about 0.5 hours to about 200 hours, or any time therebetween (e.g., about 2 hours to about 100 hours, or any suitable time therebetween). For example, in some embodiments, it is carried out for about 0.5, about 1, about 2, about 5, about 7, about 10, about 12, about 14, about 15, about 20, about 25, about 30, about 35, about 40, about 45, about 50, about 55, about 60, about 65, about 70, about 75, about 80, about 85, about 90, about 95, about 100, about 120, about 140, about 160, about 180, about 200, or any suitable time therebetween.)","In some embodiments, the enzymatic hydrolysis is batch hydrolysis, continuous hydrolysis, and\/or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the hydrolysis is agitated, unmixed, or a combination thereof. The enzymatic hydrolysis is typically carried out in a hydrolysis reactor. The cellulase enzyme composition is added to the pretreated lignocellulosic substrate prior to, during, or after the addition of the substrate to the hydrolysis reactor. Indeed it is not intended that reaction conditions be limited to those provided herein, as modifications are well-within the knowledge of those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, following cellulose hydrolysis, any insoluble solids present in the resulting lignocellulosic hydrolysate, including but not limited to lignin, are removed using conventional solid-liquid separation techniques prior to any further processing. In some embodiments, these solids are burned to provide energy for the entire process.","As used herein, the term \u201cby-product\u201d refers to an organic molecule that is an undesired product of a particular process (e.g., saccharification).","The present invention provides beta-xylosidase variant enzymes suitable for use in saccharification reactions. The present application further provides genetically modified fungal organisms that produce beta-xylosidase variants, as well as enzyme mixtures exhibiting enhanced hydrolysis of cellulosic material to fermentable sugars, enzyme mixtures produced by the genetically modified fungal organisms, and methods for producing fermentable sugars from cellulose using such enzyme mixtures.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods and compositions suitable for use in the degradation of cellulose. In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides beta-xylosidase variant enzymes suitable for use in saccharification reactions to hydrolyze cellulose components in biomass feedstock. In some additional embodiments, the beta-xylosidase variant enzymes are used in combination with additional enzymes, including but not limited to EG1a, Eg1b, EG2, EG3, EG5, EG6, cellobiohydrolase(s), GH61 enzymes, etc., in saccharification reactions.","Fungi, bacteria, and other organisms produce a variety of cellulases and other enzymes that act in concert to catalyze decrystallization and hydrolysis of cellulose to yield fermentable sugars. One such fungus is , which is described herein. Cellulases of interest include the variant beta-xylosidase enzymes provided herein. The variant beta-xylosidase sequences provided herein are particularly useful for the production of fermentable sugars from cellulosic biomass. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of generating fermentable sugars from cellulosic biomass, by contacting the biomass with a cellulase composition comprising at least one variant beta-xylosidase described herein under conditions suitable for the production of fermentable sugars","For example, mutagenesis and directed evolution methods can be readily applied to polynucleotides to generate variant libraries that can be expressed, screened, and assayed. Mutagenesis and directed evolution methods are well known in the art (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793, 5,830,721, 6,132,970, 6,420,175, 6,277,638, 6,365,408, 6,602,986, 7,288,375, 6,287,861, 6,297,053, 6,576,467, 6,444,468, 5,811,238, 6,117,679, 6,165,793, 6,180,406, 6,291,242, 6,995,017, 6,395,547, 6,506,602, 6,519,065, 6,506,603, 6,413,774, 6,573,098, 6,323,030, 6,344,356, 6,372,497, 7,868,138, 5,834,252, 5,928,905, 6,489,146, 6,096,548, 6,387,702, 6,391,552, 6,358,742, 6,482,647, 6,335,160, 6,653,072, 6,355,484, 6,03,344, 6,319,713, 6,613,514, 6,455,253, 6,579,678, 6,586,182, 6,406,855, 6,946,296, 7,534,564, 7,776,598, 5,837,458, 6,391,640, 6,309,883, 7,105,297, 7,795,030, 6,326,204, 6,251,674, 6,716,631, 6,528,311, 6,287,862, 6,335,198, 6,352,859, 6,379,964, 7,148,054, 7,629,170, 7,620,500, 6,365,377, 6,358,740, 6,406,910, 6,413,745, 6,436,675, 6,961,664, 7,430,477, 7,873,499, 7,702,464, 7,783,428, 7,747,391, 7,747,393, 7,751,986, 6,376,246, 6,426,224, 6,423,542, 6,479,652, 6,319,714, 6,521,453, 6,368,861, 7,421,347, 7,058,515, 7,024,312, 7,620,502, 7,853,410, 7,957,912, 7,904,249, and all related non-US counterparts; Ling et al., Anal.

Additional methods of xylose or xylobiose quantification include, but are not limited chromatographic methods (e.g., HPLC; See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,090,595 and 7,419,809, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties).","The present invention provides beta-xylosidase variants suitable for use in saccharification reactions. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods and compositions suitable for use in the degradation of cellulose and\/or hemicellulose. In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides variant beta-xylosidase enzymes suitable for use in saccharification reactions to hydrolyze cellulose components in biomass feedstock. In some additional embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidase(s) are used in combination with additional enzymes, including but not limited to at least one EG (e.g., EG b, EG1a, EG2, EG3, EG4, EG5, and\/or EG6), cellobiohydrolase, GH61, and\/or beta-glucosidases, etc., in saccharification reactions.","Fungi, bacteria, and other organisms produce a variety of cellulases and other enzymes that act in concert to catalyze decrystallization and hydrolysis of cellulose to yield fermentable sugars. One such fungus is , which is described herein. The variant beta-xylosidase sequences provided herein are particularly useful for the production of fermentable sugars from cellulosic biomass and other feedstocks. In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides methods for generating fermentable sugars from biomass, involving contacting the biomass with a cellulase composition comprising at least one beta-xylosidase variant as described herein, under conditions suitable for the production of fermentable sugars.","In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidases of the present invention further comprise additional sequences which do not alter the encoded activity of the enzyme. For example, in some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidases are linked to an epitope tag or to another sequence useful in purification.","In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidase polypeptides of the present invention are secreted from the host cell in which they are expressed (e.g., a yeast or filamentous fungal host cell) and are expressed as a pre-protein including a signal peptide (i.e., an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and which directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell secretory pathway). In some embodiments, the signal peptide is an endogenous beta-xylosidase signal peptide. In some other embodiments, signal peptides from other secreted proteins are used. In some embodiments, other signal peptides find use, depending on the host cell and other factors. Effective signal peptide coding regions for filamentous fungal host cells include, but are not limited to, the signal peptide coding regions obtained from TAKA amylase, neutral amylase, glucoamylase, aspartic proteinase, cellulase, lipase, and cellobiohydrolase II. Signal peptide coding regions for bacterial host cells include, but are not limited to the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for NCIB 11837 maltogenic amylase, alpha-amylase, \u03b2-lactamase, neutral proteases (nprT, nprS, nprM), and prsA. In some additional embodiments, other signal peptides find use in the present invention (See e.g., Simonen and Palva, Microbiol. Rev., 57: 109-137 [1993], incorporated herein by reference). Additional useful signal peptides for yeast host cells include those from the genes for alpha-factor, SUC2 invertase (See e.g., Taussig and Carlson, Nucl. Acids Res., 11:1943-54 [1983]; SwissProt Accession No. P00724; and Romanos et al., Yeast 8:423-488 [1992]). In some embodiments, variants of these signal peptides and other signal peptides find use. Indeed, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any specific signal peptide, as any suitable signal peptide known in the art finds use in the present invention.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides polynucleotides encoding variant beta-xylosidase polypeptides, and\/or biologically active fragments thereof, as described herein. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is operably linked to one or more heterologous regulatory or control sequences that control gene expression to create a recombinant polynucleotide capable of expressing the polypeptide. In some embodiments, expression constructs containing a heterologous polynucleotide encoding a variant beta-xylosidase is introduced into appropriate host cells to express the variant beta-xylosidase.","Those of ordinary skill in the art understand that due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, a multitude of nucleotide sequences encoding variant beta-xylosidase polypeptides of the present invention exist. For example, the codons AGA, AGG, CGA, CGC, CGG, and CGU all encode the amino acid arginine. Thus, at every position in the nucleic acids of the invention where an arginine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described above without altering the encoded polypeptide. It is understood that \u201cU\u201d in an RNA sequence corresponds to \u201cT\u201d in a DNA sequence. The invention contemplates and provides each and every possible variation of nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention that could be made by selecting combinations based on possible codon choices.","A DNA sequence may also be designed for high codon usage bias codons (codons that are used at higher frequency in the protein coding regions than other codons that code for the same amino acid). The preferred codons may be determined in relation to codon usage in a single gene, a set of genes of common function or origin, highly expressed genes, the codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of the whole organism, codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of related organisms, or combinations thereof. A codon whose frequency increases with the level of gene expression is typically an optimal codon for expression. In particular, a DNA sequence can be optimized for expression in a particular host organism. A variety of methods are well-known in the art for determining the codon frequency (e.g., codon usage, relative synonymous codon usage) and codon preference in specific organisms, including multivariate analysis (e.g., using cluster analysis or correspondence analysis,) and the effective number of codons used in a gene. The data source for obtaining codon usage may rely on any available nucleotide sequence capable of coding for a protein. These data sets include nucleic acid sequences actually known to encode expressed proteins (e.g., complete protein coding sequences-CDS), expressed sequence tags (ESTs), or predicted coding regions of genomic sequences, as is well-known in the art. Polynucleotides encoding variant beta-xylosidases can be prepared using any suitable methods known in the art. Typically, oligonucleotides are individually synthesized, then joined (e.g., by enzymatic or chemical ligation methods, or polymerase-mediated methods) to form essentially any desired continuous sequence. In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the present invention are prepared by chemical synthesis using, any suitable methods known in the art, including but not limited to automated synthetic methods. For example, in the phosphoramidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized (e.g., in an automatic DNA synthesizer), purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in appropriate vectors. In some embodiments, double stranded DNA fragments are then obtained either by synthesizing the complementary strand and annealing the strands together under appropriate conditions, or by adding the complementary strand using DNA polymerase with an appropriate primer sequence. There are numerous general and standard texts that provide methods useful in the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art.","The present invention also provides recombinant constructs comprising a sequence encoding at least one variant beta-xylosidase, as provided herein. In some embodiments, the present invention provides an expression vector comprising a variant beta-xylosidase polynucleotide operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In some embodiments, expression vectors of the present invention are used to transform appropriate host cells to permit the host cells to express the variant beta-xylosidase protein. Methods for recombinant expression of proteins in fungi and other organisms are well known in the art, and a number expression vectors are available or can be constructed using routine methods. In some embodiments, nucleic acid constructs of the present invention comprise a vector, such as, a plasmid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), and the like, into which a nucleic acid sequence of the invention has been inserted. In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the present invention are incorporated into any one of a variety of expression vectors suitable for expressing variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide(s). Suitable vectors include, but are not limited to chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences (e.g., derivatives of SV40), as well as bacterial plasmids, phage DNA, baculovirus, yeast plasmids, vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA, viral DNA such as vaccinia, adenovirus, fowl pox virus, pseudorabies, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retroviruses, and many others. Any suitable vector that transduces genetic material into a cell, and, if replication is desired, which is replicable and viable in the relevant host finds use in the present invention. In some embodiments, the construct further comprises regulatory sequences, including but not limited to a promoter, operably linked to the protein encoding sequence. Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art. Indeed, in some embodiments, in order to obtain high levels of expression in a particular host it is often useful to express the variant beta-xylosidases of the present invention under the control of a heterologous promoter. In some embodiments, a promoter sequence is operably linked to the 5\u2032 region of the variant beta-xylosidase coding sequence using any suitable method known in the art. Examples of useful promoters for expression of variant beta-xylosidases include, but are not limited to promoters from fungi. In some embodiments, a promoter sequence that drives expression of a gene other than a beta-xylosidase gene in a fungal strain finds use. As a non-limiting example, a fungal promoter from a gene encoding an endoglucanase may be used. In some embodiments, a promoter sequence that drives the expression of a beta-xylosidase gene in a fungal strain other than the fungal strain from which the beta-xylosidases were derived finds use. Examples of other suitable promoters useful for directing the transcription of the nucleotide constructs of the present invention in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to promoters obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase, aspartic proteinase, neutral alpha-amylase, acid stable alpha-amylase, or glucoamylase (glaA), lipase, alkaline protease, triose phosphate isomerase, acetamidase, and trypsin-like protease (See e.g., WO 96\/00787, incorporated herein by reference), as well as the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for neutral alpha-amylase and triose phosphate isomerase), promoters such as cbh1, cbh2, egl1, egl2, pepA, hJb1, hfb2, xyn1, amy, and glaA (See e.g., Nunberg et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 4:2306-2315 [1984]; Boel et al., EMBO J. 3:1581-85 [1984]; and European Patent Appln. 137280, all of which are incorporated herein by reference), and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof. In a yeast host, useful promoters include, but are not limited to those from the genes for enolase (eno-1), galactokinase (gal1), alcohol dehydrogenase\/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2\/GAP), and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Additional useful promoters useful for yeast host cells are known in the art (See e.g., Romanos et al., Yeast 8:423-488 [1992], incorporated herein by reference). In addition, promoters associated with chitinase production in fungi find use in the present invention (See e.g., Blaiseau and Lafay, Gene 120243-248 [1992]; and Limon et al., Curr. Genet, 28:478-83 [1995], both of which are incorporated herein by reference).","In some embodiments, cloned variant beta-xylosidases of the present invention also have a suitable transcription terminator sequence, a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3\u2032 terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell of choice finds use in the present invention. Exemplary transcription terminators for filamentous fungal host cells include, but are not limited to those obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase, anthranilate synthase, alpha-glucosidase, and trypsin-like protease (See also, U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,627, incorporated herein by reference). In some embodiments, exemplary terminators for yeast host cells include those obtained from the genes for enolase, cytochrome C (CYCl), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are well-known to those skilled in the art (See e.g., Romanos et al., Yeast 8:423-88 [1992]).","In some embodiments, a suitable leader sequence is part of a cloned variant beta-xylosidase sequence, which is a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5\u2032 terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice finds use in the present invention. Exemplary leaders for filamentous fungal host cells include, but are not limited to those obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase and triose phosphate isomerase. Suitable leaders for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to those obtained from the genes for enolase (ENO-1), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, alpha-factor, and alcohol dehydrogenase\/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2\/GAP).","In some embodiments, the sequences of the present invention also comprise a polyadenylation sequence, which is a sequence operably linked to the 3\u2032 terminus of the nucleic acid sequence and which, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence which is functional in the host cell of choice finds use in the present invention. Exemplary polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells include, but are not limited to those obtained from the genes for TAKA amylase, glucoamylase, anthranilate synthase, trypsin-like protease, and alpha-glucosidase.

Additional markers useful in host cells such as , include but are not limited to the amdS and pyrG genes of or and the bar gene of . Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3.","In some embodiments, a vector comprising a sequence encoding at least one variant beta-xylosidase is transformed into a host cell in order to allow propagation of the vector and expression of the variant beta-xylosidase(s). In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidases are post-translationally modified to remove the signal peptide and in some cases may be cleaved after secretion. In some embodiments, the transformed host cell described above is cultured in a suitable nutrient medium under conditions permitting the expression of the variant beta-xylosidase(s). Any suitable medium useful for culturing the host cells finds use in the present invention, including, but not limited to minimal or complex media containing appropriate supplements.

For example, knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient. Knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In some embodiments, the host cells are modified to delete endogenous cellulase protein-encoding sequences or otherwise eliminate expression of one or more endogenous cellulases. In some embodiments, expression of one or more endogenous cellulases is inhibited to increase production of cellulases of interest. Genetic modification can be achieved by genetic engineering techniques and\/or classical microbiological techniques (e.g., chemical or UV mutagenesis and subsequent selection). Indeed, in some embodiments, combinations of recombinant modification and classical selection techniques are used to produce the host cells. Using recombinant technology, nucleic acid molecules can be introduced, deleted, inhibited or modified, in a manner that results in increased yields of beta-xylosidase variant(s) within the host cell and\/or in the culture medium. For example, knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient, and knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In one genetic engineering approach, homologous recombination is used to induce targeted gene modifications by specifically targeting a gene in vivo to suppress expression of the encoded protein. In alternative approaches, siRNA, antisense and\/or ribozyme technology find use in inhibiting gene expression.","In some embodiments, host cells (e.g., ) used for expression of variant beta-xylosidases have been genetically modified to reduce the amount of endogenous cellobiose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.3.4) and\/or other enzymes activity that is secreted by the cell. A variety of methods are known in the art for reducing expression of protein in cells, including, but not limited to deletion of all or part of the gene encoding the protein and site-specific mutagenesis to disrupt expression or activity of the gene product. (See e.g., Chaveroche et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 28:22 e97 [2000]; Cho et al., 19: 1:7-15 [2006]; Maruyama and Kitamoto, Biotechnol Lett., 30:1811-1817 [2008]; Takahashi et al., 272: 344-352 [2004]; and You et al., Arch Micriobiol., 191:615-622 [2009], all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Random mutagenesis, followed by screening for desired mutations also finds use (See e.g., Combier et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett 220:141-8 [2003]; and Firon et al., Eukary. Cell 2:247-55 [2003], both of which are incorporated by reference). In some embodiments, the host cell is modified to reduce production of endogenous cellobiose dehydrogenases. In some embodiments, the cell is modified to reduce production of cellobiose dehydrogenase (e.g., CDH1 or CDH2). In some embodiments, the host cell has less than 75%, sometimes less than 50%, sometimes less than 30%, sometimes less than 25%, sometimes less than 20%, sometimes less than 15%, sometimes less than 10%, sometimes less than 5%, and sometimes less than 1% of the cellobiose dehydrogenase (e.g., CDH1 and\/or CDH2) activity of the corresponding cell in which the gene is not disrupted. Exemplary cellobiose dehydrogenases include, but are not limited to CDH1 and CDH2. The genomic sequence for the Cdh1 encoding CDH1 has accession number AF074951.1. In one approach, gene disruption is achieved using genomic flanking markers (See e.g., Rothstein, Meth. Enzymol., 101:202-11 [1983]). In some embodiments, site-directed mutagenesis is used to target a particular domain of a protein, in some cases, to reduce enzymatic activity (e.g., glucose-methanol-choline oxido-reductase N and C domains of a cellobiose dehydrogenase or heme binding domain of a cellobiose dehydrogenase; See e.g., Rotsaert et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 390:206-14 [2001], which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","Introduction of a vector or DNA construct into a host cell can be accomplished using any suitable method known in the art, including but not limited to calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, PEG-mediated transformation, electroporation, or other common techniques known in the art.","In some embodiments, the engineered host cells (i.e., \u201crecombinant host cells\u201d) of the present invention are cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the cellobiohydrolase polynucleotide. Culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and are well-known to those skilled in the art. As noted, many standard references and texts are available for the culture and production of many cells, including cells of bacterial, plant, animal (especially mammalian) and archebacterial origin.","In some embodiments, cells expressing the variant beta-xylosidase polypeptides of the invention are grown under batch or continuous fermentations conditions. Classical \u201cbatch fermentation\u201d is a closed system, wherein the compositions of the medium is set at the beginning of the fermentation and is not subject to artificial alternations during the fermentation. A variation of the batch system is a \u201cfed-batch fermentation\u201d which also finds use in the present invention. In this variation, the substrate is added in increments as the fermentation progresses. Fed-batch systems are useful when catabolite repression is likely to inhibit the metabolism of the cells and where it is desirable to have limited amounts of substrate in the medium. Batch and fed-batch fermentations are common and well known in the art. \u201cContinuous fermentation\u201d is an open system where a defined fermentation medium is added continuously to a bioreactor and an equal amount of conditioned medium is removed simultaneously for processing. Continuous fermentation generally maintains the cultures at a constant high density where cells are primarily in log phase growth. Continuous fermentation systems strive to maintain steady state growth conditions. Methods for modulating nutrients and growth factors for continuous fermentation processes as well as techniques for maximizing the rate of product formation are well known in the art of industrial microbiology.","In some embodiments of the present invention, cell-free transcription\/translation systems find use in producing variant beta-xylosidase(s). Several systems are commercially available and the methods are well-known to those skilled in the art.","The present invention provides methods of making variant beta-xylosidase polypeptides or biologically active fragments thereof.

The present invention further provides methods of making a variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide comprising cultivating a host cell transformed with a variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide under conditions suitable for the production of the variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide and recovering the variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide. Typically, recovery or isolation of the beta-xylosidase polypeptide is from the host cell culture medium, the host cell or both, using protein recovery techniques that are well known in the art, including those described herein. In some embodiments, host cells are harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification. Microbial cells employed in expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method, including, but not limited to freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, and\/or use of cell lysing agents, as well as many other suitable methods well known to those skilled in the art.","In some embodiments, the resulting polypeptide is recovered\/isolated and optionally purified by any of a number of methods known in the art. For example, in some embodiments, the polypeptide is isolated from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic interaction, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), or precipitation. In some embodiments, protein refolding steps are used, as desired, in completing the configuration of the mature protein. In addition, in some embodiments, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is employed in the final purification steps.

Biotechnol., 73:1331 [2007], both incorporated herein by reference). Indeed, any suitable purification methods known in the art find use in the present invention.","In some embodiments, immunological methods are used to purify beta-xylosidase variants. In one approach, antibody raised against a variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide (e.g., against a polypeptide comprising any of SEQ ID NOS:2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, and\/or 55, and\/or an immunogenic fragment thereof) using conventional methods is immobilized on beads, mixed with cell culture media under conditions in which the variant beta-xylosidase is bound, and precipitated. In a related approach, immunochromatography finds use.","In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidases are expressed as a fusion protein including a non-enzyme portion. In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidase sequence is fused to a purification facilitating domain. As used herein, the term \u201cpurification facilitating domain\u201d refers to a domain that mediates purification of the polypeptide to which it is fused. Suitable purification domains include, but are not limited to metal chelating peptides, histidine-tryptophan modules that allow purification on immobilized metals, a sequence which binds glutathione (e.g., GST), a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (corresponding to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein; See e.g., Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 [1984]), maltose binding protein sequences, the FLAG epitope utilized in the FLAGS extension\/affinity purification system (e.g., the system available from Immunex Corp, Seattle, Wash.), and the like. One expression vector contemplated for use in the compositions and methods described herein provides for expression of a fusion protein comprising a polypeptide of the invention fused to a polyhistidine region separated by an enterokinase cleavage site. The histidine residues facilitate purification on IMIAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography; See e.g., Porath et al., Prot. Exp. Purif., 3:263-281 [1992]) while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a means for separating the variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide from the fusion protein. pGEX vectors (Promega; Madison, Wis.) may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to ligand-agarose beads (e.g., glutathione-agarose in the case of GST-fusions) followed by elution in the presence of free ligand.","The variant beta-xylosidases and biologically active fragments thereof as described herein have multiple industrial applications, including but not limited to, sugar production (e.g., glucose syrups), biofuels production, textile treatment, pulp or paper treatment, bio-based chemical production, and applications in detergents and\/or animal feed. A host cell containing at least one variant beta-xylosidase of the present invention finds use without recovery and purification of the recombinant variant beta-xylosidase(s) (e.g., for use in a large scale biofermentor). Alternatively, recombinant variant beta-xylosidases are produced and purified from the host cell.","The variant beta-xylosidases provided herein are particularly useful in methods used to break down cellulose to smaller oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides. In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidases are used in saccharification methods. In some embodiments, the variant beta-xylosidases are used in combination with other cellulase enzymes in conventional enzymatic saccharification methods to produce fermentable sugars. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for producing at least one end-product from a cellulosic substrate, the methods comprising contacting the cellulosic substrate with at least one variant beta-xylosidase as described herein (and optionally other cellulases) under conditions in which fermentable sugars are produced. The fermentable sugars are then used in a fermentation reaction comprising a microorganism (e.g., a yeast) to produce at least one end-product. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise pretreating the cellulosic substrate to increase its susceptibility to hydrolysis prior to contacting the cellulosic substrate with at least one variant beta-xylosidase (and optionally other cellulases).","In some embodiments, enzyme compositions comprising at least one variant beta-xylosidase of the present invention are reacted with a biomass substrate in the range of about 25\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C., about 30\u00b0 C. to about 90\u00b0 C., about 30\u00b0 C. to about 80\u00b0 C., or about 30\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. Also the biomass may be reacted with the enzyme compositions at about 25\u00b0 C., at about 30\u00b0 C., at about 35\u00b0 C., at about 40\u00b0 C., at about 45\u00b0 C., at about 50\u00b0 C., at about 55\u00b0 C., at about 60\u00b0 C., at about 65\u00b0 C., at about 70\u00b0 C., at about 75\u00b0 C., at about 80\u00b0 C., at about 85\u00b0 C., at about 90\u00b0 C., at about 95\u00b0 C. and at about 100\u00b0 C. Generally the pH range will be from about pH 3.0 to about 8.5, about pH 3.5 to about 8.5, about pH 4.0 to about 7.5, about pH 4.0 to about 7.0 and about pH 4.0 to about 6.5. In some embodiments, the incubation time varies (e.g., from about 1.0 to about 240 hours, from about 5.0 to about 180 hrs and from about 10.0 to about 150 hrs). In some embodiments, the incubation time is at least about 1 hr, at least about 5 hrs, at least about 10 hrs, at least about 15 hrs, at least about 25 hrs, at least about 50 hr, at least about 100 hrs, at least about 180 hrs, etc. In some embodiments, incubation of the cellulase under these conditions and subsequent contact with the substrate results in the release of substantial amounts of fermentable sugars from the substrate (e.g., glucose when the cellulase is combined with \u03b2-glucosidase). For example, in some embodiments, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or more fermentable sugar is available as compared to the release of sugar by a reference enzyme.","In some embodiments, an \u201cend-product of fermentation\u201d is any product produced by a process including a fermentation step using a fermenting organism. Examples of end-products of a fermentation include, but are not limited to, alcohols (e.g., fuel alcohols such as ethanol and butanol), organic acids (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid, acrylic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid, and succinic acid), glycerol, ketones, diols, amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid), antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline), vitamins (e.g., beta-carotene and B12), hormones, and fuel molecules other than alcohols (e.g., hydrocarbons).","In some embodiments, the fermentable sugars produced by the methods of the present invention are used to produce at least one alcohol (e.g., ethanol, butanol, etc.). The variant beta-xylosidases of the present invention find use in any method suitable for the generation of alcohols or other biofuels from cellulose.

Two methods commonly employed are separate saccharification and fermentation (SHF) methods (See e.g., Wilke et al., Biotechnol. Bioengin., 6:155-75 [1976]) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) methods (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,990,944 and 3,990,945). In some embodiments, the SHF saccharification method comprises the steps of contacting a cellulase with a cellulose containing substrate to enzymatically break down cellulose into fermentable sugars (e.g., monosaccharides such as glucose), contacting the fermentable sugars with an alcohol-producing microorganism to produce alcohol (e.g., ethanol or butanol) and recovering the alcohol. In some embodiments, the method of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) finds use, in which the cellulase production from the host is simultaneous with saccharification and fermentation either from one host or from a mixed cultivation. In addition, SSF methods find use in the present invention. In some embodiments, SSF methods provide a higher efficiency of alcohol production than that provided by SHF methods (See e.g., Drissen et al., Biocat. Biotrans., 27:27-35 [2009]).","In some embodiments, for cellulosic substances to be effectively used as substrates for the saccharification reaction in the presence of a cellulase of the present invention, it is desirable to pretreat the substrate. Means of pretreating a cellulosic substrate are well-known in the art, including but not limited to chemical pretreatment (e.g., ammonia pretreatment, dilute acid pretreatment, dilute alkali pretreatment, or solvent exposure), physical pretreatment (e.g., steam explosion or irradiation), mechanical pretreatment (e.g., grinding or milling) and biological pretreatment (e.g., application of lignin-solubilizing microorganisms), and the present invention is not limited by such methods.","In some embodiments, any suitable alcohol-producing microorganism known in the art (e.g., ), finds use in the present invention for the fermentation of fermentable sugars to alcohols and other end-products. The fermentable sugars produced from the use of the variant beta-xylosidase(s) provided by the present invention find use in the production of other end-products besides alcohols, including, but not limited to biofuels and\/or biofuels compounds, acetone, amino acids (e.g., glycine, lysine, etc.), organic acids (e.g., lactic acids, etc.), glycerol, ascorbic acid, diols (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, butanediol, etc.), vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, other chemicals, and animal feeds. In addition, the variant beta-xylosidases provided herein further find use in the pulp and paper industry. Indeed, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular end-products.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides an enzyme mixture that comprises at least one variant beta-xylosidase polypeptide as provided herein.

VA is a secondary metabolite produced at the same time as LiP by ligninolytic cultures of and without being bound by theory, has been proposed to function as a physiological redox mediator in the LiP-catalyzed oxidation of lignin in vivo (See e.g., Harvey, et al., FEBS Lett., 195:242-246 [1986]).","In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides at least one variant beta-xylosidase and at least one protease, amylase, glucoamylase, and\/or a lipase that participates in cellulose degradation.","In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides at least one variant beta-xylosidase and at least one expansin or expansin-like protein, such as a swollenin (See e.g., Salheimo et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 269:4202-4211 [2002]) or a swollenin-like protein. Expansins are implicated in loosening of the cell wall structure during plant cell growth. Expansins have been proposed to disrupt hydrogen bonding between cellulose and other cell wall polysaccharides without comprising hydrolytic activity. In this way, they are thought to allow the sliding of cellulose fibers and enlargement of the cell wall. Swollenin, an expansin-like protein contains an N-terminal Carbohydrate Binding Module Family 1 domain (CBD) and a C-terminal expansin-like domain. In some embodiments, an expansin-like protein or swollenin-like protein comprises one or both of such domains and\/or disrupts the structure of cell walls (such as disrupting cellulose structure), optionally without producing detectable amounts of reducing sugars.","In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides at least one variant beta-xylosidase and at least one polypeptide product of a cellulose integrating protein, scaffoldin or a scaffoldin-like protein, for example CipA or CipC from or respectively.
