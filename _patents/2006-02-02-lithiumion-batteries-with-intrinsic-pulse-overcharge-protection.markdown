The Government has certain rights in this invention.","This present invention relates in general to the field of lithium rechargeable batteries, and more particularly relates to the positive electrode design of lithium-ion batteries with improved high-rate pulse overcharge protection.","Currently, many consumer electronics are powered by lithium-ion batteries, the safety of which is a big concern to both the consumers and the manufacturers. A reliable battery must survive several abuse conditions, including overcharge. Overcharge generally occurs when a current is forced through a lithium-ion battery and the charge delivered exceeds the charge-storing capability of the battery. Overcharge of lithium-ion batteries can trigger chemical and electrochemical reactions of battery components, rapid temperature elevation, and can even trigger self-accelerating reactions leading up to, and including, explosion of the battery.","In current lithium-ion battery technology, several overcharge protection mechanisms are typically added to ensure the safety of the batteries during overcharging conditions. For instance, a chemical compound known as a redox shuttle additive may be incorporated into the battery electrolyte to provide intrinsic overcharge protection. Generally, the redox shuttle can be reversibly electrochemically oxidized and reduced at a potential slightly higher than the working potential of the positive electrode of the battery. With the incorporation of a redox shuttle into the electrolyte, lithium-ion batteries can normally operate in a voltage range below the redox potential of the redox shuttle. If the battery is overcharged, the battery voltage will meet the redox potential of the additive first and activate the redox mechanism of the redox shuttle. In general, when the overcharge current is lower than the shuttle capability of the additive, the redox shuttle will be the only active component to transfer the excessive charge through the battery without causing any damage to the battery. Under such mechanisms, the dangerous voltage of the battery is never reached even if the battery is overcharged.","While redox shuttles provide some protection of a lithium-ion battery, no redox shuttle can provide unlimited overcharge protection. The main barrier is the maximum shuttle current the redox shuttle can provide, which determines the maximum overcharge current that a battery with a redox shuttle, can sustain. The maximum shuttle current is physically limited by the solubility of the redox shuttle in non-aqueous electrolytes, the diffusion coefficient of the redox shuttle in the non-aqueous electrolytes, the charge transfer constant of the redox shuttle on the electrode surface, and battery geometry. Generally, redox shuttles described in the literature have very limited solubility in the non-aqueous electrolytes, and can only provide low rate overcharge protection. Once the overcharge current exceeds the maximum shuttle current of the redox shuttle, the battery will be driven to higher voltages that trigger dangerous reactions in the battery.","Recently, lithium-ion batteries have been proposed as the power source for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). During braking of a HEV, the excessive energy from the engine is stored in the lithium-ion battery. A high-rate pulse current, which can be up to a 10 C rate, will be forced through the battery to meet the high power output of the engine. In this situation, those lithium-ion cells already at their maximum charge capacity will be overcharged with a very high current (up to 10 C). It remains a huge challenge to design a redox shuttle to provide such high shuttle current. Because state-of-the-art redox shuttles alone cannot provide such high rate continuous overcharge protection, there remains a need in the art to meet the challenge of high rate pulse overcharge can for lithium-ion batteries.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a new design of positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries that dramatically boosts the pulse overcharge protection capability of the redox shuttle added to the batteries. More specifically, the present design allocates a small portion of capacity in the cathode beyond the redox potential of the redox shuttle. The extra capacity will not be accessed during normal battery operation and low-rate overcharge, but acts as the charge buffer to store the extra charge that cannot be handled by the redox shuttle during a pulse. In further aspects there are provided methods of making and using batteries using such overcharge protection systems.","The present invention relates to the design of cathode electrodes to enhance the pulse overcharge protection of redox shuttles for lithium-ion batteries. More generally, it is related to the design of lithium-ion batteries incorporating redox shuttles that are tolerant to high-rate pulse overcharge. Lithium-ion batteries containing electrodes and electrolytes of the present invention, may be used in applications such as the hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and other high-power battery applications.","Generally, a successful redox shuttle is required to have a redox potential 0.2-0.3 V higher than the working potential of the positive electrode of a lithium-ion battery. This will minimize the self-discharge of the battery induced by the shuttle mechanism of the redox shuttle. This design is generally applicable to high-energy lithium-ion batteries that are subjected to charging and discharging at low-rate currents. The redox shuttle, incorporated in the battery, is enough to handle the low rate current, and the potential of the positive electrode will never go beyond the redox potential of the redox shuttle. Therefore, at low-rate charging and discharging currents, any capacity residues at potentials higher than the redox potential will never be exploited and are considered to be inactive material.","However, the design described above is significantly challenged for high-power lithium-ion batteries. In general cases, the current for power applications is beyond the physical limitations of a redox shuttle. Once the battery is overcharged, the potential of the positive electrode will dynamically be driven to a potential higher than the redox potential of the redox shuttle, and this effect increases dramatically with the current applied. The design of the present invention is to incorporate a charge buffer in the positive electrode to improve the pulse-overcharge tolerance of the battery. The charge buffer of the present invention may be any positive electrode material that can deliver extra capacity at a potential range higher than the redox potential of the redox shuttle. When a low-rate current is applied, the redox shuttle can work properly and keep the cell potential under the redox potential of the redox shuttle. In this case, the charge buffer will not be activated. When a high-rate pulse current is applied beyond the capability of the redox shuttle, the capacity of the charge buffer will be accessed. During pulse overcharging, the charge buffer will be charged and will store the extra charge that cannot be shuttled by the redox shuttle. When the pulse is over, the charge buffer will be discharged with the aid of the redox shuttle through self-discharge and an empty charge buffer is then regenerated for next pulse overcharge. With the special design of the charge buffer, the pulse overcharge protection of the battery can be significantly improved, regardless of the charge carrying capability of the redox shuttle.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there are provided electrochemical devices that include a cathode comprising at least one primary positive material and at least one secondary positive material (i.e., the charge buffer), an anode, and a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising a redox shuttle additive. The redox shuttle has a redox potential that is greater than the redox potential of the primary positive material, but less than the redox potential of the secondary positive material. The redox shuttle additive is also stable at least up to the redox potential of the secondary positive material. By \u201cstable\u201d it is meant that the redox shuttle additive does not decompose at the working potential or overcharge potential of the device, and does not decompose to or otherwise form a passivation film on either the cathode or the anode.","Redox shuttle additives of the present invention, capable of being oxidized and reduced in the non-aqueous electrolyte, may typically be either a substituted or unsubstituted ferrocene compound, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,423, or a substituted aromatic compound.

For instance, 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-dimethoxybenzene has a redox potential of 3.9 V vs. Liand is a stable redox shuttle for LiFePOpositive electrodes, which have a working potential of about 3.5 V vs. Li. Spinel, which delivers capacity at 4.0-4.2 V vs. Li, may be used as the charge buffer for LiFePOand may dramatically boost the pulse overcharge protection capability of 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-dimethoxybenzene. Successful charge buffers are not limited to spinel materials. Any positive electrode material that delivers capacity at potentials higher than 3.9V vs. Li (e.g. LiCoO, LiCoAlO, LiMnNiCoO, etc., wherein 0\u2266\u03b1\u2032\u22660.2, 0\u2266x\u2033\u22661, 0\u2266y\u2033\u22661, 0\u2266x\u2033+y\u2033\u22661) can be an excellent charge buffers for batteries incorporating 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-dimethoxybenzene, as the redox shuttle.","Another example of a redox shuttle for 4V class positive electrode materials is (tetrafluorobenzo-1,2-dioxyl)pentafluorophenylborane. This redox shuttle has a redox potential of about 4.4 V vs. Li, and is suitable to protect 4 V class positive electrodes from overcharging. In this example, materials that deliver capacity above 4.4 V vs. Limay be used as a charge buffer. In one instance, the charge buffer may be Li(MnNiCo)O, which can deliver capacity up to 4.6 V vs. Li; 0\u2266\u03b1\u2032\u22660.2.","In some embodiments, the positive electrode is a blend of two or more different positive electrode materials. At least one of the materials is the primary material that works properly below the redox potential of the redox shuttle, and at least one of the materials is added as the charge buffer. In certain cases, positive electrode materials can act as both the primary material and as the charge buffer, particularly in cases where the material exhibits different voltage potentials at zero charge and at full charge. In some embodiments the positive material is LiMnNiCoO, wherein 0\u2266x\u2033\u22661, 0\u2266y\u2033\u22661, 0\u2266x\u2033+y\u2033\u22661. For instance, LiMnNiCoOwith 10% excess lithium delivers capacity in a wide potential range from about 3.7 V to about 4.6 V vs. Li. Therefore, any positive electrodes containing materials such as LiMnNiCoOwith 10% excess lithium may fulfill the design described in the present invention.","In some embodiments, the device is an electrochemical device such as a lithium secondary battery. The battery may comprise a primary positive material of a lithium metal oxide or a mixture of two or more lithium metal oxides; a secondary positive material of a lithium metal oxide or a mixture of two or more lithium metal oxides different from the primary positive material; an anode of graphite, amorphous carbon, LiTiO, tin alloys, silicon alloys, intermetallic compounds, lithium metal, or mixtures of any two or more thereof; where the anode and cathode are separated from each other by a porous separator; and an electrolyte comprising an alkali metal salt, a polar aprotic solvent, and a redox shuttle additive.","Suitable porous separators may be made from materials well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the porous separator comprises polypropylene, polyethylene, or a multilayer laminate of polypropylene and polyethylene.","In another embodiment, an electrochemical device may comprise: a cathode comprising at least one primary positive material such as LiFePO; and at least one secondary positive material such as spinel, LiMnO, LiCoO, LiCoAlO, or LiMnNiCoO, wherein 0\u2266\u03b1\u2032\u22660.2; 0\u2266x\u2033\u22661, 0\u2266y\u2033\u22661, 0\u2266x\u2033+y\u2033\u22661; an anode; and a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising; LiBX, LiBX, or a mixture thereof; wherein each X is independently selected from the group consisting of H, F, Cl, Br, I, OCH, and OH; a polar aprotic solvent; and a redox shuttle additive; where the redox potential of the redox shuttle additive is greater than the working potential of the primary positive material and lower than the working potential of the secondary positive material; and where the redox shuttle additive is stable at the redox potential of the secondary positive material. Alternatively, the redox shuttle additive does not decompose at the working potential of the device, or at the overcharge potential of the device.","The following terms are used throughout as defined below.","The term \u201cdecomposition\u201d refers to the process of a material changing its chemical bonding due to electrochemical or chemical forces. For example, polymerization, degradation, chemical reaction, and isomerization would all be considered to be decomposition processes.
