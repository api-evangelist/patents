Field of the Invention","The embodiments herein generally relate to the field of electrical circuitry, and more particularly to a circuit capable of switching an amplified AC signal to any one of several transducers.","2. Description of the Related Art","Military personnel are often trained using hostile environment simulators. An example of such as simulator is an array of strategically spaced targets representing hostile fire or the enemy, etc. In order to best create a battlefield scenario sound systems are employed in such simulators to recreate battlefield noises in order to train military personnel. Conventionally, this sound system has included speakers arranged in various locations, some of which are isolated from one another due to the wide-spaced layout of the simulators. As such, each speaker is required to be powered by its own amplifier. This is because conventional switches cannot handle powered AC signals, therefore the signal would have to be amplified at each individual speaker. Such a setup is not only unduly expensive, but also requires significant resources for maintenance of each speaker\/amplifier unit. Moreover, it has been virtually impossible to design a system, which can easily turn on or off a particular speaker so that there is no sound distortion emanating from the other speakers in the simulator. Recent simulator designs have required the capability of switching moderately powered AC signals.","A HEXFET\u00ae, available from International Rectifier, California, USA, is capable of handling higher currents and voltages better than a standard FET. To date, most of the hexagonal cell field effect transistors (HEXFET) applications for switching and power handling capabilities are involved with motor controls. Motor controls are DC power applications that are easily handled by power HEXFETs and require no special or unique circuitry. Conventionally, voltage is applied to the gate of the HEXFET, which turns the HEXFET on, supplying DC power to the motor. Switching of powered AC signals presents quit a different and more difficult problem. With an AC signal placed on the drain of the HEXFET, the HEXFET can be turned on inadvertently depending on the polarity and magnitude of the powered AC signal. For example if +5 volts is required to turn on a p-channel HEXFET and the gate has 0 volts applied to it, if the AC signal on the drain transitions to \u22125 volts, then the relative gate-drain voltage will be +5 volts and the HEXFET will turn on. This may not be a desirable effect in instances when it is not required for the HEXFET to be turned on, but does so nonetheless. Moreover, for control of a powered AC signal where complete isolation and total mitigation of the signal is required this is an undesirable effect.","Currently, there are no available systems that are capable of switching on\/off high-powered acoustic signals. Most conventional switches are designed for DC TTL (transistor-transistor logic) level signals only. Moreover, most switches capable of handling power are for motor control only. As such, these conventional switches are not designed to handle AC or transient signals above 60 Hz.","Therefore, due to the limitations of conventional switching circuits there is a need for a switching circuit, which includes mitigation capabilities to handle voltage transients that could inadvertently turn a HEXFET on. Furthermore, there is a need for a circuit, which can accommodate high powered and high-speed AC signals.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides an amplified signal switching system comprising a plurality of transducers and switch operable for diverting amplified transient signals to selected transducers and preventing the amplified transient signals from being sent to non-selected transducers, wherein the amplified transient signals are AC or acoustic signals, wherein the plurality of transducers comprise a plurality of speakers, and wherein the plurality of transducers are isolated from one another. The system further comprises an amplifier operable for sending the amplified transient signals to the switch. The switch selectively turns the amplified transient signals on and off to the selected transducers in order to prevent the non-selected transducers from receiving the amplified transient signals. Moreover, the switch minimizes signal distortion in the selected transducers, and alternatively, the switch eliminates signal output to the non-selected transducers.","The system further comprises an n-channel hexagonal cell field effect transistor comprising an n-channel source, an n-channel drain, and an n-channel gate component, wherein the n-channel hexagonal cell field effect transistor is connected to the switch; a p-channel hexagonal cell field effect transistor comprising a p-channel source, a p-channel drain, and a p-channel gate component, wherein the p-channel hexagonal cell field effect transistor is connected to the switch; and a voltage input unit operable to send voltage to the n-channel gate component and the p-channel gate component, wherein the amplifier is operable for sending the amplified transient signals to the p-channel drain component, and wherein the p-channel source component is connected in series to the n-channel drain component through the transducers.","Another embodiment provides a method of diverting amplified transient signals comprising arranging a plurality of transducers in isolation from one another, generating amplified transient signals, diverting the amplified transient signals to selected transducers using a switching circuit, and preventing the amplified transient signals from being sent to non-selected transducers, wherein the amplified transient signals are AC or acoustic signals, and wherein the plurality of transducers comprise a plurality of speakers. The method further comprises selectively turning the amplified transient signals on and off to the selected transducers in order to prevent the non-selected transducers from receiving the amplified transient signals. Moreover, the method further comprises minimizing signal distortion in the selected transducers, or alternatively eliminating signal output to the non-selected transducers.","An advantage of the system is that one can amplify the signal before being switched to a speaker. This means only one amplifier is needed for all of the speakers as opposed to amplifying the signal directly to the speaker, which would require separate amplifiers for each speaker. Also, the system can handle rapidly changing AC signals with complete isolation from adjacent channels and speakers. Moreover, the system can easily switch moderately powered AC signals (signals in excess of 10 V). In fact, experimental tests have been performed on the system with voltages in excess of 100 V on an 8-Ohm load, and the system functioned properly according to the experiment. According to the embodiments herein, the unique design for switching AC signals can easily handle high frequency signals (50 KHz) with moderately high power (in excess of 500 watts) and complete isolation for adjacent channels and speakers. The design of the system also eliminates the inherent \u201cpop\u201d associated with conventional amplifier turn on. Furthermore, the switch is capable of diverting an amplified transient signal to any one of several transducers thus eliminating the need to adjust for output impedance concerns. The circuit also completely isolates the transducers from each other thus eliminating cross talk between transducers or concerns associated with AC signals on ground planes.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","As previously mentioned, there is a need for a switching circuit, which includes mitigation capabilities to handle voltage transients that could inadvertently turn a HEXFET on. Furthermore, there is a need for a circuit, which can accommodate high powered and highspeed AC signals. According to a preferred embodiment herein, there is provided a circuit including a unique application of power HEXFETs for switching amplified acoustic or AC signals on or off of without distortion or bleed-through of the amplified signal to other channels. A cluster of these circuits would also have the ability to handle more than one signal with complete isolation. In one embodiment, the circuit is capable of switching an amplified acoustic signal to one of a plurality of different speakers without bleed-through to any of the other speakers. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","100","20","20","20","20","20","20"],"i":["a ","a","b ","b"]},"The switching circuit  may be one of a plurality of switching circuits  arranged on an integrated circuit chip . The system  further comprises an amplifier  operable for sending the amplified transient signals to the integrated circuit  and a voltage input unit  operable for sending voltage to the integrated circuit . The switching circuit  selectively turns the amplified transient signals on and off to the selected transducers in order to prevent the non-selected transducers from receiving the amplified transient signals. Moreover, the switching circuit  minimizes signal distortion in the selected transducers , and alternatively, the switching circuit  eliminates signal output to the non-selected transducers ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","60","70","35","60","70","35"]},"While  provides numeric values for different elements (such as the resistors R-R and capacitors C and C), these values are provided as an example and should not be construed as a limitation on the embodiments herein. Preferably, the p-channel HEXFET  is rated at \u2212100 volts and is configured to handle 23 amps of current and is used to gate an electrical signal to a speaker SPK. Preferably, the n-channel HEXFET  is rated at +55 volts and is configured to handle  amps of current and is used to gate a speaker SPK to ground. An example of a SPDT analog switch  that may be used in accordance with the embodiments herein is a MAXIM max333AEPP, available from Maxim Integrated Products, California, USA, which operates with a dual power supply and is powered by +7 volts (V+) and \u22127 volts (V\u2212). The turn-on and turn-off voltages on the respective gates (G) of the HEXFETS ,  are set at the same levels as the dual supplies (\u00b17 volts). Preferably, the HEXFETs ,  are configured in series, where the source (S) of the p-channel HEXFET  is connected in series to the drain (D) of the n-channel HEXFET  to handle the AC signal components of positive and negative voltages.","According to a preferred embodiment, one SPDT analog switch  is used to control a switching circuit  comprising two switching components , , which in turn, control two separate speakers SPK, SPK. The NC (Normally closed) pin (pin  in ) on the SPDT analog switch  is pulled up to V+ through resistor R and supplies p-channel HEXFET  with positive voltage which turns off the p-channel HEXFET . This protects against the p-channel HEXFET  inadvertently turning on if the gate-to-source voltage (V) exceeds the turn on voltage for the p-channel HEXFET . For example, if the AC signal sweeps to +8 volts on the drain (D) of the p-channel HEXFET , the voltage difference between the gate (G) and the drain (D) will be \u22128 volts which is below the \u22124 volt V(gate turn on voltage) and the p-channel HEXFET  will turn on even though a gate voltage was not applied. However, when a +7 volt bias is applied to the gate (G) of the p-channel HEXFET  in the previous example, the p-channel HEXFET  will not turn on because the apparent voltage between the gate (G) and the drain (D) will be \u22121 volt, which is less than the minimum Vthreshold of \u22122 volts. If the voltage on the drain (D) of the p-channel HEXFET  swings negative, the voltage difference between the gate (G) and the drain (D) will always be positive and the p-channel HEXFET  will not turn on.","In other words, experimentally, +7 and \u22127 volts were used for these signals. The normal closed position of the integrated circuit  (at 0 volts) routes the hard turn-off voltages to the gates (G) of the HEXFETs , , respectively. Furthermore, the HEXFETs ,  remain turned off so long as the gate voltages with respect to the drain voltages remain above or below the turn-on voltage depending on the channel type of the particular HEXFET , . For example, an AC signal, with a sufficiently large amplitude can turn on the p-channel HEXFET  if the signal transcends the required turn-on voltage at the gate (G) of the p-channel HEXFET . The amplitude of this signal is the opposite sense needed to turn-on the n-channel HEXFET  so the potential voltage across the speaker SPK, SPK is 0 volts.","The n-channel HEXFET  is used to block the voltages from the p-channel HEXFET  that exceed +11 volts (voltage difference between the gate (G) and the drain (D) of p-channel HEXFET  is less than \u22124 volts and will turn on the p-channel HEXFET ). The Vfor the n-channel HEXFET  is +4 volts and the voltage difference between the gate (G) and the drain (D) of the n-channel HEXFET  for a +11 volt signal from the source (S) of the p-channel HEX FET  is \u221211 volts. This voltage level is below the threshold for turning on the gate (G) of the n-channel HEXFET . Accordingly, this also mitigates any ground line transients that may couple back into the speaker SPK, SPK.","During operation, an amplified AC or acoustic signal is applied to the drain (D) of the p-channel HEXFET . The source (S) of the p-channel HEXFET  is tied directly through speaker SPK to the drain (D) of the n-channel HEXFET . The source (S) of the n-channel HEXFET  is tied to ground. In the off state both the p-channel and n-channel HEXFETs , , respectively, have the opposite of their turn-on voltages applied to their respective gates (G) to insure a hard turn-off which negates the effects of any signal bleeding-through due to relative transitions of the AC signal. The integrated circuit  then switches the outputs COM, COM (pins ,  in ) between two reference voltages.","More specifically, since both HEXFETs ,  cannot be inadvertently turned on at the same time, the HEXFETs ,  completely isolate the AC signals from the respective speaker SPK, SPK until controlled gate voltage is applied to both HEXFETs , . The gate voltage is supplied from the SPDT analog switch  COM and COM pins. A +5 volt control input signal (ex. supplied by a computer's parallel port (not shown))) is applied to pins IN, IN (labeled as pins , , respectively in ) of the SPDT analog switch . The two pins IN, IN are tied together and act to control the voltages that are applied to the respective gates (G) of the HEXFETs , , respectively. Resistor R is used to pull down the control signal to GND to insure the control inputs are at 0 volts when no signal is present on the control line  (of ). IN and IN are tied together so both COM and COM pins are activated simultaneously. Activation of the IN and IN line on the SPDT analog switch  with a +5 volt signal allows the NO and NO (normally open) pins to be connected to COM and COM which in turn supplies the appropriate signed voltages to the respective gates (G) of the p-channel HEXFET  and the n-channel HEXFET  to turn them on. Furthermore, 0 volts applied to IN and IN causes pins NC and NC to be connected to COM and COM and accordingly the HEXFETs ,  are turned off. When the HEXFETs ,  are turned off, the speakers SPK, SPK are completely isolated from the signal and ground. When the HEXFETs ,  are turned on, they have a low resistance to the signal which maximizes the speaker SPK, SPK response and eliminates any distortion of the AC signal. Resistors R and R, which in one embodiment, are 300 ohm resistors and are used to limit the current supplied to the p-channel HEXFET  and the n-channel HEXFET  by the SPDT analog switch  to 23 ma. This is a safety factor that prevents excessive current damage to the SPDT analog switch  due to gate failure of the HEXFETs , .","In other words, with a +5 volt signal, the outputs of the integrated circuit  are connected to the turn-on voltages for the respective HEXFETs , . These output voltages are then applied to the respective gates (G) of the HEXFETs , , thereby turning them on. This allows the AC signal to pass through the speaker SPK, SPK to ground, which completes the circuit . The speaker SPK, SPK then converts the amplified AC signal to an acoustic signal.","As shown in , the analog switch  includes four switches , , , . Switch  and switch  control a first output device such as the first speaker (SPK) and switch  and switch  control a second output device such as the second speaker (SPK). Switch  is used to turn on\/off the first output device such as the first speaker (SPK) (i.e., control the current flow). Switch  is used to control the current flow from the first output device such as the first speaker (SPK) to ground. Switch  is used to turn on\/off the second output device such as the second speaker (SPK) (i.e., control the current flow to the second output device). Switch  is used to control the current flow from the second output device such as the second speaker (SPK) to ground.","As further illustrated in , the IN pin (pin ) serves as a control input for controlling the opening and closing of switch  for the current flow from the second output device such as the second speaker (SPK). The NO pin (pin ) serves as the input to the side of switch  that is open when the switch  is not engaged (i.e., when the IN pin  receives a signal, the NO pin (pin ) is connected to the COM pin (pin ), thereby turning on the HEXFETS , ). The COM pin (pin ) serves as the output from switch  to the HEXFET  which controls the current from the second speaker (SPK). The NC pin (pin ) serves as the input to the side of switch  which is normally closed when the switch  is not engaged (i.e., when the IN pin (pin ) does not have a signal, the NC pin (pin ) is connected to the COM pin (pin ), thereby turning off the HEXFETS , ).","The N.C. (not connected) pin (pin ) is an extra unused pin in a current embodiment. The NC pin (pin ) serves as the input to the side of switch  which is normally closed when the switch  is not engaged (i.e., when the IN pin (pin ) does not have a signal, the NC pin (pin ) is connected to the COM pin (pin ), thereby turning off the HEXFETS , ). The COM pin (pin ) serves as the output from switch  to the HEXFET  which controls the current to the second output device such as the second speaker (SPK). The NO pin (pin ) serves as the input to the side of switch  that is open when the switch  is not engaged (i.e., when the IN pin (pin ) receives a signal, the NO pin (pin ) is connected to the COM pin (pin ), thereby turning on the HEXFETS , ). The IN pin (pin ) serves as the control input for controlling the opening and closing of switch  for the current flow to the second output device such as the second speaker (SPK).","The time constant for the p-channel HEXFET  and the n-channel HEXFET  is determined by the values of Capacitor  and Resistor  (C, R) and Capacitor  and Resistor  (C, R). In one embodiment, C is approximately 4.7 \u03bcF, R is approximately 10 k\u03a9, C is approximately 47 \u03bcF, and R is approximately 300\u03a9. Preferably, the time constant of the circuit  is approximately 0.047 seconds which eliminates any transients caused by circuit activation. The transient signal is sent through Control SPK  to the IN and IN pins of the SPDT analog switch , thereby activating the SPDT analog switch , which then applies a voltage to the gates (G) of the p-channel and n-channel HEXFETs , , respectively wherein the p-channel HEXFET  is preferably embodied as a P-N-P configuration, while the n-channel HEXFET  is preferably embodied as a N-P-N configuration. Resistors R and R limit the amount of current applied to the gates (G) of the HEXFETs ,  and also serve as a filter in series with capacitors C and C to eliminate popping of the speaker SPK, SPK when the HEXFETs ,  are activated. Resistors R and R bleed the current off when the SPDT analog switch  is deactivated. Resistor R limits current to the negative latches of the SPDT analog switch  for pins NO and NO. Resistor R limits the current from the SPDT analog switch  and provides a path for excess current when pins IN and IN are de-activated. When the signal is sent to activate the circuit, pins NO and NO (pins  and , respectively in ) supply the correct voltages to the gates (G) of the HEXFETs , , which in turn activate the speaker SPK, SPK.","The following is an example demonstrating the functionality of the system . The system  initially begins in the off state (0 volts), which causes the SPDT analog switch  to switch on the normally closed output voltages to the HEXFETs , . Each of the gates (G) of the HEXFETs ,  receive its respective hard turn-off voltage of \u22127 volts or +7 volts, for example. If an amplified acoustic signal with average amplitude of approximately 30 volts peak to peak is placed on the signal line (the drain (D) of the p-channel HEXFET ), then a 0 to \u221216 volt signal would be seen on the drain (D) of the n-channel HEXFET . This is due to the p-channel HEXFET  turning on when the relative voltage exceeds +7 volts. This happens when the input signal transitions to less than \u221214 volts (the output goes from 0 to \u221214 volts when the input goes from \u221214 volts to \u221230 volts). The n-channel HEXFET  does not turn on because it sees a +7 volt to +21 volt relative the gate-drain voltage and the n-channel HEXFET  requires a \u22127 volt relative gate-drain voltage to turn on. Therefore, a non-selected speaker (either SPK or SPK) does not transmit an acoustic signal.","In another embodiment illustrated in  (with reference to ), the embodiments herein provide a method of diverting amplified transient signals comprising arranging () a plurality of transducers  in isolation from one another; generating () amplified transient signals; diverting () the amplified transient signals to selected transducers using a switching circuit ; and preventing () the amplified transient signals from being sent to non-selected transducers , wherein the amplified transient signals are AC or acoustic signals, and wherein the plurality of transducers  comprise a plurality of speakers SPK, SPK. The method further comprises selectively turning () the amplified transient signals on and off to the selected transducers in order to prevent the non-selected transducers from receiving the amplified transient signals. Moreover, the method further comprises minimizing () signal distortion in the selected transducers , or alternatively eliminating () signal output to the non-selected transducers ","Preferably, the switching circuit  is computer controlled with the signal being moved around an array of speakers SPK, SPK in a rapid sequence. While only two speakers SPK, SPK are shown in , the circuit  may be incorporated into a system  comprising well over thirty speakers. The switching circuit  is capable of handling voltages in excess of \u00b160 volts with complete isolation of the signal and no bleed through detected at the speaker SPK, SPK. The switching circuit  also has a turn on time of less than 50 ms with no audible popping noise when energized. During implementation, the maximum frequency response may be measured to be greater that approximately 100 MHz, and which is dependent on the internal capacitance of the HEXFETs , .","An advantage of the system  is that one can amplify the signal before being switched to a particular transducer . This means only one amplifier  is needed for all of the transducers  as opposed to amplifying the signal directly to the transducer , which in the case of speakers, would require separate amplifiers  for each speaker SPK, SPK, as in the conventional systems. Also, the system  can handle rapidly changing AC signals with complete isolation from adjacent transducers . Moreover, the system  can easily switch moderately powered AC signals (signals in excess of 10 volts). In fact, experimental tests have been performed on the system  with voltages in excess of 100 V on an 8-Ohm load, and the system  functioned properly according to the experiment. According to the embodiments, the unique design for switching AC signals can easily handle high frequency signals (50 KHz) with moderately high power (in excess of 500 watts) and complete isolation for adjacent speakers SPK, SPK. The design of the system  also eliminates the inherent \u201cpop\u201d associated with conventional amplifier turn on. Furthermore, the switching circuit  is capable of diverting an amplified transient signal to any one of several transducers  thus eliminating the need to adjust for output impedance concerns. The system  also completely isolates the transducers  from each other thus eliminating cross talk between transducers  or concerns associated with AC signals on ground planes.","The embodiments herein are operable in any environment that needs the capability of switching one input signal to one of many outputs. For example, virtuality simulators with a multiple speaker array would benefit from the embodiments herein, as would a public announcement system in a school or office where one would want to select a single room to broadcast to. In fact, the embodiments herein are advantageous in this regard as they would significantly reduce the size of the switchboard typically required for such systems\/uses.","Moreover, the system  provided by the embodiments herein can accommodate a plurality of different acoustic signals (for example, 8 different signals), wherein each signal is routed to one of a plurality of speakers SPK, SPK with no two signals going to the same speaker SPK, SPK at the same time. The system  provided by the embodiments herein may be used in any powered AC application where switching of the signal is required. Moreover, the ability to switch an amplified signal will drastically reduce the number of amplifiers  required to perform a specific task. As mentioned, conventionally if a requirement existed to have, for example, twenty-five speakers, then twenty-five amplifiers would be needed to power the speakers because of the lack of a switch capable of handling powered AC signals. However, according to the embodiments herein, only one amplifier  is required to amplify the signal, which could then be switched to any one of the plurality of transducers  (i.e., speakers SPK, SPK).","Generally, the embodiments herein provide a circuit  that can switch moderately powered signals. This is accomplished by using HEXFETs ,  in the circuit  in a novel manner. Instead of putting the AC signal on the gates (G) of the HEXFETs ,  (as usually done in a motor control circuit), the circuit  uses a DC signal on the gate (G) of the HEXFETs , , and the drain (D) of the HEXFETs ,  receives the AC signal. Accordingly, the embodiments of the invention use a pair of complementary HEXFETs ,  to protect the circuit , when it is turned off, from AC swings in one polarity or the other.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Therefore, while the embodiments herein have been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments herein can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments herein will be better understood from the following detailed description with reference to the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
