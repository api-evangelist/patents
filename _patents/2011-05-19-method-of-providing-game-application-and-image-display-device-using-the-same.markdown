The image display device displays a broadcast, which is selected by the user from among broadcast signals transmitted from a broadcast station, on a display. Currently broadcasters are transitioning from analog to digital broadcasting.","Digital broadcasting refers to broadcasting of digital video and audio signals. The digital broadcast has low data loss due to robustness against external noise, error correction, high resolution and a high-definition screen, as compared with an analog broadcast. In addition, digital broadcasting can provide a bidirectional service unlike analog broadcasting.","In order to use digital broadcasting including a variety of content, the performance of an image display device has been improved and the function thereof has been diversified. As the performance of the image display device has been improved, various functions of the image display device, such as gaming, music listening or Internet shopping, using various applications can be performed in addition to a function for receiving an image signal from a broadcast station and viewing a broadcast.","In the case where a game application is used in a conventional image display device, a plurality of players plays the game using one display. Thus, each player may not be suitably displayed on a game screen. In general, since a remote controller of the image display device is used as a game controller, the number of input keys of the remote controller is restricted and key input is inconvenient. Thus, it is difficult to smoothly play the game.","Accordingly, there is a need for a method of providing a game application through an image display device and a user terminal connected over a network such that the game application is used using separate user terminals and an image display device using the same, in order to solve the problems of the conventional image device.","An object of the present invention devised to solve the problem lies in a method of providing a game application through an image display device and a user terminal connected over a network such that the game application is smoothly used in the image display device, and an image display device using the same.","Another object of the present invention devised to solve the problem lies in a game play information notification method using an image display device and a user terminal connected over a network, which can store game play information of a game application executed on the image display device in a server connected to the network and output a notification message to the image display device if the stored game play information is changed such that a user recognizes changed information of the game play information without executing the game application, and an image display device using the same.","The object of the present invention can be achieved by providing a method of providing a game application of an image display device connected to predetermined user terminals over a network, including assigning a play identifier to the user terminal, executing the game application, generating game execution information, and transmitting the game execution information to the user terminal.","In another aspect of the present invention, provided herein is a game play information notification method of an image display device connected over a network, including receiving a first game play information of an user, receiving a second game play information of the user, checking a change regarding an user ranking information between the first game information and the second game information, and transmitting a notification message regarding the change to an image display device, when the user ranking information is changed.","In a further aspect of the present invention, provided herein is an image display device for executing a game application, including a display configured to display a play screen of the game application, a network interface configured to transmit or receive data to or from predetermined user terminals connected to the image display device over a network, and a controller configured to assign a play identifier to at least one user terminal, execute the game application, generate game execution information, transmit the game execution information corresponding to the player identifier assigned to each of the user terminals, and receive a game play signal from each of the user terminals.","According to the present invention, it is possible to utilize a user terminal as a game controller without further providing a separate game controller to an image display device.","According to the present invention, by utilizing a separate user terminal as a game controller only by simple setting in an image display device, it is possible to provide a separate game screen to each player and easily input a game play command.","According to the present invention, it is possible to identify change information of game play information while performing another operation using an image display device, even when a user does not execute a game application.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings.","The terms \u201cmodule\u201d and \u201cunit\u201d attached to describe the names of components are used herein to help the understanding of the components and thus should not be considered as having specific meanings or roles. Accordingly, the terms \u201cmodule\u201d and \u201cunit\u201d may be used interchangeably.","An image display device as set forth herein is an intelligent image display device equipped with a computer support function in addition to a broadcast reception function, for example. Since an Internet function is added to a broadcast reception function, the image display device may have user-friendly interfaces such as a handwriting input device, a touchscreen, or a pointing device. Further, because the image display device supports wired or wireless Internet, it is capable of e-mail transmission\/reception, Web browsing, banking, gaming, etc. by connecting to the Internet or a computer. To implement these functions, the image display device may operate based on a standard, general-purpose Operating System (OS).","Various applications can be freely added to or deleted from, for example, a general-purpose OS kernel of the image display device according to the present invention. Therefore, the image display device may perform a number of user-friendly functions. The image display device may be a network TV, a Hybrid broadcast broadband TV (HBBTV), a smart TV, etc. for example. The image display device is also applicable to smart phones.","Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings, but it should be understood that they are merely illustrative of the present invention and should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the present invention.","In addition, although the terms used in the present invention are selected from generally known and used terms, some of the terms mentioned in the description of the present invention, the detailed meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the description herein, have been selected at the discretion of the applicant. Furthermore, the present invention must be understood, not simply by the actual terms used but by the meanings of each term lying within.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , the broadcast system including the image display device according to the embodiment of the present invention may include a Content Provider (CP) , a Service Provider (SP) , a Network Provider (NP) , and a Home Network End Device (HNED) . The HNED  corresponds to, for example, a client  which is an image display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The client  corresponds to the image display device according to the embodiment of the present invention, and the image display device may be a network TV, a smart TV, an Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), etc.","The CP  creates and provides a variety of content. The CP  may be, for example, a terrestrial broadcaster, a cable System Operator (SO) or Multiple System Operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, or an Internet broadcaster, as illustrated in .","Besides broadcast content, the CP  may provide various applications, which will be described later in detail.","The SP  may provide content received from the CP  as a service package. For instance, the SP  may package first terrestrial broadcasts, second terrestrial broadcasts, cable MSOs, satellite broadcasts, various Internet broadcasts, and applications and provide the package to users.","The SP  may unicast or multicast a service to the client . Unicast is a form of transmission in which data is sent from only one transmitter to only one receiver. In an example of unicast transmission, upon receipt of a request for data from a receiver, a server transmits the data to only one receiver. Multicast is a type of transmission or communication in which a transmitter transmits data to a group of receivers. For example, a server may transmit data to a plurality of pre-registered receivers at one time. For multicast registration, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) may be used.","The NP  may provide a network over which a service is provided to the client . The client  may construct a home network end user (HNED) and receive a service over the HNED.","Content transmitted in the above-described system including the image display device may be protected through conditional access or content protection. CableCard and Downloadable Conditional Access System (DCAS) are examples of such conditional access or content protection systems.","The client  may also transmit content over a network. In this case, the client  serves as a CP and thus the CP  may receive content from the client . Therefore, an interactive content service or data service can be provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As shown in , the image display device  according to another embodiment of the present invention is connected to a broadcast network and the Internet. The image display device  is, for example, a network TV, a smart TV, an HBBTV, etc.","The image display device  includes, for example, a broadcast interface , a section filter , an Application Information Table (AIT) filter , an application data processor , a broadcast data processor , a media player , an Internet Protocol (IP) processor , an Internet interface , and a runtime module .","The image display device  receives AIT data, real-time broadcast content, application data, and stream events through the broadcast interface . The real-time broadcast content may be referred to as linear Audio\/Video (A\/V) content.","The section filter  performs section filtering on the four types of data received through the broadcast interface , and outputs the AIT data to the AIT filter , the linear A\/V content to the broadcast data processor , and the stream events and application data to the application data processor .","Meanwhile, the image display device  receives non-linear A\/V content and application data through the Internet interface . The non-linear A\/V content may be, for example, a Content On Demand (CoD) application.","The non-linear A\/V content and the application data are transmitted to the media player  and the runtime module , respectively.","The runtime module  includes, for example, an application manager and a browser as illustrated in . The application manager controls the life cycle of an interactive application using the AIT data, for example. The browser displays and processes the interactive application.","The game application according to one embodiment of the present invention is received through the broadcast interface  or the Internet interface  shown in .","The game application received through the broadcast interface  is transmitted to the runtime module  through the application data processor . The game application received through the Internet interface  is transmitted to the runtime module  through the IP processor .","The runtime module  executes the game application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"2"},"The SP performs an SP discovery operation (S). The image display device transmits an SP attachment request signal (S). Upon completion of attachment to the SP, the image display device receives provisioning information from the SP (S). Further, the image display device receives Master System Information (SI) Tables (S), receives Virtual Channel Map Tables (S), receives Virtual Channel Description Tables (S), and receives Source Tables from the SP (S).","More specifically, SP Discovery is a process by which SPs that provide IPTV services search for servers providing services to the SPs.","In order to receive information (e.g., SP discovery information) about the service discovery (SD) servers, an SD server address list can be detected, for example, using three methods, specifically use of an address preset in the image display device or an address manually set by a user, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)-based SP Discovery, and Domain Name System Service (DNS SRV)-based SP Discovery. The image display device accesses a specific SD server using the SD server address list obtained through one of the above three methods and receives an SP Discovery record from the specific SD server. The Service Provider Discovery record includes information needed to perform Service Discovery on an SP basis. The image display device then starts a Service Discovery operation using the SP Discovery record. These operations can be performed in a push mode or a pull mode.","The image display device accesses an SP attachment server specified by an SP attachment locator included in the SP Discovery record and performs a registration procedure (or a service attachment procedure).","Further, after accessing an authentication service server of an SP specified by an SP authentication locator and performing an authentication procedure, the image display device may perform a service authentication procedure.","Once service attachment is successfully completed, a server may transmit data to the image display device in the form of a provision information table.","During service attachment, the image display device may include an Identifier (ID) and location information thereof in data and transmit the data to the service attachment server. Thus the service attachment server may specify a service that the image display device has subscribed to based on the ID and location information. In addition, the service attachment server provides, in the form of a provisioning information table, address information from which the image display device can obtain Service Information (SI). The address information corresponds to access information about a Master SI Table. This method facilitates provision of a customized service to each subscriber.","The SI is divided into a Master SI Table record for managing access information and version information about a Virtual Channel Map, a Virtual Channel Map Table for providing a list of services in the form of a package, a Virtual Channel Description Table that contains details of each channel, and a Source Table that contains access information about actual services.","The image display device shown in  receives the game application according to the embodiment of the present invention from the SP or a virtual channel provided by a broadcast station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"A Master SI Table contains information about the location and version of each Virtual Channel MAP.","Each Virtual Channel MAP is identified by its Virtual Channel MAP identifier. Virtual Channel MAP Version specifies the version number of the Virtual Channel MAP. If any of the tables connected to the Master SI Table shown in  in the arrowed direction is modified, the versions of the modified table and overlying tables thereof (up to the Master SI Table) are incremented. Accordingly, a change in any of the SI tables can be readily identified by monitoring the Master SI Table.","For example, when the Source Table is changed, the version of the Source Table is incremented and the version of the Virtual Channel Description Table that references the Source Table is also incremented. In conclusion, a change in any lower table leads to a change in its higher tables and, eventually, a change in the Master SI Table.","One Master SI Table may exist for each SP. However, in the case where service configurations differ for regions or subscribers (or subscriber groups), an SP may have a plurality of Master SI Tables in order to provide a customized service on a unit basis. Thus it is possible to efficiently provide a customized service to a subscriber through the master SI table according to a region in which the subscriber is located and subscriber information regarding the subscriber.","A Virtual Channel Map Table may contain one or more virtual channels. A Virtual Channel Map includes not only details of the channels but information about the locations of the details of the channels. In the Virtual Channel Map Table, Virtual Channel Description Location specifies the location of a Virtual Channel Description Table including the details of the channels.","The Virtual Channel Description Table contains the details of the virtual channels. The Virtual Channel Description Table can be accessed using the Virtual Channel Description Location of the Virtual Channel Map Table.","A Source Table provides information necessary to access actual services (e.g. IP addresses, ports, AV Codecs, transmission protocols, etc.) on a service basis.","The above-described Master SI Table, the Virtual Channel Map Table, the Virtual Channel Description Table and the Source Table are delivered in four logically separate flows, in a push mode or a pull mode. For version management, the Master SI Table may be multicast and thus version changes can be monitored by receiving a multicast stream.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 5"],"b":"2"},"An image display device  includes a network interface , a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) manager , a service delivery manager , a demultiplexer (DEMUX) , a Program Specific Information (PSI) & (Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP) and\/or SI) decoder , an audio decoder , a video decoder , a display A\/V and OSD module , a service control manager , a service discovery manager , a metadata manager , an SI & metadata database (DB) , a User Interface (UI) manager , and a service manager .","The network interface  transmits packets to and receives packets from a network. Specifically, the network interface  receives services and content from an SP over the network.","The TCP\/IP manager  is involved in packet reception and transmission of the image display device , that is, packet delivery from a source to a destination. The TCP\/IP manager  classifies received packets according to appropriate protocols and outputs the classified packets to the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","The service delivery manager  controls reception of service data. For example, when controlling real-time streaming data, the service delivery manager  may use the Real-time Transport Protocol\/Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTP\/RTCP). If real-time streaming data is transmitted over RTP, the service delivery manager  parses the received real-time streaming data using RTP and transmits the parsed real-time streaming data to the DEMUX  or stores the parsed real-time streaming data in the SI & metadata DB  under the control of the service manager . In addition, the service delivery manager  feeds back network reception information to a server that provides the service using RTCP.","The DEMUX  demultiplexes a received packet into audio data, video data and PSI data and transmits the audio data, video data and PSI data to the audio decoder , the video decoder , and the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , respectively.","The PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes SI such as PSI. More specifically, the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  receives and decodes PSI sections, PSIP sections or SI sections demultiplexed by the DEMUX .","The PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  constructs an SI DB by decoding the received sections and stores the SI DB in the SI & metadata DB .","The audio decoder  and the video decoder  decode the audio data and the video data received from the DEMUX  and output the decoded audio and video data to a user through the display A\/V and OSD module .","The UI manager  and the service manager  manage the overall state of the image display device , provide UIs, and manage other managers.","The UI manager  provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the form of an OSD and performs a reception operation corresponding to a key input received from the user. For example, upon reception of a key input signal regarding channel selection from the user, the UI manager  transmits the key input signal to the service manager .","The service manager  controls managers associated with services, such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","The service manager  also creates a channel map and selects a channel using the channel map according to the key input signal received from the UI manager . The service manager  sets the audio\/video Packet ID (PID) of the selected channel based on SI of the channel received from the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  in the demultiplexer .","The service discovery manager  provides information necessary to select an SP that provides a service. Upon receipt of a channel selection signal from the service manager , the service discovery manager  detects a service based on the channel selection signal.","The service control manager  takes charge of selection and control services. For example, if a user selects a live broadcasting service, such as a conventional broadcasting service, the service control manager selects and controls the service using Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) or Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). If the user selects Video on Demand (VoD), the service control manager  selects and controls the service using RTSP. RTSP supports trick mode for real-time streaming. Further, the service control manager  may initialize and manage a session through an IP Multimedia Control (IMC) gateway using IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The protocols are only exemplary and thus other protocols are also applicable.","The metadata manager  manages metadata related to services and stores the metadata in the SI & metadata DB .","The SI & metadata DB  stores the SI decoded by the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , the metadata managed by the metadata manager , and the information required to select an SP, received from the service discovery manager . The SI & metadata DB  may store system setup data.","The SI & metadata DB  may be constructed in a Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) or a flash memory.","An IMS Gateway (IG)  is a gateway equipped with functions needed to access IMS-based IPTV services.","The UI manager  of the image display device  shown in  serves to control the game application according to the embodiment of the present invention. In particular, the UI manager  operates according to a user input signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":"2"},"Referring to , an image display device  according to another embodiment of the present invention includes a broadcast receiver , an external device interface , a memory , a user input interface , a controller , a display , an audio output unit , a power supply , and a camera module (not shown). The broadcasting receiver  may include a tuner , a demodulator  and a network interface . As needed, the broadcasting receiver  may be configured so as to include only the tuner  and the demodulator  or only the network interface .","The tuner  tunes to a Radio Frequency (RF) broadcast signal corresponding to a channel selected by a user from among a plurality of RF broadcast signals received through an antenna and downconverts the tuned RF broadcast signal into a digital Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal or an analog baseband video or audio signal.","More specifically, if the tuned RF broadcast signal is a digital broadcast signal, the tuner  downconverts the tuned RF broadcast signal into a digital IF signal DIF. On the other hand, if the tuned RF broadcast signal is an analog broadcast signal, the tuner  downconverts the tuned RF broadcast signal into an analog baseband video or audio signal CVBS\/SIF. That is, the tuner  may be a hybrid tuner capable of processing not only digital broadcast signals but also analog broadcast signals. The analog baseband video or audio signal CVBS\/SIF may be directly input to the controller .","The tuner  may be capable of receiving RF broadcast signals from an Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) single-carrier system or from a Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) multi-carrier system.","The tuner  may sequentially tune to a number of RF broadcast signals corresponding to all broadcast channels previously stored by a channel storage function from a plurality of RF signals received through the antenna and may downconvert the tuned RF broadcast signals into IF signals or baseband video or audio signals.","The demodulator  receives the digital IF signal DIF from the tuner  and demodulates the digital IF signal DIF.","For example, if the digital IF signal DIF is an ATSC signal, the demodulator  may perform 8-Vestigal SideBand (VSB) demodulation on the digital IF signal DIF. The demodulator  may also perform channel decoding. For channel decoding, the demodulator  may include a Trellis decoder (not shown), a de-interleaver (not shown) and a Reed-Solomon decoder (not shown) so as to perform Trellis decoding, de-interleaving and Reed-Solomon decoding.","For example, if the digital IF signal DIF is a DVB signal, the demodulator  performs Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (COFDMA) demodulation upon the digital IF signal DIF. The demodulator  may also perform channel decoding. For channel decoding, the demodulator  may include a convolution decoder (not shown), a de-interleaver (not shown), and a Reed-Solomon decoder (not shown) so as to perform convolution decoding, de-interleaving, and Reed-Solomon decoding.","The demodulator  may perform demodulation and channel decoding on the digital IF signal DIF, thereby obtaining a Transport Stream (TS). The TS may be a signal in which a video signal, an audio signal and a data signal are multiplexed. For example, the TS may be an MPEG-2 TS in which an MPEG-2 video signal and a Dolby AC-3 audio signal are multiplexed. An MPEG-2 TS may include a 4-byte header and a 184-byte payload.","In order to properly handle not only ATSC signals but also DVB signals, the demodulator  may include an ATSC demodulator and a DVB demodulator.","The TS output from the demodulator  may be input to the controller  and thus subjected to demultiplexing and A\/V signal processing.

In addition, the external device interface  may output video, audio, and data signals processed by the controller  to the external device. In order to receive or transmit audio, video and data signals from or to the external device, the external device interface  includes the A\/V I\/O unit (not shown) and\/or the wireless communication module (not shown).","The A\/V I\/O unit may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, a Composite Video Banking Sync (CVBS) port, a Component port, a Super-video (S-video) (analog) port, a Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port, a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) port, and a D-sub port, in order to input the video and audio signals of the external device to the image display device .","The wireless communication module may perform short-range wireless communication with other electronic devices. For short-range wireless communication, the wireless communication module may use Bluetooth, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra WideBand (UWB), ZigBee, and Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) communication standards.","The external device interface  may be connected to various set-top boxes through at least one of the above-described ports and may thus perform an I\/O operation with the various set-top boxes.","The external device interface  may receive applications or an application list from an adjacent external device and provide the applications or the application list to the controller  or the memory .","The network interface  serves as an interface between the image display device  and a wired\/wireless network such as the Internet.
