{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/551,401, filed on Oct. 25, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. FA9550-09-1-0613 awarded by the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in this invention.","Computer simulations are one of the most useful tools in modern engineering. To evaluate a proposed solution to a complex engineering problem, an engineer typically uses a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software tool to construct a mathematical model of the proposed solution and to run FEA simulations based on the mathematical model. For instance, when designing a bridge, a structural engineer can use an FEA tool to construct a model of a proposed design and to run simulations to determine whether any stress \u201chot spots\u201d exist under various loading conditions.","FEA refers generally to a class of numerical analysis techniques for approximating solutions of partial differential equations. These techniques attempt to break down a complex physical system into simpler subsystems that are analyzed locally. For instance, in the example of the proposed bridge design, a mathematical domain representing the structure of the bridge can be divided into a set of disjoint subdomains each representing a portion of the structure. An unknown function of interest (e.g., displacement or stress) can then be approximated locally over each subdomain.","Several FEA tools are available commercially, such as MSC Nastran by MSC.Software Corporation, COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae by COMSOL AB, SAP 2000\u00ae by Computers and Structures, Inc., and ANSYS\u00ae by ANSYS, Inc.","Systems, methods, and apparatus for modeling and analyzing a physical system comprising a plurality of components.","In some embodiments, a method is provided, comprising acts of: accessing, based at least in part on a component type of a component of the plurality of components, a dataset from a plurality of datasets, the dataset comprising a representation of at least one partial differential equation; constructing a model of the component based at least in part on the accessed dataset and at least one parameter relating to a physical characteristic of the component; and using the model of the component to compute at least one output value based on at least one input value.","In some further embodiments, a system is provided, comprising at least one processor programmed to: access, based at least in part on a component type of a component of the plurality of components, a dataset from a plurality of datasets, the dataset comprising a representation of at least one partial differential equation; construct a model of the component based at least in part on the accessed dataset and at least one parameter relating to a physical characteristic of the component; and use the model of the component to compute at least one output value based on at least one input value.","In yet some further embodiments, at least one computer-readable medium is provided, having encoded thereon instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, implement a method for modeling and analyzing a physical system comprising a plurality of components, the method comprising acts of: accessing, based at least in part on a component type of a component of the plurality of components, a dataset from a plurality of datasets, the dataset comprising a representation of at least one partial differential equation; constructing a model of the component based at least in part on the accessed dataset and at least one parameter relating to a physical characteristic of the component; and using the model of the component to compute at least one output value based on at least one input value.","It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below (provided such concepts are not mutually inconsistent) are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. In particular, all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein.","The inventors have recognized and appreciated a number of disadvantages of conventional simulation techniques.","First, conventional FEA tools require users to go through extensive training to learn how to construct and analyze three-dimensional (3D) models. Even with adequate training, the model construction process tends to be complex and time-consuming. As a result, engineers are discouraged from verifying their designs using full-scale 3D simulations. Instead, engineers often rely on more limited modeling techniques, such as those based on one-dimensional (1D) \u201cstick\u201d models. Such techniques may lead to oversimplification of complex physical systems and hence may be less effective in uncovering design flaws. Therefore, a need exists for a simulation tool that allows users to construct and analyze 3D models in a simple and intuitive manner.","Second, while some conventional FEA tools allow users to construct 3D models and perform full-scale simulations, such simulations are computationally intensive and require powerful hardware infrastructure. Typically, to simulate a real-world problem such as a design of a bridge, each simulation run that corresponds to a particular set of loading conditions can take an hour or more to complete. Even with supercomputers, which are costly to acquire and maintain, engineers often need to wait more than a day to obtain simulation results on all loading conditions of interest. Therefore, a need exists for a simulation tool that can deliver results in real time (e.g., in about one minute, thirty seconds, fifteen seconds, five seconds, two seconds, one second, or less) without expensive hardware.","Third, conventional FEA tools do not provide efficient mechanisms for fine tuning system designs. For example, whenever a user modifies any aspect of a design, a conventional FEA tool re-computes a full FEA solution on the entire physical system. As a result, conventional FEA tools are unable to deliver updated simulation results in real time, even for minor modifications. Therefore, a need exists for a simulation tool that provides convenient mechanisms for modifying system designs and efficiently computes updated simulation results.","Fourth, conventional FEA tools offer few opportunities for reusing existing work. A user typically constructs a new FEA model for each new physical system to be analyzed, and a full FEA solution is computed based on the new model, even if the new physical system shares similar components with physical systems previously analyzed. Therefore, a need exists for a simulation tool that provides convenient mechanisms for managing and reusing previously computed data, which may significantly shorten the amount of time needed to build a computational model and perform a simulation.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, systems, methods and apparatus are provided for constructing and analyzing component-based models of engineering systems.","In accordance with some embodiments, an improved simulation tool is provided that allows a user to construct a model for a physical system in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d fashion, by creating models for components in the physical system and specifying how the components are interconnected. For instance, each component in the physical system may have one or more ports for connecting to one or more other components, so that the user may specify a connection between a first component and a second component by simply selecting a first port of the first component and a second port of the second component and indicating that the first and second ports are to be connected.","The inventors have recognized and appreciated that it may be beneficial to provide parametrizable components. For example, in one implementation, a library of reference components is provided, where each reference component may conceptually represent a component type, such as a component with one or more parameters unspecified. In such an embodiment, a user may create a component model simply by selecting a reference component from the library of reference components and then specifying one or more parameters to be used to instantiate the selected reference component.","In accordance with some further embodiments, an improved simulation tool is provided that is capable of delivering FEA simulation results in real time using only commonly available hardware, such as hardware on a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smartphone, or some other suitable user device. In some implementations, a static condensation procedure may be used to eliminate one or more degrees of freedom internal to at least one component in the physical system, and a reduced basis (RB) approximation technique may be applied to reduce the computational complexity associated with the static condensation procedure. For example, rather than computing an exact solution for a so-called \u201cbubble function\u201d as done in a conventional static condensation procedure, an RB approximation of the bubble function may be computed, which may lead to significant computational savings.","The inventors have further recognized and appreciated that it may be beneficial to decompose an RB computation into two steps, Construction and Evaluation, such that the Construction step may be computationally expensive but may result in readily reusable data, while the Evaluation step may be computationally inexpensive. For example, in an embodiment with parametrizable components, a Construction step may produce data corresponding to a reference component (which may, mathematically, correspond to a family of components that differ only in one or more parameters), and an Evaluation step may use the data produced by the Construction step to construct and analyze a component model corresponding to an instance of the reference component (e.g., with specified parameter values). As a more specific example, the Construction step may involve solving one or more instances of at least one partial differential equation, where each instance may correspond to a different set of one or more parameters for the partial differential equation. The data thus generated may be used during the Evaluation step to solve any new instance of the partial different equation corresponding to any set of parameters drawn from selected parameter ranges. In this manner, the cost incurred during the Construction step for a reference component may be amortized over multiple instantiations of the reference component. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the Construction step may be performed offline (e.g., before actual parameters are determined for a specific problem), so that only the relatively inexpensive Evaluation step is performed online.","In accordance with some further embodiments, an improved simulation tool is provided that allows a user to modify one or more aspects of a physical system and obtain updated simulation results in real time. For instance, user interface functions may be provided for the user to perform various modifications, including, but not limited to, modifying one or more parameters of a component, adding a component (e.g., by cloning an existing component), removing a component, disconnecting previously connected components, moving a component from one part of the physical system to another part of the physical system, and rotating a component. In response to such changes requested by the user, the simulation tool may be able to quickly deliver updated simulation results by leveraging previously computed data. For example, in some implementations, the simulation tool may update certain computations relating to components whose parameters and\/or connections are changed, but may reuse previously computed data for components that are not directly affected by the changes.","In accordance with some further embodiments, an improved simulation tool may perform one or more consistency checks to determine whether changes requested by a user are compatible with other aspects of a physical system. The simulation tool may alert the user if any incompatibility is detected. Additionally, or alternatively, the simulation tool may propose further changes to the physical system to remove one or more incompatibilities introduced by the user-requested changes.","In accordance with some further embodiments, an improved simulation tool is provided that automatically computes an error associated with a simulation result. In some implementations, an error may be a rigorously computed error bound, such as a maximum possible difference between the simulation result and a result that would have been obtained had a full FEA solution been computed. For example, in an embodiment in which RB approximations are computed for bubble functions, a \u201clocal\u201d error bound may be computed for each bubble function, where the local error bound indicates a difference between a reduced order model computed for the bubble function and a corresponding full FEA solution. Such local error bounds may then be combined to obtain an overall error bound for an entire physical system or a portion thereof. In other implementations, an error may be an error estimate that can be computed in less time compared to a rigorous error bound. In yet some other implementations, a user may choose which type of error (e.g., rigorous error bound or error estimate) is to be computed by the simulation tool. Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and embodiments of, inventive systems, methods, and apparatus for constructing and analyzing component-based models of engineering systems. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. For instance, the present disclosure is not limited to the particular arrangements of components shown in the various figures, as other arrangements may also be suitable. Such examples of specific implementations and applications are provided solely for illustrative purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"In the example shown in , the illustrative simulation tool  includes a user interface  through which a user  may interact with the simulation tool . For instance, the user interface  may allow the user  to construct a model for a physical system by specifying one or more aspects of the physical system, such as geometry, material, and\/or any other suitable physical characteristics. Once such a model is constructed, the user  may, again via the user interface , direct the simulation tool  to perform a simulation based on the model to predict how the physical system may behave under one or more selected conditions. Results of the simulation may be delivered to the user  via the user interface  in any suitable manner, such as by visually rendering one or more output values of the simulation.","In some embodiments, the simulation tool  may allow the user  to construct a model in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d fashion, by creating models for components in the physical system and specifying how the components are interconnected. For instance, the simulation tool  may allow the user  to create a model for a component by browsing through a library of reference components. (As discussed above, a reference component may conceptually represent a component with one or more parameters unspecified, or a component type.) The user  may select from the library a reference component having one or more desired characteristics, such as geometry, material, and\/or any other suitable physical characteristics, and specify one or more parameters to be used by the simulation tool  to instantiate the selected reference component. Furthermore, the simulation tool  may allow the user  to specify how the component is to be \u201cdocked\u201d within the physical system, for example, by specifying one or more ports of the component and one or more corresponding ports of the physical system and indicating that the component is to be connected to the physical system at the specified ports.","In the example shown in , the simulation tool  includes a component instantiation module  adapted to use the component parameters specified by the user  to instantiate the reference component selected by the user . For instance, the component instantiation module  may be adapted to access a reference component library  that stores a plurality of datasets (e.g., datasets -, -, . . . -N, as shown in ) corresponding respectively to a plurality of reference components. The component instantiation module  may access a dataset corresponding to the reference component selected by the user , and may use the component parameters specified by the user  and the accessed dataset to create a component model. For example, in some embodiments, the component instantiation module  may use the component parameters specified by the user  and the dataset accessed from the library  to derive one or more partial differential equations that represent the component. As a more specific example, the component instantiation module  may use the component parameters specified by the user  and the dataset accessed from the library  to compute a so-called \u201clocal stiffness matrix\u201d and a so-called \u201clocal load vector\u201d that represent the component.","In various embodiments, pre-computed reference component datasets may be made available to users via different channels. For example, an educational institution, an engineering firm, an equipment manufacturer, or some other suitable entity may develop and maintain a library of pre-computed reference component datasets for internal use. As another example, a group of entities may enter into an agreement to jointly develop and maintain a shared library of pre-computed reference component datasets. As yet another example, a component manufacturer may make pre-computed reference component datasets available to component purchasers, either with the purchase of corresponding components, or as an additional service. As yet another example, a library of pre-computed reference component datasets may be maintained by a private or governmental entity, where public access may be allowed either at no charge or under some suitable billing arrangement. For instance, a user may pay a fee to subscribe to the library. Additionally, or alternatively, a user may pay a fee for each dataset accessed from the library. The fee may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a subscription package paid for by the user, whether the accessed dataset belongs to a pool of premium content, and\/or whether a contributor of the dataset receives compensation for allowing access to the dataset. Other ways of developing, maintaining, and\/or distributing pre-computed reference component datasets may also be possible, as aspects of the present disclosure are not so limited.","Returning to the example shown in , the simulation tool  further includes a system assembly module  adapted to construct a model for the overall physical system based on component models created by the component instantiation module  and information provided by the user  regarding how the components are to be connected. For instance, in an embodiment in which the components are connected at ports specified by the user , the component models created by the component instantiation module  may contain information relating to the ports, and the system assembly module  may use the information relating to the ports to combine the component models into a system model. For example, in some embodiments, the system model may include one or more partial differential equations representing the overall physical system, and the system assembly module  may derive the partial differential equations representing the overall physical system using partial differential equations representing individual components. As a more specific example, the system assembly module  may use local stiffness matrices and local load vectors associated with the components to compute a global stiffness matrix and a global load vector for the overall physical system.","In the example shown in , the simulation tool  further includes a system evaluation module  adapted to compute one or more output values of interest based on one or more input values provided by the user . Such input values may represent loading and\/or boundary conditions for the physical system being analyzed. For instance, in an example in which the physical system is a bridge, the user  may specify a location at which a load is to be applied to the bridge and a size of the load, which may be used by the system evaluation module  as loading conditions. The user  may further specify that the bottom of each pillar of the bridge is to have zero displacement, which may be used by the system evaluation module  as boundary conditions. The system evaluation module  may then apply such loading and\/or boundary conditions to the system model constructed by the system assembly module  to compute one or more output values of interest, such as displacement and\/or stress at various parts of the bridge. Such output values may be delivered to the user  via the user interface  in any suitable manner, for example, by visually displaying one or more graphs, charts, and\/or other suitable representations of the output values. Additionally, or alternatively, the output values may be stored in some suitable storage device for future access.","While various illustrative features of a simulation tool are discussed above, it should be appreciated that aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to any specific feature or combination of features. Nor are aspects of the present disclosure limited to the illustrative arrangement of modules shown in . Rather, a simulation tool may include fewer modules, more modules, or different modules, and each module may perform any suitable functionality or combination of functionalities. Furthermore, the modules may be arranged in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, one or more modules may be located remotely from other modules and the modules may communicate with each other using any suitable networking technologies. Further still, some of the computations performed by a module may be distributed across different computers, for example, to deliver simulation results in less time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIGS. 3A-J","FIGS. 3A-J"],"b":["200","200","100","110","200"]},"At act , the simulation tool may receive an identification of a first reference component to be used to create a model of a first component of the physical system being analyzed. For instance, as discussed above in connection with , the simulation tool may present to the user a plurality of reference components, such as reference components for which pre-computed datasets are available from one or more libraries (e.g., the reference component library  in the example of ). The user may browse through the reference components and select one or more of them for use in constructing a model of the physical system being analyzed. Alternatively, the user may obtain identification information regarding a desired reference component in some other suitable manner, such as by looking up a directory of reference components for which pre-computed datasets are available.","At act , the simulation tool may receive one or more parameters for the reference component identified at act . Such parameters may relate to one or more physical characteristic of the component being modeled, such as geometric and material characteristics. However, it should be appreciated that some reference components may not be parameterized, so that no parameters may be received for such reference components.","Referring to , an illustrative graphical user interface (GUI) A is shown, in which a user selects a reference component corresponding to a keystone to create a component , in accordance with some embodiments. In this example, the component  has four ports, -, -, -, and -, for connecting to other components. The user may specify the geometry of the keystone, for example, by specifying a width of the keystone, a height of the keystone, and\/or a size for each of the four ports -, -, -, and -. Alternatively, one or more suitable geometric relationships may be assumed, so that some measurements may be inferred from other measurements. For example, the port - may, by definition, have the same dimensions as the port -. As yet another alternative, the user may specify an angle of the arch in combination with other dimensions such as the width and height of the keystone.","Although the illustrative GUI A shown in  displays a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the component , it should be appreciated that the simulation tool may create and manipulate a 2D or 3D mathematical model of the component . For example, the component  may be assumed to have a uniform depth, which may be specified by the user. In alternative embodiments, a 3D representation of the component  may be displayed, and the user may specify depth information using any suitable input method, for example, by clicking and dragging points of interest using a mouse, or by entering depth information into a dialog box.","Returning to , the simulation tool may receive an identification of a second reference component at act , and may receive, at act , one or more parameters for the second reference component identified at act . The acts  and  may be similar to, respectively, the acts  and  described above.","At act , the simulation tool may receive an indication that the first and second components specified at acts , , , and  are to be connected. For example, with reference to  showing an illustrative GUI B, the user may create a component  corresponding to a pillar and having ports - and -, and may indicate that the port - of the component  is to be connected to the port - of the component .","At act , the simulation tool may receive an indication that a subsystem including the first and second components specified at acts , , , and  are to be cloned. For example, with reference to  showing an illustrative GUI C, the user may select the component  and the component  to form a subsystem for cloning, and may specify that a cloned subsystem is to be connected to the original subsystem at the port - of the component .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 2A"],"b":["300","305","315","325","335","325","335","305","315","230","310","2","305","325","335","305","315","310","2","305","330","4","325","310","2","305","330","4","325","325","335","310","2","305"]},"Returning to , the simulation tool may, at act , receive one or more loading and\/or boundary conditions. For instance, in the example of the arch structure discussed above, a loading condition may specify a location, a magnitude, and a direction of a force to be applied to the arch structure, whereas a boundary condition may specify how the arch structure is expected to behave at a port that is not connected to any other component in the arch structure. As a more specific example,  shows an illustrative GUI E displaying the arch structure having the components , , , and , where the user specifies that the port - of the component  and a port - of the component  are to have zero displacement.","Returning to , the simulation tool may, at act , obtain simulation results based on information received from the user and\/or other sources. For instance, in some embodiments, the simulation tool may use the identifying information received at acts  and  to access pre-computed reference component datasets for the first and second reference components. The simulation tool may then use the component parameters received at acts  and  and the accessed datasets to construct component models for the first and second components. A component model for a cloned component (e.g., the component  in the example of ) may be constructed based on the component model for the corresponding original component (e.g., the component  in the example of ), for instance, by applying appropriate translational and\/or rotational transformations. The simulation tool may then assemble the component models into a system model and compute one or more output values of interest, for example, by solving one or more partial differential equations.","It should be appreciated that any of the processing tasks associated with the act  may be performed by one or more computers different from a computer on which the simulation tool is running. For instance, in some alternative embodiments, the simulation tool may request that a simulation be performed by a server located remotely from the simulation tool, and may send relevant information (e.g., identification of reference components, component parameters, and\/or information regarding how various components are connected) to the server and receive simulation results from the server. As another alternative, the simulation tool may request component models from a server (e.g., by providing identification of reference components and\/or component parameters), but may perform other tasks locally, such as those tasks related to cloning, assembly, and solving partial differential equations. Other ways of distributing the processing tasks may also be suitable, as aspects of the present disclosure are not so limited.","At act , the simulation tool may display the simulation results obtained at act  to the user. For instance, with reference to the arch structure example discussed above, the simulation results may include predictions regarding how the arch structure would behave under specified loading and\/or boundary conditions. One example of such a prediction is the expected deformation (or displacement) of the arch structure, which is displayed in an illustrative GUI F shown in . In this example, deformation is expected at various locations, such as vertical displacement of the keystones (e.g., at location  as shown in ) and bending of the pillars (e.g., at location  shown in ).","In some embodiments, the simulation tool may provide an error bound associated with a simulation result. For instance, in the example shown in , the simulation tool indicates that an error associated with the displacement prediction is no more than 0.0053571% at any location within the arch structure. This error may indicate a difference between the output of the simulation tool and an output that would have been obtained had a full FEA solution been computed (e.g., according to some suitable FEA technique). As discussed in greater detail below, such a full FEA solution may be used as a reference model in an offline stage of computation. Such an error bound may be derived in a rigorous and verifiable manner so that engineers may rely on the results of the simulation tool with confidence.","It should be appreciated that the simulation results produced by the simulation tool may include other information in addition to, or instead of, displacement of a structure. Depending on the particular engineering problem at hand, any suitable output of interest may be computed. For example, in an illustrative GUI G shown in , a user may choose from a number of different displays, -, . . . , -, which may show, respectively, the expected displacement and three principal stresses within the arch structure, all of which may be included in the simulation results obtained by the simulation tool. The user may also return to a display - showing the proposed arch structure, edit simulation parameters via a display -, or interact with another software (e.g., a software for solving partial differential equations) via a display -. Other types of displays providing other functionalities may also be provided, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited in this manner.","In addition to visually displaying simulation results such as displacement of a structure, the simulation tool may, in some embodiments, allow the user to drill down to more detailed results. For example, in an illustrative GUI H shown in , the simulation tool may allow the user to select the connection between port - of the component  and port - of the component  to see an estimate for the displacement values at that connection. This estimate may be computed in any suitable manner, for example, by taking an average or an upperbound along the connection. A rigorously computed error bound may also be provided for this estimate.","While illustrative examples relating to an arch structure are discussed above in connection with  and , it should be appreciated that various inventive concepts disclosed herein can also be used to analyze other types of structures and other types of engineering problems (e.g., heat transfer, acoustics, fluid mechanics, etc.). Also, aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular number or arrangement of components. For example, as shown in an illustrative GUI I of , the cloning feature of the simulation tool may allow a user to rapidly construct a model for a complex structure with many components by taking advantage of repetitions in the complex structure. The simulation tool may provide a rigorously computed error bound for the entire structure, for example, as shown in an illustrative GUI J of , to assist an engineer in managing the risk of error accumulation in a repeated structure.","In some embodiments, a simulation tool may allow a user to make modifications to a system after a model has been constructed. In response to such modifications, the simulation tool may construct an updated model and obtain updated simulation results using the updated model.  shows an illustrative process  that may be performed by a simulation tool to process one or more modifications to a component-based model of a physical system, in accordance with some embodiments. For purposes of illustration, various acts of the process  will be explained with reference to , which show an example of a series of user interactions relating to modifying an arch structure and analyzing the modified arch structure.","At act , the simulation tool may receive an input specifying one or more modifications to a model of a physical system (e.g., a component-based model as described above in connection with the illustrative process  shown in ). For instance, as shown in an illustrative GUI A of , the simulation tool may allow the user to modify angles of keystone components  and  in an arch structure. In this example, a dialog box  is provided to allow the user to enter the desired angles. However, it should be appreciated that other input methods may also be suitable, for example, by allowing the user to use a pointing device (e.g., a mouse) to select and move one or more lines forming an angle to be changed.","Returning to the example of , the simulation tool may, at act , automatically perform one or more compatibility checks response to a modification requested by the user. For example, if the user attempts to change a geometry parameter of a component, the simulation tool may automatically check whether the modified component is still compatible with the physical system. As a more specific example, if a user attempts to change a width or height of a keystone in an arch structure, the simulation tool may automatically check whether the modified keystone would still fit into the arch structure, which may depend on whether and how the modified keystone is connected to other components in the arch structure, such as other keystones and\/or pillars. However, it should be appreciated that other types of incompatibilities may also be checked by the simulation tool, including, but not limited to connecting two components via ports that do not match (e.g., ports that have different sizes and\/or shapes), connecting two component in such a way that corresponding interface functions are not oriented consistently, and connecting two components in such a way that the two components occupy a common region in space (which may be impossible in real life).","In the example of , the simulation tool may, at act , attempt to make changes to the physical system other than those requested by the user, for example, to preserve consistency of the physical system. This may be done with or without user approval. For instance, in the example of , the simulation tool may attempt to move a pillar  connected to the keystone  if the user requests to increase the width of the keystone , so that the pillar  remains centered relative to the keystone . If the pillar  is connected to another component (not shown), the simulation tool may perform another compatibility check to determine whether moving the pillar  should trigger yet another change to the physical system. This process may repeat until all compatibility requirements are satisfied, or until some stopping condition is reached, such as the discovery of an incompatibility that the simulation tool does not have sufficient information to resolve. In this manner, changes may be propagating throughout the physical system automatically, which may significantly improve user experience and productivity. However, it should be appreciated that automatic propagation of changes is not required, and the simulation tool may simply alert the user when an incompatibility is detected and allow the user to make further changes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","405","415","425","435","405","415","405","415","425","435","425","435","405","415"]},"Once the proposed changes are confirmed by the simulation tool and\/or the user, the simulation tool may process the proposed changes to obtain updated simulation results. For instance, returning to the example of , the simulation tool may obtain updated simulation results at act  and display the updated simulation results at act . In some embodiments, the processing tasks performed at acts  and  may be similar to those performed at acts  and  of . However, in an embodiment in which a system model is obtained based on multiple component models, some computational savings may be possible. For example, some speedup (e.g., five, ten, or fifteen percent) may be achieved by reusing previously computed data relating to component models that are not directly affected by any modifications, such as component models with no changes to either parameters or connections.","An example of such updated simulation results is displayed in an illustrative GUI C shown in . In this example, significant deformation is expected at various locations, such as vertical displacement of the keystones (e.g., at location  as shown in ) and bending of the pillars (e.g., at location  as shown in ).","Returning to the example of , the simulation tool may, at act , determine whether further modifications to the physical system may be desired. For example, based on the results obtained at act  and displayed at , an engineer may decide to add to the arch structure shown in  one or more reinforcing features such as flying buttresses (not shown). As another example, the engineer may decide to make further changes to parameters of one or more components. If such modifications are desired, the simulation tool may return to act  to receive instructions from the engineer to further modify the physical system. For example, the simulation tool may readily construct models for additional components using pre-computed reference component datasets that may be available for the additional components. If, on the other hand, no other modifications are desired, the process  may end.","While specific examples of modifications are discussed above in connection with FIGS. B and A-C, it should be appreciated that aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular types of modifications. For instance, modifications relating loading and\/or boundary conditions may be made, in addition to, or instead of, modifications relating to component parameters,","In some further embodiments, a simulation tool may be used to analyze various types of failures, such as a brittle failure in a structure.  shows an illustrative GUI A displaying an arch structure in which a pillar has been removed at location , so as to analyze how the remaining structure may behave. The simulation tool may construct an updated model, for example, by simply omitting a component model corresponding to the missing pillar during an assembly procedure. The updated model may be analyzed as before, and an example of an updated result is shown in an illustrative GUI B of . In this example, significant deformation is expected at various locations above the missing pillar, such as vertical displacement of the keystones at locations  and  as shown in .","As discussed above and in greater detail below in connection with , a simulation tool may be able to construct update models and obtain updated simulation results in an efficient manner due to the use of pre-computed reference component datasets. However, it should be appreciated that aspects of the present disclosure is not limited to such use. For example, pre-computed data of some other form, or no pre-computed data at all, may be used by a simulation tool in accordance with alternative embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2A"],"b":["600","600","200","600","600"]},"As discussed above, a reference component may conceptually represent a component type, such as a component with one or more parameters unspecified. For purposes of illustration, the process  is described below with reference to a pillar with unspecified length and width as an example of a reference component. However, it should be appreciated that the illustrative process  may be performed to prepare evaluation datasets for other reference components, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited in this respect.","At act , one or more interface functions may be computed on a port of a reference component. In the example of a pillar, there may be two ports, one at each end of the pillar, for connecting to other components such as keystone components or other pillar components. If the pillar is modeled as a 3D object, a port may be a 2D surface.","At act , an interface function computed at act  may be lifted into the interior of the reference component in any suitable fashion. For instance, with reference again to the example of a 3D pillar, an interface function computed on a 2D port may be extended to an interface function defined in 3D space so that the 3D interface function may take on the same value (which may be non-zero) as the 2D interface function anywhere on the port, while diminishing into the interior of the pillar in a smooth fashion and becoming zero at any other port. Once an interface function has been lifted into the interior of a component, the interface function can be used to indicate some quantity of interest (e.g., displacement in a structural analysis problem or temperature in a heat transfer problem) in the component. It should be appreciated that components and ports may have other dimensionalities, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to models of any particular dimensionality. Furthermore, any suitable number of interface functions may be computed for each port of the reference components. For example, in some embodiment, more interface functions may be computed to reduce error, even though having more interface functions may lead to a higher computational load.","At act , a reduced basis technique may be applied to form one or more RB bubble spaces associated with an interface function computed at act . In some embodiments, an RB bubble space may have as elements linear combinations of one or more basis functions, so that forming an RB bubble space may include identifying the one or more basis functions. As discussed in greater detail below in connection with , an RB bubble space associated with an interface function may be used to approximate a bubble function associated with the interface function, where both the bubble function and the interface function may be used in computing a local stiffness matrix and a local load vector of a component.","In one implementation, a basis function for forming an RB bubble space may be obtained by randomly selecting a set of one or more parameters for the reference component (e.g., a length and a width for the pillar), solving one or more partial differential equations corresponding to the selected set of parameters, and using the solution to obtain the basis function. In an alternative implementation, basis functions may be obtained using an iterative greedy algorithm. For example, an iterative greedy algorithm may be initialized by selecting a training set of parameters for a reference component (e.g., multiple combinations of lengths and widths for the pillar). At each iteration of the algorithm, an error estimate, based on a current set of basis functions, may be evaluated for some or all of the parameters in the training set, and a set of one or more parameters at which the error estimate is maximized may be selected. A solution corresponding to the selected set of one or more parameters may then be used to obtain a basis function. This new basis function may be added to the set of basis functions, and the algorithm may proceed to the next iteration. The algorithm may terminate when some desired number of basis functions is reached, or when an error tolerance over the training set is satisfied.","While random selection and greedy selection are described above as alternative techniques for identifying a basis function, it should be appreciated that other techniques for identifying a basis function may also be possible, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited in this respect. Furthermore, as described above in the example of a greedy algorithm, a process for selecting a basis function may be performed any suitable number of times to obtain any suitable number of basis functions, for example, based on a desired tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency. As a more specific example, an error tolerance may be used, so that more basis functions may be added until an estimated error is below the selected error tolerance.","At act , a source RB bubble space may be formed using any of the techniques described above, or any other suitable technique. As discussed in greater detail below in connection with , a source RB bubble space may be used to approximate a source bubble function, which may in turn be used in computing a local load vector of a component. Such a source bubble function may represent an input to a physical system being analyzed, such as a heat source in a heat transfer application or a force or load in a solid mechanics application.","At act , certain parameter-independent data may be computed, which may be used during an online stage to analyze a physical system that includes an instance of the reference component with all parameters specified. In some embodiments, parameter-independent data computed at act  may include one or more inner products of functions that are independent of those parameters that are not yet specified during an offline stage. Computing such parameter-independent data ahead of time may speed up the online stage significantly, so that simulation results may be delivered to a user in real time.","Act , some or all of the data computed at acts , , , , and  may be organized into a dataset and stored in such a manner that the dataset may be later retrieved by identifying the associated reference component (e.g., the pillar). As discussed before, computing and storing such a dataset ahead of time may speed up the online stage significantly, and may allow the computational overhead to be amortized over multiple instantiations of a reference component.","Although specific examples are described above for data that may be included in a reference component dataset and for techniques that may be used to prepare such data, it should be appreciated that aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular type of data to be included in a reference component dataset, nor to any particular technique for computing such data. For instance, where multiple interface functions are computed, a single RB bubble space may be used for all of the interface functions. Alternatively, a different RB bubble space or set of RB bubble spaces may be computed for each interface function. A combination of these two approaches may also be possible, for example, by having some, but not all, of the interface functions share an RB bubble space or set of RB bubble spaces. Furthermore, any suitable software may be used to solve partial differential equations, for example, in a process for selecting basis functions at act .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2A"],"b":["700","700","200","700"]},"At act , an approximation may be computed for each source bubble function and each bubble function associated with each interface function for each component in the physical system using a reference component dataset corresponding to the component. In some embodiments, such an approximation may be computed as a suitable linear combination of basis functions from a corresponding RB bubble space. For instance, a so-called Galerkin method may be used to select coefficients for scaling the basis functions based on the particular set of one or more parameters specified for the reference component. Additionally, an error estimate may be computed that is indicative of a difference between each \u201ctrue\u201d bubble function and the corresponding approximation.","At act , a local stiffness matrix and a local load vector may be computed for each component in the physical system. The local stiffness matrix and the local load vector may define one or more partial differential equations that predict how a component may behave given some particular set of parameters, boundary conditions, and\/or loading conditions. In some embodiments, the local stiffness matrix and the local load vector may be computed using both a corresponding reference component dataset and data computed based on the particular set of parameters, boundary conditions, and\/or loading conditions that may not have been specified until the online stage of computation.","At act , the local stiffness matrices computed for various components at act  may be assembled into a global stiffness matrix for the entire physical system, and likewise for a global load vector. In some embodiments, the assembly process may include, at each connection between two components, adding contributions from both components at the corresponding ports.","At act , error bounds computed at act  may be accumulated to obtain one or more error bounds for the entire physical system or a portion thereof. For instance, in some embodiments, a global error bound may be obtained by adding error bounds corresponding to all bubble function approximations used for all components. A local error bound for an individual component may then be obtained by post-processing the global error bound.","At act , a system of one or more equations specified by the global stiffness matrix and the global load vector, which may provide an approximation to a system of one or more partial differential equations associated with the entire physical system, may be solved to predict how the physical system may behave given the particular set of parameters, boundary conditions, and\/or loading conditions. For instance, in the example of an arch structure, a system of one or more equations corresponding to a global stiffness matrix and a global load vector may be solved to predict how much deformation or stress may be experienced at various points in the arch structure.","Again, it should be appreciated that the various techniques described above in connection with  are merely illustrative, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular techniques for defining and solving partial differential equations for predicting system behavior. For instance, once a system of one or more equations corresponding to a global stiffness matrix and a global load vector is specified, any suitable software may be used to solve such a system. Thus, act  of the process  may include preparing a representation of the system of one or more partial differential equations that is compatible with a desired software for solving partial differential equations, running the software with that representation as input, and receiving results from the software.","Following below are detailed mathematical formulations and proofs for a static condensation reduced basis element method in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

However, we now introduce a reduced basis (RB) approximation: in particular, we follow exactly the same procedure as above, except now we introduce RB approximations for the bubble functions (\u03bc), (\u03bc). As we will demonstrate, the resulting numerical approach may offer considerable computational savings.","To begin, from (18), for each COM \u03b5, we define the RB approximation {tilde over (b)}(\u03bc)\u03b5{tilde over (X)},\n\na((\u03bc),)=(;\u03bc),\u2200,\u2003\u2003(38)\n\nwhere the RB space {tilde over (X)}, is constructed for each component COM from a greedy algorithm.

Note that thanks to our eigenfunction port representation the higher-mode (larger k) bubble functions may vanish rapidly into the interior of COM\u2014as seen in  for example\u2014and thus in many cases these higher modes will depend relatively weakly on the parameter.

Rozza, et al. We shall develop the C-E decomposition for reference components  in a Library.

The second, Evaluation, step is performed many times for each new parameter of interest in ; this step is inexpensive and in particular the cost shall be independent of dim().

The actual physical domain associated with a component COM is given by \u03a9(\u03bc)\u2261(\u03a9; \u03bc), for \u03bc\u03b5, where (\u2022; \u03bc) is a piecewise-affine mapping; the system physical domain is thus given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0246","num":"0245"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00031","num":"00031"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":["\u03a9","_"]},"mi":["SYS","phys"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bc"}},{"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"_"},"mi":"COM"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03a9","COM"]},"mo":";"},"mo":"\u2063","mi":"\u03bc"}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"\u2261"}}}},"In the simplest case (\u2022; \u03bc) may be dictated solely by translation and rotation \u201cdocking\u201d parameters; for isotropic, homogeneous operators, our forms aand fmay be independent of these docking parameters. On the other hand, a, fwill of course depend on geometric parameters \u03bc that represent dilations and other more general affine transformations.","In some embodiments, we may not have complete freedom in imposing component connections. For example, two connectivity constraints must be honored. We consider two components COM, COM\u2032 which are connected in the sense that \u2203L-P \u03b5and L-P\u2032 \u03b5 , such that (L-P, COM)=(L-P\u2032, COM\u2032). First, for such connected components, the associated truth \u201ctrace\u201d spaces over the shared port must be identical: (\u0393)=(\u0393). This constraint imposes a condition on the set of possible connections and hence possible mappings . Second, for connected components, (\u0393; \u03bc\u03b5) must coincide with (\u0393; \u03bc\u03b5). This constraint imposes a condition on , in particular on the allowable domains for those parameters related to geometry (and hence on which will depend).","We now consider the steps and associated operation counts and storage required to evaluate \u03bc\u03b5\u2192{tilde over (s)}(\u03bc), \u0394(\u03bc).

We Evaluate the set of m(or m+1, if f\u22600) RB bubble approximations (coefficients) and associated error bounds for each COM \u03b5: the total cost over all components is O(||m(N+QN+QN)) FLOPs and the total storage is O(||m(QNQN)). The complexity scales with || even if |Library|=|| since \u03bc\u03b5is potentially different for different instances COM of any particular reference component .","2. We Evaluate the \u201clocal stiffness matrices\u201d and \u201clocal load vectors\u201d for each COM \u03b5and then assemble  of (44) according to Algorithm 2 at total cost O(||mQN). The complexity again scales with || because different instances of a reference component  may potentially correspond to different parameter values; the complexity scales with msince has entries for each pair (L-P, COM),(L-P\u2032, COM\u2032).","3. We accumulate the error bound terms for \u03c3(\u03bc) and \u03c3(\u03bc) of Proposition 5 (and \u03c3(\u03bc) of Corollary 7) at total cost O(||m).","4. We solve the linear system (44) for (\u03bc) and then compute {tilde over (s)}(\u03bc) from (45) at total cost O(n, m)","5. We compute {tilde over (\u03bb)}(\u03bc) and evaluate the system field and output a posteriori error bounds \u0394 of (72) and \u0394of (85) at total cost O(nm).","We may solve for (\u03bc) by LU factorization (though for larger statically condensed systems it may be desirable to employ iterative methods, for example, given moderate condition number of ), and evaluate {tilde over (\u03bb)}(\u03bc) by inverse iteration (or, for large systems, a Lanczos algorithm). The computational costs in Online 4 and Online 5 assume that (\u03bc) is a block sparse matrix with bandwidth m; we further assume that evaluation of {tilde over (\u03bb)}(\u03bc) goes through O(1) iterations.","We may also visualize the field computed as described above. For instance, we may visualize \u0169(\u03bc) over selected regions or surfaces of \u03a9, S. If these selected regions coincide with ports then no additional cost may be incurred. If, however, these selected regions include parts of \u2202\u03a9(or \u03a9) which do not coincide with ports, then additional operations and storage may be used\u2014O(N|V|), where V is the set of points in \u03a9 at which \u0169may be evaluated in order to render the solution over S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0258","num":"0257"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1000"]},"As used herein, a \u201cmobile device\u201d may be any computing device that is sufficiently small so that it may be carried by a user (e.g., held in a hand of the user).
