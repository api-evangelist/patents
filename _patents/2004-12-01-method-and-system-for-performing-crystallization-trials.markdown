Background of the Invention","Structure based drug development has become an important approach to developing new drugs. Structure based drug development relies on the ability to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins with the crystallization of proteins being an essential step in determining their three-dimensional structures.","Molecules are generally crystallized by precipitating the molecule out of a solution. However, the process of growing high quality crystals involves trial-and-error with multiple solution variables such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, specific concentrations of salts, precipitants and detergents. As a result, many solutions must be tried in order to identify appropriate crystallization conditions. The preparation and manipulation of these solutions and the interpretation of the results is labor intensive. The use of human workers during this process is the most common source of errors and is often a large portion of the costs associated with crystallization trials.","A need exists for improved systems for crystallizing molecules and in particular proteins and other biological macromolecules.","A system is disclosed for generating a plurality of crystallization trials in a crystallization plate. The crystallization trials can be employed to test different solutions for their ability to crystallize a molecule.

In one example, the logic causes the imaging station to take images of the crystallization trials within 1 minute of forming the crystallization trials and optionally within 30 seconds or less of forming the crystallization trials.","An embodiment of a trial generation station is also disclosed.

The one or more secondary fluid dispensers are configured to dispense a molecule solution into the sample regions of the trial zones. The molecule solution includes the molecule to be crystallized.","A method of operating a crystallization system is also disclosed. An embodiment of the method includes generating a screen storage plate containing screen solutions screen solutions at a screen generation station. The method also includes having a transport mechanism transport the screen storage plate from the screen generation station to a screen storage station.

Each of the stored screen storage plates includes a plurality of wells that contain a screen solution. At least a portion of the stored screen storage plates have a selection of screen solutions that is different from the selection of screen solutions held in other screen storage plates. The method also includes having a transport mechanism transport the identified screen storage plate to a screen replicator and transport a crystallization plate to the screen replicator. The method further includes having the screen replicator transfer screen solutions from the identified screen storage plate to the crystallization plate.","Another embodiment of the method includes storing a plurality of screen storage plates in a screen storage station. The method also includes having the screen storage station retrieve a selected screen storage plate from among the plurality of screen storage plates stored within the screen storage station. The method further includes having a transport mechanism transport the selected screen storage plate to a screen replicator. The method additionally includes having a transfer mechanism of a screen replicator transfer portions of different screen solutions from the retrieved screen storage plate to wells of a crystallization plate.","Another variation of the method includes having a screen replicator transfer screen solutions from wells of a screen storage plate into wells of one or more crystallization plates. The method also includes having a transport mechanism transport the crystallization plate from the screen replicator to a trial generation station. The method further includes having the trial generation station generate crystallization trials in the wells of the crystallization plate.","Another variation of the method is performed in a single, automated system. The method includes transferring screen solutions from wells of a screen storage plate to wells of a plurality of crystallization plates. The method further includes transporting the crystallization plates to a trial generation station. The method additionally includes generating crystallization trials in the crystallization plates transported to the trial generation station.","Another variation of the method includes having a trial generation station generate crystallization trials in a crystallization plate. The method also includes transporting the crystallization plate to an imaging station and having the imaging station take images of the crystallization trials within 30 minutes of the formation of the crystallization trials. In some instances, the images of the crystallization trials are taken within 15 minutes of forming the crystallization trials, within 5 minutes of forming the crystallization trials or within 2 minutes of forming the crystallization trials. In one example, images of the crystallization trials are taken within 1 minute of forming the crystallization trials or within 30 seconds of forming the crystallization trials.","A system for generating crystallization trials in a crystallization plate is disclosed. A crystallization trial includes a mother liquor and a crystallization sample that contains the molecule to be crystallized by the system. The system employs screen solutions that can serve as the mother liquors in the crystallization trials. These screen solutions are stored in screen storage plates.","The system can include a screen generation station configured to generate each screen solution from one or more component solutions. The screen generation station positions the screen solutions in the wells of a screen storage plate. The system can also include a transport mechanism configured to transport the screen storage plate from the screen generating station to a screen storage station where a plurality of the screen storage plates can be stored.","The selection of screen solutions in a screen storage plate is called a screen. The screen generation station and the screen storage station can be employed to generate a screen library. For instance, many of the screens that are employed during operation of the system are used repeatedly. As a result, the system can be used to generate these screens at the screen storage station and then store them in the screen storage station for later use. Further, it can be desirable to have a screen customized for some purpose on hand. The system can be used to generate customized screens at the screen storage station and store them in the screen storage station for later use. The selection of the screens stored in the screen storage station serves as a screen library that can be used during subsequent operation of the system.","The screen storage station can also include mechanics for retrieving a particular screen storage plate from among the screen storage plates stored in the screen storage station. The system can employ a transport mechanism to transport the retrieved screen storage plate to a screen replicator. The screen replicator can transfer the screen solutions from the screen storage plate to one or more crystallization plates. After transfer of the screen solutions, the transport mechanism can return the screen storage plate to the screen storage station. At a later time, the system can transport the screen storage plate from the screen storage station back to screen replicator and the screen replicator can transfer the screen solutions to one or more other crystallization plates. Each of the crystallization plates includes a plurality of crystallization zones where crystallization trials are conducted. Accordingly, the screen solutions in a screen storage plate can be used to generate the crystallization trials in more than one crystallization plate. As a result, the system can allow an operator to avoid the need to generate new screen solutions for each crystallization plate.","The use of a particular set of screen solutions with multiple crystallization plates can provide for results verification. For instance, it may be desirable to determine whether the results in a particular crystallization plate are correct or are repeatable. The system can generate another set of crystallization trials employing the same screen solutions. For instance, the system can return to the screen storage station and retrieve the same screen storage plate from which the original screen solutions were transferred. The system can use the screen solutions in that screen storage plate to generate new crystallization trials. As a result, new crystallization trials can be generated under conditions similar to the original crystallization trials. The results of the new crystallization trials and the original crystallization trials can then be compared to verify the results.","The system can also include a trial generation station. A transport mechanism can transport a crystallization plate that includes screen solutions from the screen replicator to the trial generation station. The trial generation station can employ the screen solutions to generate crystallization trials in the crystallization plate. The trial generation station can also be configured to add one or more additives to one or more of the screen solutions before generating the crystallization trials. A variety of additives can be employed. For instance, the integrity of the additive may be all or partially lost if stored under the same conditions as the screen solutions. Further, the additive may be most effective when used at different conditions than the screen solution. For instance, the additive may be most effective if added to screen solutions at a different temperature than the screen solution.","Examples of suitable additives include additives that may enhance crystallization and\/or freezing, may cause co-crystallization and\/or may associate or bind to active sites on the molecule to be crystallized.","The system can include an imaging station. A transport mechanism can transport a crystallization plate that includes crystallization trials to the imaging station. The imaging station can generate images of the crystallization trials. In some instances, the images of the crystallization trials are taken within 30 minutes of forming the crystallization trials, within 15 minutes of forming the crystallization trials, within 5 minutes of forming the crystallization trials or within 2 minutes of forming the crystallization trials. In one example, images of the crystallization trials are taken within 1 minute of forming the crystallization trials or within 30 seconds of forming the crystallization trials.","Reducing the time between generation of the crystallization trials and generation of initial images of the trials can provide useful additional information about the trial results. For example, salts tend to crystallize earlier than molecules such as proteins. Hence, a crystallization trial that quickly forms a crystal is more likely a salt than a protein. As a result, an early image of a crystallization trial can reduce the need to perform additional analysis of crystals to determine whether the crystal is a salt or a crystal of the molecule for which the crystallization trial is directed, such as a protein. Additionally or alternately, the imaging station can be employed to generate images of a crystallization trial over time to track the progress of the crystallization trial.","A suitable transport mechanism for use with the system includes a robotic arm configured to pick up a plate from one of the stations in the system and transport the plate to one or more other stations in the system. Accordingly, the robotic arm can transport a plate to a series of stations. An advantage of a robotic arm is the ability to transport one plate to a series of stations and to transport another plate to the series of stations in a different order or to transport the plate to a different series of station. In contrast, transport mechanisms such as conveyor type devices transport each plate past the same series of station in the same order. As a result, a robotic arm can enhance the flexibility of the system.","The system can be employed with a wide range of molecules. In one variation, the molecule is a molecule such as a protein for which an x-ray crystal structure is needed. Determining high-resolution structures of molecules can be used to accelerate drug development. The molecule to be crystallized may also be a molecule for which a crystalline form of the molecule is needed. For instance, it may be desirable to create a crystalline form of a molecule or to identify a new crystalline form of a molecule. In some instances, particular crystalline forms of a molecule may be more bioactive, dissolve faster, decompose less readily and\/or be easier to purify.","The molecule is preferably a macromolecule. The molecule preferably has a molecule weight of at least 500 Daltons, more preferably of at least 1000 Daltons, although smaller molecular weight molecules may also be crystallized. Of particular interest are macromolecules such as proteins because information from these crystallizations can be employed in the effective design of new drugs.","The system can employ small sample volumes and\/or small mother liquor volumes. Although larger sample volumes can be used, the sample can be prepared so as to have a volume less than about 1 \u03bcL and more preferably less than about 500 nL. Reducing the volume of the sample can increase the rate of crystal formation. Further, reducing the sample volume reduces the amount of molecule to be crystallized that is required for the crystallization experiments. Reducing the required amount of molecule can be particularly advantageous when the molecule is a protein because it reduces the substantial time and cost requirements associated with generating larger amounts of protein.","Decreasing the sample volume can also reduce the volume of the mother liquor that is required in crystallization trials. Although larger volumes can be employed, the volume of mother liquor left in the well region after preparation of the sample can be less than about 500 \u03bcL and more preferably less than about 300 \u03bcL. Decreasing the volume of the well regions can reduce the size of the trial zones and can accordingly allows the density of trial zones on a crystallization plate to be increased.","In some instances, the stations included in the system are selected such that one or more transport mechanism can take an empty crystallization plate and move that crystallization plate from one station to another until crystallization trials are formed in the crystallization plate. As a result, the system can take an empty crystallization plate as an input and provide crystallization plates with crystallization experiments as an output. Accordingly, the system can reduce the labor requirements associated with generating crystallization trials. Reduction of labor requirements can further reduce errors and costs associated with the generation of crystallization trials.","Systems according to the present invention will now be described with regard to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["10","12","14","10","10","16","16"]},"The transport mechanism  is configured to transport a plate  from one station  to one of a plurality of the other stations .

Further, the second transport mechanism and the third transport mechanism can be combined into a single transport mechanism.","The system manipulates a variety of resources during operation of the system.

The text positioned at the bottom of each column indicates where the solution is located after the transfer of the solution. The system can include stations that are configured to perform the illustrated solution transfer operations.","The column labeled A shows a plurality of component solutions that are each contained in a receptacle or bottle. The components solutions are employed to prepare screen solutions. As illustrated by the column labeled B, the component solutions are transferred into the SSP wells of an SSP. A single component solution can be delivered into an SSP well or a combination of component solutions can be delivered into one or more SSP wells. The resulting solution in each SSP wells serves as a screen solution. The screen solutions can include other components such as components that are added outside of the system or are added by the system.

The screens can be generated so as to determine the conditions under which a molecule crystallizes. For instance, a coarse screen can be generated and used to generate crystallization trials with a particular molecule. The coarse screen can be a screen that is frequently employed as an initial screen when identifying crystallization conditions. The screen solutions that cause crystal formation can be identified. The identified screen solutions can be employed to generate an optimization screen. The ability to combine component solutions in the generation of a screen solution allows for a wide range of screen solutions that can be employed in an optimization screen. The optimization screen is used to generate crystallization trials with the same molecule. The results of the optimization screen are reviewed to identify the screen solutions that cause crystal formation.

Alternately, the screen solution in a well region can combine with other components to form the mother liquor in the well region. An additive solution can be added to one or more well regions of a CP as illustrated in the column labeled D. The additive solution combines with the screen solution to form the mother liquor in that well region.","A sample is prepared in the sample regions of a CP as illustrated in the column labeled E.

For instance, the receptacles  can be positioned in a rack such as a 15 mL falcon tube rack. A receptacle placeholder  can be configured to receive a rack on the screen generation station. As a result, the component solutions in the receptacles  can be concurrently changed or refreshed by replacing the rack.","The screen generation station also includes a transfer mechanism configured to transfer the component solutions from the bottles  and\/or receptacles  to an SSP.

The transport mechanism can leave the SSP on the deck  while it performs other functions or can remain grasping the SSP during the generation of the screen.","In some instances, a screen is generated in the SSP by transferring the component solution in each of the bottles  into a different SSP well on the SSP. For instance, the head  can be moved such that the dispensers  are each positioned above a column of bottles  that has not previously been accessed during the generation of the screen. The dispensers  are lowered into the component solution in the column of bottles  and the desired amount of the component solution is extracted. The dispensers  are raised out of the bottles . The head  and dispensers  are moved such that each dispenser  is positioned over an SSP well in a column of the SSP. The dispensers  are lowered into their respective SSP wells and the component solutions are dispensed into the SSP wells. The head  and dispensers  are moved to the wash station and the dispensers  washed.

As a result, the above method can efficiently generate coarse screens.","In some instances, a screen is generated by combining component solutions from different receptacles and\/or different bottles  in one or more SSP wells. For the purposes of the following discussion, each dispenser  is associated with a row of SSP wells in that each dispenser  dispenses component solution into the SSP wells of the associated row. As a result, the dispensers  can concurrently fill the SSP wells in a column of the SSP wells.","The controller accesses a screen generation database (discussed below) to determine the recipe for preparing the screen solution in each of the SSP wells. The controller selects an SSP well in a column of the SSP and accesses a screen generation database to identify the component solutions that are to be transferred into the selected SSP well. When all of the required component solutions have been dispensed into the selected SSP well, the controller selects another SSP well in the selected column. When the database shows that all of the required component solutions have not been transferred into the selected SSP well, the controller identifies a component solution that has not been dispensed into the selected SSP well and identifies the quantity of the component solution that needs to be dispensed into the selected SSP well. The controller then identifies the bottle  or receptacle that contains the selected component solution. The controller causes the head  and dispensers  to be moved such that the dispenser  associated with the row that includes the selected SSP well is located over the identified receptacle or bottle . The selected dispenser  is lowered into the component solution within the selected receptacle or bottle  and the desired amount of the component solution is extracted. The selected dispenser  is then raised out of the receptacle or the bottle . This process is repeated until each SSP well in the selected column of SSP wells is selected. After each SSP well in the selected column of SSP wells has been selected, the head  and dispensers  are moved such that each dispenser  is positioned over an SSP well in the associated row and in the selected column. The dispensers  are lowered into their respective SSP wells and the component solutions are dispensed into the SSP wells. The head  and dispensers  are moved to the wash station and the dispensers  washed. The washing can be performed by repeatedly extracting and dispensing a wash solution from a vessel in the wash station. When one or more vacuum ports are available, the dispensers  are moved into position over the one or more vacuum ports and a vacuum is applied to remove any liquid remaining on the tips of the dispensers . The above steps can be repeated for the same column of SSP wells until each of the required component solutions have been dispensed into each of the SSP wells in the selected column. Once the required component solutions have been dispensed into each SSP well in the selected column, another column of SSP wells is selected until each of the columns has been selected. Once each of the columns has been selected, the transport mechanism can remove the SSP from the deck . Because the above method allows for different combinations of component solutions to be transferred into the SSP wells, the screen generation station can efficiently generate a wide range of optimization screens.","Although the above method of operating the screen generation station is described in the context of each dispenser  being associated with a row of SSP wells, the above method can also be employed when each dispenser  is associated with a column of SSP wells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":["FIG. 3G","FIG. 3K","FIG. 3G"],"b":["92","94","94","94","94","94","94","94","94"]},"The screen storage station also includes an opener .

In these instances, the CP placeholders , additive placeholder  and\/or molecule placeholders  can be used interchangeably. For instance, if a molecule plate and an additive plate have about the same footprint, the same placeholder can be employed to hold either plate.","The trial generation station also includes a wash station . A suitable wash station  includes a vessel through which a wash fluid can be circulated. In some instance, the wash station  includes one or more vacuum ports.","The trial generation station also includes transfer mechanism configured to transfer mother liquor from the well regions of a CP to the sample regions of the CP.

In some instances, the number of fluid dispensers  on the head  is equal to the number of well regions in a CP. Further, the fluid dispensers  can be positioned on the head  in the same arrangement as the well regions are positioned on a CP. As a result, when a CP is positioned under the head , the head  can be lowered such that each fluid dispenser  is positioned in a well region. Further, when the wells on the molecule plate are in the same arrangement as the well regions on the CP, the head  can be lowered such that each fluid dispenser  is positioned in a well of the molecule plate.

The vertical movement of a secondary dispenser  allows the secondary dispenser  to access a solution in a well without interference from the fluid dispensers . As an alternate to the secondary dispenser  being vertically movable relative to the fluid dispenser , the secondary dispenser  can be vertically immobilized relative to the head  and the fluid dispensers  can be moved vertically relative to the secondary dispenser . Further, the head  can be constructed such that the secondary dispenser  are vertically movable relative to the fluid dispenser  and the fluid dispensers  are vertically movable relative to the secondary dispenser . One or more of the secondary dispensers  can be located outside the perimeter of a grouping of fluid dispensers  as is evident in . This arrangement can reduce interference from the fluid dispensers  during operation of a secondary dispenser .","One or more secondary dispenser  can be laterally immobilized relative to the fluid dispensers . Lateral immobilization of a secondary dispenser  causes the lateral position of the secondary dispenser  to be constant relative to the lateral positions of the fluid dispensers . As a result, the lateral position of the secondary dispenser  is automatically calibrated upon calibrating the lateral positions of one or more fluid dispensers . Alternately, the lateral positions of the fluid dispensers  are automatically calibrated upon calibrating the lateral position of the secondary dispenser . Accordingly, lateral immobilization of the secondary dispenser  relative to one or more fluid dispensers  can reduce maintenance required for the trial generation station.

An example piercer  includes, but is not limited to, a rod having a diameter up to 0.5 cm. The piercer  is configured to move vertically relative to the head  as illustrated by the arrow labeled P. The movement of the piercer  can be pneumatically or hydraulically generated.

The filled CP has mother liquor positioned in the well regions of the trial zones. The trial generation station generates crystallization trials in the trial zones by performing a plurality of liquid transfer operations. For instance, the trial generation station can transfer mother liquor from the well region of each CP that contains a mother liquor into the associated sample region. The trial generation station also transfers a molecule solution from the molecule plate into the sample region of each trial zone. The molecule solution and the mother liquor added into the sample region of a trial zone combine to form the sample. The molecule solution can be transferred to the sample region of a trial zone before or after the mother liquor is transferred to the sample region of the trial zone.","The trial generation station can be configured such that CP remains stationary in the same location on the deck  during the generation of the sample. Allowing the CP to remain stationary in the same location reduces problems associated with alignment between the head  and the CP during the sequential positioning of the head  relative to the CP.","In some instances, the trial generation station transfers additive solution from one or more wells of one or more additive plates into the well region of one or more trial zones. This transfer of additive solution can be performed before the mother liquors are transferred from the well regions into the sample region of the trial zones. As a result, the additive solutions are added to the mother liquors before the sample is formed.","When the mother liquor is transferred from the well region into the sample region of each trial zone, the head  is moved over the CP and lowered such that the tip of each fluid dispenser  is in the mother liquor positioned in the well region of each trial zone. The fluid dispensers  extract a portion of the mother liquor from each of the well regions. The head  is raised such that each of the fluid dispensers  is withdrawn from the mother liquors. The head  is moved so as to move the dispensers from over the well regions of the trial zones to a position over the sample regions of the trial zones. The extracted mother liquor is dispensed from each dispenser into the sample region of the trial zones. In the movement of the head  before dispensing the mother liquors, each dispenser is moved from over the well region of a particular trial zone to a position over the sample region associated with the same trial zone. As a result, the mother liquor in the sample region and the mother liquor in the well region of a trial zone is the same.","A parallel transfer of molecule solution can be employed to transfer molecule solution(s) from the molecule plate into the trial zones. For instance, the head  can be moved over the molecule plate and lowered such that the tip of each fluid dispenser  is in a well of a molecule plate. The fluid dispensers  then extract a portion of the molecule solution from the wells that actually contain molecule solution. In some instances, the molecule solutions are extracted concurrently. The head  is raised so as to withdraw the fluid dispensers  from the molecule solutions. The head  is moved such that each fluid dispenser  is positioned over the sample regions of a trial zone. When the molecule plate wells have the same number and arrangement as the trial zones, the head  can move to this position without laterally moving the fluid dispensers  relative to one another. The extracted molecule solutions are dispensed from the fluid dispensers  into the sample region of the trial zones. In some instances, the molecule solutions are dispensed concurrently. This parallel molecule solution transfer reduces the time required for formation of the crystallization trials and allows a plurality of the samples to be formed concurrently. Further, one or more wells in the molecule plate can include different molecule solutions. As a result, different molecule solutions can be delivered into different trial zones.","As an alternate to parallel transfer of the molecule solutions, the molecule solutions can be transferred in series. For instance, the head  can be moved such that the secondary dispenser  is located over a well in the molecule plate. The head  is lowered so as to place the tip of the secondary dispenser  in the molecule solution. The desired amount of molecule solution is extracted from the well and the head  is raised so as to remove the secondary dispenser  from the well of the molecule plate. The head  is then moved so as to position the secondary dispenser  over a sample region of a trial zone and the desired volume of molecule solution is dispensed into the trial zones. The head  can then be moved so as to dispense the molecule solution into another of the trial zones. In some instances, the molecule solution is transferred from a single well on the molecule plate into each of the trial zones on a CP. As a result, the molecule solution can be the same in each trial zone. Alternately, the secondary dispenser  can transfer the molecule solution into a portion of the trial zones and then return to a different well of the molecule plate and extract a second molecule solution. The second molecule solution can be dispensed into a different selection of trial zones than the first molecule solution. As a result, the secondary dispenser  can dispense different molecule solutions into different trial zones.","A parallel transfer of additive solution can be employed to transfers additive solution from the molecule plate into the trial zones. For instance, the head  can be moved over the additive plate and lowered such that the tip of each fluid dispenser  is in a well of an additive plate. The fluid dispensers  extract a portion of the additive solution from the wells that actually contain additive solution. In some instances, the additive solutions are dispensed concurrently. The head  is raised so as to withdraw the fluid dispensers  from the additive solutions. The head  is moved such that each fluid dispenser  is positioned over the well region of a trial zone. When the additive plate wells have the same number and arrangement as the trial zones, the head  can move to this position without laterally moving the fluid dispensers  relative to one another. The extracted additive solutions are dispensed from the fluid dispensers  into the sample region of the trial zones. In some instances, the additive solutions are dispensed concurrently. This parallel additive solution allows different additive solutions to be efficiently delivered into different trial zones. For instance, one or more wells in the additive plate can include different additive solutions. As a result, the parallel transfer of the additive solutions places different additive solutions in different trial zones.","As an alternate to parallel transfer of the additive solutions, the additive solutions can be transferred in series. For instance, the head  can be moved such that the secondary dispenser  is located over a well in the additive plate. The head  is lowered so as to place the tip of the secondary dispenser  in the additive solution. The desired amount of additive solution is extracted from the well and the head  is raised so as to withdraw the secondary dispenser  from the well of the additive plate.

The second additive solution can be dispensed into a different selection of trial zones than the first additive solution. As a result, the secondary dispenser  can dispense different additive solutions into different trial zones.","In some instances, a material is positioned over one or more wells on the molecule plate before molecule solution is extracted from these wells. Additionally or alternately, a material can be positioned over one or more wells on the additive plate before additive solution is extracted from these wells. In these instances, the head  can be moved so as to position the piercer  over a well from which a fluid is to be withdrawn. The piercer  can be lowered to pierce the material such that an opening is left in the material. This process can be repeated so as to create an opening over each well from which solution is to be extracted. After piercing the material, the head  can be moved so one or more dispensers are positioned over a well that has been pierced. The one or more dispensers can be lowered into the well(s) through the opening(s).","In some instances, it is desirable to mix the contents of the CP after additive solutions have been added to the mother liquors. As a result, after the trial generation station transfers additive solutions from an additive plate to a CP, the transport mechanism may transport the CP from the trial generation station to the mixing station before the trial generation station performs additional liquid transfer operations.","It may be desirable to wash the fluid dispensers  and\/or the secondary dispenser  after performing any of the liquid transfer operations described above.

For instance, the plates can be positioned directly on a deck without any structure to preserve the plate position.","The controller can access and\/or maintain a variety of databases during the operation of the system.  illustrates an example of an SSP tracking database that can be employed by the controller. The SSP tracking database stores data for a plurality of SSPs. For each SSP in the database, the SSP tracking database associates an SSP identifier with an SSP location identifier and a screen identifier. The controller can employ the SSP identifier to identify a particular SSP during operation of the system. As an example, an SSP can include a bar code as disclosed above. Each screen identifier can be associated with a particular bar code. As a result, when the transport mechanism approaches or grasps a targeted SSP, the controller can compare the bar code on the SSP with a screen identifier to determine whether the SSP being approached or grasped is the targeted SSP.","The SSP location identifier indicates the position of the associated SSP in the system. The SSP location identifier can indicate the station where the associated SSP is positioned. In some instances, the SSP location identifier also indicates the location of the SSP at that station. For instance, the SSP location identifier can indicated that the SSP is located in a particular port in the screen storage station. The controller can update the SSP tracking database to reflect the new location of an SSP each time the SSP is moved. As a result, the controller can employ the SSP location identifier to identify the location of a particular SSP in the system.","The screen identifier is associated with a particular selection of screen solutions. For instance, the screen identifier can indicate the contents of the SSP wells in an SSP associated with that screen identifier. In some instances, the screen identifier indicates that the SSP wells are empty. The screen identifier can take a variety of forms. In some instances, the screen identifier is a name that is used to identify a particular screen. Alternately, the screen identifier can list the contents of each SSP well. Alternately, the screen identifier can be a simpler identifier that can be associated with a separate listing of the SSP well contents. As a result, the screen identifier allows the controller to identify the screen that is contained in a particular SSP or allows the controller to identify an SSP that contains a particular screen.","Although the SSP identifier, the SSP location identifier and the screen identifier are each shown as requiring a single column in the database, one or more of these identifiers may require more than one column of the database.","The SSP tracking database can include a variety of additional information that is not illustrated.

The one or more component solutions delivered into an SSP well serve as a screen solution in that SSP wells.","SSPs generated at the screen generation station or retrieved from the screen storage station are transported to the mixing station at block  and mixed at block . The SSPs are transported from the mixing station to the screen replicator at block . In some instances, an SSP can be transported directly from the screen storage station to the screen replicator as illustrated by the arrow labeled . Further, an SSP can be transported directly from the screen generation station to the screen replicator as illustrated by the arrow labeled . In some instances, the SSP is already located at the screen replicator and need not be transported to the screen replicator. For instance, a desired SSP can be used one or more times at the screen replicator and then left at the screen replicator for additional use at a later time. In these instances, the controller will identify that the identified SSP is located at the screen replicator when executing block . The controller can leave the SSP in place at the screen replicator or can transport the SSP to the mixing station and return the SSP to the screen replicator.","The CP is transported from a primary CP storage station to the screen replicator at block . At block , the screen replicator transfers the screen solutions from the SSP wells of the SSP to the well regions of the trial zones. The screen replicator can be operated such that each screen solution in the SSP is transferred to the CP. Alternately, the screen replicator can be operated such that a portion of the screen solutions in the SSP are transferred to the CP. Further, the screen replicator can be operated such that each trial zone that receives a screen solution receives the screen solution from a single SSP well.","The screen solution transferred into a trial zone can serve as a mother liquor in that trial zone or can be combined with one or more other components that act together as the mother liquor. The controller updates the CP tracking database to include the CP identifier associated with the CP, the CP location identifier showing the location of the CP at the screen replicator and the SSP identifier for the SSP from which the mother liquor was extracted to fill the SSP wells.","As noted above, the SSP wells can be configured to hold enough screen solution for multiple CPs. Accordingly, the SSP can remain at the screen replicator while multiple empty CPs are transported to the screen replicator. The screen solutions can be transferred into the trial zones of more than one CP transported to the screen replicator. When the SSP is no longer required at the screen replicator, the SSP is transported to the screen storage station at block  and stored in the screen storage station at block . In some instances, the SSP is covered before being stored in the screen storage station.","The CP may be transported from the screen replicator to a secondary CP storage station before being transported to the sample generation station. For instance, the CP can be transported from the screen replicator to a secondary CP storage station as shown at block . Alternately, the CP can be transported from the screen replicator to the mixing station and mixed at block . The CP can be then transported from the mixing station to a secondary CP storage station as illustrated by the arrow labeled . Transporting the CP to a secondary CP storage station before transporting the CP to the sample generation station may be appropriate when the task list for a particular CP does not list the location of a molecule to be employed with the CP or when the CP is to be removed from the system before generation of the crystallization trials as illustrated at block .","A CP can be transported from a secondary CP storage station to the sample generation station. For instance, a CP can be transported from the secondary CP storage station to the mixing station as illustrated by the arrow labeled  and then to the sample generation station as illustrated by the arrow labeled . Alternately, the CP can be transported directly from the secondary CP storage station to the sample generation station as illustrated by the arrow labeled . An example of a suitable condition for transporting a CP from the secondary CP storage station to the trial generating station includes, but is not limited to, the condition that a task list is modified so as to associate the location of a molecule solution on the sample generation station with a CP stored in the secondary CP storage station.","A CP may be transported to the sample generation station without being transported to a secondary CP storage station. For instance, a CP can be transported from the screen replicator to the mixing station as illustrated by the arrow labeled  and then to the sample generation station as illustrated by the arrow labeled . Alternately, the CP can be transported directly from the screen replicator directly to the sample generation station as illustrated by the arrow labeled . An example of a suitable condition for transporting a CP from the screen replicator to the sample generation station includes, but is not limited to, when the task list associates the location of a molecule solution on the sample generation station with the CP.","As disclosed above, the CP can be transported to the trial preparation station from the screen replicator, from the mixing station or from the secondary CP storage station as shown by the arrows leading to block .","In the event that an additive solution is to be used with the CP, the additive solution can be dispensed into the well region of one or more trial zones as illustrated at block . The additive solution is extracted from one or more wells in an additive plate. The location of the one or more additive plate wells can be indicated in the task list. Further, the task list can associate particular trial zones with particular wells on the additive plate. As a result, the additive solution from a particular well can be dispensed into particular trial zones. The additive solution can be sequentially dispensed into the trial zones sequentially from the secondary dispenser on the head of the sample generation station. Alternately, the fluid dispensers on the head of the sample generation station can be employed to perform a parallel transfer of additive solutions from a plurality of the additive plate wells into a plurality of the trial zones.","In some instances, a material may be in place over the additive plate wells where the desired additive solution(s) are located. In these instances, the piercer is employed to pierce the material over each of the additive plate wells where a desired additive solution is contained. These additive solutions can be accessed through the openings in the material left by the piercer.","When an additive solution is dispensed into one or more of the trial zones, the CP can be transported from the sample generation station to the mixing station and mixed as shown at block . The CP is transported from the mixing station back to the sample generation station at block .","At block , the sample generation station generates crystallization trials in the CP. The mother liquor from the well regions of one or more trial zones is transferred into the sample region of one or more trial zones. For instance, the fluid dispensers on the head of the sample generation station can be employed to extract the mother liquor from the well region of one or more trial zones and to dispense the mother liquor into the sample region of the one or more trial zones. The sample generation station can be operated such that mother liquor from each trial zone that contains a mother liquor is transferred to a sample region. Alternately, the sample generation station can be operated such that mother liquor from a portion of the trial zones that contains a mother liquor is transferred to a sample region.","When the system is employing hanging drop trials, the sample regions are included on one or more well covers. Accordingly, the sample generation station can transfer mother liquors from one or more well regions to the one or more well covers. The sample generation station can then position the well covers over one or more well regions in the CP. Alternately, the system can include an additional station that positions the well covers over one or more well regions in the CP.","In some instances, the mother liquor is concurrently extracted from the well regions of the trial zones and then concurrently transferred into the sample regions of the trial zones.","Additionally, molecule solution is dispensed into the sample region of one or more trial zones from one or more wells of a molecule plate located on the sample generation station. The location of the one or more molecule plate wells is indicated in the task list. Further, the task list can associate particular trial zones with particular molecule plate wells. As a result, the molecule solution from different molecule plate wells can be dispensed into the sample region of different trial zones. The molecule solution(s) can be sequentially dispensed into the trial zones. Alternately, molecule solution(s) can be concurrently dispensed into a plurality of the trial zones.","In some instances, a material may be in place over the molecule plate wells where the desired molecule solution(s) are located. In these instances, a piercer can be employed to pierce the material over each of the molecule plate wells where a desired molecule solution is contained. These molecule solutions can be accessed through the openings the piercer leaves in the material.","At block , the CP can be transported from the sample generation station to the sealing station where the trial zones are sealed. At block , the CP can be transported from the sealing station to the imaging station where the contents of the trial zones can be imaged. The images of the crystallization trials can be taken within 30 minutes of generating the last crystallization trial at the sample generation station. In some instances, the images are taken 15 minutes of forming the last crystallization trial, within 5 minutes of forming the last crystallization trials or within 2 minutes of forming the last crystallization trial. In one example, images of the crystallization trials are taken within 1 minute of forming the last crystallization trial, within 30 seconds of forming the last crystallization trial or within 15 seconds of forming the last crystallization trial. At block , the CP can be transported to the secondary CP storage station from the imaging station or from the sealing station.","In some instances, one or more of the CPs in the secondary CP storage station is periodically imaged. For instance, a CP can be periodically transported from the secondary CP storage station to the imaging station. The CP contents are imaged at the imaging station and returned to the secondary CP storage station. Periodic imaging of the CPs allows the trial zone contents to be tracked over time. In some instances, the periodic imaging is performed so as to track the sample over time.","An operator can remove a CP from the secondary CP storage station at block .","One or more of the stations disclosed with respect to the above system is optional. Additionally, one or more operations in the methods of  and  are optional. For instance, as evident from the above discussion, screens can be prepared outside of the system and placed into the screen storage station for use by the system. Because the screens stored in the screen storage station can be generated outside of the system, the screen generation station is an optional station.","Although the system is disclosed as having a single controller, the system can include a plurality of controller. The controllers can operate the system in conjunction with one another or can perform various operations independent from one another. Further, portions of the controller can be localized to one or more of the stations.","Although each of the stations above are disclosed as being independent, two or more of the stations can be integrated into a single station. For instance, the screen generation station and the screen storage station can be integrated into a single station. Additionally, some of the stations perform more than one operation on a plate. These stations can be separated into multiple stations. As an example, the system can include an additional station for transferring additive solution(s) to the crystal plates. Further, the covering device disclosed in the context of the screen storage station can be a separate station. For instance, when a sealing medium is employed as a cover on the SSPs, the system can include an additional sealing station that serves as the covering device. Alternately, the disclosed sealing station can be employed as a covering device for covering the SSPs.","Although operation of the system is described as being performed by a single operator, the system may require more than one operator. For instance, different operators can provide different inputs to the controller. Further, one or more operators may prepare solutions for use in the system and one or more operators can provide inputs to the controller.","Other embodiments, combinations and modifications of this invention will occur readily to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of these teachings.
