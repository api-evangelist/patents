More specifically, the invention relates to a zinc oxide sintered compact with high strength and low resistance, that allows production of a high-resistance zinc oxide thin-film by sputtering, to a sputtering target comprising the zinc oxide sintered compact, and to a zinc oxide thin-film.","Zinc oxide is a white powder with a hexagonal crystal structure, and in recent years it is being used for a variety of purposes, in the formation of thin-films. The methods used to form such zinc oxide thin-films include physical vapor deposition methods such as vacuum vapor deposition and sputtering, and chemical vapor deposition methods such as CVD. Sputtering methods are widely employed as methods for forming zinc oxide thin-films, because they allow stable film formation even with low-vapor-pressure materials, and the process is simple.","Sputtering is a method in which a positive ion such as argon ion is physically impacted with a target set on a cathode, the impact energy causing the material of the target to be discharged, accumulating a film of approximately the same composition as the target material on a substrate that has been set facing the target. Sputtering methods include direct current sputtering methods (DC sputtering methods), and radio-frequency sputtering methods (RF sputtering methods). Direct current sputtering methods involve using a DC power supply to apply a direct-current voltage to the cathode target, and they have the advantage of high film-forming speed and high productivity. However, direct current sputtering methods are restrictive in that the resistivity of the target used must be no greater than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. This is because using a target with a resistivity of 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or greater results in non-stable discharge being generated during sputtering.","On the other hand, high-frequency sputtering methods employ a high-frequency power source instead of a DC power supply. Although the target used does not have to be a conducting material, the film deposition rate is slower than with a direct current sputtering method, and the productivity tends to be low. Also, because of the complexity and high cost of the power source and apparatus, equipment cost also tends to be high. A demand therefore exists for a target that can be used in direct current sputtering methods.","Zinc oxide thin-films are typically used as transparent conductive films. For example, zinc oxide thin-films containing zirconium added at 0.1 atomic percent (corresponding to 1120 ppm by weight) or greater have been proposed, which are imparted with conductivity by addition of additives, for use as transparent conductive films for solar cells (PTL 1, for example). However, the electric conductivity of such thin-films is 0.0003 \u03a9\u00b7cm, and they cannot be used as high-resistance thin-films.","Other uses of thin-films composed mainly of zinc oxide are for zinc oxide thin-films with high resistance. For example, the use of zinc oxide thin-films with high resistance values of 1.0 \u03a9\u00b7cm or greater as buffer layers in CIGS thin-film solar cells has been proposed (PTL 2, for example). For such purposes, the resistivity of the zinc oxide thin-film is preferably as high as possible.","The zinc oxide targets used to form such zinc oxide thin-films by sputtering are of high purity, containing absolutely minimal additives or impurities (PTL 3, for example). The reason for this is that the presence of impurities in the film generates carrier electrons from the impurities which lower the resistivity of the film, making it impossible to obtain a thin-film with high resistance (PTL 2).","A zinc oxide thin-film having such high resistance can be formed by sputtering using relatively inexpensive starting materials, but two problems arise in this case.","The first problem is that the zinc oxide target used to form such a thin-film has low conductivity and is therefore unsuitable for direct current sputtering methods. A high-purity zinc oxide target has low impurity-driven carrier generation, and therefore has resistivity of 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or greater. It is therefore unsuitable for direct current sputtering methods. It is therefore necessary to employ high-frequency sputtering methods, which are associated with low film-forming speeds and high equipment cost.","Reactive sputtering is a known strategy for avoiding this problem. The method is one in which argon gas is introduced together with a reactive gas, and the target material discharged by the impact of argon ions reacts with the reactive gas, accumulating as an insulating film on the substrate. It is a feature of the method that it allows formation of insulating films by direct current sputtering using conductive targets. For formation of a high-resistance zinc oxide thin-film, using a conductive metal zinc target and adding oxygen gas to the argon gas for direct current sputtering allows an insulating zinc oxide thin-film to be accumulated. In this method, however, the quality of the zinc oxide thin-film varies significantly depending on the amount of reactive gas added and changes in the zinc deposition rate over time. Control of the reaction is therefore difficult, and it is difficult to obtain a film with stable resistivity.","Another method of forming a zinc oxide thin-film with high resistance has been proposed, in which zinc metal is mixed with zinc oxide powder and firing is conducted at below the melting temperature of zinc (PTL 5). Since the target in this method contains zinc metal, it is possible to lower the resistance. However, since the firing temperature is near the melting point of zinc (419.5\u00b0 C.), densification of zinc oxide does not progress sufficiently. The target is therefore quite brittle, and the target readily cracks during sputtering.","The second problem in forming a zinc oxide thin-film with high resistance by sputtering is the low strength of the target. Here, \u201cstrength\u201d means the physical strength of the target, and the measured value is represented as the transverse intensity. Virtually no impurities are present in a high-purity zinc oxide target. When a target is produced by firing, therefore, there is minimal sintering inhibition by impurities. As a result, although grain growth of the target proceeds, abnormal grain growth also takes place, drastically lowering the strength of the sintered compact. In addition, since the exterior of the sintered compact undergoes sintering and densification before the interior, air bubbles remain in the interior and the density of the sintered compact tends to be reduced. Furthermore, the virtual lack of impurities weakens interaction at the grain boundaries, and cracking, chipping and shedding very frequently take place at the grain boundary sections.","In order to ameliorate this problem, it has been proposed to conduct firing of zinc oxide at a high temperature of 1200\u00b0 C. so that densification occurs through to the interior of the sintered compact (PTL 3). However, firing at such a high temperature results in accelerated grain growth of the sintered compact and increased particle size. As a result, the transverse intensity of the obtained target is less than 40 MPa and it is extremely brittle. The low transverse intensity of such a target tends to lead to cracking of the target in sputtering methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[PTL 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication HEI No. 2-149459","[PTL 2] International Patent Publication No. WO2009\/110092","[PTL 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-167095","[PTL 4] Japanese Patent Public Inspection SHO No. 58-500174","[PTL 5] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No."]}},"Incidentally, cylindrical sputtering targets have begun to come into use in recent years. Cylindrical sputtering targets generate increased interior stress during sputtering, compared to conventional flat targets. Therefore, even higher strength is considered necessary. For this reason, the cylindrical targets in wide use have conventionally been formed of metal materials. On the other hand, targets formed of ceramic materials, which are of low strength and brittle, tend to exhibit cracking during sputtering and production. At the current time, therefore, almost no targets made of ceramic materials are being used, except for targets in thermal spraying methods. A ceramic target in a thermal spraying method will tend to have air bubbles remaining inside the target, and it will therefore be a low-density target, having a relative density of no greater than 90%. This results in the problem that cracking or anomalous discharge of the target can more easily occur during sputtering.","A rotating cathode sputtering apparatus using a cylindrical target is not suitable for high-frequency sputtering. Demand therefore exists for a cylindrical zinc oxide target having high density and high strength, as well as conductivity to allow formation by direct current sputtering methods.","The present invention has been accomplished in light of these circumstances, and one object thereof is to provide a zinc oxide sintered compact and a sputtering target that can adequately inhibit generation of cracks during production of the sputtering target and during sputtering, and that also have high strength. It is another object of the invention to provide a zinc oxide thin-film having both high resistivity and high transmittance, by using the zinc oxide sintered compact.","The present inventors have completed this invention as a result of much diligent research directed toward solving the problems described above. Specifically, the invention is the following.","(1) A zinc oxide sintered compact with a zirconium content of 10 to 1000 ppm.","(2) The zinc oxide sintered compact according to (1), wherein the resistivity is no greater than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm.","(3) The zinc oxide sintered compact according to (1) or (2), which is cylindrical.","(4) A sputtering target comprising a zinc oxide sintered compact according to any one of (1) to (3).","(5) A zinc oxide thin-film having a zirconium content of 10 to 2000 ppm and a resistivity of 10 \u03a9\u00b7cm or greater.","(6) The zinc oxide thin-film according to (5), wherein the zirconium content is 10 to 1000 ppm.","(7) The zinc oxide thin-film according to (5) or (6), wherein the transmittance at a wavelength of 500 nm is 75% or greater with a film thickness of 100 nm.","According to the invention, it is possible to increase the strength of a sintered compact (to 40 MPa or greater, for example) by adding zirconium at 10 to 1000 ppm to a zinc oxide sintered compact. This can prevent occurrence of cracking and chipping while bonding during firing, sintered compact machining and target fabrication, which have occurred in the past due to insufficient strength, and can improve productivity. It can also adequately inhibit cracking of the target during sputtering, and allow stable production of a zinc oxide thin-film with both high resistivity and high transmittance.","Moreover, if the resistivity of the zinc oxide sintered compact is no greater than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm, the sputtering target will be usable for film formation by direct current sputtering.","Furthermore, since the zinc oxide sintered compact has high strength, it allows complex machining into cylindrical shapes and the like. This makes it possible to produce a target for a rotating cathode sputtering apparatus. In addition, this can adequately inhibit cracking of the cylindrical zinc oxide target during sputtering, and allows stable production of a zinc oxide thin-film with both high resistivity and high transmittance.","A zinc oxide thin-film having zirconium added at 10 to 2000 ppm and having high resistivity of 10 \u03a9\u00b7cm or greater can be suitably used as a semiconductor insulating film or solar cell buffer layer.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail. Throughout the present specification, \u201cppm\u201d for zirconium represents the zirconium weight-based content, of the total weight (wt ppm).","<Zinc Oxide Sintered Compact>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10","10","10"]},"A greater zirconium content will tend to increase the strength of the zinc oxide sintered compact . However, a zirconium content of greater than 1000 ppm will lower the resistivity of a zinc oxide thin-film formed using a sputtering target comprising the sintered compact. The effect of allowing production of a zinc oxide thin-film with high resistance will be reduced as a result. The zirconium content of the zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment is therefore between 10 and 1000 ppm.","By adding zirconium within this range, it will be possible to increase the strength of the zinc oxide sintered compact  while allowing production of a zinc oxide thin-film with high resistance when the sintered compact is used as a target. From the viewpoint of obtaining a zinc oxide sintered compact with even higher strength, the zirconium content is preferably 30 to 1000 ppm.","The zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment thus has high strength. It can therefore be used as a cylindrical zinc oxide-based target. It can also be suitably used as a sputtering target.","The resistivity of the zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment is preferably no greater than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. Such low resistivity of the zinc oxide sintered compact  will allow its use as a sputtering target in a direct current sputtering method. There are no particular restrictions on the method of limiting the resistivity to no greater than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. For example, the zirconium content of the zinc oxide sintered compact  may be set at 500 ppm or greater, or oxygen defects may be created in the zinc oxide to lower the bulk resistance value. When oxygen defects are present in zinc oxide, carriers are generated and the resistivity of the zinc oxide sintered compact  is reduced.","The method for creating oxygen defects is not particularly restricted. For example, the oxygen partial pressure in the atmosphere may be lowered during firing of the zinc oxide sintered compact . It will thus be possible to lower the resistivity of the zinc oxide sintered compact  to about 1\/100 compared to firing in air, even when the zirconium content is less than 500 ppm. When a zinc oxide sintered compact  having such oxygen defects is to be used to fabricate a target for film formation by sputtering, oxygen deficiency may be compensated by adding a trace amount of oxygen gas.","The zinc oxide sintered compact  containing zirconium may be produced in the following manner, as an example. Specifically, the production method described here has a mixing step in which a powder containing zinc oxide and a zirconium source is prepared, a molding step in which the powder is molded to produce a compact, and a firing step in which the compact is fired. Each step will now be explained in detail.","[Mixing Step]","The zinc oxide powder starting material used is preferably one with as few impurities as possible, in order to minimize lowering the resistivity of the zinc oxide thin-film. The zirconium source that is added is not particularly restricted so long as it contains zirconium, and it may be zirconium metal, a zirconium salt such as zirconium chloride, a zirconium complex, zirconium oxide (zirconia), partially stabilized zirconia, stabilized zirconia, or alumina-added zirconia.","Preferred among these zirconium sources are zirconium oxide, partially stabilized zirconia, stabilized zirconia and alumina-added zirconia, which are oxides like zinc oxide. There are no particular restrictions on the properties of additives. When a powder is used as an additive, it is preferably a fine powder in order to improve dispersibility.","The method for mixing the zinc oxide powder and zirconium source is not particularly restricted. The zinc oxide powder and zirconium source are preferably mixed to as uniform a state as possible. The mixing method may be a method of dry ball mill mixing, wet bead mill mixing or agitated mixing. Methods in which zinc oxide powder mixed with a prescribed amount of a zirconium source is further mixed with zinc oxide powder, for dilution to a prescribed concentration, are also effective as methods for achieving uniform mixing.","A different method for adding and mixing a zirconium source is one in which zirconium oxide is used as the medium for the grinding, mixing or dispersing apparatus. Specifically, this method involves using a container with zirconia beads and\/or lined with zirconia as the grinding, mixing and dispersing apparatus, for grinding, mixing and dispersion of zinc oxide in order to mix a trace amount of zirconium with the zinc oxide powder. This method is advantageous in that it prevents the medium for the grinding, mixing and dispersing apparatus from becoming a contaminating source, and the medium serves as a zirconium source.","For example, zinc oxide is prepared as a slurry and dispersed with zirconia beads in a zirconia-lined container. This will allow uniform mixing of zirconium and zinc oxide. Using such a method will allow uniform mixing of a trace amount of zirconium with the zinc oxide. The amount of addition may be adjusted by the mixing time, allowing the zirconium content of the final zinc oxide sintered compact  to be controlled to between 10 and 1000 ppm.","The grinding, mixing and dispersing apparatus may be either dry or wet, but it is preferably wet from the viewpoint of obtaining a more uniform dispersed state of the zirconium.","The final state of the powder is not particularly restricted. For molding with a dry system, it is preferred to use a granulated powder so that the powder flow property is high and the compact density is uniform. The granulation method is also not particularly restricted, and may be spraying granulation, fluidized bed granulation, tumbling granulation, agitated granulation or the like. Spraying granulation is preferably employed because the procedure is easy and it allows treatment in bulk.","There are no particular restrictions on the physical properties of the powder. From the viewpoint of obtaining a high-density zinc oxide sintered compact , however, the BET specific surface area of the powder is preferably 2 to 20 m\/g and more preferably 4 to 10 m\/g. If the BET specific surface area is lower than 2 m\/g, densification of the sintered compact will proceed with greater difficulty, tending to result in low density and reduced strength of the sintered compact. If the BET specific surface area is higher than 20 m\/g, on the other hand, the powder will tend to aggregate, thereby hampering molding. In addition, the high sinterability tends to promote grain growth during firing, resulting in coarse particles and reduced strength of the sintered compact.","The mean secondary particle size of the powder is preferably no greater than 1.5 \u03bcm and more preferably 0.1 to 1.5 \u03bcm, in consideration of the powder moldability and sinterability. Using such a powder can improve the sintered compact density. Here, the \u201csecondary particle size\u201d is the particle size for aggregated primary particles as observed by TEM or the like. The secondary particle size can be measured with a wet particle size distribution meter or the like, after suspension of the powder.","The bulk density of the powder is preferably 0.5 to 1.8 g\/cm. Powder with a bulk density within this range will have excellent handleability and high molding yield. In addition, it can increase the density of the obtained zinc oxide sintered compact. The angle of repose of the powder is preferably no greater than 45\u00b0. A greater value will tend to impair the flow property of the powder, making it difficult to achieve uniform packing of the powder. The angle of repose of the powder is more preferably no greater than 35\u00b0, from the viewpoint of further improving the powder flow property.","[Molding Step]","The method for producing the compact is not particularly restricted, and for example, a die press molding method, cold isostatic press molding method or cast molding method may be used. The powder or slurry used as starting material may contain an organic or inorganic binder. Such methods may be used to fabricate compacts of various shapes, such as flat or cylindrical.\n\n[Firing Step]\n\nThe obtained compact is formed into a sintered compact by firing at high temperature. The production apparatus used to produce the sintered compact is not particularly restricted, and for example, an electric furnace, gas furnace or hot press may be used. Preferred among these is an electric furnace, in terms of productivity, temperature distribution in the furnace and relative low cost of the apparatus.\n","According to this embodiment, zirconium is mixed with zinc oxide at 10 ppm or greater to obtain a dense sintered compact with a relative density of 95% or greater. The reason for this is as follows. Specifically, zirconium inhibits firing of zinc oxide during the firing. As a result, since the shrinkage speed during firing is reduced, the particle size of the sintered compact particles is smaller than when no zirconium is present. In addition, the differential shrinkage between the exterior and interior by firing is reduced, leaving fewer air bubbles inside the sintered compact. This yields a high-density sintered compact. Furthermore, addition of zirconium increases the strength of interaction at the grain boundaries, and can inhibit cracking, chipping and shedding at the grain boundaries.","The firing conditions are not particularly restricted, but from the viewpoint of shortening the firing time and preventing cracking, the temperature-elevating rate is preferably 10\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C.\/hr. From the same viewpoint, the firing temperature is preferably 900\u00b0 C. to 1200\u00b0 C. In addition, from the viewpoint of obtaining a dense sintered compact with a relative density of 97% or greater, the firing temperature is preferably 950\u00b0 C. to 1150\u00b0 C. The temperature-lowering rate is preferably 10\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C.\/hr from the viewpoint of preventing cracking. Especially in order to prevent cracking of the sintered compact by heat shock, the temperature when the sintered compact is removed from the furnace is preferably close to room temperature.","A higher density of the zinc oxide sintered compact can increase the strength. The relative density is therefore preferably 95% or greater and more preferably 97% or greater. A smaller particle size for the particles composing the zinc oxide sintered compact will increase the strength. Thus, the mean particle size of the particles of the zinc oxide sintered compact is preferably 1-15 \u03bcm and more preferably 1-10 \u03bcm.","The hardness of the sintered compact is preferably 120HV10 or greater and more preferably 150HV10 or greater, in terms of Vickers hardness. Such a sintered compact will exhibit increased strength. In order to prevent cracking of the target during sputtering, the target must have higher strength than the thermal stress generated in the target during sputtering. The thermal stress will differ depending on the sputtering conditions and sputter apparatus, but will generally be about 40 Mpa. Therefore, in order to prevent cracking of the target during sputtering, the target must have a strength, i.e. transverse intensity, that is greater than this level.","By using the zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment as the target, it is possible to obtain a target transverse intensity of 40 MPa or greater. This can adequately inhibit cracking and chipping of the sintered compact during firing and sintered compact machining, and will allow increased yield to be obtained. It will also make it possible to minimize defects (pinholes) in the substrate that are caused by anomalous discharge resulting from cracking of the target during sputtering. This will allow stable film formation, so that a zinc oxide thin-film can be produced at high yield.","In the zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment, zirconium generates carrier electrons, lowering the resistivity of the sintered compact. Thus, firing at high temperature results in a resistivity of 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or lower. The target can therefore be suitably used as a target for a direct current sputtering method. For stable direct current sputtering, however, the resistivity of the zinc oxide sintered compact  is preferably lowered still further.","In order to obtain a zinc oxide sintered compact  with an even lower resistivity, an inert gas or nitrogen gas is introduced into the firing furnace to lower the oxygen partial pressure in the firing atmosphere, and the zinc oxide compact is fired in that state. The oxygen partial pressure in the firing atmosphere will depend on the amount of zinc oxide compact to be fired. If the gas flow rate of introduction is represented as A (L\/min) and the charging mass of the compact to be fired is represented as B (kg), the ratio is defined as the gas flow rate parameter, according to the following formula.\n\nGas flow rate parameter=\n","If the gas flow rate parameter is no greater than 2.0, resulting in a zirconium content of at least 10 ppm in the zinc oxide sintered compact , the resistivity of the sintered compact will be no greater than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm even if the firing temperature is 1100\u00b0 C. or below.","The zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment can be used as a sputtering target. The zinc oxide sintered compact  may be machined to prescribed dimensions. The machining method is not particularly restricted, and for example, a surface grinding method, rotary grinding method or cylindrical grinding method may be employed. Since the zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment contains a prescribed amount of zirconium, the particle size of the sintered compact is small and the grain boundary strength is increased. At the same time, the sintered compact is densified and the hardness of the sintered compact is increased. Cracking and chipping therefore occur less frequently during polishing of the sintered compact to the prescribed target dimensions. As a result, the yield during production of sputtering targets is increased.","The zinc oxide sintered compact  of this embodiment, and the zinc oxide sintered compact  described below, may if necessary be anchored (bonded) to a flat or cylindrical support using a bonding agent such as a solder material. The material of the support is not particularly restricted so long as it has high thermal conductivity and strength capable of supporting the sintered compact. The material of the support is preferably a metal such as Cu (copper), SUS (stainless steel) or Ti (titanium), for high thermal conductivity and high strength, and more preferably Ti (titanium) because it has a coefficient of thermal expansion close to that of zinc oxide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":"20"},"The adhesive material (bonding material) used to bond the sintered compact and the support is not particularly restricted so long as it has sufficient bonding strength for support, and for example, a conductive resin, tin-based solder material or indium-based solder material may be used. Of these, indium solder is preferred because it has high conductivity and thermal conductivity, and is soft and easily deformed. The reason for this is to allow efficient cooling of the heat on the target surface, and to allow absorption of the stress between the sintered compact and the support that is generated by thermal expansion to prevent cracking of the sintered compact.","If air bubbles (voids) remain in the adhesive material when the zinc oxide sintered compacts ,  are bonded with the support with the adhesive material, the thermal conductivity will tend to be reduced at those sections. When air bubbles are present, it becomes impossible to efficiently cool the heat generated on the target surface during sputtering, and cracking of the target tends to occur. Air bubbles can be examined by X-ray photography or an ultrasonic inspection device. The bonding rate between the zinc oxide sintered compacts ,  and the support may be defined by the following formula.\n\nbonding rate=(area to be bonded\u2212void area)\/area to be bonded\u00d7100\n","During sputtering, the support undergoes little expansion because it is being cooled by cooling water. On the other hand, the sputtering target expands by the heat generated by sputtering, regardless of its shape. With a flat target such as shown in , therefore, the distance between the target and the support does not change. However, with a cylindrical target such as shown in , the distance between the target and the support increases due to thermal expansion of the target. Therefore, force is applied perpendicular to the interface between the sintered compact and the adhesive material, increasing detachment from the air bubble sections and lowering the heat conduction, with targets that have a low bonding rate. Consequently, a cylindrical target with a low bonding rate tends to result in more cracking than a flat target.","When a flat sintered compact  such as shown in  is used as the sputtering target, the bonding rate is preferably at least 90% from the viewpoint of preventing cracking. When a cylindrical zinc oxide sintered compact  such as shown in  is used as the target, however, the bonding rate is preferably at least 95% and more preferably at least 97%, from the same viewpoint.","The zinc oxide sintered compacts ,  have higher strength than common high-purity zinc oxide sputtering targets. Stress between the sintered compact  and the support, generated by thermal expansion during bonding of the cylindrical sintered compact , can therefore be adequately withstood. It is thus possible to produce a sputtering target at high yield.","<Sputtering Target>","The sputtering target of this embodiment (also referred to simply as \u201ctarget\u201d) comprises the aforementioned zinc oxide sintered compact, and the zinc oxide sintered compact may be used directly or machined for use in sputtering. Thus, the sputtering target of this embodiment may have either the cylindrical or flat shape shown in  or . The sputtering target of this embodiment also has the same composition as the zinc oxide sintered compact described above.","Because the sputtering target of this embodiment comprises the zinc oxide sintered compact described above, it has high density and high grain boundary strength. During sputtering, therefore, cracking of the target does not easily occur and particle generation is minimal. It is also possible to inhibit generation of black protrusion-like matter (nodules) that takes place on the target surface during sputtering. Furthermore, the high density results in high thermal conductivity, and also resistance to cracking by thermal stress even with application of high power to the target. Therefore, defects (pinholes) in the substrate can be reduced during production of a zinc oxide thin-film by sputtering. As a result, in addition to the high yield, the target can be used for prolonged periods.","<Zinc Oxide Thin-Film>","The zinc oxide thin-film of this embodiment (also referred to simply as \u201cthin-film\u201d) is obtained using the sputtering target described above. The zinc oxide thin-film therefore has the same composition as the sputtering target (zinc oxide sintered compact). That is, by forming a film using a sputtering target made of a zinc oxide sintered compact containing zinc oxide as the major component and having a zirconium content of 10 to 1000 ppm, it is possible to obtain a zinc oxide thin-film having a zirconium content that is approximately equal to that of the sputtering target.","The zinc oxide thin-film of this embodiment has a zirconium content of 10 to 2000 ppm, and high resistivity of 10 \u03a9\u00b7cm or greater.","There are no particular restrictions on the method for producing the zinc oxide thin-film of this embodiment, and examples include chemical vapor deposition methods such as CVD, methods of suspending or dissolving it in a solvent for coating, and methods of film formation by sputtering or the like. Sputtering is preferred among these methods. The sputtering target used for sputtering may be a zinc oxide sintered compact produced with a prescribed concentration of zirconium. A zinc oxide thin-film may also be formed by sputtering using a zinc oxide target with zirconium on-chip. Incidentally, a zinc oxide thin-film with a zirconium content of 10 to 1000 ppm can be obtained by sputtering the sputtering target described above.","As shown in  explained below, the zinc oxide thin-film of this embodiment has high resistivity, because it contains zirconium at 10 ppm or greater. High resistivity is also exhibited up to a zirconium concentration of about 1000 ppm. Exceeding approximately 1000 ppm, however, results in drastically reduced resistivity. Nevertheless, high resistivity of 10 \u03a9\u00b7cm or greater, necessary for use as a highly resistant film layer for a solar cell such as a CIGS, is maintained until 2000 ppm is exceeded. The zinc oxide thin-film of this embodiment must therefore have its zirconium content limited to no greater than 2000 ppm. In order to obtain a zinc oxide thin-film with a sufficiently high resistance value, as shown in , the upper limit is 1000 ppm, as the region in which the resistance value begins to fall, and the zirconium content is between 10 and 1000 ppm.","It is not completely understood why the resistance value increases at about 10 ppm or greater and then falls at about 1000 ppm or greater, when the zirconium content is increased in this manner. It is considered likely that the locations where zirconium is present vary depending on the zirconium content, resulting in inhibition or increase in the conductivity of the thin-film, and that the threshold values for this variation are near 10 ppm and 1000 ppm.","The change in resistivity of a thin-film due to the sputtering conditions is not very significant up to a zirconium content of about 1000 ppm. However, a zirconium content of 1200 ppm or greater can potentially lower the resistivity of a thin-film in sputtering with argon gas alone. Therefore, by introducing a small amount of oxygen gas during sputtering, it is possible to inhibit carrier generation and increase the resistance value of the thin-film. Oxygen gas may also be introduced during sputtering even if the zirconium content is between 10 and 1000 ppm. The aforementioned effect is obtained if the amount of oxygen gas introduced is at least 0.2 vol % with respect to the amount of argon gas introduced. From the viewpoint of obtaining a thin-film with even higher resistance, the amount of oxygen gas introduced is preferably at least 0.4 vol %.","The zinc oxide thin-film of this embodiment has high transmittance since carrier generation is adequately inhibited by zirconium. With a film thickness of 100 nm, for example, very high transmittance, such as transmittance of 75% or greater, can be achieved not only at a wavelength of 500 nm but also across a wide range of 400 to 1200 nm. It is therefore suitable for use as a buffer layer or the like in a thin-film solar cell.","The embodiments described above are preferred embodiments of the invention, but the invention is not limited thereto. For example, the shape of the zinc oxide sintered compact is not limited to the shapes shown in  and , and may instead be another shape.","The invention will now be explained in greater detail with respect to examples and comparative examples, with the understanding that the invention is not limited to the examples.

Thus, 2000 g of a mixed powder with a zirconium content of 45 ppm was obtained. Next, a 500 \u03bcm sieve was used for adjustment of the mixed powder size, to finally obtain approximately 1990 g of mixed powder.
