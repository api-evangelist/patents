{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60\/206,497, filed May 23, 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention was made, at least in part, with support from the National Institutes of Health Grant Nos. R01-NS36420 and R21-DK53160, and AFAR Research Grant. The U.S. government may have certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to an improved method for producing herpes simplex virus (\u201cHSV\u201d) amplicons, the resulting HSV amplicons, and their use in gene therapy.","The ability to deliver genes to the nervous system, and to manipulate their expression, may make possible the treatment of numerous neurological disorders. Unfortunately, gene transfer into the central nervous system (\u201cCNS\u201d) presents several problems including the relative inaccessibility of the brain and the blood-brain-barrier, and that neurons of the postnatal brain are post-mitotic. The standard approach for somatic cell gene transfer, i.e., that of retroviral vectors, is not feasible for the brain, as retrovirally mediated gene transfer requires at least one cell division for integration and expression. A number of new vectors and non-viral methods have therefore been used for gene transfer in the CNS. Although the first studies of gene transfer in the CNS used an ex vivo approach, i.e., the transplantation of retrovirally-transduced cells, more recently several groups have also used an in vivo approach.","The in vivo approach was initially largely based on the use of the neurotropic herpes simplex virus (\u201cHSV\u201d), however, HSV vectors present several problems, including instability of expression and reversion to wild-type.","The genome of HSV-1 is about 150 kb of linear, double-stranded DNA, featuring about 70 genes. Many viral genes may be deleted without the virus losing its ability to propagate. The \u201cimmediately early\u201d (\u201cIE\u201d) genes are transcribed first. They encode trans-acting factors which regulate expression of other viral genes. The \u201cearly\u201d (\u201cE\u201d) gene products participate in replication of viral DNA. The late genes encode the structural components of the virion as well as proteins which turn on transcription of the IE and E genes or disrupt host cell protein translation.","After viral entry into the nucleus of a neuron, the viral DNA can enter a state of latency, existing as circular episomal elements in the nucleus. While in the latent state, its transcriptional activity is reduced. If the virus does not enter latency, or if it is reactivated, the virus produces numerous infectious particles, which leads rapidly to the death of the neuron. HSV-1 is efficiently transported between synaptically connected neurons, and hence can spread rapidly through the nervous system.","Two types of HSV vectors previously have been utilized for gene transfer into the nervous system. Recombinant HSV vectors involve the removal of an immediate-early gene within the HSV genome (ICP4, for example), and replacement with the gene of interest. Although removal of this gene prevents replication and spread of the virus within cells which do not complement for the missing HSV protein, all of the other genes within the HSV genome are retained. Replication and spread of such viruses in vivo is thereby limited, but expression of viral genes within infected cells continues. Several of the viral expression products may be directly toxic to the recipient cell, and expression of viral genes within cells expressing MHC antigens can induce harmful immune reactions. In addition, nearly all adults harbor latent herpes simplex viruses within neurons, and the presence of recombinant HSV vectors could result in recombinations which can produce an actively replicating wild-type virus. Alternatively, expression of viral genes from the recombinant vector within a cell harboring a latent virus might promote reactivation of the virus. Finally, long-term expression from the recombinant HSV vector in the CNS has not been reliably demonstrated. It is likely that, except for conditions in which latency is induced, the inability of HSV genomes to integrate within host DNA results in susceptibility to degradation of the vector DNA.","In an attempt to circumvent the difficulties inherent in the recombinant HSV vector, defective HSV vectors were employed as gene transfer vehicles within the nervous system. The defective HSV vector is a plasmid-based system, whereby a plasmid vector (termed an amplicon) is generated which contains the gene of interest and two cis-acting HSV recognition signals. These are the origin of DNA replication and the cleavage packaging signal. These sequences encode no HSV gene products. In the presence of HSV proteins provided by a helper virus, the amplicon is replicated and packaged into an HSV coat. This vector therefore expresses no viral gene products within the recipient cell, and recombination with or reactivation of latent viruses by the vector is limited due to the minimal amount of HSV DNA sequence present within the defective HSV vector genome. The major limitation of this system, however, is the inability to eliminate residual helper virus from the defective vector stock. The helper virus is often a mutant HSV which, like the recombinant vectors, can only replicate under permissive conditions in tissue culture. The continued presence of mutant helper HSV within the defective vector stock, however, presents problems which are similar to those enumerated above in regard to the recombinant HSV vector. This would therefore serve to limit the usefulness of the defective HSV vector for human applications.","While HSV vectors of reduced toxicity and replication ability have been suggested, they can still mutate to a more dangerous form, or activate a latent virus, and, since the HSV does not integrate, achieving long-term expression would be difficult.","To avoid the difficulties raised with the use of helper viruses, newer methods of packaging have been developed that result in \u201chelper virus-free\u201d amplicon stocks (Fraefel et al., \u201cHelper virus-free transfer of herpes simplex virus type 1 plasmid vectors into neural cells,\u201d 70:7190-7197 (1996); Stavropoulos and Strathdee, \u201cAn enhanced packaging system for helper-dependent herpes simplex virus vectors,\u201d 72:7137-43 (1998)). Stocks produced by these means, however, are typically of low titer (approximately 10expression units\/ml or less), allowing for only modest in vitro experimentation. Such low titers discourage investigators from performing the large animal studies required to develop and assess amplicon-directed therapies in mammals, including humans.","The present invention is directed to overcoming these deficiencies in the art.","A first aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing herpes simplex virus (\u201cHSV\u201d) amplicon particles, which includes co-transfecting a host cell with the following: (i) an amplicon vector comprising an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a heterologous transgene expressible in a patient, (ii) one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals, and (iii) a vhs expression vector encoding a virion host shutoff protein; and then isolating HSV amplicon particles produced by the host cell, the HSV amplicon particles including the transgene.","A second aspect of the present invention relates to HSV amplicon particles produced according to the method of the present invention.","A third aspect of the present invention relates to a system for preparing HSV amplicon particles which includes: an amplicon vector comprising an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a transgene insertion site; one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals; and a vhs expression vector encoding a virion host shutoff protein; wherein upon introduction of the system into a host cell, the host cell produces herpes simplex virus amplicon particles.","A fourth aspect of the present invention relates to a kit for preparing HSV amplicon particles which includes: an amplicon vector comprising an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a transgene insertion site; one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals; a vhs expression vector encoding an virion host shutoff protein; a population of host cells susceptible to transfection by the amplicon vector, the vhs expression vector, and the one or more vectors; and directions for transfecting the host cells under conditions to produce HSV amplicon particles.","A fifth aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a neurological disease or disorder which includes providing HSV amplicon particles of the present invention that include a transgene encoding a therapeutic transgene product and exposing neural or pre-neural cells of a patient to the HSV amplicon particles under conditions effective for infective transformation of the neural or pre-neural cells, wherein the therapeutic transgene product is expressed in vivo in the neural or pre-neural cells, thereby treating the neurological disease or disorder.","A sixth aspect of the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting development of a neurological disease or disorder which includes providing HSV amplicon particles of the present invention that include a transgene encoding a therapeutic transgene product and exposing neural or pre-neural cells of a patient susceptible to development of a neurological disease or disorder to the HSV amplicon particles under conditions effective for infective transformation of the neural or pre-neural cells of the patient, wherein the therapeutic transgene product is expressed in vivo in the neural or pre-neural cells, thereby inhibiting development of the neurological disease or disorder.","A seventh aspect of the present invention relates to a method of expressing a therapeutic gene product in a patient which includes providing HSV amplicon particles of the present invention that include a transgene encoding a therapeutic transgene product and exposing patient cells to the HSV amplicon particles under conditions effective for infective transformation of the cells, wherein the therapeutic transgene product is expressed in vivo in transformed cells.","In an effort to enhance amplicon titers, the present invention involves introduction in trans of a vector including a sequence which encodes a virion host shutoff protein. Co-transfection of this plasmid, specifically one containing the HSV virion host shutoff (\u201cvhs\u201d) protein-encoding gene UL41, with the amplicon and packaging reagents results in a 10-fold higher amplicon titer and stocks that do not exhibit the pseudotransduction phenomenon. To further enhance packaging efficiency, the HSV transcriptional activator VP16 was introduced into packaging cells prior to the packaging components. Pre-loading of packaging cells with VP16 led to an additional enhancement of amplicon titers, an effect that did not occur in the absence of vhs. Increased helper virus-free amplicon titers resulting from these modifications will make in vivo transduction experiments more feasible.","One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing herpes simplex virus (HSV) amplicon particles. This method is carried out by co-transfecting a host cell with several vectors and then isolating HSV amplicon particles produced by the host cell. The vectors used to transfect the host cell include: (i) an amplicon vector comprising an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a heterologous transgene expressible in a patient; (ii) one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals; and (iii) a vhs expression vector encoding a virion host shutoff protein. As a result of the transgene being included in the HSV amplicon vector, the HSV amplicon particles include the transgene.","The amplicon vector is any HSV amplicon vector which includes an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a heterologous transgene expressible in a patient. The amplicon vector can also include a selectable marker gene and an antibiotic resistance gene.","The HSV cleavage\/packaging signal can be any suitable cleavage\/packaging signal such that the vector can be packaged into a particle that is capable of adsorbing to a cell (i.e., which is to be transformed). A suitable packaging signal is the HSV-1 a segment located at approximately nucleotides 127-1132 of the a sequence of the HSV-1 virus or its equivalent (Davison et al., \u201cNucleotide sequences of the joint between the L and S segments of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 255:315-331 (1981), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The HSV origin of replication can be any suitable origin of replication which allows for replication of the amplicon vector in the host cell which is to be used for replication and packaging of the vector into the HSV amplicon particles. A suitable origin of replication is the HSV-1 c region which contains the HSV-1 orisegment located at approximately nucleotides 47-1066 of the HSV-1 virus or its equivalent (McGeogh et al., 14:1727-1745 (1986), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Origin of replication signals from other related viruses (e.g., HSV-2) can also be used.","Selectable marker genes are known in the art and include, without limitation, galactokinase, beta-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, beta-lactamase, green fluorescent protein (\u201cgfp\u201d), alkaline phosphate, etc.","Antibiotic resistance genes are known in the art and include, without limitation, ampicillin, streptomycin, spectromycin, etc.","A number of suitable empty amplicon vectors have previously been described in the art, including without limitation: pHSVlac (ATCC Accession 40544; U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,979 to Geller et al.; Stavropoulos and Strathdee, \u201cAn enhanced packaging system for helper-dependent herpes simplex virus vectors,\u201d 72:7137-43 (1998), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) and pHENK (U.S. Pat. No. 6,040,172 to Kaplitt et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference. The pHSVlac vector includes the HSV-1 a segment, the HSV-1 c region, an ampicillin resistance marker, and an lacZ marker. The pHENK vector include the HSV-1 a segment, an HSV-1 ori segment, an ampicillin resistance marker, and an lacZ marker under control of the promoter region isolated from the rat preproenkephalin gene (i.e., a promoter operable in brain cells).","These empty amplicon vectors can be modified by introducing therein, at an appropriate restriction site, either a complete transgene which has already been assembled or a coding sequence can be ligated into an empty amplicon vector which already contains appropriate regulatory sequences (promoter, enhancer, polyadenylation signal, transcription terminator, etc.) positioned on either side of the restriction site where the coding sequence is to be inserted, thereby forming the transgene upon ligation. Alternatively, when using the pHSVlac vector, the lacZ coding sequence can be excised using appropriate restriction enzymes and replaced with a coding sequence for the transgene.","The use of restriction enzymes for cutting DNA and the use of DNA ligase to ligate together two or more DNA molecules can be performed using conventional molecular genetic manipulation for subcloning gene fragments, as described by Sambrook et al., , Cold Springs Laboratory, Cold Springs Harbor, N.Y. (1989); Ausubel et al. (ed.), , John Wiley & Sons (New York, N.Y.) (1999 and preceding editions); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,224 issued to Cohen and Boyer, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Suitable transgenes will include one or more appropriate promoter elements which are capable of directing the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase, optionally one or more enhancer elements, and suitable transcription terminators or polyadenylation signals.","Basically, the promoter elements should be selected such that the promoter will be operable in the cells of the patient which are ultimately intended to be transformed (i.e., during gene therapy). A number of promoters have been identified which are capable of regulating expression within a broad range of cell types. These include, without limitation, HSV immediate-early 4\/5 (IE4\/5) promoter, cytomegalovirus (\u201cCMV\u201d) promoter, SV40 promoter, and \u03b2-actin promoter. Likewise, a number of other promoters have been identified which are capable of regulating expression within a narrow range of cell types. These include, without limitation, neural-specific enolase (NSE) promoter, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter, GFAP promoter, preproenkephalin (PPE) promoter, myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter, insulin promoter, cholineacetyltransferase (CHAT) promoter, dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) promoter, calmodulin dependent kinase (CamK) promoter, c-fos promoter, c-jun promoter, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter, erythropoietin (EPO) promoter, and EGR-1 promoter.","The transcription termination signal should, likewise, be selected such that they will be operable in the cells of the patient which are ultimately intended to be transformed. Suitable transcription termination signals include, without limitation, polyA signals of HSV genes such as the vhs polyadenylation signal, SV40 polyA signal, and CMV IE1 polyA signal.","When used for gene therapy, the transgene encodes a therapeutic transgene product, which can be either a protein or an RNA molecule.","Therapeutic RNA molecules include, without limitation, antisense RNA, inhibitory RNA (RNAi), and an RNA ribozyme. The RNA ribozyme can be either cis or trans acting, either modifying the RNA transcript of the transgene to afford a functional RNA molecule or modifying another nucleic acid molecule. Exemplary RNA molecules include, without limitation, antisense RNA, ribozymes, or RNAi to nucleic acids for huntingtin, alpha synuclein, scatter factor, amyloid precursor protein, p53, VEGF, etc.","Therapeutic proteins include, without limitation, receptors, signaling molecules, transcription factors, growth factors, apoptosis inhibitors, apoptosis promoters, DNA replication factors, enzymes, structural proteins, neural proteins, and histone or non-histone proteins. Exemplary protein receptors include, without limitation, all steroid\/thyroid family members, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophins 3 and 4\/5, glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), cilary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), persephin, artemin, neurturin, bone morphogenetic factors (BMPs), c-ret, gp130, dopamine receptors (D1-D5), muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factors, leptin, resistin, and orexin. Exemplary protein signaling molecules include, without limitation, all of the above-listed receptors plus MAPKs, ras, rac, ERKs, NFKB, GSK3\u03b2, AKT, and PI3K Exemplary protein transcription factors include, without limitation, p300, CBP, HIF-1 alpha, NPAS1 and 2, HIF-1\u03b2, p53, p73, nurr 1, nurr 77, MASHs, REST, and NCORs. Exemplary neural proteins include, without limitation, neurofilaments, GAP-43, SCG-10, etc. Exemplary enzymes include, without limitation, TH, DBH, aromatic aminoacid decarboxylase, parkin, unbiquitin E3 ligases, ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, cholineacetyltransferase, neuropeptide processing enzymes, dopamine, VMAT and other catecholamine transporters.

Exemplary pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins include, without limitation, bax, bid, bak, bcl-xs, bcl-xl, bcl-2, caspases, SMACs, and IAPs.","The one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals can either be in the form of a set of vectors or a single bacterial-artificial chromosome (\u201cBAC\u201d), which is formed, for example, by combining the set of vectors to create a single, double-stranded vector. Preparation and use of a five cosmid set is disclosed in (Fraefel et al., \u201cHelper virus-free transfer of herpes simplex virus type 1 plasmid vectors into neural cells,\u201d 70:7190-7197 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Ligation of the cosmids together to form a single BAC is disclosed in Stavropoulos and Strathdee, \u201cAn enhanced packaging system for helper-dependent herpes simplex virus vectors,\u201d 72:7137-43 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The BAC described in Stavropoulos and Strathdee includes a pac cassette inserted at a BamHI site located within the UL41 coding sequence, thereby disrupting expression of the HSV-1 virion host shutoff protein.","By \u201cessential HSV genes\u201d, it is intended that the one or more vectors include all genes which encode polypeptides that are necessary for replication of the amplicon vector and structural assembly of the amplicon particles. Thus, in the absence of such genes, the amplicon vector is not properly replicated and packaged within a capsid to form an amplicon particle capable of adsorption. Such \u201cessential HSV genes\u201d have previously been reported in review articles by Roizman (\u201cThe Function of Herpes Simplex Virus Genes: A Primer for Genetic Engineering of Novel Vectors,\u201d 93:11307-11312 (1996); \u201cHSV Gene Functions: What Have We Learned That Could Be Generally Application to its Near and Distant Cousins?\u201d 43(2-3):75-80 (1999), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

NP045229 and NC001844, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","When performing an initial transfection step prior to co-transfection, the transfection with a vector encoding the VP16 protein can be carried out at least about 1 hour before the co-transfection step, more preferably at least about 4 hours before, and most preferably at least about 12 hours before. Maximal amplicon particle titers have been achieved following transfection of host cells (with VP16) about 24 hours prior to the co-transfection step described below. When prior transfection of the host cell is carried out, a preferred vector encoding the HSV-1 VP16 protein is vector pGREvp16, whose structure is illustrated in .","In host cells transiently expressing VP16, the plasmid encoding VP16 is lost in up to about 50% of the cells per doubling of the cell population.","Stable expression of VP16 can be achieved either using a stable plasmid which is copied and partitioned among dividing host cells with acceptable fidelity or by integration of the VP16 into the host cell genome. Plasmids which are stable in vitro cell lines are known in the art and can be used to introduce UL48 thereon. Also, integration can be carried out according to known procedures.","Preparation of HSV amplicon particles can be carried out by co-transfecting a suitable host cell with (i) the amplicon vector, (ii) either the set of cosmid vectors or BAC, and (iii) the vhs expression vector. Basically, the various vectors are introduced into a single medium (e.g., Opti-MEM available from Gibco-BRL, Bethesda, Md.) within a container (e.g., sterile polypropylene tube), forming a DNA mix. The weight ratio of BAC:amplicon vector is between about 1-10:1, preferably about 5-10:1, and the weight ratio of 5 cosmid set (in total):amplicon vector is between about 1-10:1, preferably about 2-7:1. The DNA mix is later introduced into a container (with Lipofectanine reagent) which has been seeded with the host cells to be co-transfected. Thereafter, the transfection mix is diluted with an equal volume of a selection medium (e.g., DMEM plus 20% FBS, 2% penicillin\/streptomycin, and 2 mM hexamethylene bis-acetamide (HMBA)) and incubated for several days. Virion particles are released from the host cells by sonication and purified from host cell protein\/membrane components via ultracentrifugation.","When prior transfection is effected, allowing the host cells to express HSV-1 VP16 prior to co-transfection as described above, the cells plated for packaging were first allowed to adhere to a culture dish and subsequently transfected with pGREvp16 using Lipofectamine reagent. Following suitable incubation, the transfection mix was removed, complete medium (e.g., DMEM plus 10% FBS, 1% penicillin\/streptomycin) was added, and the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. until the packaging co-transfection step described above.","Suitable host cells which can be co-transfected for preparation of HSV amplicon particles are eukaryotic cells, preferably mammalian cells. Exemplary host cells include, without limitation, BHK cells, NIH 3T3 cells, 2-2 cells, 293 cells, and RR1 cells.","When the HSV amplicon particles are harvested from the host cell medium, the amplicon particles are substantially pure (i.e., free of any other virion particles) and present at a concentration of greater than about 1\u00d710particles per milliliter. To further enhance the use of the amplicon particles, the resulting stock can also be concentrated, which affords a stock of isolated HSV amplicon particles at a concentration of at least about 1\u00d710particles per milliliter.","The resulting amplicon particles produced according to the present invention, i.e., in the presence of vhs and, optionally VP16, both of which can be expressed in host cells prior to packaging, are substantially different in kind from the virion particles which can be prepared using known helper virus methods (see Examples 1 and 4).","The concentrated stock of HSV amplicon particles is effectively a composition of the HSV amplicon particles in a suitable carrier. Alternatively, the HSV amplicon particles may also be administered in injectable dosages by dissolution or suspension of these materials in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier. Such carriers include sterile liquids, such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable carriers, including adjuvants, excipients or stabilizers. Illustrative oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, or mineral oil. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solution, and glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions.","For use as aerosols, the HSV amplicon particles, in solution or suspension, may be packaged in a pressurized aerosol container together with suitable propellants, for example, hydrocarbon propellants like propane, butane, or isobutane with conventional adjuvants. The materials of the present invention also may be administered in a non-pressurized form such as in a nebulizer or atomizer.","The pharmaceutical composition is preferably in liquid form, such as a solution, suspension, or emulsion. Typically, the composition will contain at least about 1\u00d710amplicon particles\/ml, together with the carrier, excipient, stabilizer, etc.","A further aspect of the present invention relates to a system for preparing HSV amplicon particles. The system includes (i) an empty amplicon vector as described above, which includes an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a transgene insertion site (at which a transgene may be inserted, as described above), (ii) one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals, and (iii) a vhs expression vector encoding a virion host shutoff protein. The vhs expression vector is of the type described above. The system is characterized as being able to produce HSV amplicon particles of the present invention when the system is introduced (i.e., co-transfected) into a suitable host cell. The system may further include, as described above, a host cell which stably expresses an HSV VP16 protein and\/or a vector encoding the HSV VP16 protein.","Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a kit for preparing HSV amplicon particles of the present invention. The kits includes: (i) an amplicon vector comprising an HSV origin of replication, an HSV cleavage\/packaging signal, and a transgene insertion site (at which a transgene may be inserted, as described above), (ii) one or more vectors individually or collectively encoding all essential HSV genes but excluding all cleavage\/packaging signals, (iii) a vhs expression vector encoding an virion host shutoff protein, (iv) a population of host cells susceptible to transfection by the amplicon vector, the vhs expression vector, and the one or more vectors, and (v) directions for transfecting the host cells under conditions to produce HSV amplicon particles. The vhs expression vector is of the type described above. The kit may further include, as described above, a host cell which stably expresses an HSV VP16 protein and\/or a vector encoding the HSV VP16 protein.","Yet another aspect of the present invention relates generally to a method of expressing a therapeutic gene product in a patient using the HSV amplicon particles of the present invention which contain a transgene encoding a therapeutic gene product. Basically, this method is carried out by providing such HSV amplicon particles and exposing patient cells to the HSV amplicon particles under conditions effective for infective transformation of the cells, wherein the therapeutic transgene product is expressed in vivo in transformed cells. As noted below, transformation of the patient cells can be carried out in vivo or ex vivo.","HSV-1 has a wide host range and infects many cell types in mammals and birds (including chickens, rats, mice, monkeys, humans) (Spear et al., , pp. 615-746, Tooze, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York (1981), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). HSV-1 can lytically infect a wide variety of cells including, e.g., neurons, fibroblasts, and macrophages. In addition, HSV-1 infects post-mitotic neurons in adult animals and can be maintained indefinitely in a latent state (Stevens, 70:31-50 (1975), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Two lines of evidence suggest that HSV-1 can infect most, if not all, kinds of neurons in the central nervous system. First, following inoculation of HSV-1 in the periphery, a burst of virus production ascends the neuroaxis, initially in the sensory or motor neurons innervating the site of inoculation, then in the spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex (Koprowski, , pp. 691-699, Stevens, ed., Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1978), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Second, attempts to mimic HSV-1 latency in tissue culture with different preparations of neurons have required high temperature, DNA synthesis inhibitors, and antisera directed against HSV-1 virions to prevent lytic infection for spreading to all neurons (Wigdahl et al., 81:6217-6201 (1984), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Because HSV-1 infects a wide range of animals, the HSV amplicon particles of the present invention can be used on a wide variety of mammals and birds. Preferably, the HSV amplicon particles are used on mammals, most preferably humans, to effect expression of the therapeutic transgene product. Thus, as used herein, patient refers generally to mammals and birds, as well as humans specifically.","When exposing the patient cells to the HSV amplicon particles, an in vivo route of delivery is performed by administering the HSV amplicon particles directly to the patient cells which are to be transformed. The administering can be achieved in a manner which is suitable to effect delivery and subsequent patient cell transformation, including, without limitation, intraparenchymal, intramuscular, intravenous, intracerebroventricular, subcutaneous, or intramucosal delivery.","Alternatively, an ex vivo route of delivery is performed by providing patient cells (either removed from the patient or obtained from a donor), exposing the cells ex vivo to the HSV amplicon particles, and then introducing the transformed cells into the patient. Stem cells, embryonic or progenitor, can be effectively transformed and then introduced into the patient at a desired location. For non-motile transformed cells, such cells are preferably administered to the patient at the site where the cells are intended to reside. For actively or passively motile transformed cells, such cells may be administered in a manner which is effective to deliver the transformed cells into the patient. Suitable delivery routes include, without limitation, intraparenchymal, intramuscular, intravenous, intracerebroventricular, subcutaneous, or intramucosal delivery.","Still another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a neurological disease or disorder using the HSV amplicon particles of the present invention which include a transgene encoding a therapeutic transgene product. Basically, this method is carried out by providing such HSV amplicon particles and exposing patient neural or pre-neural cells to the HSV amplicon particles under conditions effective for infective transformation of neural or pre-neural cells of the patient, wherein the therapeutic tansgene product is expressed in vivo by the neural or pre-neural cells, thereby treating the neurological disease or disorder.","As noted above, transformation can be effected either in vivo or ex vivo (i.e., using differentiated neural cells, neural stem cells, or embryonic stem cells which differentiate into neural cells). A preferred in vivo route of delivery is administering the HSV amplicon particles directly to neural cells which are to be treated using, e.g., the delivery routes listed above.","Neuronal diseases or disorders which can be treated include lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., by expressing MPS 1-VIII, hexoaminidase A\/B, etc.), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (e.g., by expressing HPRT), amyloid polyneuropathy (e.g., by expressing \u03b2-amyloid converting enzyme (BACE) or amyloid antisense), Alzheimer's Disease (e.g., by expressing NGF, CHAT, BACE, etc.), retinoblastoma (e.g., by expressing pRB), Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (e.g., by expressing Dystrophin), Parkinson's Disease (e.g., by expressing GDNF, Bcl-2, TH, AADC, VMAT, antisense to mutant alpha-synuclein, etc.), Diffuse Lewy Body disease (e.g., by expressing heat shock proteins, parkin, or antisense or RNAi to alpha-synuclein), stroke (e.g., by expressing Bcl-2, HIF-DN, BMP7, GDNF, other growth factors), brain tumor (e.g., by expressing angiostatin, antisense VEGF, antisense or ribozyme to EGF or scatter factor, pro-apoptotic proteins), epilepsy (e.g., by expressing GAD65, GAD67, pro-apoptotic proteins into focus), or arteriovascular malformation (e.g., by expressing proapoptotic proteins).","Likewise, the HSV amplicon particles of the present invention which include a transgene encoding a therapeutic transgene product can also be used according to a method of inhibiting development of a neurological disease or disorder. Basically, this method is carried out by providing such HSV amplicon particles and exposing neural or pre-neural cells of the patient who is susceptible to development of a neurological disease or disorder to the HSV amplicon particles under conditions effective for infective transformation of the neural or pre-neural cells, wherein the therapeutic transgene product is expressed in vivo by the neural or pre-neural cells, thereby inhibiting development of the neurological disease or disorder.","As noted above, transformation can be effected either in vivo or ex vivo (i.e., using differentiated neural cells, neural stem cells, or embryonic stem cells which differentiate into neural cells). A preferred in vivo route of delivery is administering the HSV amplicon particles directly to the neural cells which are to be treated using, e.g., the delivery routes listed above. The neuronal disease or disorder whose development can be inhibited, and the therapeutic transgene product associated therewith, are those which are listed above by way of example.","In addition to the foregoing uses described, the HSV amplicon particles of the present invention can also be used for delivery of other therapeutic transgenes as reported previously in the literature (i.e., using other vectors or HSV-derived vectors prepared according to helper-virus procedures or previously reported helper virus-free procedures). By way of example, Kutubuddin et al., \u201cEradication of Pre-Established Lymphoma Using Herpes Simplex Virus Amplicon Vectors,\u201d 93(2):643-654 (1999), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, reports on the use of helper virus-prepared HSV amplicon particles which transduce CD80 or RANTES, eliciting a protective immune response to pre-established lymphoma and generating tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells immunity and immunologic memory.","The following examples are provided to illustrate an embodiment of the present invention but is by no means intended to limit its scope.","Materials & Methods","Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were maintained as described before (Lu and Federoff, \u201cHerpes simplex virus type 1 amplicon vectors with glucocorticoid-inducible gene expression,\u201d 6:421-430 (1995), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).

The protocol for both cosmid- and BAC-based packaging was identical from the following step forward. Ten microliters of Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Gibco-BRL) were added over a 30-second period to the DNA mix and allowed to incubate at RT for 20 min. In a separate tube, 15 \u03bcl Lipofectamine (Gibco-BRL) were mixed with 250 \u03bcl Opti-MEM. Following the 20-min incubation, the contents of the two tubes were combined over a 1-min period, and incubated for an additional 20 min at RT. During the second incubation, the medium in the seeded 60-mm dish was removed and replaced with 2 ml Opti-MEM. The transfection mix was added to the flask and allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 hrs. The transfection mix was then diluted with an equal volume of DMEM plus 20% FBS, 2% penicillin\/streptomycin, and 2 mM hexamethylene bis-acetamide (HMBA), and incubated overnight at 34\u00b0 C. The following day, medium was removed and replaced with DMEM plus 10% FBS, 1% penicillin\/streptomycin, and 2 mM HMBA. The packaging flask was incubated an additional 3 days and virus harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until purification. Viral preparations were subsequently thawed, sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation (3000\u00d7g, 20 min.). Viral samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. For packaging experiments examining the effect of VP16 on amplicon titers, the cells plated for packaging were first allowed to adhere to the 60-mm culture dish for 5 hours and subsequently transfected with pGREvp16 using the Lipofectamine reagent as described above. Following a 5-hr incubation, the transfection mix was removed, complete medium (DMEM plus 10% FBS, 1% penicillin\/streptomycin) was added, and the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. until the packaging co-transfection step the subsequent day.","Amplicon titers were determined by counting the number of cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp amplicon) or \u03b2-galactosidase (HSVlac amplicon). Briefly, 10 \u03bcl of concentrated amplicon stock was incubated with confluent monolayers (2\u00d710expressing particles) of NIH 3T3 cells plated on glass coverslips. Following a 48-hr incubation, cells were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT and mounted in Moiwol for fluorescence microscopy (eGFP visualization), or fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and processed for X-gal histochemistry to detect the lacZ transgene product Fluorescent or X-gal-stained cells were enumerated, expression titer calculated, and represented as either green-forming units per ml (gfu\/ml) or blue-forming units per ml (bfu\/ml), respectively.","To isolate total DNA for quantitation of amplicon genomes in packaged stocks, virions were lysed in 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8 and 0.2% Triton X-100. Two micrograms of genomic carrier DNA was added to each sample. An equal volume of 2\u00d7 Digestion Buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.2 mg\/ml proteinase K) was added to the lysate and the sample was incubated at 56\u00b0 C. for 4 hrs. Samples were processed further by one phenol:chloroform, one chloroform extraction, and a final ethanol precipitation. Total DNA was quantitated and 50 ng of DNA was analyzed in a PE7700 quantitative PCR reaction using a designed lacZ-specific primer\/probe combination multiplexed with an 18S rRNA-specific primer\/probe set.

Following a 2-min 50\u00b0 C. incubation and 2-min 95\u00b0 C. denaturation step, the samples were subjected to 40 cycles of 95\u00b0 C. for 15 sec. and 60\u00b0 C. for 1 min. Fluorescent intensity of each sample was detected automatically during the cycles by the Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem Sequence Detector 7700 machine. Each PCR run included the following: no-template control samples, positive control samples consisting of either amplicon DNA (for lacZ) or cellular genomic DNA (for 18S rRNA), and standard curve dilution series (for lacZ and 18S). Following the PCR run, \u201creal-time\u201d data were analyzed using Perkin-Elmer Sequence. Detector Software version 1.6.3 and the standard curves. Precise quantities of starting template were determined for each titering sample and results were expressed as numbers of vector genomes per ml of original viral stock.","BHK cell monolayers (2\u00d710cells) transfected with varying packaging components were lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.5% SDS, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoretically separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The resultant blot was incubated with an anti-VP16 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Inc.), and specific VP16 immunoreactive band visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-based chemiluminescent detection kit (ECL).","Mice were anesthetized with Avertin at a dose of 0.6 ml per 25 g body weight. After positioning in an ASI murine stereotactic apparatus, the skull was exposed via a midline incision, and burr holes were drilled over the following coordinates (bregma, +0.5 mm; lateral \u22122.0 mm; and deep, \u22123.0 mm) to target infections to the striatum. A 33 GA steel needle was gradually advanced to the desired depth, and 3 \u03bcl of HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp virus was infused via a nicroprocessor-controlled pump over 10 minutes (UltraMicroPump, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota Springs, Fla.). The injector unit was mounted on a precision small animal stereotaxic frame (ASI Instruments, Warren, Mich.) micromanipulator at a 90\u00b0 angle using a mount for the injector. Viral injections were performed at a constant rate of 300 nl\/min. The needle was removed slowly over an additional 10-minute period.","Infected mice were anesthetized four days later, a catheter was placed into the left ventricle, and intracardiac perfusion was initiated with 10 ml of heparinized saline (5,000 U\/L saline) followed by 60 ml of chilled 4% PFA. Brains were extracted and postfixed for 1-2 hours in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0 C. Subsequently, brains were cryoprotected in a series of sucrose solutions with a final solution consisting of a 30% sucrose concentration (w\/v) in PBS. Forty micron serial sections were cut on a sliding microtome (Micron\/Zeiss, Thomwood, N.Y.) and stored in a cryoprotective solution (30% sucrose (w\/v), 30% ethylene glycol in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)) at \u221220\u00b0 C. until processed for GFP visualization. Sections were placed into Costar net wells (VWR, Springfield, N.J.) and incubated for 2 hrs in 0.1 M Tris buffered saline (TBS) (pH=7.6). Upon removal of cryoprotectant, two additional 10 min washes in 0.1 M TBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) were performed. Sections were mounted with a fine paint brush onto subbed slides, allowed to air dry, and mounted with an aqueous mounting media, Mowiol. GFP-positive cells were visualized with a fluorescent microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss, Thornwood, N.Y.) utilizing a FITC cube (Chroma Filters, Brattleboro, Vt.). All images used for morphological analyses were digitally acquired with a 3-chip color CCD camera at 200\u00d7 magnification (DXC-9000, Sony, Montvale, N.J.).","Cell counts were performed on digital images acquired within 24 hrs of mounting. At the time of tissue processing coronal slices were stored serially in three separate compartments. All compartments were processed for cell counting and GFP(+) cell numbers reflect cell counts throughout the entire injection site. All spatial measurements were acquired using an image analysis program (Image-Pro Plus, Silver Spring, Md.) at a final magnification of 200\u00d7. Every section was analyzed using identical parameters in three different planes of focus throughout the section to prevent repeated scoring of GFP(+) cells. Each field was analyzed by a computer macro to count cells based on the following criteria: object area, image intensity (fluorescent signal) and plane of focus. Only cells in which the cell body was unequivocally GFP(+) and nucleus clearly defined were counted. Every section that contained a GFP-positive cell was counted. In addition, a watershed separation technique was applied to every plane of focus in each field to delineate overlapping cell bodies. The watershed method is an algorithm that is designed to erode objects until they disappear, then dilates them again such that they do not touch.","To determine if introduction of vhs into the packaging scheme could increase amplicon titers and quality, a genomic segment of the UL41 gene was cloned into pBluescript and the resulting plasmid (pBSKS(vhs)) was introduced into co-transfection protocols to provide vhs in trans. The genomic copy of UL41 contained the transcriptional regulatory region and flanking cis elements believed to confer native UL41 gene expression during packaging. When pBSKS(vhs) was added to the packaging protocols for production of a \u03b2-galactosidase (lacZ)-expressing amplicon (HSVlac), a maximum of 10-fold enhanced amplicon expression titers was observed for both cosmid- and BAC-based strategies ( and B, respectively). As observed previously, the expression titers for HSVlac virus produced by the BAC-based method were approximately 500- to 1000-fold higher than stocks produced using the modified cosmid set. Even though a large disparity existed between the differently prepared stocks, the effect of additionally expressed vhs on amplicon titers was analogous.","The punctate appearance of reporter gene product (pseudotransduction), a phenomenon associated with first-generation helper virus-free stocks, was drastically diminished in vitro when vhs was included in BAC-based packaging of an enhanced green fluorescent (GFP)-expressing virus (HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp) (). Pseudotransduction was not observed, as well, for cosmid-packaged amplicon stocks prepared in the presence of vhs.","To assess the ability of the improved amplicon stocks to mediate gene delivery in vivo, 3 \u03bcl of BAC-packaged HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp virus prepared in the absence or presence of pBSKS(vhs) was injected stereotactically into the striata of C57BL\/6 mice. Four days following infection, animals were sacrificed and analyzed for GFP-positive cells present in the striatum (). The numbers of cells transduced by HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp prepared in the presence of vhs were significantly higher than in animals injected with stocks produced in the absence of vhs (). In fact, it was difficult to definitively identify GFP-positive cells in animals transduced with vhs(\u2212) amplicon stocks.","The mechanism by which vhs expression resulted in higher apparent amplicon titers in helper virus-free packaging could be attributed to one or several properties of vhs. The UL41 gene product is a component of the viral tegument and could be implicated in structural integrity, and its absence could account for the appearance of punctate gene product material following transduction. For example, the viral particles may be unstable as a consequence of lacking vhs. Thus, physical conditions, such as repeated freeze-thaw cycles or long-term storage, may have led to inactivation or destruction of vhs-lacking virions at a faster rate than those containing vhs.","The stability of HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp packaged via the BAC method in the presence or absence of vhs was analyzed initially with a series of incubations at typically used experimental temperatures. Viral aliquots from prepared stocks of HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp were incubated at 4, 22, or 37\u00b0 C. for periods up to three hours. Virus recovered at time points 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes were analyzed for their respective expression titer on NIH 3T3 cells. The rates of decline in viable amplicon particles, as judged by their ability to infect and express GFP, did not differ significantly between the vhs(+) and vhs(\u2212) stocks (). Another condition that packaged amplicons encounter during experimental manipulation is freeze-thaw cycling. Repetitive freezing and thawing of virus stocks is known to diminish numbers of viable particles, and potentially the absence of vhs in the tegument of pBAC-V2 packaged amplicons leads to sensitivity to freeze fracture. To test this possibility, viral aliquots were exposed to a series of four freeze-thaw cycles. Following each cycle, samples were removed and titered for GFP expression on NIH 3T3 cells as described previously. At the conclusion of the fourth freeze-thaw cycle, the vhs(\u2212) HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp stock exhibited a 10-fold diminution in expression titers as opposed to only a 2-fold decrease for vhs(+) stocks (). This observation suggests that not only do vhs(+) stocks have increased expression titers, but the virions are more stable when exposed to temperature extremes, as determined by repetitive freeze-thaw cycling.","Wild-type HSV virions contain multiple regulatory proteins that prepare an infected host cell for virus propagation. One of these virally encoded regulators, which is localized to the tegument, is vhs. The UL41 gene-encoded vhs protein exhibits an essential endoribonucleolytic cleavage activity during lytic growth that destabilizes both cellular and viral mRNA species (Smibert et al., \u201cIdentification and characterization of the virion-induced host shutoff product of herpes simplex virus gene UL4173:467-470 (1992), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Vhs-mediated ribonucleolytic activity appears to prefer the 5\u2032 ends of mRNAs over 3\u2032 termini, and the activity is specific for mRNA, as vhs does not act upon ribosomal RNAs (Karr and Read, \u201cThe virion host shutoff function of herpes simplex virus degrades the 5\u2032 end of a target mRNA before the 3\u2032 end,\u201d 264:195-204 (1999), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Vhs also serves a structural role in virus particle maturation as a component of the tegument HSV isolates that possess disruptions in UL41 demonstrate abnormal regulation of IE gene transcription and significantly lower titers than wild-type HSV-1 (Read and Frenkel, \u201cHerpes simplex virus mutants defective in the virion-associated shutoff of host polypeptide synthesis and exhibiting abnormal synthesis of \u03b1 (immediate early) viral polypeptides,\u201d 46:498-512 (1983), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), presumably due to the absence of vhs activity. Therefore, because vhs is essential for efficient production of viable wild-type HSV particles, it likely plays a similarly important role in packaging of HSV-1-derived amplicon vectors.","The term \u201cpseudotransduction\u201d refers to virion expression-independent transfer of biologically active vector-encoded gene product to target cells (Liu et al., \u201cPseudotRansduction of hepatocytes by using concentrated pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G)-Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retrovirus vectors: comparison of VSV-G and amphotrophic vectors for hepatic gene transfer,\u201d 70: 2497-2502 (1996); Alexander et al., \u201cTransfer of contaminants in adeno-associated virus vector stocks can mimic transduction and lead to artifactual results,\u201d 8:1911-1920 (1997); Yu et al., \u201cHigh efficiency in vitro gene transfer into vascular tissues using a pseudotyped retroviral vector without pseudotransduction,\u201d 6:1876-1883 (1999), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). This phenomenon was originally described with retrovirus and adeno-associated virus vector stocks and was shown to result in an overestimation of gene transfer efficiencies. \u03b2-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase are two commonly expressed reporter proteins that have been implicated in pseudotransduction, presumably due to their relatively high enzymatic stability and sensitivity of their respective detection assays (Alexander et al., \u201cTransfer of contaminants in adeno-associated virus vector stocks can mimic transduction and lead to artifactual results,\u201d 8:1911-1920 (1997), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Stocks of \u03b2-galactosidase-expressing HSVlac and GFP-expressing HSVPrPUC\/CMVegfp exhibited high levels of pseudotransduction when packaged in the absence of vhs. Upon addition of vhs to the previously described helper virus-free packaging protocols (Fraefel et al., \u201cHelper virus-free transfer of herpes simplex virus type 1 plasmid vectors into neural cells,\u201d 70:7190-7197 (1996); Stavropoulos and Strathdee, \u201cAn enhanced packaging system for helper-dependent herpes simplex virus vectors,\u201d 72:7137-43 (1998), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety), a 10-fold increase in expression titers and concomitant decrease in pseudotransduction were observed in vitro.","Vhs-mediated enhancement of HSV amplicon packaging was even more evident when stocks were examined in vivo. GFP-expressing cells in animals transduced with vhs(+) stocks were several hundred-fold greater in number than in animals receiving vhs(\u2212) stocks. This could have been due to differences in virion stability, where decreased particle stability could have led to release of co-packaged reporter gene product observed in the case of vhs(\u2212) stocks. Additionally, the absence of vhs may have resulted in packaging of reporter gene product into particles that consist of only tegument and envelope (Rixon et al., \u201cAssembly of enveloped tegument structures (L particles) can occur independently of virion maturation in herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells,\u201d 73:277-284 (1992), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Release of co-packaged reporter gene product in either case could potentially activate a vigorous immune response in the CNS, resulting in much lower than expected numbers of vector-expressing cells.","Interestingly, the HSV-encoding cosmid set harbored an intact UL41 gene locus (Cunningham and Davison, \u201cA cosmid-based system for construction mutants of herpes simplex type 1197:116-124 (1993), which is hereby incorporated by reference), while the BAC reagent that was utilized for helper virus-free packaging did not because of a disruption introduced during its initial construction (Stavropoulos and Strathdee, \u201cAn enhanced packaging system for helper-dependent herpes simplex virus vectors,\u201d 72:713743 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference). Expression of vhs via a co-transfected plasmid containing the entire UL41 gene plus its cognate transcriptional regulatory regions resulted in pronounced increases in packaged amplicon produced via either cosmid- or BAC-based method. For BAC-based packaging, the explanation appears rather clear: vhs is not expressed due to disruption of the UL41 locus, and therefore, inclusion of a vhs expression plasmid results in a more productive packaging. In the case for cosmid-based packaging, the copy number of the co-transfected vhs-encoding plasmid greatly exceeded the number of vhs transcription units present in the cosmid set. This likely led to a more rapid accumulation of vhs during the early stages of packaging. Additionally, because the cosmid set is believed to undergo recombination of its overlapping homologous regions to produce a HSV genome-sized unit following introduction into the packaging cell, perhaps viral gene expression is delayed (Cunningham and Davison, \u201cA cosmid-based system for construction mutants of herpes simplex type 1197:116-124 (1993), which is hereby incorporated by reference). As a result, amplicon propagation cannot optimally initiate.","The resulting HSV amplicon particles were also examined by scanning electron micrography using a standard negative staining technique (Monroe and Brandt, \u201cRapid semiquantitative method for screening large numbers of virus samples by negative staining electron microscopy,\u201d Appl Microbiol 20(2):259-62 (1970), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). As shown in , the HSV amplicon particles, denoted by arrows, are substantially smaller in size than the 173 nm reference spheres and rather heterogeneous in structure. In contrast, helper virus-containing stocks are characterized by the production of HSV amplicon particles which are approximately 150 nm in size and more homogeneous in shape. Thus, the HSV amplicon particles of the present invention are physically different from previously known helper virus-prepared HSV amplicon particles.","The native HSV genome enters the host cell with several viral proteins besides vhs, including the strong transcriptional activator VP16. Once within the cell, VP16 interacts with cellular transcription factors and HSV genome to initiate immediate-early gene transcription. Under helper virus-free conditions, transcriptional initiation of immediate-early gene expression from the HSV genome may not occur optimally, thus leading to lower than expected titers. To address this issue, a VP16 expression construct was introduced into packaging cells prior to cosmid\/BAC, amplicon, and pBSKS(vhs) DNAs, and resultant amplicon titers were measured. To achieve regulated expression a glucocorticoid-controlled VP16 expression vector was used (pGREvp16).","The pGREvp16 vector was introduced into the packaging cells 24 hours prior to transfection of the regular packaging DNAs. HSVlac was packaged in the presence or absence of vhs and\/or VP16 and resultant amplicon stocks were assessed for expression titer. Some packaging cultures received 100 nM dexamethasone at the time of pGREvp16 transfection to strongly induce VP16 expression; others received no dexamethasone. Introduction of pGREvp16 in an uninduced (basal levels) or induced state (100 nM dexamethasone) had no effect on HSVlac titers when vhs was absent from the cosmid- or BAC-based protocol (). In the presence of vhs, addition of pGREvp16 led to either a two- or five-fold enhancement of expression titers over those of stocks packaged with only vhs (cosmid- and BAC-derived stocks, respectively; ). The effect of \u201cuninduced\u201d pGREvp16 on expression titers suggested that VP16 expression was occurring in the absence of dexamethasone. To demonstrate this, Western blot analysis with a VP16-specific monoclonal antibody was performed using lysates prepared from BHK cells transfected with the various packaging components. Cultures transfected with pGREvp16\/BAC\/pBSKS(vhs) in the absence of dexamethasone did show VP16 levels intermediate to cultures transfected either with BAC alone (lowest) or those transfected with pGREvp16\/BAC\/pBSKS(vhs) in the presence of 100 nM dexamethasone (highest)().","VP16-mediated enhancement of packaged amplicon expression titers could be due to increased DNA replication and packaging of amplicon genomes. Conversely, the additional VP16 that is expressed via pGREvp16 could be incorporated into virions and act by increasing vector-directed expression in transduced cells. To test the possibility that VP16 is acting by increasing replication in the packaging cells, concentrations of vector genomes in BAC-derived vector stocks were determined. HSVlac stocks produced in the presence or absence of vhs and\/or VP16 were analyzed using a \u201creal-time\u201d quantitative PCR method. The concentration of vector genome was increased two-fold in stocks prepared in the presence of VP16 and this increase was unaffected by the presence of vhs (). VP16 expression was induced with 100 nM dexamethasone treatment at varying time points prior to introduction of the packaging components. Dexamethasone-induced production of VP16 prior to transfection of the packaging components did not appear to enhance amplicon titers over that observed with basal pGREvp16-mediated expression (). This suggests that low levels of VP16 are sufficient to enhance amplicon packaging in the presence of vhs.","Pre-loading of packaging cells with low levels of the potent HSV transcriptional activator VP16 led to a 2- to 5-fold additional increase in amplicon expression titers only in the presence of vhs for cosmid- and BAC-based packaging systems, respectively. This observation indicates the transactivation and structural functions of VP16 were not sufficient to increase viable viral particle production when vhs was absent, and most likely led to generation of incomplete virions containing amplicon genomes as detected by quantitative PCR. When vhs was present for viral assembly, however, VP16-mediated enhancement of genome replication led to higher numbers of viable particles formed. The effect of VP16 on expression titers was not specific to amplicons possessing the immediate-early 4\/5 promoter of HSV, as amplicons with other promoters were packaged to similar titers in the presence of VP16 and vhs.","VP16 is a strong transactivator protein and structural component of the HSV virion (Post et al., \u201cRegulation of alpha genes of herpes simplex virus: expression of chimeric genes produced by fusion of thymidine kinase with alpha gene promoters,\u201d 24:555-565 (1981), which is hereby incorporated by reference). VP16-mediated transcriptional activation occurs via interaction of VP16 and two cellular factors, Oct-1 (O'Hare and Goding, \u201cHerpes simplex virus regulatory elements and the immunoglobulin octamer domain bind a common factor and are both targets for virion transactivation,\u201d 52:435-445 (1988); Preston et al., \u201cA complex formed between cell components and an HSV structural polypeptide binds to a viral immediate early gene regulatory DNA sequence,\u201d 52:425-434 (1988); Stern et al., \u201cThe Oct-1 homoeodomain directs formation of a multiprotein-DNA complex with the HSV transactivator VP16341:624-630 (1989), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) and HCF (Wilson et al., \u201cThe VP16 accessory protein HCF is a family of polypeptides processed from a large precursor protein,\u201d 74:115-125 (1993); Xiao and Capone, \u201cA cellular factor binds to the herpes simplex virus type 1 transactivator Vmw65 and is required for Vmw65-dependent protein-DNA complex assembly with Oct-110:4974-4977 (1990), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety), and subsequent binding of the complex to TAATGARAT elements found within HSV IE promoter regions (O'Hare, \u201cThe virion transactivator of herpes simplex virus,\u201d 4:145-155 (1993), which is hereby incorporated by reference). This interaction results in robust up-regulation of IE gene expression. Neuronal splice-variants of the related Oct-2 transcription factor have been shown to block IE gene activation via binding to TAATGARAT elements (Lillycrop et al., \u201cThe octamer-binding protein Oct-2 represses HSV immediate-early genes in cell lines derived from latently injectable sensory neurons,\u201d 7:381-390 (1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference), suggesting that cellular transcription factors may also play a role in limiting HSV lytic growth.","The levels of VP16 appear to be important in determining its effect on expression titers. Low, basal levels of VP16 (via uninduced pGREvp16) present in the packaging cell prior to introduction of the packaging components induced the largest effect on amplicon expression titers. Conversely, higher expression of VP16 (via dexamethasone-induced pGREvp16) did not enhance virus production to the same degree and may have, in fact, abrogated the process. The presence of glucocorticoids in the serum components of growth medium is the most likely reason for this low-level VP16 expression, as charcoal-stripped sera significantly reduces basal expression from this construct. Perhaps only a low level or short burst of VP16 is required to initiate IE gene transcription, but excessive VP16 leads to disruption of the temporal progression through the HSV lytic cycle, possibly via inhibition of vhs activity. Moreover, evidence has arisen to suggest vhs activity is downregulated by newly synthesized VP16 during the HSV lytic cycle, thereby allowing for accumulation of viral mRNAs after host transcripts have been degraded (Smibert et al., \u201cHerpes simplex virus VP16 forms a complex with the virion host shutoff protein vhs,\u201d 68(4):233-236 (1994); Lam et al., \u201cHerpes simplex virus VP16 rescues viral mRNA from destruction by the virion host shutoff function,\u201d 15:2575-2581 (1996), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). Therefore, a delicate regulatory protein balance may be required to attain optimal infectious particle propagation. Additionally, the 100-nM dexamethasone treatment used to induce VP16 expression may have a deleterious effect on cellular gene activity and\/or interfere with replication of the OriS-containing amplicon genome in packaging cells. High levels of dexamethasone have been shown previously to repress HSV-1 OriS-dependent replication by an unknown mechanism (Hardwicke and Schaffer, \u201cDifferential effects of nerve growth factor and dexamethasone on herpes simplex virus type 1 oriL- and oriS-dependent DNA replication in PC12 cells,\u201d 71:3580-3587 (1997), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","There is a possibility that addition of viral proteins, like vhs and VP16, to the packaging process may lead to vector stocks that are inherently more cytotoxic. The amplicon stocks described above were examined for cytotoxicity using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release-based cell viability assay. Packaged amplicon stocks were used to transduce NIH 3T3 cells and 48 hours following infection, viability of the cell monolayers was assessed by the LDH-release assay. Amplicon stocks produced in the presence of vhs and VP16 displayed less cytotoxicity on a per virion basis than stocks packaged using the previously published BAC-based protocol () (Stavropoulos and Strathdee, \u201cAn enhanced packaging system for helper-dependent herpes simplex virus vectors,\u201d 72:7137-43 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)).","Ectopic expression of vhs and VP16 did not lead to amplicon stocks that exhibited higher cytotoxicity than helper virus-free stocks prepared in the traditional manner when examined by an LDH-release assay. Stocks prepared by the various methods were equilibrated to identical expression titers prior to exposure to cells. The heightened cytotoxicity in stocks produced in the absence of vhs and\/or VP16 may reflect that larger volumes of these stocks were required to obtain similar expression titers as the vhs\/VP16-containing samples or the levels of defective particles in the former may be significantly higher. Contaminating cellular proteins that co-purify with the amplicon particles are most likely higher in concentration in the traditional stocks, and probably impart the higher toxicity profiles observed.","Helper virus-free HSV amplicon particles were prepared as described above in Example 1 and helper virus-containing HSV amplicon particles were prepared according to known procedures.","Two-dimensional gel analyses were performed on stocks containing the helper virus-free (HVF) virion particles () and helper virus-containing (HVC) virion particles () to determine differences in their protein composition. Virion particles from both helper virus-containing and helper virus-free amplicon stocks were purified by ultracentrifugation on a 30%\/60% discontinuous sucrose gradient. Bands containing viral particles were extracted from the gradient at the 30%\/60% interface and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until 2-D gel analyses were performed. Prior to gel analyses, protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay and 100 \u03bcg of each sample was resuspended in urea sample buffer (9.5 M ultrapure urea, 2% w\/v Nonidet P-40, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, and 2% ampholines consisting of 1.6% pH 5-7 and 0.4% pH 3.5-10). Fifty \u03bcg of each sample was run 2X's on 2-D gels (ampholines pH of 3.5-10), the gels were silver-stained, digitized, and analyzed by comparison of 2-D patterns and spot intensity of helper virus-containing vs. helper virus-free amplicon stocks.","As shown in Table 2 below, the reference spot number, pI, and molecular weight (daltons) are given for polypeptide spots analyzed in the samples obtained from the stocks of HVF and HVC virion particles. Also indicated in Table 2 are the fold increase or decrease (difference) of the polypeptides for gel bands from the two samples.
