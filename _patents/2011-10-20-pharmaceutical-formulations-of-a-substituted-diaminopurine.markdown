Nos. 7,521,446, 7,723,340, and 7,759,342; U.S. Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 2009\/275564, 2009\/312320, 2010\/249066, and 2009\/0048275; and International Pub. Nos. WO 2006\/076595, WO 2007\/127382, and WO 2008\/057252; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The identification and selection of a formulation of a pharmaceutical compound is complex, given that a change in a formulation may affect a variety of physical and chemical properties, which may provide benefits or drawbacks in safety, processing, stability, solubility and bioavailability, among other important pharmaceutical characteristics.","Notably, the various excipients employed in a formulation of a pharmaceutical compound can have a profound effect on the manufacturing process, wherein characteristics such as flowability (e.g., blend flow), hardness, compressibility, sticking, filming and capping can be affected by the identity and amount of the excipients employed.","Potential formulations include, but are not limited to solid, liquid and aerosol formulations. Potential solid formulations include, but are not limited to, tablet and capsule formulations. The variety of possible formulations creates potential diversity in physical and chemical properties for a given pharmaceutical compound. The discovery and selection of the optimal formulation is of great importance in the development of a safe, effective, stable and marketable pharmaceutical product.","Notably, 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol is a fine white powder with a fluffy appearance, which exhibits poor flow. In addition, 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol exhibits low aqueous solubility, at a level of less than 1 mg\/mL.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for formulations that impart more desirable chemical and physical properties.","Teratogenic agents can disturb the growth of an embryo or fetus. Accordingly, exposure to teratogenic agents should be avoided by females who are pregnant or may become pregnant and by males who may come into contact with such females. One strategy for reducing or minimizing such exposure for teratogenic pharmaceutical agents is to provide the final product in a form that minimizes such exposure, such as a capsule formulation or a coated tablet formulation. Such formulations can reduce the exposure of, for example, workers who might come into contact with the teratogenic agent in a manufacturing setting, as well as patients being administered the teratogenic agent, in addition to health care providers and others who might come into contact with the teratogenic agent.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for formulations that reduce the risk of exposure to teratogenic pharmaceutical agents.","Capsule formulations, wherein the drug is contained within a capsule shell, offer a route to such formulations. Capsule formulations can comprise a hard outer shell that contains the drug formulation inside, thus reducing exposure to the drug after the manufacturing process is complete. In addition, capsule formulations allow for manufacturing processes that can reduce the handling of the solid formulation. For instance, with the appropriate choice of excipients, it may be possible to direct-fill into capsules, thus reducing exposure to the drug during compression (tablet), film coating and packaging operations. Thus, capsule formulations also may reduce exposure to the drug during the manufacturing process.","Citation or identification of any references in this application is not to be construed as an admission that the references are prior art to the present application.","Formulations of pharmaceutical agents are critical for proper drug delivery. Formulations achieving an effective bioavailability, while also protecting the patient and health care provider are needed. Furthermore, formulations that allow for scaled up manufacturing processes to be carried out in a time and cost-efficient manner are also needed. In addition, formulations with desirable dissolution profiles (i.e., correlating to desirable bioavailability) are also needed.","Accordingly, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, having the following structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"40.47mm","wi":"64.01mm","file":"US08603527-20131210-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"101.26mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08603527-20131210-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, useful for the treatment, prevention or management of disease, wherein the pharmaceutical formulation is formulated as a capsule.","In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, useful for the treatment, prevention or management of disease, wherein the pharmaceutical formulation is formulated as a coated tablet.","In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, and silicified microcrystalline cellulose.","Also provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, and silicified microcrystalline cellulose, in combination with one or more diluent, disintegrant, and\/or lubricant.","In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, and silicified microcrystalline cellulose, in combination with lactose, croscarmellose sodium, and\/or magnesium stearate.","Provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising from about 10 to about 60% by weight (also referred to herein is w\/w) of 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, and from about 20 to about 70% w\/w of silicified microcrystalline cellulose.","In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations comprising 4-((9-((3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-8-((2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)amino)-9H-purin-2-yl)amino)-trans-cyclohexanol, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers, isotopologues, tautomers or racemic mixtures thereof, and about 45-60% w\/w microcrystalline cellulose.

In addition, four groups of five time-mated females\/group served as toxicokinetic (TK) animals and received the vehicle or test article in the same manner as the main study groups.","All animals in the main study and TK subgroups survived to scheduled termination. Pregnancy rates were 100% in all groups, providing 25 litters in each main study group with fetuses for evaluation on GD 20 and five litters in each TK group for fetal TK blood collection.","No maternal toxicity was seen at 25 mg\/kg\/day but developmental effects were seen from lower fetal weights (about 6% lower than controls) and increased frequency of several fetal skeletal variations. Maternal toxicity seen at the higher dose levels was evident from lower weight gain during the treatment period at 50 and 100 mg\/kg\/day, and lower food consumption at 100 mg\/kg\/day. At 100 mg\/kg\/day, there was also an increase in mean number of resorptions and increased post implantation loss index. Fetal body weights were about 11% and 27% lower than controls in the 50 and 100 mg\/kg\/day groups, respectively, and in both groups there was an increased frequency in occurrence of several fetal skeletal variations consistent with the lower fetal weights in these groups and suggestive of a developmental delay. In the 100 mg\/kg\/day group, there was also a slight increase in incidence of fetal malformations involving the heart and aortic vessels, ribs, and\/or vertebrae; these effects are believed to be treatment-related.","Compound I was readily absorbed in pregnant rats following daily oral administration of Compound I for 11 days (GD 6-16). Exposures for Compound I increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner from 25 to 100 mg\/kg\/day. The mean toxicokinetics for Compound I are provided in Table 12.","In conclusion, in this rat developmental toxicity study with Compound I, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 25 mg\/kg\/day, and this was also the No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) for developmental

Additionally, four groups of five animals\/group served as toxicokinetic (TK) animals and received the vehicle or test article in the same manner and dose levels as the main study groups.

Additionally, Compound I was not found in the vehicle control group.","All main study and TK animals in the control, 10, and 20 mg\/kg\/day groups survived to scheduled termination. At 40 mg\/kg\/day, one main study animal was found dead (death was considered test article related), five main study females aborted, and three main study and one TK females at uterine examination had all resorption sites in utero. Main study pregnancy indices in the control, 10, 20, and 40 mg\/kg\/day groups were 100%, 95%, 100%, and 95%, respectively, and there were 20, 19, 20, and 10 litters, respectively, with viable fetuses for evaluation on GD 29.","No maternal or developmental toxicity was seen at 10 mg\/kg\/day. At 20 mg\/kg\/day, there was an increased incidence of animals with feces few\/absent and sporadic thin appearance observations noted at clinical examination, but in the absence of an effect on food consumption and body weight, this was not considered toxicologically meaningful. No other maternal toxicity or developmental toxicity was seen at this dose level. Clinical findings seen with increased frequency at 40 mg\/kg\/day and considered to be treatment related included feces few\/absent (consistent with lower food consumption during the treatment period), red material in the cage pan (associated with the failed pregnancies), decreased activity, and thin appearance. Additional maternal toxicity at 40 mg\/kg\/day included lower gestation weights and weight gain, and lower food consumption.","Developmental toxicity seen in this study was limited to the 40 mg\/kg\/day dose level and involved a decrease in number of fetuses per doe, smaller litter size at uterine examination, and an increase in number of resorption sites and post-implantation loss. There was also an increase in overall incidence of litters containing a fetus or fetuses with malformations. Seven of the 10 litters (70%) available at GD 29 for fetal evaluation contained one or more fetuses with a malformation. However, only during the skeletal evaluations was there some similarity in malformations within the group. These changes, however, were not statistically different from controls (25%). These fetal effects were most likely due to the severe maternal toxicity observed in this group, although a direct test article-related effect cannot be ruled out.

Tablets were compressed at a press speed of approximately 29 rpm using two sets of tooling. The compression of batch B0001F1, containing equal parts of AVICEL\u00ae PH 102 and Super Tab\u00ae 21AN, resulted in low hardness values and filming on the punch faces at both the 25 mg and 100 mg strengths. Hardness values greater than 2 kP were not achieved during compression of batch B0002F2A, which was comprised of equal portions of Starch 1500 and Mannogem\u2122 EZ Spray Dried Mannitol. Batch B0003F3 tablets, containing equal quantities of AVICEL\u00ae PH-102 and Mannogem\u2122 EZ Spray Dried Mannitol, yielded low hardness values as well. Tablet breakage was observed for the 100 mg strength (B0003F3B). It was decided to modify formulations 1 and 3 to increase the quantity of AVICEL\u00ae PH 102. These changes were implemented and prepared as batches B0004F4 and B0005F5. Although the hardness values increased slightly, filming of the punch faces was observed during compression in both strengths.","For the next set of experiments, it was decided to make adjustments to the formulations as well as implementing new excipients of interest. The goal of the next batches was to improve blend flow, increase tablet hardness, and to prevent tablet sticking, filming and capping during compression. All batches in this set of experiments and for the remainder of the study included a 5 minute lubricant mix, which was increased from 3 minutes in the previous batches. Without being limited by theory, the increased mix time was intended to allow for adequate dispersion of the lubricant in an effort to eliminate the observed tablets sticking to the punch surfaces.","The following modifications were made to the prior batches: (i) modify batch F4 by reducing the concentration of magnesium stearate from 0.75% to 0.5% (batch B0006F6); (ii) repeat batch F5 with the increased lubricant mix time (batch B0007F7); (iii) use a combination of AVICEL\u00ae PH-102 and Starch 1500\u00ae in an effort to improve tablet hardness (batch B0008F8); (iv) base a new formula on F6 where the Super Tab\u00ae 21AN lactose concentration was increased to 56.5% from 17.62% in an effort to improve blend flow during compression due to increased particle size of lactose (batch B0009F9); (v) implement a combination of two grades of MCC (AVICEL\u00ae PH-102 and PH-105), SuperTab\u00ae 21AN, and the inclusion of Cab-O-Sil\u00ae M5P at a 0.2% level (the incorporation of a glidant (Cab-O-Sil\u00ae M5P) and AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 was to improve blend flow characteristics and compressibility properties, respectively) (batch B0010F10); and (vi) incorporate PROSOLV SMCC 50\u00ae at 53.63% as the main filler in an effort to improve tablet hardness (batch B0011F11).","These subsequent formulations prepared are described below in Table 17, the corresponding physical

Tablets were compressed at approximately 29 rpm using two sets of tooling. During compression of batch B0006F6A, the hardness values varied and remained low despite the reduction in magnesium stearate in the blend. Although there appeared to be neither sticking during compression, nor filming on the punch surfaces, the hardness values were quite low at approximately 6 and 7 kP. The tablet press was adjusted through out the compression to increase the hardness values as data were collected at low, nominal and high hardness values. Low hardness values of 4-6 kP were obtained during the compression of batch B0007F7A as well. It was determined not to perform any chemical testing on these two batches. Poor flow from the hopper was observed during the compression of batches B0008F8A and B0008F8B as well as low tablet hardness values. Batches B0010F10 and B0011F11 were made in an effort to overcome the challenge of low tablet hardness. Batch B0010F10 blend exhibited poor flow from the hopper, however, the incorporation of AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 made a noticeable difference in tablet hardness with approximate average values of 11 kP and 21 kP for batches B0010F10A (25 mg) and B0010F10B (100 mg), respectively. The hardness values were a great improvement compared to all previous batches. Batch B0011F11 blend showed excellent flow properties primarily due to the incorporation of the silicified microcrystalline cellulose (PROSOLV SMCC 50\u00ae) as target hardness values were achieved at 12 kP and 23 kP for batches B0011F11A and B0011F11B, respectively. In addition there were no signs of tablet sticking nor filming of the tablet punches observed during the compression. Because of the compression success of batches B0010F10 and B0011F11, the two 25 mg tablet batches were submitted for dissolution profile testing.","Because of the promising dissolution data obtained for batch B0011F11A, as well as ideal blend and compression characteristics, additional chemical testing was performed on both strengths of tablets. Content uniformity and assay tests were performed on batches B0011F11A and B0011F11B, 25 mg and 100 mg strengths, respectively. The dissolution results for the 100 mg strength of tablets were highly notable with 100% release at the 15 minute time point.","Additional batches were prepared in a continuing effort to produce a second robust and unique prototype formulation. The incorporation of AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 in batch B0010F10 aided in higher tablet hardness values during compression, so it was decided to continue to use those excipients outlined in the formula as well as to evaluate new potential formulations. The goal was to explore other excipient combinations in an effort to improve blend flow and compression characteristics in a second prototype formulation.","The following modifications were made to the prior batches: (i) modify F10 by increasing the Cab-O-Sil\u00ae M5P concentration from 0.2% to 0.5% to improve blend flow (batch B0012F12); (ii) a new formulation using the combination of AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 and AVICEL\u00ae PH-302 was prepared (without being limited by theory, these two materials were utilized to (a) increase tablet hardness and to (b) improve blend flow due to the compressibility characteristics and increased density of the materials, respectively) (B0016F13); (iii) modify F13 using equal amounts of AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 and PH-302 and replacing SuperTab\u00ae 21AN, Ac-Di-Sol\u00ae, and magnesium stearate Hyqual\u00ae vegetable source with Mannogem\u2122 EZ Spray Dried Mannitol with Explotab and PRUV in an effort to increase tablets hardness and blend flow (B0018F14); (iv) modify F14 by increasing the quantity of AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 in an effort to increase tablet hardness values (B0020F16); and (v) repeat F11 at the 25 mg strength at a larger scale for use in film coating and analytical methods development

using the combination of AVICEL\u00ae PH-105 and AVICEL\u00ae PH-302. Compression was conducted successfully at the two strengths: 25 mg and 100 mg. The tablet surfaces remained glossy and filming or sticking to the punch faces was not observed. Furthermore, the average tablet hardness values were promising at 8.1 kP and 17.8 kP, respectively, which were within the target hardness range desired. All in all, formulation F14 proved to be positive in regards to blend flow and tablet hardness values obtained. During the compression of batch B0020F16, the blend flow was observed to be quite poor, and there were no substantial improvements to the tablet hardness values compared to batch B0018F14. Chemical tests were not performed on batch B0020F16. Batch B0021F11A was prepared as a scale-up batch of batch B0011F11A at 1100 g, and was used for coating evaluation and analytical method development purposes. Tablets were compressed at a target of 10-12 kP using eight sets of \u00bc\u2033 SC tooling with R&D embossing on the upper punches. The compressed tablets exhibited picking on the R&D debossing due to sticking during compression. In addition, some tablets were broken, chipped and quite friable. These observations were supported by the friability value (% weight loss) of 0.55% compared to the first batch (same formula), B0011F11A, with a friability of 0.07% weight loss. With the chemical and physical testing data supporting the encouraging compression characteristics, formulation 14 was identified as the second prototype.","Although early stability data showed potential for the two prototype formulations, it was decided to implement modifications to the formulations in an effort to further improve blend flow and compression characteristics to eliminate sticking to punch surfaces. Batches B0029F18A and B0030F19A were prepared at the 25 mg strength tablets and were prepared at batch sizes of 1000 g.","The following modifications were made to the prior batches: (i) a modification of prototype I (F11), where the quantity of magnesium stearate Hyqual\u00ae Vegetable Source was increased from 0.5% to 0.65%. Without being limited by theory, this was done in an effort to reduce sticking of tablets to the punch surfaces (Batch B0029F18A); and (ii) the quantity of Cab-O-Sil\u00ae M5P was increased from 0.5% to 0.6% in prototype II (Batch B0030F19A). The Cab-O-Sil\u00ae M5P was incorporated in the 14 minute mix (after the Compound I premix) compared to prior batches where blending occurred in the last mixing steps. Without being limited by theory, the increased quantity and mix time was implemented in an effort to better distribute the glidant to improve the blend flow characteristics during the compression process.","These subsequent formulations prepared are described below in Table 24 and the corresponding physical testing results are described below in Table

In addition, no TEAE-leading to early termination was reported. There was no apparent dose-related trend in the number of subjects reporting TEAE. All AEs reported were mild in severity and resolved by the end of study, except for one unrelated moderate TEAE (loss of dental cap). The data indicated that multiple-dosing of Compound I was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 200 mg daily dose for 14 days.","Compound I plasma PK was characterized by rapid absorption, with the maximum plasma concentration occurring at a median tof 1 to 2 hours (). Following attainment of C, plasma concentrations of Compound I appeared to decline in a biphasic manner (). The mean terminal half-life (t) ranged from 25 to 31 hours (Table 29). There was no apparent dose-related trend in t. Steady state appeared to be reached on Day 6 based on the trough Compound I plasma concentrations, with the approximately 2 fold of accumulation on both Day 10 and Day 14 with QD dosing (, Table 29). At steady state, systemic exposure (AUC) and Cincreased with increasing daily dose from 25 mg to 200 mg (, Table 29). The inter-subject variability of AUCfor Compound I ranged from 10% to 26% on Day 14. The intra-subject variability of AUCwas less than 20% (Table 30).","Compound I excreted unchanged in the urine was low, mean fraction excreted at steady state ranged from 6% to 14% across dose levels (Table 31), suggesting that non-renal mechanisms are major elimination route.","The systemic exposure of S-cis isomer of Compound I was low, representing only about 2% that of Compound I (Table 32). The mean values of t, t, and accumulation ratio for S-cis isomer of Compound I were comparable to those for Compound I.","Pharmacokinetic characteristics of multiple doses Compound I are in accord with the data obtained from the single dose study.","Conclusion: Multiple doses of Compound I were well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 200 mg QD for 14 days. Systemic exposure (Cand AUC) of Compound I increased with increasing doses at steady state. There was approximately 2 fold accumulation of Compound I plasma concentration at steady state with once daily dosing.","Methods: This was an open-label, randomized, 4-treatment, 4-period, 4-sequence crossover study in healthy subjects to evaluate relative bioavailability and food effect on Compound I capsule formulations. The study consisted of a screening phase (Day \u221221 to Day \u22122) for subject eligibility, a baseline\/admission phase (Day \u22121) for each period, treatment and assessment phase (Days 1 to Day 8) for each period, and a follow-up visit (Day 15\u00b12 days from the last dose). During each period, subjects were domiciled at the study site from Day \u22121 through Day 2 (discharged on Day 3 after PK sampling and safety evaluations). Subjects then visited the study center on Days 4, 6, and 8 of each period for PK sampling and safety evaluations. Between periods, there was a minimum of 10 days of washout from the prior dose to the next dose (no more than 14 days).","Sixteen (16) male subjects were be randomized to one of the following 4 treatment sequences (4 subjects per sequence) on Day 1 of Period 1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0380","num":"0391"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00033","num":"00033"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Period 1","Period 2","Period 3","Period 4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Sequence I","A","D","B","C"]},{"entry":[{},"Sequence II","B","A","C","D"]},{"entry":[{},"Sequence III","C","B","D","A"]},{"entry":[{},"Sequence IV","D","C","A","B"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Treatment A: a single dose of 100 mg (1 \u00d7 100-mg) Compound I-in-capsule, fasting."]},{"entry":[{},"Treatment B: a single dose of 100 mg (1 \u00d7 100-mg) Compound I formulated capsule (Pharmaceutical Formulation VIII, Table 11), fasting."]},{"entry":[{},"Treatment C: a single dose of 100 mg (4 \u00d7 25-mg) Compound I formulated capsules (Pharmaceutical Formulation VII, Table 10), fasting."]},{"entry":[{},"Treatment D: a single dose of 100 mg (1 \u00d7 100-mg) Compound I formulated capsule (Pharmaceutical Formulation VIII, Table 11), fed."]}]}}]}}},"Subjects started fasting from the night of Day \u22121 for a minimum of 10 hours prior to dosing.

similar following the treatment of the 4\u00d725-mg formulated capsule, 100-mg formulated capsule, or the 100-mg Compound I-in-capsule. The formulations produced about 35% higher Cthan the Compound I-in-capsule. \u2022Median twas 1.5 hours for the formulations as compared with 2.5 hours for the Compound I-in-capsule, which suggests that absorption rate is slightly faster with formulation. No apparent food effect on the extent of absorption following oral administration of 100-mg capsule formulation was seen. However, median twas delayed by about 2.5 hours in the presence of food.","Compound I (\u02dc5 mg) was suspended in ethyl acetate (500 \u03bcl) and heated to 50\u00b0 C. until completely dissolved. The solvent was then allowed to slowly evaporate at room temperature to produce crystals suitable for single crystal diffraction. A crystal of sufficient size and quality for analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction was selected directly from the sample, which exhibited a prism morphology of approximate dimensions 0.12\u00d70.08\u00d70.06 mm. Optical micrographs of the crystal used for data collection are shown in .","The compound of the crystal has been identified as the imino tautomer of Compound I, where the double bond of the imidazole moiety is exo-cyclic.","The asymmetric unit contains three independent molecules of Compound I, henceforth referred to as molecule A, (), molecule B, () and molecule C, (). Final R[I>2\u03c3(I)]=3.05%.","The absolute stereochemistry of Compound I has been determined. For the structure as presented with the chiral centre C18, (A, B and C), in the S configuration, the Flack parameter=0.00(7). For the inverted structure with C18, (A, B and C), in the R configuration the Flack parameter=1.00(7). On the basis of the former result, the absolute stereochemistry of Compound I has been assigned as having S configuration at the C18, (A, B and C) chiral center.","A calculated least-squares plane through the 6 atoms of the 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl ring of molecules A, B, C, (C1 to C6), gave an RMSD's from planarity of 0.0090, 0.0052 and 0.0041 respectively with atoms C6A, C1B and C2C showing the greatest deviations from planarity, \u22120.013(1) \u212b, \u22120.007(1) \u212b, and \u22120.006(1) \u212b, respectively.","A calculated least-squares plane through the 9 atoms of the purine ring of molecules A, B, C, (C7 to C11, N2 to N5), gave an RMSD's from planarity of 0.0206, 0.0275 and 0.0303 respectively with atoms C9A, C7B and C 11C showing the greatest deviations from planarity, \u22120.032(1) \u212b, \u22120.049(1) \u212b, and \u22120.046(2) \u212b, respectively.","The calculated dihedral angle made between the least-squares plane of the purine and trifluorophenyl rings is 57.94(6)\u00b0, 47.05(6)\u00b0 and 48.95(6)\u00b0 for molecules A, B and C, respectively.","Conformational analysis on the substituted tetrahydrofuran ring reveals that the closest ring puckering descriptor for this moiety is an envelope on O2 for molecules A and B and twisted on bond C20-O2 for molecule C.","Conformational analysis on the substituted cyclohexanol ring reveals that the closest ring puckering descriptor for this moiety is a chair form for molecules A B and C with both the amino and hydroxyl substituent occupying an equatorial position.","There are no other unusual structural features, and the final Fourier difference map is featureless, showing maximal and minimal electron densities of 0.162 and \u22120.229 e\u212b, respectively.","The experimental and simulated XRPD patterns for Compound I are presented in  (overlay),  (experimental) and  (simulated). 2\u03b8 peak listings against intensity for the experimental and simulated XRPD patterns for Compound I are shown in Tables 35 and 36, respectively. The two patterns match well, though it should be noted that there are small temperature shifts in some of the peaks owing to the fact that the experimental pattern was collected at room temperature and the calculated pattern is derived from data collected at 100K. The experimental pattern also shows some preferred orientation effects at low angle. Peak positions can vary from sample to sample by approximately \u00b10.1 degrees 2\u03b8. Variation in peak position may depend upon multiple factors, including particle size, sample preparation, data collection temperature and parameters. Variation in peak intensity may occur, e.g., as a result of preferred orientation and\/or variation in crystal

small amount of Compound I was dissolved in acetone\/water (50\/50% v\/v). The solution was slowly evaporated at room temperature. The crystals were isolated and observed by polarised light microscopy. A small crystal of plate morphology was isolated and analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The approximate dimensions of the selected crystal were of 0.08\u00d70.07\u00d70.01 mm (80\u00d770\u00d710 \u03bcm), see .","The form has been identified as the bis-Hydrate of Compound I.","The asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules of Compound I, henceforth referred to as molecule A () and molecule B (), and four molecules of water.

For the structure as presented with the chiral centre C18, (A and B), in the S configuration, the Flack parameter=0.13(17). For the inverted structure with C18, (A and B), in the R configuration the Flack parameter=0.81(17). On the basis of the former result, the absolute stereochemistry has been assigned as having S configuration at the C18 (A and B) chiral centre.","The single crystal structure shows that the C\u2014N bond lengths for the imidazole moieties are 1.317 (4) \u212b [N3A-C7A] and 1.331(4) \u212b [N3B-C7B] for molecules A and B (mean value: 1.324) respectively.","Conformational analysis on the substituted cyclohexanol ring reveals that this moiety is in a chair form for molecules A and B with both the amino and hydroxyl substituent occupying an equatorial position.","There are no other unusual structural features, and the final Fourier difference map is featureless, showing maximal and minimal electron densities of 0.223 and \u22120.230 e\u212brespectively.","The experimental and simulated XRPD patterns for the bis-hydrate of Compound I are presented in . The experimental pattern was measured on the material as received.

This was an open-label study conducted at a single study center in conformance with good clinical practice (GCP). Thirty-six eligible healthy male and female subjects were enrolled and distributed into 3 groups as follows:","Group 1\u2014A total of 12 females between 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive (\u00b15 years age-matched and \u00b110% weight-matched to subjects in Group 2).","Group 2\u2014A total of 12 males between 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive (\u00b15 years age-matched and \u00b110% weight-matched to subjects in Group 1).","Group 3\u2014A total of 12 males and females between 65 and 85 years of age, inclusive (weight and gender-matched to subjects in Groups 1 and 2), with a minimum of 3 subjects of each gender. Seven of the subjects in Group 3 were age 70 or above, with 2 of those subjects being >75 years of age.","Group 1 (Healthy Females) and Group 3 (Elderly Males and Females): Subjects were screened within 21 days of dosing and eligible subjects were admitted to the study center on Day \u22121 (i.e., at least 12 hours predose) for baseline assessments and confirmation of eligibility. A single oral dose of 100 mg Compound I was administered on Day 1 following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Subjects were discharged from the study center the morning of Day 3 upon completion of study procedures and returned to the study center for PK blood draws and safety assessments on Days 4, 5, and 6. The end-of-study (EOS) evaluation also occurred on Day 6. Subjects returned to the study center for a follow-up visit between 7 and 10 days from EOS. Serial blood samples were collected predose and up to 120 hours postdose for the determination of plasma Compound I concentrations. Safety was monitored throughout the study; safety evaluations included AE reporting, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and clinical laboratory safety tests. All AEs and concomitant medications were assessed and recorded throughout the study from the time the ICF was signed through follow-up.","Group 2 (Healthy Males): Subjects in Group 2 participated in this portion of the study to evaluate food effect using a randomized, open-label, single dose, 2-period (Period 1 and Period 2), 2-sequence, 2-way crossover design. Subjects were screened within 21 days of dosing and eligible subjects were admitted to the study center on Day \u22121 (i.e., at least 12 hours predose) for baseline assessments and confirmation of eligibility. On Day 1 of Period 1, following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, subjects were randomized to receive 100 mg Compound I either with or without food (6 subjects received Compound I with food and 6 subjects received Compound I without food) according to a random code. Subjects were discharged from the study center the morning of Day 3 upon completion of study procedures and returned to the study center for PK blood draws and safety assessments on Days 4, 5, and 6.","Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics: Summary demographics for subjects participating in the evaluation of effect of food, effect of gender, and effect of age are presented in Table 47, Table 48 and Table 49, respectively. There were 19 male and 17 female subjects in this study. The mean age of the 36 subjects enrolled in this study was 52.1\u00b115.88 years (range: 24 to 82 years). The mean height was 168.76\u00b18.84 cm (range: 148.8 to 186.8 cm).

interval of 10 to 15 days (i.e., at least 10 days and no more than 15 days from the dosing day (Day 1) of Period 1 to Day 1 of Period 2), subjects were re-admitted to the study center on Day \u22121 of Period 2 (i.e., at least 12 hours predose) for baseline assessments and reconfirmation of eligibility. On Day 1 of Period 2, assigned treatment was switched. Subjects who received Compound I with food in Period 1 received Compound I without food in Period 2 and subjects who received Compound I without food in Period 1 received Compound I with food in Period 2. Subjects were discharged from the study center the morning of Day 3 upon completion of study procedures and returned to the study center for PK blood draws and safety assessments on Days 4, 5, and 6. Day 6 of Period 2 also served as the EOS evaluation. Subjects returned to the study center for a follow-up visit between 7 and 10 days from EOS. In each study period, serial blood samples were collected predose and up to 120 hours postdose for the determination of plasma Compound I concentrations. Safety was monitored throughout the study; safety evaluations included AE reporting, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and clinical laboratory safety tests. All AEs and concomitant medications were assessed and recorded throughout the study from the time the ICF was signed through follow-up.","The effect of age and gender on the PK of Compound I was assessed using data from all healthy subjects who were administered Compound I under fasting conditions (Group 1, Group 2 under fasting conditions, and Group 3). The effect of food on the PK of Compound I was assessed using data from the healthy male subjects in Group 2 who were administered Compound I under fasting and fed conditions in a crossover fashion.","Blood samples from subjects in Groups 1, 2 (both study periods) and 3 were collected predose (O-hr) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose. Acceptable PK sample collection windows were provided to the site prior to study initiation. Specific instructions regarding the collection, handling, processing, storage, and shipment of PK samples were provided to the site via a separate, stand-alone PK Manual. At each time point, approximately 5 mL blood was collected into a pre-chilled K-EDTA tube. Within 30 minutes of blood collection, each sample was centrifuged at 1,500 g (3,000 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to obtain plasma. The plasma was divided into 2 aliquots and transferred into 2 polypropylene tubes (approximately 1 mL plasma per tube). Within 60 minutes of blood collection, plasma samples were transferred into a \u221270\u00b0 C. freezer where they remained stored until they were shipped to the bioanalytical laboratory. Plasma samples were assayed for Compound I using a validated liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy (LC\/MS\/MS) method.","Pharmacokinetics: The following non-compartmental PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentration-time data using WinNonlin (Professional Version 5.1.1). Actual sampling times were used in the calculations:\n\n","The PK profiles of Compound I after a 100 mg single oral dose were characterized and compared to assess the effects of food, age, and gender. In general, the PK of Compound I was similar to that observed in previous studies in healthy subjects with rapid absorption (median Tof 1 to 2 hours under fasting conditions; 4 hours with food) and relatively slow elimination (mean tranging from approximately 23 to 34 hours).","Following a single oral dose of 100 mg Compound I with or without food, the median Tincreased from 1 hour under the fasting condition to 4 hours under the fed condition.
