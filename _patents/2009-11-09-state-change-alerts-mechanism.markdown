{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/624,192, filed Jul. 24, 2000, which claims benefit from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/189,974, filed Mar. 17, 2000, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/195,989, filed Apr. 7, 2000, the entire contents of the prior applications are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to delivering information to a client. More particularly, the present invention relates to alerting a client of a state change within an online service.","Online service providers are constantly offering new services and upgrading existing services to enhance their subscribers online experience. Subscribers have virtually on-demand access to news, weather, financial, sports, and entertainment services as well as the ability to transmit electronic messages and to participate in online discussion groups. For example, subscribers of online service providers such as America Online or CompuServe may view and retrieve information on a wide variety of topics from servers located throughout the world. A server may be maintained by the service provider or by a third party provider who makes information and services available through the network of computers that make up the online service.","The proliferation of electronic mail (email) as a means of communication has facilitated the efforts of online service providers to develop and offer additional services to improve subscribers access to information. For example, a subscriber to America Online may register for a service that tracks stock ticker symbols designated by the subscriber and delivers a daily report directly to the subscriber by email at the end of each trading day. The daily report includes daily closing quote data, index quotes, a market news summary, news associated with the company identified by the ticker symbol, and relevant content links. America Online offers a service that delivers information to a registered subscriber according to the subscribers profile. By setting up a subscriber profile specifying certain categories and\/or search words, a registered subscriber can receive a daily newsletter containing articles that pertain to the subscribers profile. A subscriber can also receive a daily listing of Internet or online sites (links) related to the subscribers profiles and can register to receive reminder emails before holidays and\/or other special occasions.","America Online also has provided subscribers with the ability to send and receive instant messages. Instant messages are private online conversations between two or more people who have subscribed to the instant messaging service and have installed the necessary software. Because such online conversations take place virtually in real time, instant messaging can provide immediate access to desired information. Instant messaging is fast becoming a preferred means of communicating among online subscribers.","In one general aspect, a communications system includes one or more alert gates and an alert controller. Each alert gate is configured to detect a different type of alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert controller is connected to the alert gates and operable to receive detected alerts from the alert gates and to deliver the detected alerts to a user of the communications system.","The alert controller may be configured to maintain a record of alert types registered for by the user of the communications system. The user may be a subscriber of an instant messaging system. The alert controller may deliver one or more detected alerts to the subscriber through the instant messaging system.","The user also may be a subscriber of an online service provider, and the alert controller may deliver one or more detected alerts to the subscriber through the online service provider. The alert controller may be connected to an instant messaging controller through a routing gateway.","The instant messaging controller and the alert controller may be assigned to the user of the communications system according to a hashing technique. Implementations may include multiple alert controllers.","At least one of the alert gates may detect an alert feed from a remote server by sending a status inquiry to the remote server. The remote server may be a mail server, a stock server, a third party server, a weather server and a news server, and\/or a calendar server.","Implementations also may include an alert controller network having multiple alert controllers including the alert controller. The alert controller may be configured to communicate with all alert controllers in the alert controller network.","At least one type of alert feed may contain information related to a group, and the alert controller may be dedicated to receiving information related to certain members of the group. The group may be a group of users, a group of stocks, a group of third parties, and\/or a group of cities.","In another general aspect, a user of a communications system is alerted by detecting, at an alert gate, an alert feed corresponding to an alert indicative of a change in state at a remote server; receiving, at an alert controller, detected alerts from the alert gate; and delivering a detected alert to a user of the communications system when the user has indicated a desire to receive the alert.","For illustrative purposes,  describe a communications system for implementing techniques for alerting a client of a state change within an online service. For brevity, several elements in the figures described below are represented as monolithic entities. However, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, these elements each may include numerous interconnected computers and components designed to perform a set of specified operations and\/or dedicated to a particular geographical region.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging data between a client system  and a host system  through a communications link . The client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and\/or client controllers .

The client system  may be arranged to operate within or in concert with one or more other systems, such as for example, one or more LANs (\u201cLocal Area Networks\u201d) and\/or one or more WANs (\u201cWide Area Networks\u201d).","The client device  is generally capable of executing instructions under the command of a client controller . The client device  is connected to the client controller  by a wired or wireless data pathway  capable of delivering data.","The client device  and client controller  each typically includes one or more hardware components and\/or software components.

Other examples include a special-purpose computer, a workstation, a server, a device, a component, other equipment or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions. An example of client controller  is a software application loaded on the client device  for commanding and directing communications enabled by the client device . Other examples include a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the client device  to interact and operate as described herein. The client controller  may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to the client device .","The communications link  typically includes a delivery network  making a direct or indirect communication between the client system  and the host system , irrespective of physical separation. Examples of a delivery network  include the Internet, the World Wide Web, WANs, LANs, analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, or xDSL), radio, television, cable, satellite, and\/or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  that enables communications through the one or more delivery networks  described above. Each of the communication pathways ,  may include, for example, a wired, wireless, cable or satellite communication pathway.","The host system  includes a host device  capable of executing instructions under the command and direction of a host controller . The host device  is connected to the host controller  by a wired or wireless data pathway  capable of carrying and delivering data.","The host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and\/or host controllers . For example, the host system  may include one or more general-purpose computers (e.g., personal computers), one or more special-purpose computers (e.g., devices specifically programmed to communicate with each other and\/or the client system ), or a combination of one or more general-purpose computers and one or more special-purpose computers. The host system  may be arranged to operate within or in concert with one or more other systems, such as, for example, one or more LANs (\u201cLocal Area Networks\u201d) and\/or one or more WANs (\u201cWide Area Networks\u201d).","The host device  and host controller  each typically includes one or more hardware components and\/or software components.

In particular, the host system  and communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to host system  and communications link  of . Likewise, the client system  of  typically has attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the client system  of .","The client device  typically includes a general purpose computer  having an internal or external storage  for storing data and programs such as an operating system  (e.g., DOS, Windows\u2122, Windows 95\u2122, Windows 98\u2122, Windows 2000\u2122, Windows NT\u2122, OS\/2, or Linux) and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications  (e.g., word processing, database programs, spreadsheet programs, or graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications  (e.g., AOL client, CompuServe client, AIM client, AOL TV client, or ISP client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications  (e.g., Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content.","The general-purpose computer  also includes a central processing unit  (CPU) for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation, the client controller  includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage  of the general-purpose computer . In another implementation, the client controller  includes application programs externally stored in and performed by one or more device(s) external to the general-purpose computer .","The general-purpose computer typically will include a communication device  for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device  is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver, a set-top box, a communication card, a satellite dish, an antenna, or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link  through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general-purpose computer  also may include a TV (\u201ctelevision\u201d) tuner  for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast, satellite, and\/or cable TV signals. As a result, the client device  can selectively and\/or simultaneously display network content received by communications device  and television programming content received by the TV tuner .","The general-purpose computer  typically will include an input\/output interface  for wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices  include, but are not limited to, a mouse , a mobile phone , a personal digital assistant  (PDA), a keyboard , a display monitor  with or without a touch screen input, and\/or a TV remote control  for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers.","Although  illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone , a PDA , and a TV remote control  as being peripheral with respect to the general-purpose computer , in another implementation, such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general-purpose computer  and operate as the client device . For example, the mobile phone  or the PDA  may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device  by accessing the delivery network  and communicating with the host system . Furthermore, the client system  may include one, some or all of the components and devices described above.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems  and  and communications links  and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems  and  shown in , respectively.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system  and other elements of the host device . The host device  also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP (\u201cOnline Service Provider\u201d) host complex  and IM (\u201cInstant Messaging\u201d) host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers, the client system  includes communication software, for example, an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber's interactions with the respective services and, in particular, may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.","Typically, the OSP host complex  supports different services, such as email, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols (i.e., standards, formats, conventions, rules, and structures) to transfer data. The OSP host complex  ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex  may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common, underlying proprietary protocol.","The IM host complex  is generally independent of the OSP host complex , and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber's network or Internet access. Thus, the IM host complex  allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages, whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex  may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex  has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data, the IM host complex  employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.","The host device  may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes, such as the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex  gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex  with the IM host complex  through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily, when used to facilitate a link between complexes, the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex, which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance, the OSP host complex  and IM host complex  generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway  and\/or the IM host complex gateway .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , and  and communications links , , and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems , , and  shown in , respectively. However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex . For purposes of communicating with an OSP host complex , the delivery network  is generally a telephone network.","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex  using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an IM client application, and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with the IM host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","The OSP host complex  supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex  generally may be viewed as existing on the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex  may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example, servers may be arranged in large centralized clusters known as farms  or in localized clusters known as pods .","Farms  are groups of servers located at centralized locations within the OSP host complex . Farms  generally are dedicated to providing particular functionality and services to subscribers and clients from a centralized location, regardless of the location of the subscriber or client. Farms  are particularly useful for providing services that depend upon other processes and services for information, such as, for example, chat, email, instant messaging, news, newsgroups, search, stock updates, and weather. Thus, farms  tend to rely on connections with external resources such as the Internet  and\/or other servers within the OSP host complex .","To reduce the time delays and congestion inherent in centralized processing, some services offered by the OSP host complex  are provided from localized servers, generally known as pods . Each pod  includes one or more interrelated servers capable of operating together to provide one or more services offered by the OSP host complex  in a geographically localized manner, the servers within a pod  generally operating independently rather than relying on resources external to the pod  to operate. A pod  may cache content received from external sources, such as farms  or the Internet , making frequently requested information readily available to local subscribers served by the pod . In this way, pods  are particularly useful in providing services that are independent of other processes and servers such as, for example, routing, keywords, and downloading certain software and graphical interface updates with reduced processing time and congestion. The determination of which servers and processes are located in the pod  is made by the OSP according to load distribution, frequency of requests, demographics, and other factors.","In addition to farms  and pods , the implementation of  also includes one or more non-podded servers . In general, the non-podded server  may be dedicated to performing a particular service that relies on other processes and services for information and may be directly or indirectly connected to resources outside of the OSP host complex , such as the Internet  and the IM host complex , through an OSP gateway . In the event that subscriber usage of the particular service is relatively high, the non-podded server  may be included in a farm.","In the implementation of , a pod , shown in more detail, includes a routing processor . In a packet-based implementation, the client system  may generate information requests, convert the requests into data packets, sequence the data packets, perform error checking and other packet-switching techniques, and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system , the routing processor  may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . In general, the routing processor  will examine an address field of a data request, use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request, and direct the data request to the appropriate destination.","For example, in the event that a data request from the client system  can be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request to a local server  in the pod . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request internally to one or more farms , one or more other pods , or one or more non-podded servers  in the OSP host complex , or may direct the data request externally to the Internet  or the IM host complex  through an OSP\/pod gateway .","The routing processor  also may direct data requests and\/or otherwise facilitate communication between the client system  and the Internet . In one implementation, the client system  uses an OSP client application to convert standard Internet content and protocols into OSP protocols and vice versa. For example, when a browser application transmits a request in standard Internet protocol, the OSP client application can intercept the request, convert the request into an OSP protocol and send the converted request to the routing processor  in the OSP host complex . The routing processor  recognizes the Internet  as the destination and routes the data packets to an IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) tunnel . The IP tunnel  converts the data from the OSP protocol back into standard Internet protocol and transmits the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel  also converts the data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the data to the routing processor  for delivery back to the client system . At the client system , the OSP client application converts the data in the OSP protocol back into standard Internet content for communication with the browser application.","The IP tunnel  may act as a buffer between the client system  and the Internet , and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example, the IP tunnel  can check parental controls settings of the client system  and request and transmit content from the Internet  according to the parental control settings. In addition, the IP tunnel  may include a number a caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches, the IP tunnel  may send the information to the client system  from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .","In another implementation, the client system  may use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the pod  and the Internet . For example, the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system  to generate a request in standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). In a packet-based implementation, data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d) and routed to a web tunnel . The web tunnel  may be a L2TP (\u201cLayer Two Tunneling Protocol\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (PPP) session with the client system . The web tunnel  provides a gateway to the routing processor  within the pod , the Internet , and a web proxy .","The web proxy  can look up subscriber information from the IP address of the client system  to determine the subscriber's parental controls settings and other demographic information. In this way, the web proxy  can tailor the subscriber's content and user interfaces. The web proxy  can also perform caching functions to store certain URLs (\u201cUniform Resource Locators\u201d) and other electronic content so that the web proxy  can locally deliver information to the client system  and avoid the need to access the Internet  in the event that data requested by the client system  has been cached.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to .

However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex . For purposes of communicating with the IM host complex , the delivery network  is generally a telephone network.","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  utilizing exclusive IM protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an OSP client application, and\/or an Internet browser application for communicating with the OSP host complex  and the Internet , respectively.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","To access the IM host complex  to begin an instant messaging session, the client system  establishes a connection to the login server . The login server  typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex  by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex , the login server  employs a hashing technique on the subscriber's screen name to identify a particular IM server  for use during the subscriber's session. The login server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular IM server , gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie), and breaks the connection. The client system  then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server  through the communications link , and obtains access to that IM server  using the encrypted key. Typically, the client system  will be equipped with a Winsock API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) that enables the client system  to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .","Once a connection to the IM server  has been established, the client system  may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server  and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server  supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers  may support associated services, such as, for example, administrative matters, directory services, chat and interest groups. In general, the purpose of the domain servers  is to lighten the load placed on the IM server  by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server  and\/or the domain server , a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","In the implementation of , the IM server  is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway  facilitates the connection between the IM server  and one or more alert multiplexors , for example, by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers to several alert multiplexors. In general, an alert multiplexor  maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.","Once the client system  is connected to the alert multiplexor , a subscriber can register for and\/or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system  and the alert multiplexor  is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server  to identify the particular alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session. Once the particular multiplexor  has been identified, the IM server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor  and gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie). The client system  then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor  through the communication link  and obtains access to the alert multiplexor  using the encrypted key.","The alert multiplexor  is connected to an alert gate  that, like the IM host complex gateway , is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate  is the interface between the IM host complex  and the physical servers, such as servers in the OSP host complex , where state changes are occurring. In general, the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However, the alert multiplexor  also may communicate with the OSP host complex  through the IM gateway , for example, to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex  with certain information gathered from the alert gate .","The alert gate  can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate  may include a piece of code (alert receive code) capable of interacting with another piece of code (alert broadcast code) on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general, the alert receive code installed on the alert gate  instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate  upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed, the alert gate  contacts the alert multiplexor , which in turn, informs the client system  of the detected alert feed.","In the implementation of , the IM host complex  also includes a subscriber profile server  connected to a database  for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server  may be used to enter, retrieve, edit, manipulate, or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation, a subscriber's profile data includes, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, designated stocks, identified interests, and geographic location. The subscriber may enter, edit and\/or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system  to interact with the subscriber profile server .","Because the subscriber's data is stored in the IM host complex , the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex  using new or a different client system . Accordingly, when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex , the IM server  can instruct the subscriber profile server  to retrieve the subscriber's profile data from the database  and to provide, for example, the subscriber's buddy list to the IM server  and the subscriber's alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server  also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex  to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively, user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , ,  and  and communications links , , ,  and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems , , ,  and  shown in , respectively. However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex . For purposes of communicating with the IM host complex , the delivery network  is generally a telephone network.","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the IM host complex . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  utilizing exclusive IM protocols.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including the IM host complex . The IM host complex  includes an IM server network  and an alert multiplexor network . The IM server network  is an interconnected network of IM servers and the alert multiplexor network  is an interconnected network of alert multiplexors. Each IM server and each alert multiplexor can directly or indirectly communicate and exchange information with all of the IM servers in the IM server network  and all of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network . Each of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network  is connected to several alert gates  that receive different types of alerts. In the implementation of , the IM server network  and the alert multiplexor network  are interconnected by a routing gateway  that serves as a common hub to reduce the number of connections.","A subscriber typically will be assigned to one IM server in the IM server network  and to one alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  during a session based on one or more hashing techniques. However, the IM servers and the alert multiplexors are capable of storing subscriber information and other electronic content that may be accessed by the other IM servers and alert multiplexors. In one implementation, for example, each IM server in the IM server network  may be dedicated to serving a particular set of registered subscribers. Because all of the IM servers can communicate with each other, all subscribers can communicate with each other through instant messaging. In another implementation, each alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  may be dedicated to storing information about a particular set or subset of alerts. Because all of the alert multiplexors can communicate with each other, all registered subscribers can receive all types of alerts. This networking arrangement enables the load to be distributed among the various servers in the IM host complex  while still enabling a subscriber to communicate, share information, or otherwise interact with other subscribers and servers in the IM host complex .","Referring to , a client device , an alert multiplexor , a profile server , and an alert gate  interact according to a procedure  to deliver an alert message to a subscriber. The procedure  may be implemented by any type of hardware, software, device, computer, computer system, equipment, component, program, application, code, storage medium, or propagated signal.","Initially, a subscriber may use the client device  to connect to the alert multiplexor  (step ). Typically, the client device  will include an installed IM client application and will be equipped with a Winsock API that enables the client device  to establish an open TCP connection to the alert multiplexor . It also may be necessary to perform one or more hashing techniques to identify the alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session.","Once a connection to the alert multiplexor  has been established, a subscriber may use the client device  to send an alert registration to the alert multiplexor  (step ). The alert registration may inform the alert multiplexor  that the subscriber desires to enable the alert capabilities of the alert multiplexor . The alert multiplexor , in turn, may receive the alert registration from the client device  (step ) and enable the alert capabilities such as, for example, stock alerts, mail alerts, weather alerts, calendar alerts, news alerts, third party alerts, or any other comparable type of alert.","A subscriber may also use the client device  to generate a subscriber record that includes the particular types of alerts desired by the subscriber and other alert preferences. The alert preferences may include the conditions for tripping the alerts, the timing of the alerts, and\/or the presentation method of the alerts. In general, alert messages may take the form of an instant message, an icon, a pop-up window, and\/or an audio alarm that appears during a subscriber's IM session. A subscriber also may choose to receive offline notification of alerts, so that the subscriber may be informed of certain changes in state even when the subscriber is not running the IM client application. For example, a subscriber may set up alert preferences to request notification, for example, by telephone, email, or pager.","In one implementation, an IM client application installed on a client device  may generate a URL based on the subscriber record. The URL may specify, for example, the protocol, the site name, and a path that corresponds to the alert preferences. The client device  may use a browser application, such as, for example, an embedded HTTP engine in the IM client application, to navigate to the URL to directly or indirectly retrieve data corresponding to particular types of alerts.","Typically, a subscriber will generate a subscriber record during an initial session by interacting with UIs (\u201cUser Interfaces\u201d) presented on the client device . The subscriber record may be stored locally on the client device  so that the subscriber does not have to reenter the alert preferences for subsequent sessions unless, of course, the subscriber is using a different client device or desires to change alert preferences. Additionally, the subscriber record may be persistently stored in a centralized database in the host system.","In the event that the subscriber record is stored in a database in the host system, the alert multiplexor  may request the subscriber record from the profile server  (step ). The profile server  may receive the request for the subscriber record (step ), retrieve the subscriber record from the database (step ), and send the subscriber record to the alert multiplexor  (step ).","The alert multiplexor  receives the subscriber record from the profile server  (step ) and then communicates with the alert gate . In one implementation, the alert multiplexor  may send an alert request to the alert gate  based on the subscriber record (step ). Namely, the alert multiplexor  may instruct the alert gate  to start searching for alert feeds corresponding to any alerts designated in the subscriber record and\/or to send alert notifications when an alert feed corresponding to any alerts designated in the subscriber record is detected. The alert gate  receives the alert request from the alert multiplexor  (step ) and, in response, searches for and detects alert feeds (step ).","In another implementation, the alert gate  continuously searches for a particular type of alert feed. The alert gate  may be loaded with a software program or piece of code that instructs the alert gate  to detect a particular alert feed from a remote server, such as, for example, a remote server in an OSP complex or the Internet. The alert feed may correspond to one subscriber or a group of subscribers depending upon load distribution. Typically, the remote server will be loaded with a software program or piece of code that instructs the server to broadcast an alert feed based on some triggering event to one or more specified alert gates. The broadcast of the alert feed may be a continuous or periodic broadcast of the state, may be a broadcast in response to a change in state, or may be a broadcast in response to a status inquiry (e.g., polling). As used herein, state refers to any condition of being that may be represented by the remote server. A change in state can be any updated condition of being and may be internal or external to the remote sever.","Upon detecting the alert feed (step ), the alert gate  may send an alert notification to the alert multiplexor  (step ). The alert notification will inform the alert multiplexor  of the alert feed, the condition that triggered the alert feed, and\/or the need to contact a particular subscriber. In one implementation, the alert gate  may send an alert notification to an alert multiplexor  that is associated with a particular subscriber during a session. This is typically the case for alerts relating to personalized information such as, for example, mail alerts and calendar alerts. In another implementation, the alert gate  may send an alert notification to an alert multiplexor  that that is associated with a particular type of alert. This is generally the case for alerts relating to information of interest to a large number of subscribers, such as, for example, stock alerts, weather alerts, news alerts, and third party alerts.","Typically, the alert multiplexor  will be loaded with a software program or piece of code for instructing the alert multiplexor  to receive and\/or retrieve messages from the alert gate . The alert multiplexor  may be set to continuously or periodically receive and\/or retrieve messages the alert gate . The alert multiplexor  may receive the alert notification from the alert gate  (step ), and may then determine whether the alert notification corresponds to an alert of interest to a registered subscriber. In the event that a subscriber has requested notification about the particular alert feed, the alert multiplexor  sends an alert message to the client device  of the registered subscriber (step ). If the subscriber has requested offline notification about the particular alert, the alert multiplexor  may send an alert message to the appropriate offline device of the subscriber. The alert message may contain information about the alert feed and\/or the condition that triggered the alert feed. The alert multiplexor  alone or in conjunction with other servers may perform sorting, prioritizing, or other types of organizational processing on the alert messages so that the client device  is notified in an optimal fashion.","The client device  receives the alert message from the alert multiplexor  (step ), and then responds to the alert message (step ). For example, the subscriber may use the client device  to generate a response appropriate to the particular alert feed or triggering condition. Alternatively, the client device  may respond automatically to particular alert feeds and\/or triggering conditions in a defined manner.","A stock alert is one example of an alert message that may be requested by a subscriber.  illustrate several different UIs that may be used to set a subscriber's stock alert preferences by selecting certain options of and inputting information into the fields of the UIs.","Referring to , a UI  may include a ticker symbol field  for entering the ticker symbol of one or more stocks to track and an index field  for selecting one or more stock indexes to track. The UI also may include a refresh field  for designating the interval at which the stock data is updated. The UI  may further include a stock alert button  for setting and editing stock alert preferences.","Referring to , a UI  may include an enabled field  for enabling a stock alert for a particular stock and a stock selection field  for selecting a particular stock to trip a stock alert message. The UI  also may include a notification field  for selecting the conditions that trip the stock alert. Typically, a stock alert will be tripped based on price and\/or volume, such as, for example, when the price exceeds a certain level, is below a certain level, is above the 52 week high, is below 52 week low, or is above or below a previous close by a certain amount, or when the volume of trading is above or below a certain amount. The UI  also may include an alert presentation field  for selecting the manner in which an alert message is presented to a subscriber, for example, by showing an alert notification window and\/or playing a sound.","Referring to , a UI  may include a display field  for showing whether a stock alert has been tripped, the ticker symbol of the stock, and the conditions that trip the stock alert. The UI  also may include an alert selection field  for selecting which of the stock alerts to display. The UI  may include an add button , an edit button , and a remove button  for adding, editing and removing certain stock alerts and may include a reset button  for resetting a stock alert that has been tripped. The UI  also may include a day selection field  and time selection field  for selecting when to run the stock alerts, for example, only on certain days and\/or only at certain times during the day.","Referring to , a UI  illustrates a stock alert message that may be presented to a subscriber. The stock alert message may be any type of instant message, pop-up window, icon and\/or audible alarm capable of getting a subscriber's attention. The stock alert message may include an information field  containing information such as the last price, the dollar change, the percent change, the high, the low, the open, the previous close, the 52 week high, the 52 week low, and\/or the trading volume. The UI  also may include an edit button  for editing the presentation of the alert, a chart button  for displaying a stock performance chart, and a more information button  for linking to OSP or Internet websites that provide more detailed information about the particular stock, financial advice, and\/or contact information for online or offline stock brokers.","As the stock market fluctuates, a stock alert server, for example, in an OSP host complex or the Internet, broadcasts a stock alert feed to indicate the changing stock prices. The stock alert feed may correspond to one stock, a group of stocks, or all stocks depending upon load distribution. A stock alert gate detects the stock alert feed and then, alone or in conjunction with one or more alert multiplexors, sorts and sends alert notifications to an alert multiplexor network. Each alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network may be dedicated to stock alerts for a certain set of stock ticker symbols and for a certain set of registered subscribers. By communicating with each other, all of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network have access to information including the complete set of subscribers registered to receive stock alerts, the selected stocks of each registered subscriber, the alert multiplexor and the IM server dedicated to each subscriber during a session, and the alert multiplexors dedicated to the selected stocks. Based on this information, the alert multiplexor network can send, deliver, retrieve, and\/or receive stock alert notifications corresponding to all of the stocks selected by all of the registered subscribers and may command the IM client application of each registered subscriber to display an appropriate stock alert message.","A mail alert is another example of an alert message that may be requested by a subscriber.  illustrate different UIs that may be used to set a subscriber's mail alert preferences by selecting certain options and inputting information into the fields of the UIs.","Referring to , a UI  may include an alert notification field  for setting and editing certain mail alert preferences including the manner in which an alert message is presented to a subscriber, for example, by showing an alert notification window and\/or playing a sound. The UI  also may include an email address display field  for showing the email addresses that trip a mail alert. The UI  may include an add mail box button , an edit button , and a remove button  for adding, editing and removing email addresses that trip a mail alert.","Referring to , a UI  may include a type field  for entering the type of email account, e.g., a POP3 mail account, and an email address field  for entering the type and address of an email account that trips a mail alert. The UI  also may include a password field  for entering the password to the email account, a server name field  for entering the name of the server for the email account, a program field  for entering the program used to access the email account, and a time field  for entering the interval at which the email account is checked.","Referring to , a UI  illustrates a mail alert message that may be presented to a subscriber. The mail alert message may be any type of instant message, pop-up window, icon and\/or audible alarm capable of getting a subscriber's attention. The mail alert message may include an information field  containing information such as one or more email addresses, whether each of the email address contains unread email, and when the email address was last checked for unread email.","As email messages are received, a mail alert server, for example, in an OSP host complex or the Internet, broadcasts a mail alert feed to indicate changing mail status. The mail alert feed may correspond to one subscriber, a group of subscribers, or all subscribers depending upon load distribution. The mail alert feed is sent to a mail gateway that performs any necessary protocol conversion and then directs the mail alert feed to a mail alert gate.","The mail alert gate detects the mail alert feed and then, alone or in conjunction with one or more alert multiplexors, sorts and sends mail alert notifications to an alert multiplexor network. Each alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network may be dedicated to receiving mail alert notifications for a certain set of registered subscribers. Upon receiving a mail alert notification, the alert multiplexor examines whether the mail alert notification corresponds to any of its subscribers. In the event that the alert notification is for one of its subscribers, the alert multiplexor commands the IM client application running on the subscriber's client device to indicate that the subscriber has unread email. Once notified, the subscriber may use the client device to read the email message, typically with an email client application.","Email messages are received and\/or stored by a mail server alone or in cooperation with a mail repository. The mail server and mail repository may be part of an OSP host complex or any type of server capable of receiving and\/or storing email whether internal or external to the OSP host complex. Email messages may be received and stored from any type of email account including, but not limited to an OSP based email account, an ISP based email account, a Web-based email account, and a POP3 email account.","A third party alert is another example of alert message that may be requested by a subscriber. A third party is broadly understood to include any individual or business entity that provides goods or services. In general, a subscriber may register to receive alerts from one or more third parties that provide a certain category of services. In one implementation, the OSP queries subscribers as to whether they would like to receive various categories of third party alerts. For example, the OSP may partner with various suppliers of computer merchandise and may query subscribers as to whether they would like to receive alerts from any or all third parties that supply computer merchandise. In another implementation, a subscriber may register to receive an alert message at a third party's web site. Once a subscriber has registered to receive the alert, the third party directly or indirectly sends to the subscriber an alert including, for example, a promotional advertisement, a coupon, a notification that an order is done and\/or a service is complete, and a message regarding confirmation, cancellation, and\/or rescheduling of an appointment.","A weather alert is another example of an alert message that may be requested by a subscriber. In one implementation, a subscriber may register to receive an alert message that informs the subscriber of a weather forecast and\/or adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region.","A calendar alert is another example of an alert message that may be requested by a subscriber.
