{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Portable Document Format (PDF) is a standard found in common use for electronic documents. PDF is used to represent electronic documents in a way that is independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. Each PDF file encapsulates a description of a fixed layout, flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information used to display it. Some PDF files include a field capability that, when used in a PDF, facilitates the creation of forms that may be filled out by the user. The completed PDF form may be saved electronically or printed. PDF-based forms are popular because they support autonomous and disconnected operation.","The present disclosure relates to creating and manipulating forms in electronic documents such as PDF files or other electronic documents. While PDF forms provide a convenient electronic replacement for traditional paper forms, PDF forms can be very inconvenient to manage, especially when managing bulk forms or many different PDF forms. Also, it may be difficult to apply changes to multiple form objects (i.e., fields) at the same time. Such changes may relate to field definitions such as, for example, font, drop-down lists, positions, sizes, etc. Further, in certain situations, a user may have to fill out a multitude of different PDF forms, which may be difficult to process automatically due to different respective form field naming conventions.","Various embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate editing and other processing of forms in electronic documents, such as PDF forms or other forms. A data grid may be displayed in conjunction with a PDF form to allow the form fields of a PDF form to be viewed and manipulated with bulk operations. A form field shaper utility may be provided to insert or modify existing form fields through a graphical user interface. Multiple different PDF forms in multiple PDF files may be combined into a single electronic document to facilitate efficient data collection. Various embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate a significant savings relating to labor to maintain form appearances, such as mass changes of fonts, alignments, field sizes, etc. Moreover, data integrity may be maintained through mass updates to drop-down lists, mass updates of field names to match data dictionary standards, and so on. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a computing device  according to various embodiments. The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, set-top boxes, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, electronic book readers, or other devices with like capability. The computing device  may include a display . The display  may comprise, for example, one or more devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRTs), liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, gas plasma-based flat panel displays, LCD projectors, or other types of display devices, etc.","Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores  as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a form management application , a spreadsheet application , an electronic document application , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The form management application  is executed to obtain metadata describing a form in an electronic document and to generate a user interface for managing the form. The user interface for managing the form facilitates bulk transformations for the form such that multiple form fields or form field definitions may be manipulated or modified through a single operation.","The spreadsheet application  is executed to provide a portion of the user interface generated by the form management application . In one embodiment, a spreadsheet containing a data grid is generated by the form management application . The cells of the data grid are mapped by the form management application  to form field definitions of an electronic document. Operations supported by the spreadsheet application  may be employed to transform the form of the electronic document. In various embodiments, the spreadsheet application  may correspond to a commercially available application such as Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae, Apple\u00ae Numbers, OpenOffice.org Calc, and so on.","The electronic document application  is executed to facilitate reading, creating, and\/or modifying electronic documents such as PDF files. The electronic document application  may allow creation of forms in electronic documents and\/or filing out forms in electronic documents. Non-limiting examples of commercially available electronic document applications  include Foxit\u00ae Phantom\u00ae, Foxit\u00ae Reader, Adobe\u00ae Reader, Adobe\u00ae Acrobat\u00ae, Nuance\u00ae PDF Reader, and so on. The form management application  may interact with the electronic document application  by way of an application programming interface (API) or other approach.","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, electronic documents , a data dictionary , and potentially other data. The electronic documents  correspond to PDF files and\/or other types of electronic documents. The electronic documents  may correspond to multi-page documents. The electronic documents  may each include one or more forms . Each form  may have one or more form fields . The form fields  may correspond, for example, to text input boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, drop-down boxes, and\/or other types of form fields. Each form field  may be associated with a plurality of form field definitions  such as, for example, field name, field type, field action, page number, position relative to a page dimension, font, color, size, and other field definitions. The data dictionary  may include standardized data for use, for example, in normalizing options for drop-down boxes, color of field elements (e.g., border, background, etc.) or other form fields .","The display  may show a user interface  rendered by the form management application , the spreadsheet application , and\/or the electronic document application . The user interface  may include a data grid , a rendered electronic document , and\/or other components. The data grid  may correspond to a selection and presentation interface of the form management application  generated in conjunction with the spreadsheet application . The rendered electronic document  may correspond to a presentation of an electronic document  that is currently loaded for management by the form management application . In various embodiments, the rendered electronic document  corresponds to a temporary file that reflects changes undertaken through the form management application  before those changes are saved to the electronic document  in the data store .","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the computing device  is provided. To begin, a user may load an electronic document  using the electronic document application . The electronic document  may include one or more forms . From the electronic document application , the user may be able to launch the form management application . Alternatively, the user may launch the form management application  and select an electronic document  or set of electronic documents . For example, the user may specify a directory for the form management application  and all electronic documents  within that directory may be loaded. The electronic document(s)  are read into memory, and the metadata describing the forms  is obtained by the form management application .","From the metadata, the form management application  is able to generate a data grid  that displays the form field definitions  for the form fields  of the form . In one embodiment, the data grid  corresponds to a spreadsheet. The data grid  may be displayed by the spreadsheet application . In one embodiment, the data grid  may be displayed on one display  and the rendered electronic document  may be displayed on another display . Which display  of multiple displays  is employed for the electronic document  or the data grid  may be a user configurable parameter of the form management application .","The contents of the data grid  may be linked to the forms  of the rendered electronic document . When a user selects one or more cells in the data grid , the corresponding form fields  may be highlighted automatically in the rendered electronic document . When a form field definition  for a form field  is updated in the data grid , the rendered electronic document  may be updated in response to the user input respecting the data grid  or may be updated in response to a user-selected update request. In one embodiment, a new electronic document  is created and then rendered as the rendered electronic document . In another embodiment, the existing electronic document  may be manipulated in memory by the form management application  and re-rendered by the electronic document application .","It is noted that a user may perform an action relating to multiple form field definitions  and\/or multiple form fields  using the data grid . In some cases, an action may relate to multiple forms  from multiple electronic documents . Additionally, various tools of the spreadsheet application  may be available to manipulate data of the data grid , which may then be reflected in the rendered electronic document .","For example, a data grid  may show the form fields  listed according to the tab order of a form . A user may use a sort function of the spreadsheet application  to reorder the form fields  alphabetically by field name. Then, the user may apply the change to the rendered electronic document , and a new tab order may be adopted according to the sort of the data grid . Other possible form field  modifications that may be made using the data grid  may include, for example, changes to field type, changes to field size, creation and editing of drop-down fields, colors for drop-down fields, field fonts, and\/or other modifications.","In one embodiment, tools may be available to verify the integrity of the data in the data grid  and to normalize the data if necessary. For example, the options available for a form field  that is a drop-down box may be analyzed with respect to a data dictionary . The options may be standardized according to the data dictionary . Further, if multiple electronic documents  are to be combined into one electronic document , form fields  having duplicate names may be renamed to meet a uniqueness constraint.","Referring next to , shown is one example of a rendered electronic document  that is generated through the electronic document application  () executed in the computing device  (). The rendered electronic document  includes a form  related to customer data collection. The form  of  includes multiple form fields  to collect, for example, the name, address, city, state, and postal code of the customer. The form  in  also includes a drop-down form field  for the customer to select a referral source, e.g., a search engine or another referral source. The electronic document  () corresponding to the rendered electronic document  may be filled out and saved by the customer in an autonomous and disconnected manner. The fields of the generated form are based on fields extracted from forms loaded by the electronic document application . It may be the case that only unique fields in the electronic document  are automatically included by the form management application  () in the rendered electronic document . For example, while an address form field  may be found in multiple forms, it may be placed only once in the rendered electronic document  by the form management application  ().","Turning now to , shown is one example of a user interface  rendered by the form management application  () in the computing device  (). The user interface  includes an electronic document portion , which in turn includes the rendered electronic document  as depicted in . In one embodiment, the electronic document portion  is rendered by the electronic document application  (). In another embodiment, the rendered electronic document  is rendered by the electronic document application , while the surrounding electronic document portion  is rendered by the form management application .","The user interface  also includes a data grid portion , which in turn includes a data grid . Although the data grid portion  and the electronic document portion  are shown in the same user interface , it is understood that the data grid portion  and the electronic document portion  may be shown on the same display  () or different displays . In one embodiment, the data grid portion  is rendered by a spreadsheet application  (), and the data grid  corresponds to a spreadsheet. Additional buttons and other user interface components associated with the spreadsheet application  may be present in the data grid portion . Components rendered by the form management application  may also be present in the data grid portion  in some embodiments. The data grid  may be larger than the available space on the display . If so, a horizontal scrollbar  and\/or a vertical scrollbar  may be rendered to facilitate display of other portions of the data grid .","The data grid  may be organized, for example, into rows and columns. For example, the form fields  () may be organized along a first axis, and the form field definitions  () corresponding to the form fields  may be organized along a second axis. As shown in , six form fields , , , , , and are described in the data grid , one in each row of the data grid . The columns of the data grid  correspond to form field definitions , , , , and . In the example of , the form field definitions , , , , and correspond, respectively, to field name, field type, font, field size, and alignment.","Additional form field definitions  may be present in the data grid  and accessed by scrolling the viewport of the data grid  using the horizontal scrollbar . In some embodiments, one or more form fields  may not have all of the form field definitions  that other ones of the form fields  have. In such a case, the cell corresponding to the intersection of the form field row and field definition column may be empty or occupied by a placeholder.","In the non-limiting example of , the electronic document portion  of the user interface  includes various user interface components associated with the form management application . In particular, the electronic document portion  includes a read form component , a write form component , and a field shaper component . The read form component , write form component , and the field shaper component  are depicted as buttons but may be other user interface components in other examples.","The read form component , when selected, reads the metadata from an electronic document  loaded by the electronic document application  and generates a data grid  with the corresponding form data. The write form component , when selected, writes the modified form information from the data grid  to the electronic document . The field shaper component , when selected, launches a field management utility of the form management application  that will be described in connection with .","Moving on to , shown is another example of a user interface  rendered by the form management application  () in the computing device  (). In , a user has made a selection  corresponding to form field definitions () for each one of the form fields , , , , and (). The selection  may be emphasized in the data grid  using a border, highlighting, bold text, or another form of emphasis. In response to the selection  being made, the form management application  has also emphasized the corresponding form fields  in the rendered electronic document .","Continuing on to , shown is yet another example of a user interface  rendered by the form management application  () in the computing device  (). In , the user has modified the data contained in the cells of the data grid  encompassed within the selection . In this case, the user has applied a formula through the spreadsheet application  () to reduce the field size of each of the selected form fields -() by 5. Accordingly, while in  the corresponding cells show , , , , and , in , the corresponding cells show , , , , and . Moreover, the rendered electronic document  has been updated to reduce the size of the emphasized form fields .","It is noted that multiple form fields of the rendered electronic document  may be modified based upon user input respecting multiple cells of the data grid . Therefore, a user need not select and modify each form field  separately. Also, tools of the spreadsheet application  may be employed to facilitate potentially complex modifications of multiple form fields . As a non-limiting example, the form fields  may be given modified field names in bulk by prepending some prefix to an existing field name. If the user is satisfied with the change to the rendered electronic document , the corresponding electronic document  () may be saved by activating the write form component  ().","Turning now to , shown is an example of a field management user interface  rendered by the form management application  () in the computing device  (). In one embodiment, the field management user interface  is rendered in conjunction with the user interface  () so that the rendered electronic document  () may be viewable at the same time on a display  (). The field management user interface  facilitates the adjustment of various parameters for form fields  () that affect visual characteristics of the form fields . For example, the field management user interface  may allow a user to change a dimension of a form field  (e.g., width, height, etc.). The field management user interface  may also allow a user to change the position of the form field  within a page of the electronic document  ().","The example of the field management user interface  shown in  is configured to adjust the \u201ccustomer_zip\u201d form field shown in . A drop-down box  indicates that the \u201ccustomer_zip\u201d form field is currently selected, though other form fields  may potentially be selected. A previous field component  and a next field component  may be used to jump to the previous or next form field  of the form  () of the electronic document , for example, in tab order or in some other order.","Coordinate entry fields and may allow a user to enter coordinates that define a position of the form field  within the page of the electronic document . To this end, the coordinate entry fields  may control the positioning of the top-left corner of the form field  or some other reference point relative to the top-left corner of the page or some other reference point. Dimension entry fields and may allow a user to enter dimension values that define the size of a form field . As a non-limiting example, the dimension entry fields  may respectively define the height and width of a form field .","The field management user interface  may include movement components , , , and for moving the form field  up, to the right, down, or to the left, respectively, within the electronic document . In this non-limiting example, the movement components , , , and are buttons. When a movement component , , , or is selected, the form field  is moved on the rendered electronic document  () by a predefined increment. The predefined increment may be configured by the user through an increment field  of the field management user interface . The increment may be specified in points, pixels, inches, millimeters, or other type of measurement.","The field management user interface  may include expansion components , , , and for expanding the form field  outwardly from a top side, from a right side, from a bottom side, or a left side, respectively. In this non-limiting example, the expansion components , , , and are buttons. When an expansion component , , , or is selected, the form field  is expanded outwardly by a predefined, potentially configurable, increment which may be the same increment or a different increment from that specified in the increment field .","The field management user interface  may include contraction components , , , and for contracting the form field  inwardly from a top side, from a right side, from a bottom side, or a left side, respectively. In this non-limiting example, the contraction components , , , and are buttons. When a contraction component , , , or is selected, the form field  is contracted inwardly by a predefined, potentially configurable, increment which may be the same increment or a different increment from that specified in the increment field .","When the movement components , expansion components , or contraction components  are selected, the rendered electronic document  may be updated in response to show the modification being applied to the form field  of the electronic document . Likewise, when the user enters a new value in the coordinate entry fields  or the dimension entry fields , the rendered electronic document  may be updated in response. Further, the coordinate entry fields  and\/or dimension entry fields  may be updated with new values after the movement components , expansion components , or contraction components  are selected. After the rendered electronic document  is modified, the user may select the write form component  () to save the modifications to the electronic document .","The field management user interface  may include a split field component . When selected, the split field component  may cause the form management application  to split the form field  into two form fields  that are side-by-side or arranged according to another predefined arrangement. The field management user interface  may include a clone field component . When selected, the clone field component  may cause the form management application  to duplicate the form field  into another form field  having the same characteristics. Both the split field component  and the clone field component  may modify the names of one or more of the two form fields  to ensure that there is no namespace collision.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the form management application  according to various embodiments.
