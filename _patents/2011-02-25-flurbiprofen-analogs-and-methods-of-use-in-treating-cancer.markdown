title: Flurbiprofen analogs and methods of use in treating cancer
abstract: Flurbiprofen analog compounds having an amino acid derivatized at the flurbiprofen alkanoic acid carboxyl group and terminating at an ester or amide group are effective in inhibiting cancer cells in vitro and inhibiting the growth of cancers in viva. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them are particularly useful for the treatment of lung, pancreatic and head and neck cancers.

The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to flurbiprofen analogs and their use in treating cancers, including lung-cell, head and neck, and pancreatic cancers.","Adenocarcinoma, arising from the bronchial mucosal glands, is the most frequent non-small cell lung cancer in the United States, representing 35-40% of all lung cancers and usually occurs in a peripheral location within the lung. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype, and may manifest as a \u201cscar carcinoma.\u201d This is the subtype observed most commonly in persons who do not smoke and may manifest as multifocal tumors in a bronchoalveolar form.","Bronchoalveolar carcinoma is a distinct subtype of adenocarcinoma with a classic manifestation as an interstitial lung disease on chest radiograph. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma arises from type II pneumocytes and grows along alveolar septa. This subtype may manifest as a solitary peripheral nodule, multifocal disease, or a rapidly progressing pneumonic form. A characteristic finding in persons with advanced disease is voluminous watery sputum.","Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 25-30% of all lung cancers. The classic manifestation is a cavitary lesion in a proximal bronchus. This type is characterized histologically by the presence of keratin pearls and can be detected based on results from cytologic studies because it has a tendency to exfoliate. It is the type most often associated with hypercalcemia.","Large cell carcinoma accounts for 10-15% of lung cancers, typically manifesting as a large peripheral mass on chest radiograph. Histologically, this type has sheets of highly atypical cells with focal necrosis, with no evidence of keratinization (typical of squamous cell carcinoma) or gland formation (typical of adenocarcinomas).","The invention includes, in one aspect, a flurbiprofen analog compound having the structural formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"43.35mm","wi":"38.18mm","file":"US08575170-20131105-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, where Ris selected from H or a 1-4 carbon alkyl, Ris selected from F, Cl, and Br and may include two or more Rsubstitutions on the ring, Ris selected from H, F, Cl and Br, and may include two or more non-H substitutions on the ring, \u2014NH\u2014CH(R)\u2014C(O)\u2014 is a hydrophobic amino acid, and C(O)Ris an amide or ester.","In various exemplary embodiments, \u2014NH\u2014CH(R)\u2014C(O)\u2014 may be selected from one of L-(4-Phenylphenyl)alanine) (Bip), L-3,3-Diphenylalanine (Dip), O-(2,6-dicholorbenzyl)-L-tyrosine (OC2Y), L-3-(2-Naphthyl)alanine (2Nal), L-3-Benzothienylalanine (Bta), L-\u03b2-Cyclohexylalanine (\u03b2Cha), L-3-Pyridylalanine (3Pal), \u03b2-(p-Biphenylyl)-\u03b2-alanine (\u03b2Bpa), L-4-Trifluoromethylphenylalanine (F3MF), L-Fluorophenylalanine (PFF), and L-Melphalane (MEL).","C(O)Rmay be an amide that terminates in an H atom or a 1-6 carbon linear, branched or cyclic alkyl or alkenyl group, including cyclic groups with one or more nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur ring atoms.

Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable materials can be sterilized for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter.","The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampules and vials, and may be stored in a lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the type described above.","In one aspect, the invention includes a method of inhibiting cancer cells by exposing the cells to an inhibitory concentration of the flurbiprofen compound of the invention. The data presented in Section IIIA below demonstrate that the method is effective against a wide variety of cancer cells associated with both non-small and small-cell lung carcinomas cell lines, head and neck cancer cell lines, pancreatic cancer cell lines, a colon cancer line, and brain cancer cell lines. The mechanism by which the compounds inhibit cell survival and growth is discussed in Section IIIB; Section IIIC demonstrates the approximately 100-1,000 fold greater anti-cancer activity of the activity of the compounds relative to flurbiprofen itself.","The ability of the flurbiprofen analog compounds of the invention to inhibit cancer cell growth and survival (viability) in a variety of cancer lines was examined in a standard MTT assay for cell viability, as detailed in Example 2.","In one group of studies, the effect of compound B1031 (compound GCBH-110 above) on a variety of lung cancer cells lines identified in Tables 1A-1C was investigated  are dose-response curves, showing the change in percent survival as a function of compound concentration, after four days incubation in the presence of the compound for the various cell lines tested (identified in Tables 1A-1C below). As seen from the figures, compound concentrations in the range 0.1 to 2 \u03bcM were effective to produce 50% cell death. The ICvalues (compound concentration producing 50% survival) for the 32 lung cancer cell lines studies are summarized in Tables 1A-1C below. The 12 cell lines shown in Table 1A are all adenocarcinoma lines, a type of non-small cell lung carcinoma; the 11 cell lines shown in Table 1B, identified as adenosquamous, large cell, mesothelioma, squamous, and squaous mesothelioma, are non-small cell lung carcinoma lines; and the 7 cell lines shown in Table 1C are all small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines. As seen from the three tables, the B1031 compound has a comparable inhibitory effect on a wide variety of both small- and various non-small cell lung carcinomas, yielding ICvalues between about 0.1 and 1.8 \u03bcM, with most cell lines showing an ICvalue of less than about 0.5 \u03bcM.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE
