{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to integrated circuit packaging.","Integrated circuit (IC) packaging may be considered the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication. During this step of the fabrication process, IC chips are mounted on substrates, forming IC packages. Examples of different types of IC packages include dual in-line package (DIP), pin grid array (PGA) package, leadless chip carrier (LCC) package, surface mount package, small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC) package, plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) package, plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) package, thin small-outline package (TSOP), and ball grid array (BGA) package. In a flip-chip ball grid array (FCBGA) package, a chip is flipped upside down and bonded to the BGA substrate.","During the stage of integrated circuit (IC) packaging, IC chips are mounted on substrates using various suitable mounting techniques to form IC packages.  illustrates an example IC package  that has an IC chip  mounted on a substrate . IC chip  may be constructed of silicon, and substrate  may be constructed of ceramic or plastic. In particular embodiments, IC chip  may be soldered on substrate , and the solder material may be tin-lead, tin-silver, etc.","A particular material has various properties, including thermal expansion and Young's modulus. Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature. For example, a material may expand when heated up and contract when cooled down. The amount of thermal expansion of each material may be measured by its coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), which is defined as the degree of expansion in the material divided by the change in temperature. When force is applied to a solid object, the object may experience stress, which may be measured as the ratio of the applied force and the cross section area of the object. Strain is the deformation of a solid object due to stress. Stress and strain experienced by a solid object may be represented using a stress-strain curve. In solid mechanics, the slope of a stress-strain curve at any point is called the tangent modulus. The tangent modulus of the initial, linear portion of a stress-strain curved is called Young's modulus (named after Thomas Young, the 19th century British scientist), also known as the tensile modulus, which is defined as the ratio of the uniaxial stress over the uniaxial strain in the range of stress in which Hooke's Law holds.","Different materials have different CTEs. Similarly, objects made of different materials have different tangent moduli and thus different stress-strain curves. For example, in , because silicon has relatively low CTE, IC chip  expands only slightly when heated up (e.g., during the soldering process). On the other hand, plastic has relatively high CTE, and thus substrate  expands much more when heated up. Consequently, when IC chip  and substrate  are both cooled down, IC chip  contracts much less than substrate , as illustrated in . This results in thermomechanical stress in IC package . The thermomechanical stress becomes progressively higher when IC chip  is cooled down from the bounding temperature (e.g., during the bonding) toward the room temperatures.","One type of IC packaging in flip-chip technology is pillar packaging, as illustrated in . With pillar packaging, in particular embodiments, a number of interconnect structures , also referred to as pillars, may be formed on IC chip . The other end of each interconnect structure  is soldered to substrate . Alternatively, in particular embodiments, a number of interconnect structures  may be formed on substrate , and the other end of each interconnect structure  is soldered to IC chip .","In particular embodiments, each interconnect structure  is constructed with a single material, such as copper. Copper pillar packaging offers advantages in fine pitch, since copper does not collapse into spherical shape during bonding. However, copper has a much higher tangent modulus than typical solder materials such as tin-silver, and so copper pillar packaging tends to induce higher thermomechanical stress than conventional solder bump packaging.","Particular embodiments construct each interconnect structure between an IC chip and a substrate using multiple materials instead of a single material. Such interconnect structures may be referred to as hybrid interconnect structures. Any number of different materials may be used to construct an interconnect structure. Particular embodiments may select the different materials to be complementary to each other in terms of their properties and characteristics, such as their CTEs and tangent moduli. For example, if an interconnect structure is constructed with two different materials, one material may have a relatively high CTE and the other material may have a relatively low CTE, or one material may have a relatively high rigidity and the other material may have a relatively low rigidity. The combination of multiple materials may help reduce thermomechanical stress on the IC chip. Particular embodiments may reduce the thermomechanical stress by optimizing spatial locations for the materials used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","420","430","440"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":"600"},"Given an interconnect structure, particular embodiments may divide the interconnect structure into n sections, as illustrated in STEP . The n sections may or may not have the equal thickness. In particular embodiments, n is a number greater than 1, and may be chosen based on experiments. If n is too large (e.g., greater than 100), the process may require long computation time. If n is too small (e.g., less than or equal to 4), the final result may not be satisfactory. In particular embodiments, n may be a number divisible by 2 (e.g., 6, 8, 10, . . . ). In particular embodiments, the more number of materials used to construct the interconnect structure, the larger n is preferred. Based on experiments, for two materials, a number between 10 and 20 (e.g., 12) may be a good choice for n. For illustrative purposes, interconnect structure  is divided into eight sections, as illustrated in .","Particular embodiments may assign all n sections of the interconnect structure to a first material (e.g., copper), as illustrated in STEP . For interconnect structure , all eight sections of are assigned the same first material (). Particular embodiments may then record the current stress level corresponding to the interconnect structure (i.e., the stress level corresponding to the interconnect structure with all n sections assigned the same first material), as illustrated in STEP . In some implementations, the stress level to be recorded is at the location where fracture may occur (e.g., the integrated circuits on the chip or the pillar itself).","For each of the n sections that has the first material, particular embodiments may assign the section the second material, one section at a time, and determine the stress level corresponding to the interconnect structure with the current configuration, as illustrated in STEP . For interconnect structure , at this point, all eight sections have the first material (). First, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections - still have the first material, and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Second, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - still have the first material, and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Third, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections - and - still have the first material, and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. And so on, until finally, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections - still have the first material, and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. There are eight different configurations, and thus eight different stress levels are determined.","Particular embodiments may determine the section that, when assigned the second material, gives the lowest stress level for the interconnect structure among the above cases of STEP , as illustrated in STEP . In other words, the configuration that has the lowest stress level among the above cases of STEP  is determined. For example, suppose that for interconnect structure , among the above eight configurations, the configuration where section  has the second material and sections - and - have the first material () gives the lowest stress level.","Particular embodiments may compare this currently-lowest stress level with the previously-recorded stress level to determine if this currently-lowest stress level is less than the previously-recorded stress level, as illustrated in STEP . For interconnect structure , the stress level corresponding to the configuration where section  has the second material and sections - and - have the first material (i.e., the currently-lowest stress level, ) is compared with the stress level corresponding to the configuration where all eight sections have the first material (i.e., the previously-recorded stress level, ).","If the currently-lowest stress level is less than the previously-recorded stress level (STEP \u2014\u201cYES\u201d), particular embodiments may change the section that corresponds to the currently-lowest stress level to the second material, and record the currently-lowest stress level, as illustrated in STEP . For interconnect structure , suppose that the stress level corresponding to the configuration where section  has the second material and sections - and - have the first material () is lower than the stress level corresponding to the configuration where all eight sections have the first material (). Section  is changed to the second material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration is recorded.","Particular embodiments may then repeat STEPS , , , and  for another iteration. For interconnect structure , at the beginning of the second iteration, section  already has the second material and sections - and - still have the first material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration has been recorded. At this point, there are seven sections still having the first material. Each section that still has the first material is assigned the second material, one section at a time, and the stress level corresponding to each configuration is determined (STEP ). First, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - still have the first material (section  already has the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Second, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - still have the first material (section  already has the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Third, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections - and - still have the first material (section  already has the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. And so on. For the second iteration, there are seven sections (i.e., sections - and -) having the first material, and thus there are seven different configurations and seven corresponding stress levels. The configuration with the currently-lowest stress level among the seven configurations is determined (STEP ). Suppose that the configuration where sections  and  have the second material and sections - and - and  have the first material () gives the currently-lowest stress level. This currently-lowest stress level is compared with the previously-recorded stress level (i.e., the stress level corresponding to the configuration where section  has the second material and sections - and - have the first material ()).","Suppose that for interconnect structure , the currently-lowest stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections  and  have the second material and sections - and - and  have the first material () is lower than the previously-recorded stress level corresponding to the configuration where section  has the second material and sections - and - have the first material (). Section  is now changed to the second material (), and stress level corresponding to this configuration is recorded (STEP ).","STEPS , , , and  may be repeated once again. For interconnect structure , at the beginning of the third iteration, sections  and  already have the second material and sections - and - and  still have the first material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration has been recorded. At this point, there are six sections still having the first material. Each section that still has the first material is assigned the second material, one section at a time, and the stress level corresponding to each configuration is determined (STEP ). First, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - and  still have the first material (sections  and  already have the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Second, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - and  still have the first material (sections  and  already have the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Third, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections - and - and  still have the first material (sections  and  already have the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. And so on. For the third iteration, there are six sections (i.e., sections - and - and ) having the first material, and thus there are six different configurations and six corresponding stress levels. The configuration with the currently-lowest stress level among the six configurations is determined (STEP ). Suppose that the configuration where sections  and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material () gives the currently-lowest stress level. This currently-lowest stress level is compared with the previously-recorded stress level (i.e., the stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections  and  have the second material and sections - and - and  have the first material ()).","Suppose that for interconnect structure , the currently-lowest stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections  and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material () is lower than the previously-recorded stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections  and  have the second material and sections - and - and  have the first material (). Section  is now changed to the second material (), and stress level corresponding to this configuration is recorded (STEP ).","STEPS , , , and  may be repeated once again. For interconnect structure , at the beginning of the fourth iteration, sections  and - already have the second material and sections - and - still have the first material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration has been recorded. At this point, there are five sections still having the first material. Each section that still has the first material is assigned the second material, one section at a time, and the stress level corresponding to each configuration is determined (STEP ). First, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - still have the first material (sections  and - already have the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Second, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections  and - still have the first material (sections  and - already have the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. Third, only section  is replaced with the second material and sections - and - still have the first material (sections  and - already have the second material), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration for interconnect structure  is determined. And so on. For the fourth iteration, there are five sections (i.e., sections - and -) having the first material, and thus there are five different configurations and five corresponding stress levels. The configuration with the currently-lowest stress level among the five configurations is determined (STEP ). Suppose that the configuration where sections - and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material gives the currently-lowest stress level. This currently-lowest stress level is compared with the previously-recorded stress level (i.e., the stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections  and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material ()).","Suppose that for interconnect structure , the currently-lowest stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections - and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material is higher than or equal to the previously-recorded stress level corresponding to the configuration where sections  and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material (). In particular embodiments, the iterative process ends (STEP \u2014\u201cNO\u201d). Note that section  is not changed to the second material, because doing so does not help lower the stress level corresponding to interconnect structure .","Note that during each iteration, the number of sections that currently have the first material is always less than or equal to n. That is, if there are m sections currently having the first material during each iteration, then m\u2266n.","Particular embodiments may verify that whether, at the point when the iterative process (STEPS , , , ) ends, all n sections of the interconnect structure still have the same first material, as illustrated in STEP . If so (STEP \u2014\u201cYES\u201d), this means that the interconnect structure having only the first material (e.g., ) gives the lowest stress level. Particular embodiments may then finalize the interconnect structure so that it is constructed with only the first material (i.e., no combination of multiple materials), as illustrated in STEP . On the other hand (STEP \u2014\u201cNO\u201d), particular embodiments may determine if there is any section that has the first material and is adjacent to a section that has the second material, as illustrated in STEP . If so (STEP \u2014\u201cYES\u201d), particular embodiments may further test each such section, as illustrated in STEP .","In particular embodiments, larger numbers of sections may provide better results. However, larger numbers of sections often require longer computation time. Thus, particular embodiments may further test those sections that still have the first material and are adjacent to the sections that have the second material to ensure the quality of the final results, especially when n is relatively small.","For interconnect structure , at the end of the iterative process, sections  and - have the second material and sections - and - have the first material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration has been recorded. In this case, not all eight sections still have the first material. In addition, sections  and , which have the first material, are adjacent to section , which has the second material. Section , which has the first material, is adjacent to section , which has the second material. Thus, each of sections , , and  needs to be tested.","First, considering sections  and  adjacent to section . To independently test sections  and  in connection with section , section  is reverted back to the first material (). Section  is assigned the second material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration is determined. Then, section  is reverted back to the first material, and section  is assigned the second material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration is determined. The three stress levels of the three configurations of , F, and G, respectively, are compared to each other, and the configuration with the lowest stress level among the three is selected and its corresponding stress level is recorded.","Second, considering section  adjacent to section . To independently test section  in connection with section , section  is reverted back to the first material (). Section  is assigned the second material (), and the stress level corresponding to this configuration is determined. This stress level may be compared with the stress level corresponding to the configuration of , and the configuration with the lower stress level is selected and its corresponding stress level is recorded.","For interconnect structure , the effect of STEP  is that the four stress levels of the four configurations illustrated in , F, G, and I, respectively, are compared to each other, and the configuration with the lowest stress level among the four is selected. This configuration is the final result for interconnect structure .","For different interconnect structures, the process illustrated in  may result in different configurations of the two materials. Several example configurations of the interconnect structures constructed using two materials are illustrated in . Note that there may be different amounts of the two materials within an interconnect structure, and the two materials may alternate among the sections of an interconnect structure.","Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.
