{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a non-provisional application claiming priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/407,989, filed Oct. 29, 2010, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Providing Smart Appliances\u201d and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The subject invention generally relates to systems and methods for a networking appliances, and more particularly, to systems and methods for providing smart appliances.","Appliances adapted to provide remote diagnostic data are generally known in the art. By way of example, U.S. Published Application No. 2011\/0060553 describes a home appliance that functions to output product information as a sound signal. A service center remotely performs fault diagnosis of the home appliance by receiving the sound signal, detecting the product information from the sound signal, and checking the state of the home appliance using diagnostic data that is also included in the product information.","In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 7,340,414 describes a refrigerator capable of transmitting and receiving information over a network and having an automatic food ordering function. Residual amounts of food articles stored in containers of the refrigerator are measured through sensors installed in the containers and then displayed on a screen of a display unit, thereby enabling a user to easily recognize the residual amounts of the food articles stored in the refrigerator without opening the door of the refrigerator. The measured residual amounts of the food articles are compared with minimum proper amounts of the food articles preset by the user. In the case where the measured residual amount of a specific one of the food articles is smaller than the minimum proper amount of the specific food article, the specific food article is automatically ordered and delivered.","Still further, U.S. Pat. No. 7,136,940 describes an Internet refrigerator and a Web pad for operating the same. The Web pad is detachably mounted on the Internet refrigerator, and transmits and receives data to\/from the Internet refrigerator on the basis of a remote display protocol. The Web pad is a client Web pad detachably mounted on an outer surface of the Internet refrigerator. The client Web pad is adapted to receive a display signal transmitted from the Internet refrigerator and output the received display signal externally. A server control unit is provided to transmit the display signals to the client Web pad on the basis of the remote display protocol such that data processed in the Internet refrigerator is displayed through the client Web pad. Application programs and multimedia data are driven on the basis of the server control unit, resulting in a reduction in work-load on the client Web pad.","Yet further, U.S. Pat. No. 6,549,818 describes a cooking appliance, such as a stove or oven, which has the ability to download cooking recipes from the Internet. The recipes include a food list and pre-cooking directions which are displayed to a user. The recipes also include a cooking temperature schedule which is used by the temperature controller of the food-heating unit to automatically assist in heating the appliance in accordance with the recipes.","While such exemplary appliances work for the described purposes, a need exists for improved networked appliances which provide a multitude of advantages not yet seen in the art.","The following description of example methods and apparatus is not intended to limit the scope of the description to the precise form or forms detailed herein. Instead the following description is intended to be illustrative so that others may follow its teachings.","Example methods and systems for providing interoperability with household appliances is disclosed herein. The example systems allow for interoperability with different manufacturers of smart household appliances for the development of energy efficiency, smart grid capability, and\/or internet connected services. In general, the disclosed features will connect consumers with their home appliances in meaningful and productive ways. Through interactive digital connectivity, a manufacturer may be able to provide a consumer with control over their appliances as well as enhanced efficiencies, effectiveness, enjoyment, and overall productivity of the household activity to which these appliances relate.","In one example, the system provides the use of commodity hardware, off the shelf software, OS independent applications, form factor independent devices (PC, tablets, smart phones etc), media independent (voice, text, video) and cloud based infrastructure to run all functionalities of the appliance connectivity. This is in contrast to the specialized hardware, proprietary software and\/or dedicated, non-interconnected processors that typically run current appliances. In the context of a consumer environment, such as, for example, a residence, the disclosed methods and systems are particularly useful for providing enhanced services as will be described in detail herein.","With reference to the figures, the following discloses various example systems and methods for providing distributed mobile video call centers on a computer network. To this end, a processing device \u2033, illustrated in the exemplary form of a mobile communication device, a processing device \u2032, illustrated in the exemplary form of a computer system, and a processing device  illustrated in schematic form, such as for example, an appliance, are provided with executable instructions to, for example, provide a means for a customer, e.g., a user, consumer, etc., to interact with the device  and\/or to access a host system server . Generally, the computer executable instructions reside in program modules which may include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the processing devices , \u2032, \u2033 illustrated in  may be embodied in any device having the ability to execute instructions such as, by way of example, an appliance, a personal computer, mainframe computer, personal-digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), cellular telephone, tablet, ereader, or the like. Furthermore, while described and illustrated in the context of a single processing device , \u2032, \u2033 those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the various tasks described hereinafter may be practiced in a distributed environment having multiple processing devices linked via a local or wide-area network whereby the executable instructions may be associated with and\/or executed by one or more of multiple processing devices.","For performing the various tasks in accordance with the executable instructions, the example processing device  includes a processing unit  and a system memory  which may be linked via a bus . Without limitation, the bus  may be a memory bus, a peripheral bus, and\/or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. As needed for any particular purpose, the system memory  may include read only memory (ROM)  and\/or random access memory (RAM) . Additional memory devices may also be made accessible to the processing device  by means of, for example, a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and\/or an optical disk drive interface . As will be understood, these devices, which would be linked to the system bus , respectively allow for reading from and writing to a hard disk , reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk , such as a CD\/DVD ROM or other optical media. The drive interfaces and their associated computer-readable media allow for the nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the processing device . Those of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that other types of non-transitory computer readable media that can store data and\/or instructions may be used for this same purpose. Examples of such media devices include, but are not limited to, magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital videodisks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories, nano-drives, memory sticks, and other read\/write and\/or read-only memories.","A number of program modules may be stored in one or more of the memory\/media devices. For example, a basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the processing device , such as during start-up, may be stored in ROM . Similarly, the RAM , hard drive , and\/or peripheral memory devices may be used to store computer executable instructions comprising an operating system , one or more applications programs  (such as a Web browser), other program modules , and\/or program data . Still further, computer-executable instructions may be downloaded to one or more of the computing devices as needed, for example via a network connection.","To allow a user to enter commands and information into the processing device , input devices such as a keyboard  and\/or a pointing device  are provided. While not illustrated, other input devices may include a microphone, a joystick, a game pad, a scanner, a camera, touchpad, touch screen, etc. These and other input devices would typically be connected to the processing unit  by means of an interface  which, in turn, would be coupled to the bus . Input devices may be connected to the processor  using interfaces such as, for example, a parallel port, game port, firewire, or a universal serial bus (USB). To view information from the processing device , a monitor  or other type of display device may also be connected to the bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , the processing device  may also include other peripheral output devices, not shown, such as, for example, speakers, cameras, printers, or other suitable device.","As noted, the processing device  may also utilize logical connections to one or more remote processing devices, such as the host system server  having associated data repository A. In this regard, while the host system server  has been illustrated in the exemplary form of a computer, it will be appreciated that the host system server  may, like processing device , be any type of device having processing capabilities. Again, it will be appreciated that the host system server  need not be implemented as a single device but may be implemented in a manner such that the tasks performed by the host system server  are distributed amongst a plurality of processing devices\/databases located at different geographical locations and linked through a communication network. Additionally, the host system server  may have logical connections to other third party systems via a network , such as, for example, the Internet, LAN, MAN, WAN, cellular network, cloud network, enterprise network, virtual private network, wired and\/or wireless network, or other suitable network, and via such connections, will be associated with data repositories that are associated with such other third party systems. Such third party systems may include, without limitation, systems of banking, credit, or other financial institutions, systems of third party providers of goods and\/or services, systems of shipping\/delivery companies, etc.","For performing tasks as needed, the host system server  may include many or all of the elements described above relative to the processing device . In addition, the host system server  would generally include executable instructions for, among other things, receiving a request for a service call center connection, routing the request via a distributed mobile video call center, and providing a service call infrastructure for providing the requestor with a distributed customer service experience.","Communications between the processing device  and the host system server  may be exchanged via a further processing device, such as a network router (not shown), that is responsible for network routing. Communications with the network router may be performed via a network interface component . Thus, within such a networked environment, e.g., the Internet, World Wide Web, LAN, cloud, or other like type of wired or wireless network, it will be appreciated that program modules depicted relative to the processing device , or portions thereof, may be stored in the non-transitory memory storage device(s) of the host system server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","110","112","12","110","100"]},"In the example system , the example appliances  include a communication protocol to allow the appliances to connect to the local network  through a wireless and\/or a wired connection. Additionally, the example appliances  may be capable of proprietary and\/or standard communication between appliances as illustrated. The example appliances are configured to measure the internal functions and\/or status of the appliance, as provide network and\/or communication capability to a user. The appliance  may also be configured to store historical data regarding the usage and\/or operation of the appliance for diagnostic, statistical, and\/or other usage.","For example, as illustrated in , an example appliance  includes a flash memory  and\/or a random access memory (RAM)  to store the collected operational and\/or other data relevant to the appliance . The appliance  may use other types of memory in addition to, or in lieu of, flash memory  and RAM  to store data relevant to the operation, wellbeing, history, and\/or the like. The data is, in turn, transmitted to the host system  (see ) such as, for example, a personal computer (PC), terminal, router, smartphone, tablet, or other suitable device) via a communicator  such as a wireless connection using the local area network with WiFi, ZigBee\u00ae, Bluetooth, USB, Ethernet, infrared, or the like. While the connection between the appliance  and the host system  is illustrated as being a network connection, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the data connection may be any suitable connection including any wireless and\/or wired connection as desired. For example, in at least one embodiment, the system  allows for communication between the appliance  and the host system  through a modem connection, such as over the public switched telephone network (PSTN), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), etc, including a dedicated modem or through transmission of data during a service call. Software, firmware, and\/or hardware executing and\/or contained within appliance  processes the data generated by the appliance . The appliance  is adapted to at least one of displays the data on an integrated and\/or external display having a user interface , and\/or transmit the data to the host system , such as a company-operated customer service server through an Internet, cloud, cellular, wireless, wired, LAN, tethered, and\/or any other suitable connection.","In one example, a user may call a traditional customer service line to connect (via voice) to a customer service agent having access to the host system . The customer service agent may prompt the user to activate the communicator , such as for example, by pressing an external activation button. The communicator , once activated, may transmit data by modulating an analog carrier signal to encode digital information to transmit the relevant data over the phone line to host system  for use by the customer service agent. Once the data is transmitted to the host system , the voice conversation between the customer service agent and the user may continue. To provide service to the appliance , the customer service agent may instruct the user to perform certain steps, may give advice and\/or recommendations regarding usage, may transmit data back to the appliance  through a modem connection via the communicator , and\/or may schedule a service call if necessary.","Referring again to , in the illustrated example, the transmitted appliance data is segregated and\/or targeted for different services and\/or servers. In this example, the data segmentation includes an application server , an upgrade server , a web server , and a service server . While the data is segregated in the illustrated example, the data need not be divided or alternatively may be divided even further as desired.","The example application server  may provide the appliance  with custom, semi-custom, and\/or generic application specific to the appliance , and\/or providing generic capabilities to the appliance . For example, the application server may provide the appliance with any type of application including a graphical user interface, weather, web-browser, news, sports, gaming, productivity, etc. The application server may be coupled to an external application store to provide additional applications, such as for example an application market. The example upgrade server  may provide system software, firmware, middleware, software, and\/or other updates for the appliance . The upgrades may be pushed and\/or pulled from the server  to the appliance  as needed. The example web server  may provide the appliance with a portal to the Internet, cloud, web, network, etc. Access to the network services may also be provided through the network . Finally, the example service server  may provide customer service including diagnostic code interpretation, error code interpretation, operational suggestions, maintenance reminders, etc.","The appliance  may also transmit energy use data to a smart meter , via a wireless connection using ZigBee\u00ae or the like. In this example, the smart meter  is a typical electrical meter that records consumption of electric energy in predefined intervals, such as intervals of an hour or less and communicates consumption information back to a utility company  for monitoring and\/or billing purposes. Typically, the smart meter  enables two-way communication between the meter and a central system. Accordingly, the utility company  providing the power to the appliances  and\/or other equipment via a power line can access the energy use data stored on the smart meter  for further review. Additionally, in at least one example, the appliance  can access the smart meter  to retrive data regarding the power grid. For example, the appliance  may access the smart meter  to inquire as to the best time to operate a schedulable batch process, such as a washing and\/or drying cycle, by determining when the electrical costs are minimized. In this instance, the appliances  may coordinate with the smart grid to produce savings to the operator.","Returning to , the example appliance  comprises a line interface  and a power supply  which is electrically coupled to the utilities  to rectify and provide line powered voltage to a microcontroller , the memories , , the communicator , sensors, such as a monitoring sensor , a diagnostic sensor , and the user interface . A common access port (CAP)  and the user interface  may be coupled to the microcontroller through a secure protocol , such as an encryption routine, a firewall, a password protected protocol, and\/or the like. The common access port  provides for a common access point for technicians, service individuals, etc., independent of the appliance's connection with the networks  and\/or .","It will be appreciated that the monitoring sensor  and the diagnostic sensor  provide the microcontroller with data regarding the operation and\/or health of the appliance . It will be further appreciated that any number of sensors ,  may be used and\/or removed as necessary.","The example appliances  may be connected such that the appliances  are able to communicate with one another. Thus, each appliance  may be able to provide information relevant to the operation of another appliance  within the network as desired. The appliances may be able to coordinate operations (e.g., cycle times, optimization of electrical rates, etc.), may be able to provide information regarding operation (e.g., recipe ingredients and cook times), may provide diagnostic codes, updates, etc. Additionally, each of the appliances may be better able to communicate with the smart grid to provide added energy usage benefits.","As noted above, the example appliances  may be able to connect to internet through the communicator  and the user interface . The appliance may include open and\/or closed access to content on the Internet as desired. For example, the appliance may be able to be updated through the Internet or other network, by a connection to the upgrade server , and\/or may be updated through access through the common access port . Each example appliance  includes the capability to operate as a traditional appliance if desired without access to the Internet or other network if desired.","The example system  supports the remote monitoring, control, and diagnosis of each appliance  integrated into the system by the service server . In this instance, the appliance  and the sensors ,  provide monitoring capabilities for all major systems within the appliance  and for all monitorable failure modes. The example appliances  can communicate through the system  reliable information regarding the operation of the appliance including self diagnostic information, usage, predicted life remaining, etc. The service server  may remotely program the microcontroller  to alter operational parameters as desired to circumvent and\/or avoid a monitored and\/or predicted failure.","The example system  further allows for a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d setup features that allows for an appliance to be integrated into the system  with minimal setup and\/or configuration required. In particular, in one instance, a new appliance  may be added to the system by locating the appliance within range of the network , and allowing the appliance to configure itself through inquiry of adjacent appliance , and\/or through interaction with the identified network . In one example, the appliance  may identify the network , may present configuration questions on the interface , and based upon the answers provided to the configuration questions, configure itself to operate on the system . In another example, the appliance  may poll appliances within range of the appliance  and obtain configuration information from the local appliances . In any instance, however, the appliance  may allow for an advanced user and\/or a service technician (either locally or through the system ) to access network configurations to allow the appliance to be specifically configured.","In one example embodiment, the appliance  is adapted to download an execute application from the application server . As previously described, the downloaded application also known as an \u201capp\u201d, may be a computer executable software program designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include enterprise software, accounting software, office suites, graphics software and media players. The applications may be bundled with the appliance  and its system software, or may be published and downloaded separately through the application server  and\/or other publishing means. In this example, the applications may be executable separately from the system software necessary for operation of the appliance , or may be integrated into the system software as desired. For instance, the applications may comprise various application programming interfaces (APIs) for different development communities, and the developers of applications may place their apps in various locations on the application server .","In yet another example, each the appliance  may monitor operation through the sensors ,  and query the service server  to ensure the appliance is operating within certain efficiency guidelines, such as for example, Energy Star, or the like. Thus, the networked appliance  in the system  may communicate to ensure an eco-system that incentivizes the manufacturer and\/or the user to operate the appliance  within acceptable energy management parameters.","The example secure protocol  includes executable instructions which cause the secure protocol  to present the user with options regarding operational choices as well as options regarding privacy. For instance, the user of the appliance  may decide to opt-out of any intelligent gathering of data due to privacy concerns, and therefore, operate the appliance  without any networking capability. Additionally, the secure protocol  may allow the user to elect to block and\/or restrict access to the networks ,  as desired.","In still another example, the appliance  may allow a user to access the status and\/or operation of the appliance through a separate processing device \u2032, \u2033, such as a personal computer, tablet, mobile device, etc. In this instance, the user may be provided with a user interface that allows the user to view and\/or control such information as the power state of the appliance , the current operation of the appliance, the contents of the appliance (if equipped with a video device), the diagnostic status of the appliance, etc. The user may be able to remotely program and control the appliance  through the processing device as desired.","Specifically, in at least one example, the appliance  may be include a maintenance and\/or failure detection routine that when executed on the microprocessor , allows the appliance  to detect a repair and\/or preventable maintenance situation through the sensors , . In this example, the microprocessor  may communicate through the user interface  the detected situation, and\/or may communicate through the networks , , to the host server  and\/or to various other devices \u2032, \u2033. Still further, the host server  may actively push out a maintenance and\/or service reminder regarding the appliance  based upon the history of the appliance  and without the input of the sensors , .","The maintenance\/repair alerts and reminders may include specific instructions to repair and\/or effect the service directly by the user. In particular, one example alert may be provided to the user which includes an alert to stay up to date on the required maintenance by alerting the user to when it is needed to provide simple maintenance on the appliance . The alert may provide such details as an identified clog in the appliance (such as a dryer vent), a part that needs to be cleaned, such as a direct shelf, a dirty air filter, dirty coils, etc. The alerts may also include inventory notifications, such as the amount of an item in inventory within the appliance , and a suggestion for reordering such inventory. In still other instances, the alert may include a step-by-step instruction to perform the maintenance\/repair and including optional text and\/or videos to ensure proper execution of the repair. By providing the system , the appliances  may be optimally monitored to ensure better operation and longer lifespan, while minimizing the long-term cost of repairs.","Although certain example systems and methods have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a better understanding of the present disclosure, reference may be had to various examples shown in the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
