title: Method and system for ranking messages of discussion threads
abstract: A method and system for ranking messages of discussion threads based on relationships between messages and authors is provided. The ranking system defines an equation for attributes of a message and an author. The equations define the attribute values and are based on relationships between the attribute and the attributes associated with the same type of object, and different types of objects. The ranking system iteratively calculates the attribute values for the objects using the equations until the attribute values converge on a solution. The ranking system then ranks the messages based on attribute values.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/957,329, filed on Oct. 1, 2004 and entitled \u201cMethod and System for Identifying Questions Within a Discussion Thread,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/846,835, filed on May 14, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,346,621 and entitled \u201cMethod and System for Ranking Objects Based on Intra-Type and Inter-Type Relationships,\u201d which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The described technology relates generally to ranking of messages of a discussion thread.","Discussion threads are a popular way for people to communicate using the Internet. A discussion thread, such as a newsgroup, allows people to participate in a discussion about a specific topic. A discussion thread is typically initiated when a person creates an initial message directed to a topic and posts the message as a new discussion thread. Other persons can read the initial message and post response (or reply) messages to the discussion thread. For example, the initial message may pose a question such as \u201cHas anyone encountered a situation where the Acme software product aborts with error number 456?\u201d Persons who want to participate in the discussion can post response messages such as \u201cIt happens to me all the time\u201d or \u201cI fixed the problem by reinstalling the software.\u201d Discussion threads typically take the form of a tree structure as sequences of messages branch off into different paths. For example, three different persons can post a response message to the initial message, starting three branches, and other persons can post response messages to any one of those response messages to extend those branches.","In general, discussion threads include questions and their answers. For example, a customer support group within a company that sells a certain software product may provide a mechanism for its customers to create and participate in discussion threads relating to the software product. For example, a customer may initiate a discussion thread by posting an initial message that poses a question such as the one mentioned above. That question may be answered by the posting of a response message by another customer or a customer service representative. The corpus of discussion threads of the company may provide a vast amount of knowledge related to problems and concerns that customers may encounter along with appropriate responses (e.g., answers to questions posed).","When a customer wants an answer to a question, the customer may either initiate a new discussion thread or search messages of existing discussion threads that may provide an answer to the customer's question. When searching for an answer within the message of a corpus of discussion threads, a customer may submit a short query using keywords of the question. For example, the customer may submit the query \u201cerror 456\u201d in hopes of finding an answer to the question mentioned above. A search engine may be used to identify those messages that contain keywords matching the query. The search engine may rank messages based on a relevance score that indicates how relevant each message is to the query based on closeness of each match, date of message (e.g., recent messages being more relevant), length of message, and so on. The ranking may be based primarily on attributes of the messages themselves.","The relevance score, however, may fail to factor in attributes that are not directly related to messages. For example, the relevance of a message might more accurately be determined when the expertise of the author is factored in. A response message posted by a customer service representative may be more authoritative or important, and thus more relevant, than a response message posted by a customer. It would be desirable to have a technique for calculating importance of messages of a discussion thread based on attributes not directly related to the message.","A method and system for ranking messages of a discussion thread based on relationships with other messages and with authors is provided. The ranking system ranks messages based in part on relationships between and attributes of messages and authors. A message may have an importance attribute, and an author may have an expertise attribute. The importance of a message may be based on importance of related messages and the expertise of its author. The expertise of an author may be based on the importance of the messages posted by the author. The ranking system calculates the value of the importance attribute for the messages and may rank the messages based on their importance.","A method and system for ranking message objects (\u201cmessages\u201d) of a discussion thread based on relationships with other messages and with other types of objects is provided. In one embodiment, the ranking system ranks messages based in part on relationships between and attributes of authors and messages. A message may have an importance attribute, and an author may have an expertise attribute. The importance of a message may be based on the importance of related messages (e.g., reply messages) and the expertise of its author. The expertise of an author may be based on the importance of the messages posted by the author. Thus, the importance of a message and the expertise of its author are defined recursively. The ranking system calculates the value of the importance attribute for the messages and may rank the messages based on their importance.","The ranking system determines various relationships between objects of the same type, referred to as intra-type relationships, and between objects of different types, referred to as inter-type relationships. The intra-type relationships messages may include replied-to relationships between messages. For example, if a message is a reply to another message, then that message has a replied-to relationship to the replied-to message. The intra-type relationship of authors may include a self relationship that is each author is only related to itself. The inter-type relationships between messages and authors may be based on authored-by and author-of relationships. A message has an authored-by relationship to its author, and an author has an author-of relationship to the authored message. The ranking system uses the replied-to relationships and the authored-by and author-of relationships to derive the importance of messages and the expertise of authors.","In one embodiment, the ranking system represents the relationships and attributes using a set of equations, such as linear equations. The ranking system represents the importance of messages and expertise of authors using a linear equation that may be defined recursively. Because the linear equations may be defined recursively, the ranking system solves the linear equations by iteratively calculating the values of each linear equation until the values converge on a solution. After solving the linear equations, the ranking system may rank the messages based on their importance.","The ranking system represents the attribute values for objects based on the intra-type and inter-type relationships of the objects. The value of an attribute may be represented by the following equation:\n\n+\u03a3\n\nwhere Frepresents the attribute value associated with object i, Rrepresents the intra-type relationships between objects of the type of the object i, and Rrepresents the inter-type relationships between objects of the type of the object i and other types j. If there are two types of objects x={x, x, . . . x} representing messages and y={y, y, . . . y} representing authors, then the intra-type replied-to relationship for messages can be represented as Rand the intra-type self relationship for authors can be represented as Rand their inter-type authored-by relationship represented as Rand inter-type author-of relationship represented as R. The ranking system uses adjacency matrices to represent the relationship information. Land Lrepresent the adjacency matrices of the intra-type relationships for messages and authors, respectively. Land Lrepresent the adjacency matrix of inter-type authored-by relationships from messages to authors and the adjacency matrix of inter-type author-of relationships from authors to messages, respectively. The ranking system represents the adjacency matrix by the following:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["L","XY"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["if","there","is","a","relationship","from","object"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.1em","height":"1.1ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]}},{"mi":["to","object"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["y","j"]}}],"mo":","}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"26.1em","height":"26.1ex"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"otherwise"}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}],"sub":["XY ","y","y","y","xy","x ","x","x","x","yx","y","x ","y "],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["w","=L","w","+L","w","w","=L","w","+L","w"],"sup":["T","T","T","T"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["w","M"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["L","M","T"]},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["w","M"]}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mi":["N","M"],"mo":"\u2260"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["L","NM","T"]},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["w","N"]}}}],"mo":"+"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Because mutually reinforcing relationships between objects may give undue attribute values to objects, the ranking system may normalize the binary adjacency matrices in such a way that if an object is related to n other objects in one adjacency matrix, then each related-to object gets 1\/nof its attribute value.

When an object in M has no relationship to any objects in N, then the sub-matrix L\u2032will be zero and will represent a \u201csink node\u201d to which the calculations may assign all the attribute value. To prevent this, the ranking system sets all the elements in the corresponding row of the sub-matrix L\u2032to 1\/n, where n is the total number of objects in data space N. Alternatively, the ranking system can set the corresponding weights to 0 for undesired intra-type and inter-type relationships.
