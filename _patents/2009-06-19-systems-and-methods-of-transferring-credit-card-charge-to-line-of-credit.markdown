title: Systems and methods of transferring credit card charge to line of credit
abstract: After a charge has been made with a credit card, the charge may be analyzed to determine if it may be transferred to a line of credit. The credit card may be monitored for purchases that match rules or criteria set by a user and/or an institution system. If the transaction meets the rules and/or criteria, the charge on the credit card may be paid with funds from the line of credit. In an implementation, instead of the user waiting for the credit card bill and then paying the amount of the charge on the bill from the line of credit, the institution system automatically performs the transfer for the user (e.g., pays the charge on the credit card with funds from the line of credit).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A credit card is a system of payment in which money is not removed from the user's account after every transaction. The issuer lends money to the user to be paid to the merchant. The balance does not have to be paid in full each month. A credit card allows the user to revolve the balance, at the cost of having interest charged.","A line of credit is any credit facility extended to a user, such as a person or a business, by a bank or financial institution. It is like an account that can readily be tapped into if the need arises or not touched at all and saved for emergencies. A line of credit may be secured by collateral. Such a line of credit is referred to as an equity line of credit. For example, a home equity line of credit (often called HELOC) is a loan in which the lender agrees to lend a maximum amount within an agreed period (called a term), where the collateral is the user's equity in his house.","With a line of credit, the user is not advanced the entire sum up front, but uses a line of credit to borrow sums that total no more than the credit limit, similar to a credit card. Interest is only paid on the money actually taken out. The interest rate on a line of credit is typically lower than the interest rate on a credit card.","After a charge has been made with a credit card, the charge may be analyzed to determine if it may be transferred to a line of credit. The credit card may be monitored for purchases that match rules or criteria set by a user and\/or an institution system. If the transaction meets the rules and\/or criteria, the charge on the credit card may be paid with funds from the line of credit. In an implementation, instead of the user waiting for the credit card bill and then paying the amount of the charge on the bill from the line of credit, the institution system automatically performs the transfer for the user (e.g., pays the charge on the credit card with funds from the line of credit).","In an implementation, if the charge on the credit card meets one or more predetermined rules, such as the amount of the charge, the merchant where the charge was made, or the item purchased, and if the user has a line of credit, the charge may be transferred to the line of credit from the credit card. The user may provide authorization for the transfer before and\/or after the charge is made on the credit card, depending on the implementation.","In an implementation, if the user does not have a line of credit, the institution system may determine if the user is eligible for the line of credit and, if so, offer the line of credit to the user pursuant to a charge being made on the credit card, where the charge is eligible to be transferred to the line of credit (e.g., pursuant to previously established rules and\/or criteria).","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","2","30","40","30","83","90","40","80","80","90","90","93","80","5","2"]},"The user  may provide data to the institution system  via a user computing device . The user computing device  may be any type of personal computer (PC), a handheld computing device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, a smartphone, or any other mobile device, for example. An example user computing device is described with respect to .","The user computing device  and the institution system  may be connected over a communications network . The user  may communicate with the institution system  by way of the communications network  such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. The user  may also communicate with the institution system  by phone, email, instant messaging, text messaging, web chat, facsimile, mail, and the like.","The line of credit engine  may comprise an eligibility processor  that may determine if the user  is eligible for a line of credit , as described further herein. The line of credit  may be any type of line of credit, including an equity line of credit (e.g., a home equity line of credit, a vehicle equity line of credit, etc.). The equity line of credit may use any property of the user  as collateral, such as a house, a vehicle, a boat, an airplane, or an item purchased with the credit card . The line of credit engine  may also comprise an application processor  that may process an application from the user  for the line of credit  and may issue the line of credit  to the user .","The credit card engine  may comprise an application processor  that may process an application for the credit card  from the user  and may issue the credit card  to the user . The credit card engine  may also comprise a rules processor  that may set and\/or store rules regarding when a charge made on the credit card  may be transferred to the line of credit , as described further herein. A charge transfer controller  may transfer a charge made on the credit card  to the line of credit , e.g., by paying the charge on the credit card  with funds from the line of credit , pursuant to instructions provided by the credit card engine .","The user  may purchase an item at a merchant  with the credit card  and the transaction may be processed by a credit card processor . The credit card processor  may be an entity that provides services pertaining to credit aspects and behaviors of credit cards. The credit card processor  may be in communication with the institution system  via a network, such as the communications network . It is contemplated that the institution system  may handle such credit aspects and\/or behaviors of credit cards, and that the credit card processor  may not be used.","After the charge has been made with the credit card , the charge may be analyzed to determine if it may be transferred to the line of credit . The credit card  may be monitored for purchases that match rules or criteria set by the user  and\/or the institution system . If the transaction meets the rules and\/or criteria, the charge on the credit card  may be paid with funds from the line of credit . In an implementation, instead of the user  waiting for the credit card  bill and then paying the amount of the charge on the bill from the line of credit , the institution system  automatically performs the transfer for the user  (e.g., pays the charge on the credit card  with funds from the line of credit , as described further herein).","In some implementations, described further with respect to  and\/or  for example, if the charge on the credit card  meets one or more predetermined rules, such as the amount of the charge (e.g., \u201cif the charge is for at least a $X, then transfer the charge\u201d where X is an amount set by the user  or the institution system ), the merchant where the charge was made (e.g., based on one or more merchant identifiers such as merchant category codes (MCCs), standard industrial classifications (SICs), and or North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, for example) (e.g., \u201cif the merchant is a jewelry dealer or an automobile dealer, then transfer the charge\u201d), or the item purchased (e.g., \u201cif the item purchased is a computer, a television, or a motorcycle, then transfer the charge\u201d), and if the user has a line of credit , the charge may be automatically transferred to the line of credit  from the credit card . The user  may provide authorization for the transfer before and\/or after the charge is made on the credit card , depending on the implementation.","The user  and\/or the institution system  may set the rules or other criteria that may be used in determining whether or not to transfer a charge from the credit card  to the line of credit , to offer such a transfer to the user , and\/or to offer the line of credit  to the user  if the user does not already have the line of credit . For example, when a charge on the credit card  exceeds a predetermined amount, the charge may be automatically paid from the line of credit  that has been previously established. In this manner, the user  may receive a better interest rate using the line of credit  instead of the credit card  and may get an interest tax deduction using the line of credit .","In an implementation, any purchase amount of a charge on the credit card  may be transferred to the line of credit . In another implementation, only charges directed to particular items may be transferred to the line of credit . The institution system  may determine the item made with respect to a particular charge by asking the user , the merchant , and\/or the credit card processor  for details about the transaction, for example. The institution system  may compare the item(s) purchased with the credit card  to a predetermined list of items that may be stored in storage, such as information storage , user storage , or the storage , described further herein. The predetermined list of items may be populated with data provided by the user  and\/or the institution system  and\/or the institution , for example.","In some implementations, described further with respect to  and\/or , for example, if the user  does not have the line of credit , the institution system  may determine if the user  is eligible for the line of credit  and, if so, offer the line of credit  to the user  pursuant to a charge being made on the credit card , where the charge is eligible to be transferred to the line of credit  (e.g., pursuant to previously established rules and\/or criteria).","In an implementation, the charge may only be transferred from the credit card  to the line of credit  if the difference between the line of credit interest rate and the credit card interest rate is greater than a predetermined amount. The predetermined amount may be set by the user , the institution , or the institution system , depending on the implementation.","The application processor  of the line of credit engine  and the application processor  of the credit card engine  may each request and receive information from the user  via a line of credit application and a credit card application, respectively, that the user  may fill out and provide to the institution system . The user  may fill out the application(s) using the user computing device  and electronically send the application(s) to the institution system , such as via a website, email, or facsimile, for example. Alternatively, the user  may send the application(s) to the institution system  by mail or any other delivery method. The application processor  and\/or the application processor  may retrieve information from storage, such as information storage  and user storage , and use the information in processing the request(s) for the line of credit  and\/or the credit card . The application processor  and\/or the application processor  may also store information pertaining to the user  and the application(s) in storage, such as information storage  and user storage .","The application processor  and\/or the application processor  may send the application information (e.g., over the network ) to one or more credit reporting bureaus (e.g., Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, etc.) to obtain a report of the user's credit history. The credit history report may be obtained in real time in order to expedite processing of the application(s). A determination may then be made by the institution system  as to whether the user  qualifies for the line of credit  and\/or the credit card  based, for example, on their credit history and the institution's internal policies. The user  may be notified by the institution system  of a decision on the request(s) for the credit card  and\/or the line of credit  via the user computing device .","Information storage  may contain information pertaining to accounts or products offered by the institution system , as well as rules and other criteria for transferring charges from credit cards to lines of credit and\/or opening or offering lines of credit pursuant to charges made on credit cards, for example. Information storage  may include data that may be used in the generation of a credit card application and\/or line of credit application, the decision of a user's qualification for the credit card  or the line of credit , and the maintenance of the credit card  and the line of credit .","User storage  may contain information directed to users, such as name, address, account information, products owned, contact information for authorizing a transfer of a charge from the credit card  to the line of credit , rules provided by the user  directed to transferring a charge from the credit card  to the line of credit , etc., for example.","Information directed to credit cards, lines of credit, transfers of charges from the credit card  to the line of credit , rules, criteria, etc. may be provided via a website  to the user computing device  associated with a user . In an implementation, instead of hosting the website , the institution system  may comprise a conventional application server hosting a proprietary online service accessible only by a private network. In any event, the institution system  may have appropriate security mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting the user's information.","In an implementation, a user interface module  may receive content from the line of credit engine  and\/or the credit card engine  and may format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the user computing device . The page(s) of content  may be directed to credit card information, line of credit information, and\/or transfer information, and may be provided to the user computing device  via the website  associated with the institution system .","When the user  accesses the website , using a web browser on the user computing device , they may be presented with credit card and\/or line of credit information such as balances, interest rates, rules, etc., via the page(s) of content . The information may be displayed on one or more web pages, for example. The user  may enter information into the web pages via a web browser on the user computing device .","The content may be personalized to the user , using information retrieved from the user storage , for example. Personalization may include presentation of the page(s) of content  and\/or functionality of the page(s) of content . For example, a graphical representation displayed on the page(s) of content  may be pre-filled with some information pertaining to the user, such as name, address, account number, etc.","A user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  through which access to and maintenance of the credit card , the line of credit , and rules regarding the transfer of charges from the credit card  to the line of credit  can be accomplished. Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like. According to an embodiment, the electronic devices may include a network-based server that may process transactions involving the credit card  or the line of equity , and may provide account information and access to the user .","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The user computing device  may allow the user  to interact with the computing device(s) . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including its processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein. Information associated with the user, products, and\/or services, may be stored in storage  or other storage, for example.","Example software modules may include modules for sending and receiving information between the institution system  and the user  as well as between the institution system  and the merchant  and the credit card processor , requesting and retrieving information from storage , information storage , and user storage , processing credit card and line of credit requests, rules, and transfer requests received from the user , processing transfers, and generating web pages, described further herein.

Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and it may be combined with hardware implementations.","Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter in the context of one or more stand-alone computer systems, the subject matter is not so limited, but rather may be implemented in connection with any computing environment, such as a network or distributed computing environment. Still further, aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices, and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Such devices might include personal computers, network servers, and handheld devices, for example.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
