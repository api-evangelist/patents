title: System and method to determine and deliver quotes for distance-sensitive communication links from multiple service providers
abstract: To facilitate real-time pricing, an embodiment of the invention retrieves multiple quotes from multiple databases associated with multiple service providers. Information regarding a customer's location, and the locations of multiple service providers are used to determine the cost of services associated with each of the multiple service providers in real-time. The retrieved quotes are compared, and quotes below a pre-determined price threshold are provided to a user in real-time (e.g., via the Internet). The user can select a desired quote from the quotes provided, and purchase or request more information regarding the desired quote online.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/953,347, filed on Sep. 30, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,496,184, and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD TO DETERMINE AND DELIVER QUOTES FOR DISTANCE-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION LINKS FROM MULTIPLE SERVICE PROVIDERS,\u201d which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/517,916, filed on Nov. 7, 2003, and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD TO CALCULATE AND DELIVER QUOTES FOR DISTANCE-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION LINKS FROM MULTIPLE SERVICE PROVIDERS;\u201d each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates generally to providing quotes for communications services. More specifically, the invention relates to providing quotes for distance-sensitive communication links from multiple service providers.","In the field of telecommunications, there currently exists no means by which customers can obtain real-time price quotes for distance-sensitive communication links, such as dedicated voice and\/or data services over T1 lines, including, for example, fractional T1, full T1, DS1, T3, DS3, and so forth. For T1 loops, for example, each product vendor maintains its own internal, and in many cases proprietary, database information and interface software capable of providing the price of a T1 loop based on the telephone number and physical address of a customer. The price of T1 loops is \u201cdistance-sensitive,\u201d or in other words, the price is dependent upon the geographical distance from the service location (e.g., a customer's location) to the nearest Point of Presence (POP). Loop pricing can also vary based on a local telephone company and\/or service area.","Typically, only in-house agent managers and technicians have access to this T1 pricing software, which is only capable of providing pricing for T1 loops for areas serviced by their own company. Additionally, any proprietary information contained in the company's databases is typically only available to such in-house personnel. Each T1 vendor generally attempts to prevent competitors from accessing their pricing software or proprietary databases.","Sales agents of T1 vendors usually must contact in-house agent managers for pricing information. Some vendors allow agents to gain access to the pricing system through a password-protected agent back office web site. Agents who want to gather prices of various T1 vendors must contact each vendor individually (either via in-house agent managers or agent back office web sites) and wait for these companies to respond with their pricing information.","With such a vast, segmented distribution of T1 loop price quote mechanisms, a sales agent attempting to compare pricing information (e.g., in an attempt to find the most cost-effective provider) often has no choice but to contact each vendor individually through a sales agent or agent back-office web site, and wait for the respective agent manager or web site to provide a price quote (from their own proprietary software and\/or databases).","Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop a system for calculating and delivering real-time price quotes for distance-sensitive communication links, such as T1 service, to customers and\/or their sales agents. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide real-time price quotes to customers or their sales agents from multiple service providers.","An embodiment of the invention provides a system and method to determine and deliver price quotes for distance-sensitive communication links from multiple service providers. Specifically, a method sends a service request to a first service provider and a service request to a second service provider. Information associated with a distance-sensitive communication link of the first service provider is received in response to the service request sent to the first service provider. Information associated with a distance-sensitive communication link of the second service provider is received in response to the service request sent to the second service provider. Information that is based on the information associated with the distance-sensitive communication link of the first service provider and the information associated with the distance-sensitive communication link of the second service provider is output.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a method receives customer location information and calculates a distance between a service point of a first service provider and a customer location associated with the customer location information. The method determines, substantially in real-time with the calculating, a price associated with the first service provider for the calculated distance. The method can also optionally calculate a distance between a service point of a second service provider and the customer location associated with the customer location information and determine, substantially in real-time with the calculating for the first service provider and\/or the calculating for the second service provider, a price associated with the second service provider for the calculated distance associated with the second service provider. Additionally, the method can optionally output the price associated with the first service provider and the price associated with the second service provider.","According to another embodiment of the invention, an apparatus is provided that includes a quote compiler configured to retrieve information associated with a distance-sensitive communication link of each service provider from multiple service providers. The quote compiler is configured to determine multiple prices based at least in part on the retrieved information and information associated with a customer. Each price from the multiple prices is uniquely associated with service for the customer from each service provider from the multiple service providers. The quote compiler is configured to output the multiple prices. The apparatus can optionally include one or more databases and\/or a user interface in communication with the quote compiler.","Further features of some embodiments of the invention, and the advantages offered thereby, are explained in greater detail hereinafter with reference to the specific embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements are indicated using like reference designators.","An embodiment of the invention is described in the context of a system and method to determine and deliver quotes for distance-sensitive communication links from multiple service providers or vendors. For example, an embodiment of the invention provides quotes for T1 loop prices from multiple vendors.","For example, a method according to an embodiment of the invention receives customer location information and calculates or otherwise determines at least one distance from a customer to a location of at least one service point (e.g., a POP location) of at least one service provider. The method determines in real-time at least one price associated with the corresponding at least one calculated distance and outputs the at least one determined price.","An embodiment of the invention provides multiple price quotes (e.g., from multiple vendors or service providers) approximately simultaneously through geomapping and database standardization techniques using, for example, structured query language (SQL) and\/or extensible markup language (XML) queries. According to one or more embodiments of the invention, price quotes are provided for T1 loops from multiple service providers or vendors.","To facilitate real-time pricing, an embodiment of the invention makes use of a standardized database architecture to retrieve multiple quotes from multiple databases, where each quote is associated with a different service provider or vendor. Information regarding a customer's location, and the locations of service points (e.g., POP locations) of multiple service providers is used to determine the cost of services associated with each of the multiple service providers. The retrieved quotes are compared, and a group of quotes below a pre-determined price threshold are provided to a user (e.g., a customer, sales agent, etc.) in real-time. These quotes can be provided to a user via the Internet (e.g., via an electronic mail message, a web page, or other electronic communication), and can be displayed in an easily read format (e.g., in ascending-price order from the lowest price to the highest price). The user can select a desired quote from an output list of quotes, and request additional information or express an interest in purchasing service at the price expressed in the desired quote online.","The terms \u201ccustomer\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d can represent multiple individuals associated with a price quote system according to one or more embodiments of the invention. For the sake of brevity and simplicity, the terms \u201ccustomer\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d are used herein with specific meanings. A \u201ccustomer\u201d is the potential beneficiary of communications service(s) to whom price quotes are ultimately intended to apply. That is, the customer is the person who will pay the price(s) delivered in the price quote to use the desired communications service(s). A \u201cuser\u201d operates the price quote system described herein to create price quotes for the customer. A user can include, for example, a sales agent, a sub-agent, a system administrator, or the customer. Thus, the customer can also be the user of the price quote system, creating the customer's own price quotes. Moreover, the user can be charged (but may not be) for use of the price quote system, even if that user is not the ultimate beneficiary of the communications service(s).","According to an embodiment of the invention, the quotes are facilitated by a system and method that is capable of geomapping the U.S. location of any customer into telecommunication vertical (V) and horizontal (H) coordinates (referred to collectively as \u201cV\/H coordinates\u201d herein) using: (1) numbering plan area code (NPA) information in combination with the first three digits of the telephone number (i.e., the prefix), which is expressed as NXX in the syntax of the North American numbering plan (NANP) syntax (expressed together as NPA-NXX); and (2) physical address information (e.g., street address, city, state, zip code) of the customer. The nearest central office (CO) to the customer, which is generally the telecommunication substation that provides the customer with dial-tone service, is determined, and the V\/H coordinates for the customer's central office (CO) are calculated.","For many T1 loop calculations, the distance from the customer's central office (CO) to the location of the point of presence (POP) of one or more T1 service providers is relevant. Based upon the calculated distance from the customer's central office (CO) to each point of presence (POP), a price quote can be generated for each provider using a pricing matrix that has pricing information for each individual provider. This pricing information can be provided, for example, as a function of distance from the customer's central office (CO) to the point of presence (POP).","Additional considerations can also be taken into account in providing price quotes, such as special rates, rebates, promotions, and the like. Information regarding these additional considerations can be obtained, for example, using real-time XML queries to each of the individual vendors. For the convenience of a user of the system, all of the data generated for each product vendor and can be assimilated into a single price quote. The price quotes for each of the vendors can be ranked according to price or some other parameter, and output in a graphical array (e.g., a table) in a manner that is convenient and easy to understand. The final results of each quote procedure can be stored in a separate database where a user, such as a customer, sales agent assigned to the quote, system administrators, and other designated personnel have access to the information. A user can select and express interest in a desired service plan online via an integrated order and price quote-tracking database. Additionally, according to one or more embodiments of the invention, the user can purchase a desired service plan online using information stored by an integrated order and price quote-tracking database.","According to an embodiment of the invention, users can shop for T1 service in real-time. Users can also shop for fractional T1 service, burstable T1 service, voice service over T1, data service over T1, digital system cross-connect (DSX) service, object linking and embedding (OLE) control extensions (OCX) service, digital subscriber line (DSL) service, and other services offered by one or more of the vendors queried. The inclusion of future product vendors and\/or services is also possible.","According to an embodiment of the invention, various databases can be accessed to provide users with the best possible rate quote. For example, a CO database containing information for every central office operating in the United States, as defined by the North American numbering plan (NANP) and the local access transport area (LATA), which define areas within which calls are handled by local telephone companies, can be provided. Additionally, for example, a location database that maps each CO to a physical V\/H coordinate can be used.","A database storing common language location identifier (CLLI) information, which is an identifier of a telephone switch or calling area formatted in the American standard code for information interchange (ASCII), can also be provided. According to an embodiment of the invention, a CLLI database that details the location (in V\/H coordinates) and serviceability of each POP in a vendor's network can be provided. Additionally, a complete pricing matrix that outlines the price-per-mile breakdown for each vendor's service line is provided according to an embodiment of the invention.","An embodiment of the invention includes a service package database, which contains information for each customer, such as terms of service, length of contract, applicable installation fees and\/or rebates, equipment costs, and so forth, for each product and service line. Additionally, a customer database is provided where information regarding customers is stored for use by customers, sales agents assigned to the quote, system administrators, and other designated personnel that have access to the information. A quote database where generated quotes and\/or order information is stored for future reference by customers, in-house sales agents, system administrators, and other designated personal can also be used, according to an embodiment of the invention.","In an alternative embodiment, a dynamic data retrieval capability is provided using, for example, XML commands to dynamically retrieve information from vendors who maintain their own CLLI and service package databases, as well as pricing information (e.g., within a price database), which could be used in place of the pricing matrix mentioned above. The dynamic data retrieval capability can be used in place of or in addition to local databases.","A quote compiler (described in greater detail below) can assimilate information from one or more of the databases mentioned above (including information dynamically retrieved from one or more vendors) to provide real-time customer quotes, according to an embodiment of the invention. Each quote is generated dynamically to ensure the most up-to-date system parameters are being employed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 6"],"b":["100","100","102","100","102"]},"Information communicated to the system from the user via the user interface  is provided to the quote compiler , which is in communication with a variety of databases , , as well as a lead processing system . The quote compiler  queries the central office (CO) database  and the vendor point of presence (POP) database  to obtain information regarding the nearest CO and POPs so that a distance can be determined and a corresponding price quote compiled for a customer. Additionally, the quote compiler can determine \u201ca la carte\u201d style promotions or other promotional features associated with a specific provider, communication loop, or service, which can be included in a price quote as desired.","When a price quote has been compiled, the information can be communicated to the user via the user interface  or by other suitable means. The price quote can be sent to the user via the user interface along with any additional information (e.g., required application forms, service agreements, credit applications, promotional materials, etc.), as desired or required by the provider. Alternatively, such additional information can be sent to a sales agent via the account manager  described below.","The quote compiler , upon retrieving the necessary information from the various databases , , calculates pricing information for one or more vendors, formats the results, and communicates the results to the user via the user interface . The manner in which the quote compiler  uses the information from the various databases, formats that information, and provides the information to a user is described in greater detail below.","Once the information has been presented to the user (e.g., via the user interface , an electronic network communication, etc.), the user then can select a desired service plan and optionally purchase that service plan (e.g., online via the user interface , via an electronic network connection, etc.). Information regarding any quotes provided to a user via the user interface , as well as any information regarding purchases made by a user, is provided to the lead processing system , which stores that information in the customer quote database , and provides relevant information about the customer to the agent back-office web site . Specifically, information is provided from the lead processing system  to a lead tracker  and\/or to an account manager . The lead tracker  is responsible for allowing referral\/marketing agents a dynamic ability to follow the progress of their leads (i.e., customers who requested quotes using a unique tracking code).","The account manager  allows professional, qualified, pre-screened sales agents access to the entire customer quote and provides a customer relationship management capability that allows sales agents to append, edit, and modify quote records as needed. For example, according to one or more embodiments of the invention, the account manager , or other component of the quote system  can provide sales agents with additional information regarding referrals and potential customers, such as potential sales agent commissions for opening an account. Additionally, the account manager , or other component of the quote system can provide additional information for a particular user or service provider (e.g., required application forms, service agreements, credit applications, promotional materials, etc.), as desired or required by a service provider. Commission rates may vary for the different vendors or different price quotes depending upon a variety of factors, and the quote system  can process quotes that include these various commission rates or provide information regarding the quotes to a sales agent, system administrator, or other individual using the quote system .","It will be appreciated that the various components illustrated in  can be collocated, or located remotely from one another. For example, according to an embodiment, the user interface  can provide a user access via a communications network, such as the Internet, a large area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), or other suitable communications network. Additionally, each of the databases shown in  can represent one or more databases either collocated with, or remotely located from, the quote compiler  and other elements of the price quote system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","202","204","104","204","206","206"]},"After the compiler  receives the user input , a participating vendor database  is created. This participating vendor database  can be based on preferences, such as user, customer, and\/or marketing preferences, for example. According to an embodiment of the invention, individual marketing agents of the price quote system  (shown in ) can set preferences within the participating vendor database . For example, each vendor with whom business is conducted can be stored in this database  with an associated \u201cON\u201d or \u201cOFF\u201d preference. The vendor preference field allows vendors to be selectively presented to users of the system. For example, according to an embodiment of the invention, when an \u201cOFF\u201d preference is associated with a vendor, that vendor can be excluded from the results presented to a customer (even if service is available through the excluded vendor), while vendors having an \u201cON\u201d preference associated with them will be included in the results presented to a customer. The \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d preferences can be used, for example, to prevent contractual or other conflicts with a particular vendor. According to one or more embodiments, an agent that provides quote information to the quote compiler  can provide these \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d preferences. Vendors can be removed from the database  by marketing agents, system administrators, or other authorized individuals using a password protected web control panel, for example.","Below is a sample of a database table from the participating vendor database  containing a single entry. Although a limited number of entries (e.g., a single entry) is shown for each sample database table shown below, each database table can include multiple entries, as desired and appropriate to store the information of those tables. The sample table from the vendor database  contains a vendor number, which uniquely identifies each vendor in the database , the vendor's name, a sub-agent identification (e.g., a username) of the agent who is marketing and\/or advertising the site, and a preference associated with that vendor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Vendor Number","Vendor Name","Sub-Agent ID","Preference"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Sprint","poborn","ON"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Information from the participating vendor database , along with user input , are provided to an array constructor , which communicates with a number of databases. Specifically, the array constructor  communicates with the vendor POP database  (also shown in ), which can include a number of individual databases. More specifically, the vendor POP database  can include, for example, a vendor CLLI coverage database , an NPA-NXX coverage database , and\/or a remotely located NPA-NXX coverage database (an optional database indicated by a dashed box).","According to an embodiment of the invention, after the participating vendor list is determined from database , each vendor is subcategorized according to the method of computation required to generate pricing from that vendor. Three examples of methods that can be implemented to generate pricing information include: looking up vendor information in the vendor CLLI coverage database , looking up vendor information in the NPA-NXX coverage database , and dynamically retrieving information from an off-site vendor NPA-NXX database ","According to an embodiment of the invention, the information retrieved from the vendor CLLI coverage database  can be retrieved using a SQL lookup query. For example, a three-dimensional (3-D) lookup query, including inline calculations, or other data manipulation to be performed simultaneously within a single SQL call, can also be used.","The various compilation blocks , ,  shown in  are functional blocks, and are not components of a particular system. Rather, these compilation blocks , ,  describe the functional manner in which an array of vendors is compiled from data in the various databases , , of the POP database  (shown in ) by the array constructor .","Which database , , is queried by the array constructor  depends on the particular vendor and the type or subcategory of database available for that vendor. For example, if conversion to V\/H coordinates is necessary, a CLLI three-dimensional (3-D) inline SQL V\/H compilation  occurs to retrieve data contained in the vendor CLLI coverage database . Generally, when NPA-NXX information is sufficient, the NPA-NXX coverage database  is queried via a normal lookup compilation . Some vendors prefer to maintain pricing information in-house, and will provide agents with access to a remote NPA-NXX coverage database . Queries to this coverage database can be performed by way of an XML off-site compilation . This can also be referred to as a dynamic data retrieval or an XML handshake.","According to an embodiment of the invention, looking up information in the vendor CLLI coverage database  can involve several subroutines. For example, the V\/H coordinate of the customer's CO can first be determined, and then the nearest POP location for a first vendor can be determined. After the nearest POP location for the first vendor has been determined, the closest POP location for a second vendor is determined. This process is repeated until all the POP locations closest to the customer and\/or the customer's CO for each vendor using this lookup type (i.e., using the CLLI coverage database ) have been determined.","The V\/H coordinates are looked up in a table in the CO database  (shown in ) using the NPA and NXX of the customer as lookup parameters. Below is an example of a sample set of a single line of data as it might appear in a table of the CO database .

Once the distances have been determined for all POP CLLIs using this lookup method, the one with the smallest distance is selected and passed to the pricing matrix .","The three-dimensional query shown above can be used with additional query language and\/or parameters (e.g., as part of a multi-dimensional query). For example, query language can be used in connection with a multi-dimensional query to order or otherwise filter results of the multi-dimensional query according to one or more parameters (e.g., parameters in a table from the vendor CLLI coverage database ). For example, results can be filtered according to the associated LATA (e.g., only results within the same LATA as a customer are displayed). Additionally, or alternatively, results of the multi-dimensional query above can be ordered in either ascending or descending order according to the \u201cCompany ID\u201d values associated with the results. The results can also be ordered according to distance from the customer. For example, the multi-dimensional query can be executed on the smallest distance (e.g., between the CO and the POP) first, followed by the next-smallest distance, and so on until the multi-dimensional query has been executed for all distances across all carriers.","The three-dimensional query shown above can be used in connection with one or more constraining or filtering statements (e.g., as a multi-dimensional query), such as the example shown below.","WHERE (Distance=(SELECT MIN (Distance))","The filtering statement immediately above acts as a filter for the three-dimensional query shown and discussed above, causing the three-dimensional query to operate first on the minimum distance. In the statement above, the variable \u201cDistance\u201d can be any distance calculation, or any portion of a distance calculation (e.g., a portion of the distance formula, etc.). Similar statements can be used to filter the three-dimensional query by mileage (e.g., as contained in an NPA-NXX database , , supplied by the vendor, computed, etc.), by LATA, or by any other suitable value (e.g., a Company ID, a Record ID, etc.).","Information can also be dynamically retrieved from a remotely located NPA-NXX database using, for example, an XML handshake technique. This technique can be used in situations where T1 vendors maintain needed T1 computation algorithms or techniques and databases centralized on servers under their direct control. Such vendors can establish XML protocols to facilitate an exchange of information, while still maintaining direct control of the algorithms and databases. According to an embodiment of the invention, an XML query used in an XML handshake technique can include one or more of the following pieces of information: NPA information, NXX information, a customer's physical address, a customer's city, a customer's state, and a customer's zip code. Using one or more of these parameters, the vendor's software can determine the rate plans available from the vendor at the customer's location and transmit these plans back to the array constructor . Other dynamic query techniques, or handshake techniques can likewise be used to accomplish the transfer of information from agent to vendor and vice versa, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) post, HTTP get, file transfer protocol (FTP), application programming interface (API), and other techniques. According to an embodiment of the invention, information received via an XML handshake technique or another dynamic retrieval technique can be parsed and sent directly to the array presenter , bypassing the pricing matrix .","Once an array of available vendor data has been constructed, that information can be provided to a pricing matrix , which can calculate prices for each of the vendors within the array.

The user input can include, for example, customer information such as area code and exchange information (i.e., NPA-NXX information), street address, city name, state name, zip code information, and other suitable information for determining the location of a customer. After receiving the user input in step , the customer's location is resolved using a ranging system capable of determining the latitude and longitude of the customer's location in step . For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the global positioning system (GPS) is used to determine GPS coordinates of the customer's location in step . Determining the customer's location can be accomplished by calculation, measurement, or by data from commercially available databases. For example, the United States Postal Service maintains a regularly updated, publicly accessible database with the latitude and longitude of every location in the United States.","The GPS coordinates (or alternatively, coordinates from some other ranging system) then are converted to coordinates that can be used to measure distance between two points on a substantially spherical surface or ellipsoidal surface. For example, according to an embodiment of the invention, the GPS coordinates can be converted to V\/H coordinates in step , such as those shown in  (described in greater detail below). One technique for converting from latitude and longitude to V\/H coordinates is discussed below in detail in connection with the flow diagram shown in . Because the pricing of T1 service and other services, such as DSL service, is often highly distance-sensitive and can require a resolution on the order of about 0.1 miles, conversion to a flat geometry, representing a projection of the spherical or ellipsoidal coordinates is effective.","In step  of , the customer's CO (e.g., the CO geographically closest to the customer) is determined. This may be accomplished, for example, using input from a user, such as the customer's NPA-NXX information, as well as information from a national CO database (e.g., the CO database , shown in ). Generally this information is available in the CO database  in V\/H coordinates; however, if this information is not available in V\/H coordinates, or other similar coordinates, the same or similar conversion from latitude and longitude to V\/H coordinates performed for the customer's location can be performed to determine the V\/H coordinates of the CO. Generally, when the CO location is stored in V\/H coordinates, it can be retrieved using either a simple or a multi-dimensional inline query (e.g., a SQL or XML query)","Once the customer's CO has been determined in step , the distance from the customer to the CO is determined in step . For example, using the V\/H coordinates of the customer and the V\/H coordinates of the customer's servicing CO, the distance between the two can be determined by the following formula, where the factor 3.1623 is used to convert to miles from V\/H coordinate units (i.e., each V\/H coordinate unit is 3.1623 miles):\n\nDistance(in miles)=sqrt((V\u2212V)^2+(H\u2212H)^2)\/3.1623.\n","The distance from the customer's CO to the next-nearest T1 vendor's POP is determined in step , and is repeated until, for example, a pre-determined limit for the number of vendors to be queried is reached, as determined in step . The V\/H coordinate information of the next-nearest POP can be determined via lookup in a vendor POP database , for example, or can alternatively be calculated using the transform shown above. Using the V\/H coordinates of the customer's CO and the V\/H coordinates of the T1 vendor POP (e.g., obtained via the POP database lookup), a distance can be determined using the distance formula shown above.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a separate table within a database can be created for each vendor for which quotes are to be obtained. Each of these database tables can contain information relevant to that particular vendor, such as the CLLI code, city name, state location, local exchange carrier information, and V\/H coordinate information. Thus, with a simple list of CLLI codes, the information from the CO database  can be used to expand the list to include every NPA-NXX served.","As shown in , the distance to each next-nearest POP is determined until it has been determined in step  that the pre-determined vendor limit has been reached. In other words, the distance to the closest POP is determined, then the distance to the next-closest (i.e., the second-closest) POP is determined, followed by the distance to the next-closest (i.e., the third-closest), and so forth until the pre-determined vendor limit is reached. All of the distances determined are then stored into an array.","In step , all vendors (e.g., T1 vendors, etc.) that do not have a POP within a pre-determined threshold distance from the customer are eliminated from the array containing vendor information. According to an embodiment of the invention involving T1 vendors, the pre-determined threshold distance is approximately fifty miles because many T1 vendors do not offer service to customers who do not live within fifty miles of the vendor's closest POP. According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, step  can be optional, and all POPs for which distance has been determined can be used for price quotes, without eliminating any POPs.","In step , distance (e.g., mileage) is converted into loop prices for each vendor. Each T1 vendor generally determines prices for T1 loops using their own formula. This information for each vendor is contained within the pricing matrix , discussed above in connection with . Alternatively, this information can be obtained dynamically from vendors that make the information available for dynamic queries, such as the XML handshake technique described above. By way of either the pricing matrix  or dynamic queries, the distances from the customer to the CO and from the CO to the POP are converted to prices.","A simplified example of a pricing matrix  is shown in the table below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Distance","Cost"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20030-5 miles","$200\/month"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025-10 miles","$250\/month"]},{"entry":[{},"10-20 miles","$300\/month"]},{"entry":[{},"20-30 miles","$350\/month"]},{"entry":[{},"30-40 miles","$400\/month"]},{"entry":[{},"40-50 miles","$450\/month"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Some T1 vendors that have smaller footprints can deliver lists of the NPA-NXX combinations that they serve, along with corresponding prices for customers who are located within predefined areas associated with various combinations.

These additional price considerations (if any) are included in the price quotes for each vendor provided to the user via the user interface . According to an embodiment of the invention, a database containing vendor-specific information (e.g., a service package database), which includes information regarding basic terms and other price considerations associated with each vendor, can be used in step . For example, such a database can include terms of service, length of contract, applicable installation fees and\/or rebates, equipment costs, and so forth for each product and service line. This information can be stored, for example, by a vendor using a unique vendor identification number (Vendor ID). Each vendor's loop price and any other price considerations (e.g., the service package) associated with each vendor can be easily combined by using a SQL \u201cjoin\u201d lookup, for example, or some other suitable combining command or method.","In step , dynamic information is retrieved from vendors who make such information available. This can be accomplished, for example, using the XML handshake technique described above, with XML-enabled vendors. As discussed in connection with the NPA-NXX coverage database shown in , some providers may allow real-time access of information via dynamic inquiries, such as XML, or the like. This can be in place of or in addition to a local database query. Information obtained dynamically for certain vendors is interpreted and stored into the master array with the results for other vendors. Step  is not required, and can be performed for one or more vendors for which such queries are available. Data obtained using such dynamic information retrieval techniques can come in a variety of formats and can be interpreted from multiple possible result formats.","The array containing price information is ranked in step  according to pre-determined parameters and is formatted in step  according to a pre-determined format. According to an embodiment of the invention, after all of the results have been calculated, each pricing plan is sorted and ranked according to a monthly recurring charge associated with the corresponding vendor. This can be accomplished, for example, in two steps: (1) writing each price quote into a database; and (2) reading out each quote line, beginning with the lowest price and ending with the highest price. Alternatively, ranking and\/or formatting can be performed by rearranging the results within the array in which they are stored, and outputting the results beginning with the lowest price and ending with the highest price.","Once the price information has been ranked and formatted, it can be output (e.g., displayed, transmitted, etc.) to a user in step . According to an embodiment of the invention, the price information can be output in a form readily accessible by a user, such as a table.
