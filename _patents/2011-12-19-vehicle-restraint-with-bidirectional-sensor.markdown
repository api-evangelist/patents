title: Vehicle restraint with bi-directional sensor
abstract: A vehicle restraint restricts the movement of a vehicle at a loading dock by engaging the vehicle's RIG (rear impact guard). The vehicle restraint includes a barrier carried by a vertically translatable track follower, the barrier being driven by a motor or some other type of power unit. A RIG sensor detects the RIG's horizontal position relative to the barrier and can periodically energize the motor to maintain the barrier in generally continuous contact with the RIG, even if the RIG moves horizontally away from the barrier. Detection of such horizontal movement of the RIG triggers the barrier to move accordingly to reduce a horizontal gap that may have formed between the RIG and the barrier.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent arises from a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/551,032, entitled \u201cVEHICLE RESTRAINT WITH BI-DIRECTIONAL SENSOR,\u201d filed on Oct. 19, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure generally pertains to a vehicle restraint that engages a truck's rear impact guard (RIG) to help prevent the truck from inadvertently pulling away from a loading dock. More specifically, to a vehicle restraint that senses horizontal movement of the RIG and responds to the sensing by helping to ensure that the restraint is in an acceptable horizontal position relative to the RIG.","When loading or unloading a truck parked at a loading dock, it is generally a safe practice to help restrain the truck from accidentally moving too far away from the dock. This is often accomplished by a vehicle restraint that engages what is referred to, in the industry, as a truck's ICC bar (Interstate Commerce Commission bar) or RIG (Rear Impact Guard). An ICC bar or RIG is a bar or beam that extends horizontally across the rear of a truck, below the truck bed. Its primary purpose is to help prevent an automobile from under-riding the truck in a rear-end collision. A RIG, however, also provides a convenient structure for a vehicle restraint to engage, thereby obstructing the bar's (and thus, the truck's) movement away from the dock. To release the truck, at least a portion of the restraint is lowered to a stored position below the bar, which also allows the next truck to back into the dock.","There are at least two general types of RIG-engaging vehicle restraints. A first type of RIG-engaging vehicle restraint relies on the power of the truck backing into the dock as the impetus for operating the vehicle restraint. This type of vehicle restraint may use spring force for storing the restraint in a normally raised position. As a truck backs its RIG over the upwardly biased vehicle restraint, the RIG engages a ramp or some other type of mechanical actuator that forces the restraint down, underneath the RIG. When the truck's RIG is properly positioned over the restraint, a relatively small power unit can be actuated to raise a barrier portion of the restraint in front of the RIG. Examples of such truck-powered vehicle restraints that store in a normally raised position are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,190,109; 6,322,310; 5,882,167; 5,702,223 and 5,297,921, all of which are specifically incorporated by reference herein.","In addition to utilizing the truck's power to operate the vehicle restraint, the spring of such restraints also enables upwardly biased restraints to follow the incidental vertical movement of the RIG as the truck is being loaded or unloaded of its cargo. This can be advantageous in comparison to other types of vehicle restraints.","A second general type of vehicle restraint stores in a lowered position and typically requires some type of power unit, such as a motor or hydraulic cylinder, to raise the restraint to an elevation where it can capture the RIG. Since the power unit must raise the entire moving portion of the vehicle restraint, lifting such weight may require a power unit of substantial size and horsepower, which can add even more weight to the restraint. The power unit of this vertically moving restraint may include a small spring, or other mechanism, to accommodate slight vertical movement of the truck\/RIG, but a vehicle restraint of this type typically has no mechanism for accommodating horizontal movement of the RIG.","A limitation common to both types of restraint is an inability of the restraint to follow the horizontal movement of the RIG. For example, after a vehicle restraint is initially positioned relative to the RIG, the loading or unloading operation may cause the truck to move both vertically and horizontally. The vehicle restraint's barrier prevents the RIG from moving forward horizontally, in a direction opposite the dock face, but it does not generally accommodate the RIG moving backward in a horizontal direction toward the dock face (away from the restraint's raised barrier). This can leave a horizontal gap between the RIG and the barrier even though the spring or actuator allows for vertical movement and continues to hold the restraint tightly up against the underside of the RIG. If the vehicle later begins to return to its more forward position, the gap provides a backlash in which the RIG can accelerate before striking the barrier with an impact that may be sufficient to bend or otherwise damage the RIG. In the case of a premature truck\/trailer departure, this horizontal gap may actually allow a trailer to build up enough momentum to \u201cjump\u201d over the barrier prior to the operator lowering the restraint and releasing the trailer.","Known prior art restraints included no means for detecting the horizontal position of the RIG relative to the vehicle restraint's barrier. Because the RIG's horizontal position relative to the barrier was not detected, prior art restraints did nothing to eliminate the potentially hazardous horizontal gap that may result from the backward movement of the trailer (and RIG), nor did they do anything to alert workers of such a hazardous condition. Consequently, a need exists for a vehicle restraint that can properly respond not only to vertical movement of a RIG but also to horizontal movement of a RIG to warn of, and preferably minimize, a gap that may form between the barrier and the RIG upon horizontal movement of the RIG.","In order to provide a vehicle restraint that can properly respond to horizontal movement of a RIG, a restraint disclosed herein includes a sensor that detects whether a RIG has moved horizontally away from the restraint's barrier.","In some examples, the vehicle restraint includes a barrier that can rotate to take up both horizontal and vertical slack between the barrier and a RIG.","In some examples, the vehicle restraint includes a dual-plate barrier with a RIG sensor protectively interposed between the two plates.","In some examples, the RIG sensor includes an optical device.","In some examples, the RIG sensor includes a pivotal arm.","In some examples, a spring moves the vehicle restraint in response to vertical movement of the RIG, and a motor moves the restraint's barrier in response to horizontal movement of the RIG.","In some examples, a spring biases the vehicle restraint upward, and a motor rotates the restraint's barrier between a protruding blocking position and a retracted stored position.","In some examples, the vehicle restraint is a vertically moving restraint that includes a sensor to detect whether a RIG has moved horizontally away from a barrier included on the restraint.","In some examples, the vertically moving restraint responds to the sensor detecting that the RIG has moved horizontally away from a barrier by triggering a signaling system.","In some examples, the vertically moving restraint responds to the sensor detecting that the RIG has moved horizontally away from a barrier by moving the barrier horizontally toward the RIG.","To help prevent a vehicle  (e.g., truck, trailer, etc.) from accidentally pulling too far away from a dock face  of a loading dock , a vehicle restraint  includes a barrier  for engaging or capturing a RIG , or ICC bar, of vehicle  as the vehicle is being loaded or unloaded of its cargo. Because vehicle  typically has some incidental movement during loading and unloading operations, vehicle restraint  includes a RIG sensor  and other structure that enables restraint  to properly respond to such movement.  are right side views illustrating the operating sequence of vehicle restraint , and  is a front view of  (looking toward dock face ). A ramp extension  is omitted in  to show other features of restraint  more clearly.","To vertically position vehicle restraint  relative to RIG , restraint  comprises a track follower  that is movable between a raised position () and various lowered positions (). The vertical movement of track follower  is guided by a track  that can be mounted to dock face . A tension spring , or some other type of resilient member, biases track follower  to its raised position (), thus urging track follower  up against the underside of RIG  when RIG  is positioned above track follower  as shown in .","In order to capture RIG  and thus limit its movement away from dock face , track follower  carries rotatable barrier  that a powered drive unit  (e.g., an electric motor, hydraulic motor, piston\/cylinder, etc.\u2014see ) can rotate between a stored position (, ,  and ) and various blocking positions (,  and ).","Although the actual operation of vehicle restraint  may vary,  illustrate an example. Operation may begin as shown in , where vehicle  is backing into dock  while track follower  is at its raised position, and barrier  is at its stored position.","In , vehicle  continues backing into dock , which forces RIG  to slide over a ramp  or to engage some other type of mechanical structure that enables vehicle  to force track follower  down underneath RIG . In this example, the interaction between ramp  and RIG  forces track follower  downward against the upward urging of spring .","In , vehicle  is shown having backed RIG  over track follower  such that RIG  passes over the top of a distal end  of barrier . RIG  is now in a position where barrier  can rise to capture RIG .","In , power unit  () rotates barrier  from its stored position to a blocking position to help contain RIG  at a location that ensures a certain amount of lip purchase  or overlap between a lip  of a conventional dock leveler  and a rear edge  of vehicle . Once barrier  rises to its blocking position, dock leveler  can be operated in a conventional manner to set lip  upon the vehicle's truck bed as shown in .","Although the initial energizing of power unit  to raise barrier  could be done automatically in response to some type of sensor that senses the arrival of vehicle  or RIG , in some cases the initial energizing of power unit  is simply triggered by a conventional manually operated switch. Once energized, power unit  continues raising barrier  until RIG sensor  determines that RIG  is within a RIG-receiving throat area , or preferred capture area, of barrier . Once RIG sensor  determines that RIG  is within the RIG-receiving throat area , or preferred capture area, power unit  is de-energized, thereby stopping upward movement of barrier . RIG sensor  may also be electrically coupled with a signaling system (e.g., visual or audible communication means) to alert interested parties of the position of the barrier relative to the RIG. This arrangement may offer some advantages over prior art rotating hook restraints.","Prior art rotating hook restraints typically included a timer that was started at the same time the power unit was triggered. The power unit was then energized for a pre-determined period of time, after which the timer cut power to the power unit. The timer's period of time was set as the period of time necessary to ensure that the hook would rotate enough to properly capture the highest RIG in a given service range. If the RIG was lower in elevation, though, the hook would engage the RIG before the timer expired. Because the timer had not expired, the power unit would continue to be energized, even though the hook could not move any further (contact with the RIG prevented further movement). This arrangement required the use of a slip clutch to prevent damage to the system components during the period of time in which the power unit continued to be energized although the hook could move no further. Because this type of rotating hook restraint did not rely on the position of the RIG relative to the restraint, proper RIG-restraint engagement was indirectly measured by detecting the rotational position of the restraint hook. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,748 discloses a finger or cam attached to the shaft of the rotating hook. When the shaft was rotated, raising the hook to an operational position, the finger or cam would engage a switch, thereby indicating that the hook was in its operational position. As described, this type of system only detects the rotational position of the restraint hook, not the hook's actual position relative to the RIG. Accordingly, prior to the current invention, a rotating hook vehicle restraint's actual engagement with the RIG was not directly sensed or indicated.","By sensing the actual presence of the rotating hook in a preferred capture area, the current restraint may reduce wear on the power unit, and it may eliminate the need for a timer and a slip clutch, along with other benefits. Although the actual design of RIG sensor  may vary, the sensor will provide the aforementioned benefits. In some examples, RIG sensor  comprises a sensing arm  pivotally coupled to barrier  by way of a shaft  or some other pivotal connection. RIG sensor  may further comprise a spring , a mechanical stop , and a limit switch  (proximity switch, electromechanical switch, etc.). In this example of RIG sensor , arm  can pivot between mechanical stop  and switch , while spring  biases arm  toward stop . Switch  provides a make or break signal  () whose on\/off states are determined by whether arm  is adjacent switch .","In , arm  is up against stop , so signal  allows power unit  to be energized via the manually operated switch mentioned earlier. Once energized, barrier  continues to rise until the engagement between arm  and RIG  forces arm  to trigger switch . This causes switch  to change state such that signal  now de-energizes power unit  to stop barrier  at its blocking position of . Accordingly, by detecting the actual position of the RIG relative to the barrier, the current restraint may reduce wear on the power unit (it does not run when the hook is in contact with the RIG) and may eliminate the need for a timer and a slip clutch.","With barrier  restraining RIG  and lip  safely resting upon the vehicle's truck bed, as shown in , vehicle  can now be safely loaded or unloaded of its cargo using dock leveler  as a bridge for personnel and material handling equipment to travel to and from vehicle . Switch  and signal  can also be electrically coupled to a signaling system, such as lights or audible alarms. For example, engagement between arm  and RIG  forces arm  to trigger switch , thereby causing it to change state such that signal  changes a light inside the loading dock from red to green, indicating that the vehicle can now be safely loaded or unloaded. By measuring the actual position of the restraint relative to the RIG, a \u201cfalse lock\u201d indication, based only on the rotational position of the restraint, can be effectively avoided. Although a lighting system may be the most common means of communicating a proper position of the restraint relative to the RIG to dock workers, other forms of communication, or signaling, could readily be incorporated into the system.","After the restraint is properly positioned relative to the RIG, the vehicle may be safely loaded or unloaded. As cargo or the weight of material handling equipment is added or removed from the vehicle's truck bed, the vehicle's suspension may allow vehicle  to rise and descend accordingly. Track follower  can readily follow such vertical movement and stay in contact with the underside of RIG  by virtue of spring , which urges track follower  upward.","In the position shown in , distal end  of barrier  is a horizontal distance  from track . According to an advantageous feature of this design, the length of distance  may vary. Vehicle , for instance, could subsequently move horizontally away from its position shown in  to its position shown in  where RIG  is up against a dock bumper . To eliminate the horizontal gap between barrier  and RIG , the depicted restraint can sense the gap and re-position barrier  to eliminate it. In this example, the horizontal movement would allow arm  to return to its position against stop , whereby signal  would re-energize power unit  to once again rotate barrier  toward RIG . Barrier  would continue rotating until RIG  forces arm  away from stop  to re-trigger switch , whereby signal  would then stop barrier  at its newly adjusted blocking position of . Horizontal distance \u2032 of  is less than distance  of , so RIG  is more constrained in  than in . Reducing or eliminating the horizontal backlash of RIG  within restraint  may reduce the possibility of RIG  hammering against barrier  in an early departure situation. Thus, the barrier system according to one example provides sensing based on the actual presence of a RIG relative to the barrier, as opposed to sensing based on the rotational position of the hook. Put slightly differently, the barrier system disclosed herein detects the presence of the RIG in a preferred capture area, wherein the preferred capture area is an area in which the barrier is horizontally adjacent the RIG. In the case of a rotating hook restraint, the preferred capture area may also be referred to in the art as a RIG-receiving throat area. Furthermore, sensing that the RIG is not in the preferred capture area may also cause corrective action and\/or signaling.","Automatically repositioning the barrier in response to detecting that the RIG has moved horizontally away from the barrier offers numerous benefits, but it may not be desirable in all circumstances. For example, if the restraint rarely loses contact with the RIG, then it may be sufficient to sound an alarm or otherwise signal the loss of contact, wherein this alarm or signal alerts an operator that he must take action (e.g., push a button) to move the restraint horizontally toward the RIG. In this manner, the restraint system detects that the RIG has moved away from the barrier and triggers an alarm to alert a dock worker of a potentially unsafe condition that he should take steps to remedy.","Although these functions could be accomplished by various structures,  illustrate one example. In the illustrated example, track follower  comprises two side plates and attached to a base . Rollers  or slide members extending from side plates and and protruding into two vertical channels of track  help guide the vertical movement of track follower . To urge track follower  upward, one or more springs  extend between base  and an upper anchor  affixed to track . Although barrier  could be a single hook-shaped member, barrier  comprises two plates and that help protect RIG sensor  therebetween. Plates and can be keyed to shaft  to provide a positive drive connection to drive unit . A chain  and two sprockets  and  can couple the output of drive unit  to shaft . For overload protection, a slip clutch  can be installed somewhere in the drive train between shaft  and drive unit , although the current sensing configuration may allow the slip clutch to be eliminated. One end  of spring  can be attached to plate , and an opposite end  can be attached to arm . Stop  can be a pin or some other suitable structure extending from barrier . At least part of RIG sensor  can be attached at an appropriate location on barrier . Restraint  also may include a barrier sensor  coupled to track follower . Barrier sensor  provides a stored-signal  () that triggers powered drive unit  to stop lowering barrier  when the barrier reaches its stored position.","In the example of , barrier  is keyed or otherwise solidly fixed to shaft  while arm  can rotate about shaft . In an alternate example, however, generally the opposite is true. More specifically,  show a vehicle restraint  whose barrier  can rotate relative to a shaft , but an arm  is rigidly fixed to shaft . A tension spring , which extends between arm  and barrier , urges barrier  upward relative to arm . In this case, spring  is sufficiently strong to support the barrier's weight. The operation of vehicle restraint  may be as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","20","82","84","88","91","90","84","88"]},"In , drive unit  () is raising arm  via shaft , and barrier  rises with arm  due to spring .","In , barrier  makes initial contact with RIG ; however, drive unit  () continues raising arm  because arm  has not yet tripped switch .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 7"],"b":["88","54","32","54","20","84","54","82","20","90","84","20","20","84","88","84","55","84","88"]},"If RIG  moves slightly closer to dock face , as shown in , barrier  will tend to follow that movement due to the urging of spring . If the movement of RIG  and the relative movement of arm  are small, such that RIG  remains in the preferred capture area, then barrier  may be able to follow the RIG's movement without drive unit  having to be re-energized by switch . If, however, the movement of RIG  and the relative movement of arm  are sufficient to trip switch , indicating that a horizontal gap has developed between barrier  and RIG  (i.e., RIG  has moved out of the preferred capture area), then drive unit  is re-energized by switch  to force arm  and barrier  back up against the RIG, in its new position, as shown in . Thus, vehicle restraint  can closely follow incidental movement of RIG  by spring force alone and follow greater movement by automatically energizing power unit  when a horizontal gap forms between barrier  and RIG  such that RIG  moves out of the preferred capture area. With this design, drive unit  could be energized less often. Also, arm  never needs to actually contact RIG , so arm  could be completely hidden inside or underneath barrier . Furthermore, because the position of the restraint relative to the RIG is actually measured, the signaling system (lights or other) can be more accurate, allowing the system to more effectively alert dock workers of a potentially unsafe condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 14 and 15","FIGS. 1-7","FIGS. 14 and 15","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["92","16","92","22","94","96","98","100","96","92","20","20","94","46"]},"Yet another example of a vehicle restraint  is shown in . Like the previous examples, vehicle restraint  is intended to help prevent a vehicle  (e.g., truck, trailer, etc.) from accidentally pulling too far away from a dock face  of a loading dock . As in the previous examples, the actual position of the RIG relative to the vehicle restraint's barrier is sensed, with the barrier position being altered, if the barrier moves out of the preferred capture area, to bring the barrier back into a proper position relative to the RIG. However, unlike the previous examples, vehicle restraint , as shown in , does not rely on an upwardly-biased, rotating hook vehicle restraint to provide a barrier to vehicle movement, instead relying on a vertically-moving barrier assembly . Barrier assembly  comprises a barrier , a sliding barrier , a RIG sensor , a RIG sensor extension , and a RIG sensor switch .  are right side views illustrating the operating sequence of vehicle restraint .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 17","FIG. 16","FIGS. 17 and 18"],"b":["104","106","108","106","104","10","60","110","110","104","112","134","12","104","112","104","112","104","114","20","20","104","110","110","120","120","116","12","116","12","118","20","118","116","12","118","122","124","124","124","120","110","124"]},"As shown best in , sliding barrier  includes an extension tip  that extends over the top of a portion of the RIG. Like the rotating hook restraint shown in , but unlike a traditional vertically-moving barrier, extension tip  provides a barrier to upward movement of the RIG. Thus, in the event that the trailer's landing gear collapses, extension tip  will help prevent the RIG (and the rear of the trailer) from rapidly moving upward. As detailed above, RIG sensor  acts to ensure that RIG  is consistently positioned relative to sliding barrier  and extension tip  (with RIG  in the preferred capture area), such that extension tip  extends over a portion of RIG .","As a fork truck enters and exits the trailer during the loading\/unloading operation, the trailer (and the RIG) tends to move vertically, movement that is often referred to as trailer \u201cfloat.\u201d To allow barrier assembly  to follow RIG  as it floats slightly, the lower end  of lifting cylinder  is slidably mounted and attached to float spring . If RIG  moves slightly downward, float spring  allows barrier assembly  to follow such movement, and if RIG  moves back upward to its original position, float spring  urges barrier  upward, in contact with RIG . Thus, if the RIG moves a relatively small amount, barrier assembly  may be able to follow the RIG's movement without the need for lifting cylinder  to be re-energized.","However, vertical movement of the RIG is typically accompanied by horizontal movement of the RIG. If RIG  moves horizontally closer to dock face , then a horizontal gap would result between the barrier and RIG , such that RIG  may no longer be in the preferred capture area. According to an advantageous feature of this design, this gap may be sensed and minimized or eliminated. That is, for such horizontal RIG movement, RIG  may lose contact with RIG sensor , resulting in RIG sensor  returning to its rest position and RIG sensor extension  losing contact (e.g., magnetic contact or physical contact) with RIG sensor switch . When engagement between RIG sensor extension  and RIG sensor switch  is lost (indicating that the RIG is no longer in the preferred capture area), lifting cylinder  is re-energized and, once its internal pressure reaches the pre-determined level (as detailed above), sliding cylinder  is re-energized. Re-energizing sliding cylinder  causes it to retract, which, in turn, causes sliding barrier  to move horizontally toward dock face  to minimize the horizontal gap that has formed between RIG  and sliding barrier . Sliding barrier continues to move horizontally until RIG sensor  contacts RIG  and RIG sensor extension  is re-engaged with RIG sensor switch . Barrier assembly  is thereby returned to its engaged position, wherein RIG  is in the preferred capture area. Thus, RIG sensor  helps ensure that RIG  is consistently and properly positioned relative to sliding barrier  and extension tip  (i.e., in the preferred capture area). Furthermore, RIG sensor  can be electrically coupled to a means for accurately signaling (via lights, sound, or other) when the RIG is properly positioned relative to the barrier assembly. If lights are used to signal, these lights may change state (e.g., change illuminated color, temporarily flash) until the RIG returns to the preferred capture area. Alternatively, a horn could sound in response to RIG sensor  losing contact with the RIG. In fact, if the restraint rarely loses contact with the RIG, then it may be sufficient to sound an alarm or otherwise signal the loss of contact, wherein this alarm or signal alerts an operator that he must take action (e.g., push a button) to move the restraint horizontally toward the RIG.","As described, when the RIG is properly positioned relative to the barrier assembly, float is accommodated via float spring , pullout protection is provided via barrier , and vertical movement of the trailer and RIG is prevented by extension tip .","This arrangement may offer advantages over prior art vertically-moving restraints because it detects the horizontal position of the RIG relative to the barrier and adjusts the position of the barrier, if necessary, to help ensure a consistent horizontal relationship between the two (i.e., that the RIG is in a preferred capture area, such that any horizontal gap between the RIG and the barrier is minimized). Known prior art vertically-moving restraints only detect the vertical position of a RIG relative to the restraint (e.g., through use of a treadle plate mounted on an upper surface of the restraint). Prior to the current disclosure, known vertically moving restraints provided no means for addressing the problems associated with horizontal movement of the trailer (and RIG).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIGS. 16-18","FIG. 16","FIG. 19","FIGS. 16-18"],"b":["120","132","110","110","104","132","132","110","104","112","134","104","112","104","112","104","114","20","20","110","104","110","110","132","132","132","116","12","118","20","118","116","12","118","122","124","124","110","118","20","116","126","20","126","128","114","126"]},"Although the invention is described with reference to various examples, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications are well within the scope of the invention.
