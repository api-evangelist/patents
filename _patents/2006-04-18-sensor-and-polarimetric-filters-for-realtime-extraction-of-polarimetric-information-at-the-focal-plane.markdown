title: Sensor and polarimetric filters for real-time extraction of polarimetric information at the focal plane
abstract: A polarimetric imaging system employs a pixel pitch matched filter for use within, for example, a 2 by 2 pixel neighborhood, in which one pixel samples the scene via a 0 degree polarization filter and a second pixel samples the scene via a 45 degree polarization filter. The remaining two pixels record the intensity of the light within the 2 by 2 neighborhoods. The polarization filters employ organic materials such as polymers or metallic materials that are patterned and etched using reactive ion etching (RIE) or other appropriate etching technique in order to create 14 micron or smaller circular (or square) periodic structures that are patterned into polarization thin films that are deposited on an imaging sensor that includes a processor that computes from the polarization-filtered inputs the first three Stokes parameters in real-time.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Development of the present invention was supported in part by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) under grant number FA9550-05-1-0052. The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to imaging using the polarization properties of light and, more particularly, to a sensor and polarimetric filters for use in extracting polarimetric information at the focal plane in real-time, and a method of making such sensors and filters.","Polarization vision contains important information about the imaged environment, such as surface shapes, curvature and material properties, which are ignored with traditional imaging systems. Several species of invertebrate, such as cuttlefish, honeybees, desert ants, and others, rely on contrast enhancement using polarized vision, which is a vital survival mechanism in optically scattering media. The unaided human eye perceives visual information in terms of color and brightness, but it cannot effectively sense and utilize polarization. Accordingly, it is desired to develop an imaging system capable of extracting polarization information from the imaged environment in real-time and presenting the polarization information in parallel with the intensity information. The sensory system of the invention integrates imaging, a micro-polarization array and polarization processing at the focal plane to provide such an imaging system.","A survey of the literature reveals that most polarization sensitive imaging systems compute contrast enhancement information. This information is extracted by either temporally sampling two images filtered with two orthogonal polarized filters or integrating two orthogonal polarized filters over two neighboring photo elements. The contrast extraction information is computed either on a DSP\/CPU or at the focal plane with translinear circuits. Usual tradeoffs in these systems are reduction of frame rate versus reduction of the spatial resolution in the latter systems. Incorporating pixel pitch matched polarization filters at the focal plane has been achieved using birefringence materials or thin film polarizers. Although these sensory systems are directly inspired from biological systems, they present limited polarization information in scattered media, such as fog, under water imaging and others. In contrast, complete polarization information tends to be far more complex and its computational demands prevent real-time extraction. These complex polarization properties are fully described by the fundamental parameters known as the Stokes parameters. As will be explained in more detail herein, in order to fully determine the Stokes parameters of natural (polychromatic) light, the scene must be sampled with three different polarization filters.","A micro-polarization array with two spatially distributed polarizers has been fabricated and described by Guo et al. as described in an article entitled \u201cFabrication of high-resolution micropolarizer array,\u201d , Vol. 36, No. 8, pp. 2268-2271 (1997). Manipulation of polymer polarization filters in order to create a micro-polarizer array has been described by Faris in U.S. Pat. No. 5,327,285. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, one of the main challenges in manipulating a relatively thick polymer polarizing filter is the patterning and etching of the structures within 1 \u03bcm accuracy. The thickness of commercially available polymer polarization thin films varies between 10 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm, which creates problems when standard etching techniques employed in the semiconductor industry are used to create micro structures on the order of 10 \u03bcm or less.","Traditional imaging systems focus on converting light's intensity and color property into suitable electronic signals. An important property of light, polarization is ignored with these traditional imaging systems. Polarization vision contains information about the imaged environment, such as surface shapes, curvature and material properties. Real-time extraction of polarization properties would further allow synergy with traditional adaptive spatiotemporal image processing techniques for synthetic imaging. However, to date, no camera has enabled computation of the Stokes parameters in real-time using a single camera, for conventionally at least three cameras are needed, each with a different polarization filter, or a single camera sequentially computes the Stokes parameters by sequentially imaging with different filters. The present invention has been designed to provide for such real-time extraction using a specially designed polarimetric sensor including a two layer micro-polarizer array in combination with a photo pixel array, noise suppression circuitry and on-chip processing circuitry for polarimetric computation of the Stokes parameters of a partially polarized (polychromatic) light in real-time.","An image sensor has been developed with real-time polarimetric extraction capability at the focal plane using low power analog circuits. The imaging system using such sensors is capable of computing the first three Stokes parameters (or two polarization parameters plus intensity) at the focal plane in real-time. In order to fully describe the polarization state of polychromatic light in nature, three linear polarized projections or two linear polarized projections in combination with the total intensity are required. Since the natural lights are mostly polychromatic, the phase information between the various components is usually not available (or statistically random or lost). Therefore, of the usual four Stokes parameters, the first three are more important and relevant for natural polychromatic lights. That is why only the first three Stokes parameters are addressed.","A two layer micro polarizer array with total thickness of around 20 \u03bcm has been fabricated and mounted on top of the imaging sensor. The image sensor comprises a 256 by 256 photo pixel array, noise suppression circuitry and analog or digital processing circuitry for polarimetric computation in the current or voltage domain. The image sensor was fabricated in 0.18 \u03bcm process with 10 \u03bcm pixel pitch and 75% fill factor. Block-parallel pixel read out is employed in order to compute the first three Stokes parameters on a neighborhood of 2 by 2 pixels. The Stokes parameters are presented together with the noise suppressed intensity image.","The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of illustrative and preferred embodiments taken in connection with the accompanying  that form a part of this disclosure.

Also, as used in the specification including the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include the plural, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular value, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Where range of values is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and\/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent \u201cabout it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. All ranges are inclusive and combinable.","Overview of Polarization and Stokes Parameters","Polarization is a phenomenon observed in transverse waves. These are waves that vibrate in a direction perpendicular to their direction of propagation. Since light is a transverse wave, it can be represented as a sum of waves vibrating in (generally partially) random directions perpendicular to the line of propagation. If the vibration is consistently in a particular direction, the light is linearly polarized. Partial polarization of light usually occurs once the unpolarized light is reflected from a given surface or it has passed through a polarization filter.","The electric-field vector of a light wave traveling in the z direction can be represented as a composition of the electric-field vectors oscillating in the x-y plane.\n\ncos(\u03c8+\u03c6)+cos(\u03c8+\u03c6)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nIn equation (1), {circumflex over (x)} and \u0177 are unit vectors along the x and y axes, \u03c8=\u03c9t with \u03c9 being the radian frequency, \u03c6and \u03c6are the phases, while Eand Eare the magnitude of the electric-field in the x and y directions, respectively. For a monochromatic case, depending on the relative difference between the phase \u03c6and \u03c6, the transverse wave can be elliptically polarized if \u03c6\u2212\u03c6=constant, circularly polarized if \u03c6\u2212\u03c6=\u03c0\/2 or linearly polarized if \u03c6\u2212\u03c6=0.\n","The Stokes parameters presented by equations (2) through (5) below describe fully the polarization state of the electric-field vector E:\n\n>\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n\u2003\u2003(3)\n\n=2cos(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6)>\u2003\u2003(4)\n\n=2sin(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6)>\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nThese equations are the traditional representation of the Stokes parameters. Following the Stokes equations, the polarization state can also be described if the following three quantities are known: E, Eand \u03c6\u2212\u03c6. After some simple algebraic manipulations one can write:\n\nS=I\u2003\u2003(6)\n\n=2(0\u00b0,0)\u2212\u2003\u2003(7)\n\n=2(45\u00b0,0)\u2212\u2003\u2003(8)\n\n\u22122(45\u00b0,\u03c0\/2)\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nwhere Iis the total intensity; I(0\u00b0,0) is the intensity of the e-vector filtered with a 0 degree polarizer and no phase compensation between the x and y components; I(45\u00b0,0) is the intensity of the e-vector filtered with a 45 degree polarizer and no phase compensation as above; and I(45\u00b0, \u03c0\/2) is the intensity of the e-vector filtered with a 45 degree polarizer and \u03c0\/2 phase compensator between the x and y components. The first three Stokes parameters S, S, and Sfully describe the polarization of light with two linearly polarized intensities and the total intensity of the e-field vector. The fourth parameter describes the excess of right-circularly polarized component over the left-circularly polarized portion, which is less common in man-made and natural wave sources and it is not of interest in the present application. It is important to point out that for a partially polarized polychromatic light in nature, the measurement of the fourth Stokes parameter is not essential, since in these scenarios the phase between the two orthogonal components of polarization is usually statistically random. Therefore, for natural scenes, the first three Stokes parameters are usually of more interest, and thus only 3 independent measurements are needed in order to find the first three Stokes parameters.\n","Thus, in order to describe the polarization state of light in nature, three linear polarized projections or two linear polarized projections in combination with the total intensity are needed. The latter method is preferred for focal plane implementation since it only requires two thin film polarizers rotated by 45 degrees, patterned and placed adjacent to each other. The total thickness of the two-layer micro polarizer array can be around 20 \u03bcm, if a commercially available thin film polarizer is used.","Imaging Sensor and Micro-Polarizer Array Architectural Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","1","2","3","2","10","70","80","70","80","10","10","2","10","1","70","80","10"]},"An overview of the complete polarimetric imaging system of the invention is illustrated in .

Of course, the processing unit  also may be a digital processing unit if so desired. Also, the pixel elements  may be voltage mode active pixel sensors or current mode active pixel sensors (APS). Two thin film polarizers ,  are individually patterned and deposited on top of the imaging array  in order to form the pattern illustrated in . The thin film patterns and the photo pixel architecture allow for block parallel access of 2 by 2 pixels neighborhood. The polarization state of the pixel neighborhood is computed by scaling individual pixels according to the first three Stokes equations (6) though (8) as illustrated in .","As noted above, image processing at the focal plane can be implemented in the analog or digital domain. In the analog domain, these circuits can be implemented in the current mode as described by V. Gruev and R.

Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing, Vol. 49, No. 4, pp. 233-244, April 2002, or in the voltage domain by using switch capacitors circuits as described by Un-Ku Moon in \u201cCMOS high-frequency switched-capacitor filters for telecommunication applications\u201d IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 35, No. 2, pp. 212-220, February 2000. Both of these approaches have been extensively covered in the literature where more details on the advantages and disadvantages of each method can be found. Including an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a digital processing unit at the focal plane is another avenue of research in the system on a chip research community. In these architectures, multi-chip systems or a complicated digital system-on-chip are needed. Typically, the imaging and ADC is performed on one chip, while the computation is performed in the digital domain on a second chip as described by S.

Transistors M and M control the operational mode of the photodiode PD. These two transistors allow individual pixels to be reset sequentially. Hence, a single noise correction circuitry is used for the entire array and it bypasses the column fixed pattern noise problems which are associated with column parallel read out. Transistors M and M operate as linear transconductance amplifiers and they linearly convert the integrated voltage on the photodiode PD into two output currents. The output photo currents are presented on two separate column busses, labeled I and I, which are individually addressed via transistors M and M.","The linear photo current conversion is achieved by pinning the drain voltage of transistors M and M to V\u2212\u0394 voltage, while the reset voltage Vdd_reset is fixed to V\u2212\u0394\u2212V. Therefore, during the reset period of the pixel, the gate voltage of transistor M\/M will be a threshold voltage below the drain voltage and transistor M\/M operates in the linear mode. During the integration period, the gate voltage of transistors M and M will further discharge and transistors M and M will remain in the linear mode. Switch transistors M through M are designed with high aspect ratios in order to decrease the voltage drop across these switches and therefore retain linear output current characteristics of the photo pixel.","The drain voltage of transistor M\/M is pinned to V\u2212\u0394 via the second generation current conveyer circuit  shown in . This current conveyor circuit  is composed of a two-stage operational amplifier OA with a Miller compensation capacitor (not shown) operated in a negative feedback mode via transistor M.

The variations of the input terminal of the current conveyer circuit  over 10 \u03bcA input range is less than 1 \u03bcV.","The noise suppression circuitry of the invention is based on a known memory cell described by Hughes et al. in an article entitled \u201cSI: the Seamless SI Switched Current Cell,\u201d ISCAS '97, pp. 113-116, June 1997. The current memory cell (CDS)  comprises a coarse and a fine sub-memory cell. During the memorization stage of the coarse memory cell, charge injection error dependent on the input current level is introduced. These signal dependent charge injections are memorized in the fine memory cell and subtracted from the coarse memory cell. The final memorized current can replicate the original current with 12 bit accuracy.","The noise suppression of the photo pixel is performed in two steps. Initially, the integrated photo current is memorized in the current memory cell  for each Stokes parameter.

As shown in ), the thin film polarizer comprises an iodine-doped Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) layer , which acts as a dense array of thin microscopic wires. These microscopic wires are formed by mechanically stretching the polymer film, allowing the molecules of the PVA to align in the direction of stretching. The size of the thin microscopic wires has to be 1\/10th or smaller of the light's wavelength in order to behave as an effective polarizer. Hence, for blue light wavelengths or 450 nm wavelength, the distance between the microscopic wires should be on the order of 45 nm or less. The mechanically stretching of the polymer creates very good \u02dc10 \u03bcm thick polarization filters for the visible spectrum, with extinction ratios of 60 dB in the blue and green spectrum and 40 dB in the red spectrum. As shown in ), the PVA thin film  is placed between two 300 \u03bcm thick transparent Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) or polyethylene layers , . The CAB layers provide structural stability to the fragile and thin PVA layer .","In order to be able to manipulate the PVA layer , at least one of the protective CAB layers ,  must be removed. Since CAB is a form of acetate, it is therefore acetone soluble. Hence, the sample is submerged in an acetone bath for 30 minutes. One side of the sample is taped with an acetone resistant tape to a glass substrate. The tape provides acetone protection for the bottom CAB layer , which is necessary in order to have limited structural stability for the PVA layer . The sample is rinsed with de-ionized water (DI) in order to remove the softened CAB layer . The DI water also solidifies the CAB layer, upon which the sample is submerged in the acetone bath again. These two steps are repeated several times, until no residual CAB layer remains on the PVA as shown in ).","The bottom CAB layer  has two great disadvantages in contrast to its supporting purpose for the PVA layer . The high thickness of 300 \u03bcm would limit the incident angle of the impeding light wave. If the incident wave comes under a small angle with respect to an axes perpendicular to the PVA layer , the wave is filtered by one polarized filter and registered by another photodiode on the sensor. This would create erroneous results in the polarimetric computation. Hence, only waves parallel to the optical axes can be used in such a system, which would limit the field of view of the system. Another more serious problem of the CAB is its etching affinity to the RIE gases. As the PVA thickness tends to vary within a small area, exact timing of the etching procedure can not be determined. If the etching process is prolonged more than necessary, the optical properties of the CAB layer  will be strongly degraded. Therefore, the CAB supporting layer  is replaced with an SU-8 cross linked, hard baked (developed) photoresist, which is optically transparent and resistant during the etching process of the PVA . This is performed by spin coating an SU-8 photoresist  on top the PVA, exposing it to an ultraviolet source, developing and hard baking it. One important aspect of the SU-8 is that various thicknesses can be deposited on top of the PVA , ranging from submicron until 1 mm thickness, as shown in ).","The next step is to remove the bottom CAB layer  in order to be able to pattern the PVA layer . This step is similar as the initial step, where a repeated acetone bath and DI water rinsing is used. The final structure after this process is shown in ).","The remaining steps describe the patterning and etching process of the first layer of PVA  in accordance with invention. These steps are performed as follows:\n\n","The next step is to attach a second layer of PVA  and pattern it with the desired mask pattern. A couple of approaches were explored for this step. The most adequate steps are to place a layer of PVA  on top of the first layer  using SU-8 as an adhesion material. Following the adhesion procedure, the second layer of PVA  is patterned. These steps are described below:\n\n","Cold plasma or RIE has been widely used to modify or etch polymers. The etching process of polymers is linearly dependent on the concentration of the atomic-oxygen free radicals or on the number of oxygen atoms consumed during the etching process. Since the PVA is an unsaturated polymer, the etching process is represented as an addition to unsaturated moieties. The addition of oxygen to the unsaturated PVA creates a saturated radical with a weakened C\u2014C bond. Any subsequent attack by free oxygen radicals will break the bond, scission the saturated molecule and will create CO and CObyproducts (see Equation 11):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0057"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"19.81mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07582857-20090901-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In order to increase the etching rate of the PVA, the concentration of oxygen atoms must be increased. This is achieved with the addition of fluorine gases, such as CF, CF, CF, SFand others. In an experiment, CFwas used to enhance the etching rate of the PVA. The enhanced etching rate is due to increased density of electrons, as well as increased energies of electrons in the RIE. At the molecular level, the addition of fluorine atoms will weaken the C\u2550C bond of the PVA molecule and it will create a saturated radical prone to chain scission. The byproducts of this reaction are fluorinated ethane and ethylene derivative.","These stable fluorine products will remain on the surface of the PVA. If the concentration of the fluorine atoms is increased beyond a threshold, fluorinated ethane will have retarding effects on the etching rate due to its byproducts residuals on the surface of the PVA.

The electromagnetic wave (i.e. the light) that has an electric field perpendicular to the wires will go through the wire-grid while the wave whose field is parallel to the grid will be reflected. The metal pitch must be of the order of the wavelength and the wire width should be considerably smaller than the wavelength. This implies that advanced lithographic techniques are required to fabricate these wire-grid polarizers. Such wire-grid polarizers are commercially available in which the metal grid is sandwiched between two transparent plates, typically between a glass and plastic plate. These polarizers are uniform across their whole surface. For use as a micropolarizer in accordance with the invention, the inventors etch away part of the metal grid to form a mosaic of small (about 10 \u03bcm\u00d710 \u03bcm) wire-grid islands corresponding to the dimensions of the pixels. A second wire-grid, rotated by a certain amount (typically 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0) is etched in a similar fashion and glued on top of the first wire-grid such that the patterns are offset in a checker-board pattern, corresponding to the pattern shown in . A brief description of the steps involved in the etching of the wire-grid polarizers is given below with respect to .","As illustrated in , starting with a wire-grid polarizer including a metal grid  sandwiched between a transparent glass plate  and a Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) layer , the first step is the removal of the top protective CAB layer  which is usually a polymer () and ()). By immersing the top CAB layer  into acetone or another suitable solution one can easily remove this CAB layer . This will leave the metallic wire-grid  exposed as shown in ). Using standard lithographic techniques, a mosaic pattern is defined in the metal layer. To do this, a photoresist (positive resist is shown in the figure but a negative resist can be used as well)  is first deposited ()), and the resulting layers are soft-baked and exposed to UV light using a mask  that contains the pattern to be defined on the wire-grid ()). After developing the photoresist  ()), the exposed metal layer  is etched using dry etching techniques ()). Following etching of the metal layer , the photoresist is removed. This process is repeated for the second wire-grid polarizer, but the second wire-grid polarizer  is rotated by 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 (or an appropriate angle) compared to the first wire-grid polarizer . In a next step, a thin layer of SU-8 resist (or another suitable material)  is deposited on top of the etched wire-grid ()). The two wire-grid polarizers are then glued together as shown in ()) such that a pattern is formed as shown in . Next, the glass layers  and  on top and bottom are removed ()). This structure can then be aligned and glued on top of the underlying silicon chip.","Another method to form the wire-grid polarizer is to deposit a thin metal film directly on top of the silicon wafer or the chip. This can be done by sputtering, electron-beam evaporation or chemical vapor deposition. A typical metal is aluminum. Using advanced lithographic techniques that allow the definition of very small features, such as electron beam lithography, nano imprint lithography, shadow mark or any other suitable method, the thin metal layers are defined corresponding to the two polarization orientations (e.g. 0\u00b0 and 45\u00b0). A photoresist is deposited on the thin metal layer. Using lithography, one may define the desired pattern in the photoresist. After developing the photoresist, the underlying thin metal layer is etched to realize the finely spaced metal grids on top of the underlying pixels, corresponding to the pattern of .","Algorithmic Computation of the Stokes Parameters","The architectural design of the photo pixel and the addressing circuitry () allows for block-parallel access of 2 by 2 photo pixels. As shown in , the circuitry shown in  is applied to all four pixels within the window of polarimetric computation. The outputs from all four pixels are connected together in order to complete the computation of the Stokes parameters. The computation of the first three Stokes parameters can be generalized by the following equation (12):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0066"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","x"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mn":"4"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["a","i"]},{"mi":["I","i"]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":["for","x"]}},{"mn":["0","2"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"to"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"12"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["x ","i ","i "]},"Table I shows the general characteristics of the sensor chip in an embodiment of the invention.
