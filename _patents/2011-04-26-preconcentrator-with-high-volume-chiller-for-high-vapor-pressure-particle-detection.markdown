The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","Embodiments of the invention are in the field of particle detection and more particularly relate to detection of high vapor pressure particulates present in a high volume gas stream.","Trace chemical detection of explosives, i.e., the art of detecting explosive materials from minute quantities of vapor and\/or microscopic particles (hereinafter referred to as \u201cparticles\u201d), can be an important aspect of many physical security and contraband detection systems. In many applications, especially applications involving the general public such as airport passenger screening, swipe collection of particles via direct physical contact with the person or object to be screened for explosives is either too physically invasive or time consuming, so it is advantageous to base the collection process on air flows. But the particle material that is collected in such air flows is usually far more dilute than the detector is capable of measuring, and the air flow is often too large to be directly accommodated by the detector. These disparities give rise to preconcentrators, devices which take a trace sample of a material from a large incoming air flow and concentrate the material into a smaller volume before it is introduced into a trace detector.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,854,431 and 6,345,545 disclose single stage and multi-staged preconcentrators, respectively, for use in collecting particles from an air stream that passes over a person or object under observation. While these preconcentrators concentrate particles in a high volume gas flow for detection in a low volume gas flow, they are best suited to low vapor pressure (LVP) explosive detection. Recently however, high vapor pressure (HVP) explosives have come into more common use such that both LVP and HVP explosive detection is needed. A means to collect and preconcentrate HVP explosives is therefore desirable.","Apparatus and methods for collecting particles of both HVP and LVP target materials entrained in a large volume sample gas stream are described herein. A cold air supply is provided through large volume active cooling. The cold air supply is mixed with the sample gas stream to reduce the vapor pressure of the particles.","In one embodiment, an apparatus for collecting particles entrained in a sample gas stream includes a first duct to conduct a coolant gas stream at a first volumetric flow rate and a second duct to conduct the sample gas stream at a second volumetric flow rate. A chiller is coupled to the first duct to cool the coolant gas stream to a temperature below that of the sample gas stream. In embodiments, the chiller cools air from ambient conditions to 0-15\u00b0 C. with the volumetric flow rate of the cold air supply being at least equal to the volumetric flow rate of the sample gas stream.","An adsorption media in fluid communication with each of the sample gas stream and the coolant gas stream concurrently is to collect the particles entrained in the sample gas stream at a temperature below that of the sample gas stream, the adsorption media is further to be in alternate fluid communication with a third duct to transfer the particles from the adsorption media to a carrier gas stream having a third volumetric flow rate toward a downstream particle detector, the third volumetric flow rate being lower than the second volumetric flow rate. In further embodiments an adsorption media is heated in at least two stages, a first of which is below a threshold temperature at which decomposition products of the HVP particle are generated.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known methods and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, to avoid obscuring the present invention. Reference throughout this specification to \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, function, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrase \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, functions, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For example, a first embodiment may be combined with a second embodiment anywhere the two embodiments are not mutually exclusive.","Generally, HVP materials targeted for detection have vapor pressures of at least parts per billion (ppb) to parts to thousand. At these vapor pressures the material exits only as a vapor.  shows a vapor pressure chart for certain common explosive compounds (triacetone triperoxide (TATP), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), para-mononitrotoluene (p-MNT), 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB), nitroglycerin (NG), dinitrotoluene (DNT), ammonium nitrate (AN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol (PETN), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), and octogen (HMX)) grouped into high and low vapor pressure classes.

On the x-axis is the molecular weight, in amu, for the depicted explosive compounds. As demarked by  on , TATP, EGDN, p-MNT, DMNB, NG, DNT are classified herein as HVP explosives while AN, TNT, PETN, RDX, and HMX are classified as LVP explosives.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","205","207","200","210","215","205","205","205","220"]},"While the coolant gas stream may generally comprise any gas, in an embodiment, the coolant gas stream  is made up of air taken in at a cold air supply intake . The cold air supply intake  is preferably disposed a sufficient distance away from the source  so that the coolant gas stream is free of particulates targeted for detection by the apparatus . Collection of targeted particles at the cold air supply intake  is to be avoided to prevent adsorption of such particles onto the chiller's heat transfer surfaces  which would then risk cross-contamination of the adsorption media  between successive sources . At the cold air supply intake , air may be at ambient conditions such that for embodiments where the apparatus  is in climate controlled environments, the air is at a first temperature, T, which is approximately 25\u00b0 C. while relative humidity of the air is between about 20% and about 80%. In certain embodiments, the air may be filtered at the intake  and may also be dehumidified. In particular embodiments, clean dry air (CDA) is sourced at the intake . In alternative embodiments, the apparatus  includes a closed loop cold air supply such that intake  is coupled to a point in the cold air supply ducting downstream of the adsorption media  for a cold air supply that is at least partially recirculated (not depicted).","As further illustrated in , a first duct  is configured to conduct intake air across the chiller's heat transfer surfaces  at a first volumetric flow rate, Q, induced by a first impeller, such as blower . A second duct  is configured to conduct the sample gas stream , having a second volumetric flow rate, Q, induced by a second impeller, such as blower . The second duct  is in parallel with the first duct  upstream of the adsorption media  with the chiller  upstream of a union  joining the first and second ducts,  and  which is upstream or coincident with the adsorption media . The second duct  bypasses the heat transfer surfaces  en route to the adsorption media  to avoid particle adsorption on surfaces other than the adsorption media .","In embodiments, the sample gas stream  has a large volumetric flow rate Q, ranging from at least 1 liter\/second to 1000 liters\/sec, or more. The large Qis to accommodate sample collection from a large surface area source , such as a parcel, luggage, a person, an automobile, a shipping container, etc. In the exemplary embodiment where the source  is a person, Qis at least 50 liters\/sec and often 100 to 200 liters\/sec. The sample gas stream  is typically at ambient conditions (standard pressure and temperature) with a relative humidity ranging from about 10% to about 90%, or more, where the apparatus  is operated out of doors and from about 20% to about 80% where the apparatus is operated in climate controlled environments.","In embodiments, the coolant gas stream is conducted through the first duct  at a volumetric flow rate, Qwhich is on the same order as the volumetric flow rate of the sample gas stream (Q). Qis to be comparable to Qparticularly for embodiments where the air is at ambient conditions and subject to fluctuations in moisture content. In an embodiment, Qis at least equal to Qand in further embodiments may be between 1 and 3 times Qas a function of ambient conditions, particularly moisture content at the air intake . Hence, Qmay range from 1 to 3000 liters\/second, is preferably at least 50 liters\/second, and is in the 100-300 liters\/second range for an exemplary embodiment where the system  is disposed in a climate controlled environment (i.e., conditioned ambient air) and configured for collecting a sample from a human.","The chiller  is coupled to the first duct  and configured for cooling the large coolant gas stream volumetric flows described herein to a temperature, T, which is below the sample gas stream temperature T. In an embodiment the chiller  comprises any refrigeration means known in the art to be suitable for the volumetric flows, Q. Vortex tubes, and other means known in the art similarly adaptable only to relatively lower volumetric flows, are not well suited for the cooling the large volumetric flows of Qdescribe herein. As such, an active refrigeration means is preferred. In the exemplary embodiment, the chiller  cycles a refrigerant through compressed and expanded states, with the heat transfer surfaces  cooled by the refrigerant. In a particular embodiment, the heat transfer surfaces  comprise a heat exchanger, such as an air coil with the refrigerant on a liquid side and the coolant gas on an air side. In the exemplary embodiment, the chiller  is has a thermal rating sufficient to cool the coolant gas stream by at least 5\u00b0 C. relative to in intake temperature Tto approximately halve vapor pressures of the exemplary particles targeted for detection. In advantageous embodiments, the chiller  is has a thermal rating sufficient to cool the coolant gas stream by at least 10\u00b0 C. relative to in intake temperature T. In exemplary in-door embodiments, where a cold air supply intakes ambient air from a conditioned environment at an intake temperature Tof about 25\u00b0 C., the chiller  is has a thermal rating sufficient to provide a cold air supply temperature Tof between about 0\u00b0 C. and about 20\u00b0 C., with Tin the exemplary embodiment being between about 5\u00b0 C. and about 15\u00b0 C. for a Tof about 25\u00b0 C.","At the union  the first and second ducts  and  join. The union  may be upstream or coincident with the adsorption media . The union  may, for example comprises a T-fitting or Y-fitting. Any flow modifier may be adapted to the union  or in ducting between the union  and adsorption media  to improve Mixing of the sample gas stream  with the coolant gas stream . For example, laminar flow achieved in the second duct  for the sake of limiting deposition of particles on duct surfaces may be disrupted downstream of the union  for the sake of mixing the sample gas stream  with the coolant gas stream  to achieve the most significant vapor pressure reduction. In certain embodiments, the union  is disposed a distance upstream of the adsorption media  to provide a residence time, \u03c4, between the union  and the adsorption media  sufficient to reduce the sample gas stream  temperature Tby at least 5\u00b0 C. and thereby reduce target material vapor pressures by approximately half.","As illustrated, the adsorption media  is to be in fluid communication with each of the sample gas stream  and the coolant gas stream . The adsorption media  is to collect particles entrained in the sample gas stream  at a temperature, T, which is below that of the sample gas stream (T). The temperature Tis a function of the mass and energy balance between the sample gas stream  and the coolant gas stream concurrently introduced to the adsorption media  and is therefore subject to a variety of design choices. In the simplest case, where Qis approximately equal to Q, and the heat capacity of the respective streams is also approximately equal, Twill approximately average Tand T. Thus, were Qis approximately equal to Qwith Qcomprising cold air at 15\u00b0 C. and Qcomprising ambient air at 25\u00b0 C., T4 will be approximately 20\u00b0 C. with a volumetric flow rate, Q. of Q+Q(e.g., 2 liters\/sec-4000 liters\/sec with the exemplary flow rate of approximately 400 liters\/sec).","The adsorption media  may be any known in the art capable of conducting the volumetric flow, Qwith a pressure drop sustainable by the blowers  and  and further capable of collecting targeted particles entrained in the sample gas stream . In an embodiment, the adsorption media  is \u201cporous mesh\u201d defined herein to include other forms of porous structures, in addition to a mesh structure, including a metallic filter, a felt or felt-like mat of finely-drawn wires, a woven screen of metal wires, a porous foamed metal structure, a microporous metallic filter with microholes, and a felt-like mat of sintered metal wires. In particular embodiments, any of the materials described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,431 may be utilized as the adsorption media . In further embodiments, the adsorption media  further includes organic and\/or polymeric materials coated on a mesh substrate.","As further depicted in , a third duct  is configured conduct a carrier gas stream  toward a downstream particle detector  at a third volumetric flow rate, Q. A third impeller, such as blower , induces Qto be considerably lower than the second volumetric flow rate for purposes of preconcentration of both the HVP and LVP particles as they are subsequently desorbed from the adsorption media . The apparatus  includes flow diverters  coupled to the second and third ducts to alternately place the adsorption media in fluid communication with either of the second and third ducts to alternately transfer particles to the adsorption media  from the sample gas stream  and then transfer the particles from the adsorption media  to the carrier gas stream . The carrier gas stream  then transports the particles toward a chemical detector , such as, but not limited to, an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) or mass spectrometer (MS). As implementation details pertaining to the flow diverters , carrier gas stream , and chemical detector  may all be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,431, no further description of these components is provided herein.","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the apparatus  includes a bypass  upstream of the adsorption media . The bypass  functions to maintain a thermal load on the chiller  even when the sample gas stream  or adsorption media  are not coupled with the coolant gas stream . Absent the ability to control the thermal load on the chiller , the heat transfer surfaces  may ice over. The bypass  is operable in a first position to conduct the coolant stream through the first duct  toward the adsorption media  when the sample gas stream  is in fluid communication with the adsorption media . The bypass  is further operable in a second position to isolate the coolant stream  from the adsorption media  when the carrier gas stream  is in fluid communication with the adsorption media .","In a first embodiment where the union  is downstream of the flow diverter  coupled to the second duct  (e.g., as depicted in ), the bypass  may be a flow diverter which is controlled in concert with the flow diverters  to couple the coolant gas stream with the blower  downstream of the adsorption media . In an alternate embodiment, where the union  is upstream or coincident with the flow diverter  coupled to the second duct  (e.g., as depicted in ), the bypass  may further be incorporated into, or upstream of, the flow diverter  such that in a first position both the sample gas stream  and the coolant gas stream  are drawn through the adsorption media  and in a second position the coolant gas stream is exhausted to the blower  downstream of the adsorption media  or simply out the sample intake  or another pressure relief port (not depicted).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","300","305","242","205","230","220","205","220","220","305","220","220","205","241","310","215","235","310","205","215","205","220","220","205","205","220"]},"Generally, the total duration of both the operations  and  is between 4 and 8 seconds for the exemplary system employing a Qand Qthat are each at least 50 liters\/second and often to be in the range of 100-200 liters\/second, depending on the application. In embodiments, the duration of operation  may be about 1-2 seconds with the remaining majority of particle collection time spent at operation  in cases where both LVP and HVP particles may be adsorbed at the reduced sample stream temperature (T). Alternatively, the sequence of operations  and  may be such that the blower  is energized before the blower  to pre-cool the adsorption media .","At operation , the collection phase is terminated by denergizing the blower  and at operation , the coolant gas stream  is also diverted from the adsorption media , for example by actuating the bypass . Alternatively, the blower  may be denergized. With the collection phase completed, a desorption cycle is commenced at operation  by exposing the adsorption media  to the carrier gas stream . For example, in one embodiment, the carrier gas stream  is conducted across the adsorption media  in a direction parallel to a longest dimension of the adsorption media . In particular embodiments, operation  is commenced after diverting the coolant gas stream  at operation . The desorbed particles now entrained in the carrier gas stream  are then transported to the chemical detector  and the LVP and HVP particles transferred from the adsorption media  are analyzed at operation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","210","200","400","200","200","400"]},"The apparatus  further includes an adsorption media heater  to heat the adsorption media  to temperatures greater than a temperature of the carrier gas stream and thermally desorb the particles to the carrier gas stream while the adsorption media is in fluid communication with the third duct. Thermal desorption of the LVP and HVP particles from the adsorption media  is controlled in a manner which avoids generating appreciable levels of decomposition products, particularly of the HVP particles. In accordance with one embodiment, adsorption media heater  comprises a means to resistively heat the adsorption media . One advantageous implementation of such resistive heating is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,299,711. Other known heating means, such as lamp (radiative) heating, convective heating, inductive heating, etc. may also be implemented in a conventional manner to achieve a similar controlled thermal desorption of the LVP and HVP particles from the adsorption media .","In the exemplary embodiment, the adsorption media heater  is controlled, for example by way of the heating power supply , by an algorithm implemented in hardware (ASIC, FPGA, etc.) or software to incrementally heat the adsorption media  in stages with each heating stage having a predetermined dwell time at a predetermined temperature.  is a graph of adsorption media temperature over time for a staged transfer of HVP and LVP particles into a carrier gas, in accordance with certain embodiments.  is described concurrently with , which is a flow diagram illustrating staged adsorption media heating, in accordance with an embodiment. Operation of the apparatus  therefore is to follow the method  with the desorption phase (e.g., beginning with operation ) further including the staged heating operations illustrated in .","In an embodiment, the adsorption media heater  is to heat the adsorption media  at operation  to a first elevated temperature to desorb a HVP particle during a first dwell time. During operation , the adsorption media is held a temperature which is below a threshold temperature at which decomposition products of the HVP particle are generated. Subsequently, at operation , the adsorption media heater  is to heat the adsorption media  to a second elevated temperature to desorb a LVP particle during a second dwell time.","Referring to , the threshold temperature  may be predetermined as well as the dwell times  and  to permit desorption of one or more HVP specie during a first desorption stage. In , time (seconds) is plotted on the x-axis while the temperature of the adsorption media  is plotted on the y-axis. Three different heating curves, ,  and  are illustrated in . Heating curve  represents a flash heating which reaches a maximum elevated adsorption media temperature of about 200\u00b0 C. nearly instantaneously (approximately 0.3 seconds in certain implementations). The heating curve  represents a first controlled heating in which the adsorption media temperature is incremented by approximately 50\u00b0 C. in each of five distinct stages, each stage having a dwell time  of about 2 seconds. The heating curve  represents a second controlled heating in which the adsorption media temperature is incremented to just below the threshold  in a first stage (e.g., operation ) and then incremented to the maximum elevated adsorption media temperature in a second stage (e.g., operation ), with each of stage having a dwell time  of 2-3 seconds.","While the heating curve  can be expected to generate a significant amount of decomposition products associated the HVP particles. Both staged heating curves  and  are suitable for reducing the decomposition products associated various HVP particles. The staged heating curve  is advantageous where a time divided release of particles into the second carrier gas stream is further useful for improving resolution of the detector , for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,299,711. However, such time division of species can reduce overall apparatus throughput and where the adsorption media  forms a component of a first preconcentration stage that is followed by a second preconcentration stage (e.g., as depicted in ), specie differentiation affected in the first stage may be lost when all species are subsequently collected onto a second adsorption media. As such, the staged heating curve  is advantageous for avoiding decomposition of HVP particles while maintaining high system throughput.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","210","400","700","400","400","700"]},"In the illustrative embodiment, the apparatus  includes a second preconcentration stage employing a second adsorption media , downstream of a first preconcentration stage employing the adsorption media . Generally the second adsorption media  may be any of the embodiments described for adsorption media . The two stage preconcentration of the sample gas stream  may be implemented in part based on the multi-staged system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,345,545. As illustrated in , an output stage conducting the carrier gas stream  is coupled to an input stage duct  which is further coupled to a rotatable valve . Rotatable valve  is operable to alternately expose the second adsorption media  to the carrier gas stream  while in a first state and to expose the second adsorption media  to a second carrier gas stream  while in a second state (depicted).","The second preconcentrator stage further includes a vortex tube  through which a second coolant gas flow  (e.g., originating from a compressed gas source) is introduced while the rotatable valve  is in the first state. The vortex tube  thereby serves to reduce the temperature of the carrier gas stream  to promote particle adsorption at the second adsorption media . As the carrier gas stream  has the third volumetric flow rate, Q, which is substantially smaller than Q, the cooling capacity of a conventional vortex cooler is sufficient in the second preconcentration stage to reduce the temperature of the carrier gas stream  from a temperature elevated by heating of the adsorption media  (e.g., 100\u00b0 C.) during the first desorption phase (e.g., operation ).
