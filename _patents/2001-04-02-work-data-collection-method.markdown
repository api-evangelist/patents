{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a work data collection method, by which data on working conditions, especially data of workload on the worker, may be collected either in a light room or in a darkroom, and more may be collected.","2. Background Arts","It is conventional to collect data on the existing working conditions in a workplace, to make analysis based on the work data for the sake of improving work efficiency. A lot of methods have been developed for collecting the work data. The most primitive method is handwriting the work data on a note book, and thereafter inputting the work data in a data processing computer with reference to the note book. This method is apparently inefficient.","As a recent work data collection method, a data collector uses a bar code sheet having bar codes representative of job titles printed thereon, and reads a job title by scanning a corresponding one of the bar codes through a handy bar code reader at the start of a corresponding job in a workplace. At the end of that job, the data collector scans one of the bar codes that represents an end of job. The bar code reader has a clock and a memory incorporated therein, so the time when the bar code of the job title is scanned is recorded as a job start time on the memory, and the time when the bar code of the job end is scanned is recorded as a job end time on the memory. The data collector repeats scanning the bar codes at the start and end of each job in the same way, to record the job titles and the start and end times of the respective jobs in the memory of the bar code reader.","After collecting the work data in the workplace, the bar code reader is connected to a personal computer, to transfer the work data from the memory of the bar code reader to the personal computer. On the personal computer, the work data is monitored and, if necessary, corrected, or some data is added to the work data. Then, the work data is processed and analyzed for displaying results of analysis in the form of tables and graphs on the personal computer. If necessary, the results are printed out as hard copies.","On the other hand, there is a device for collecting and storing data of a biological factor of a person through a specific sensor, hereinafter called a biological sensor, continuously or at regular intervals. This biological data collecting device has often been used for collecting biological data in examining a training program for an athlete. In that case, the biological sensors are put on the athlete's body while the athlete is exercising according to the training program. After the athlete works out the training program, the biological data collecting device is connected to a personal computer, to transfer the stored biological data to the personal computer. On the personal computer, the biological data is statistically processed to analyze loads on the athlete during the exercise on the basis of a change of the biological factor with the time and other data like this.","The above described work data collection methods are usable for those cases where the jobs are done in a light room. But where the jobs are done in a darkroom, e.g. on dealing with photographic film, the above described work data collection methods are inconvenient. Because darkroom glasses or goggles are needed for observation in the darkroom, and the darkroom goggles make it hard to see things in hand clearly, it is difficult to scan the bar code on the bar code sheet or read the time on a wrist watch in the darkroom. Also because any apparatus that emits light is not allowed in the darkroom, neither personal computer with a back-lit display panel nor any kinds of lighting devices are usable for work data collection in the darkroom.","The above described biological data collection method may be applicable to collecting biological data from the worker as data representative of workload on the worker during the jobs, because the workload affects work efficiency. However, this idea has not yet been incarnated but in a tentative stage.","In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a work data collection method that is applicable to collecting work data in the darkroom as well as in the light room.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a work data collection method by which workload data is collectable.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a work data collection method comprises the steps of photographing through a video camera a series of different jobs done by at least a worker, to record video signal of the jobs on a memory device of the video camera; and inputting a break point signal in the video camera at each break point between the jobs, to record the break point signal on the memory device along with the video signal. The video signal and the break point signal may be transferred from the memory device of the video camera to a personal computer afterward.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a work data collection method comprises the steps of photographing a series of different jobs done by at least a worker through a video camera, to take a video signal of the jobs; recording the video signal on a memory device through a personal computer; and inputting a break point signal in the personal computer at each break point between the jobs, to record the break point signal on the memory device along with the video signal.","Since the break point signal is recorded along with the video signal of the jobs, it is easy to search the break points between the jobs, i.e. cue up the video signal at each break point, by use of the break point signal. Using an infrared video camera as the video camera makes it possible to collect work data of those jobs done in a darkroom.","By measuring workload on the worker during at least one of the jobs; and recording the workload data on a memory device in association with the video signal and the break point signal, it becomes easy to provide data of the workloads during the respective jobs and examine the relationship between the workload and the contents or sequences of the jobs.","By measuring environmental factors around the worker during at least one of the jobs and recording data of the environmental factors on a memory device in association with the video signal and the break point signal, it becomes easy to provide data of the work environments and use it for improving the work environments.","It is preferable to input job title data in the video camera or the personal computer concurrently with the break point signal, to record the job title data on the memory device in association with the break point signal, the job title data being representative of a job title predetermined for each of the jobs.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a work data collection method comprises the steps of displaying predetermined job titles on a display device connected to a personal computer, the display device being visible for a data collector while observing a series of different jobs done by at least a worker; selecting one of the displayed job titles through an input device connected to the personal computer, to enter job title data representative of the selected job title in the personal computer at each break point between the jobs; and recording the job title data on a memory device of the personal computer, along with data of time when the job title data is entered. Thereby, the job title data may be entered in the personal computer without the need for a video camera or a microphone.","According to still another aspect of the invention, a work data collection method comprising the steps of entering a job title as a sound signal through a microphone connected to a sound recording player having a clock function and a display section, at each break point between different jobs while the jobs are being sequentially done by at least a worker; recording the sound signal of the job title on a memory device of the sound recording player, along with data of an entrance time when the sound signal is entered, the entrance time being determined by the clock function of the sound recording player; and playing back a sound of the job title on the sound recording player, while displaying the entrance time of the played back job title on the display section. This method may be accomplished without bringing a video camera or a personal computer into the workplace.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a work data collection method comprises the steps of measuring time taken to accomplish each one of different jobs while the jobs are being sequentially done by at least a worker; measuring workload on the worker during each of said jobs; and recording data of the measured time and workload for each of the different jobs on a memory device. This method makes it possible to analyze the relationship between the work time and the workload, without the need for bringing a video camera or a personal computer into the workplace.","In the first embodiment shown in , a data collector  who observes a worker  doing a job in a darkroom  has a very small infrared video camera , an LCD device  and a microphone  on his or her head. The sensitivity of the video camera  is set at an infrared range, i.e., a wavelength range from about 1000 nm to about 30,000 nm. The LCD device  is so positioned on the head that the data collector  may look up at a screen of the LCD device . In order to prevent leakage of back-light of the LCD display , the data collector  wears a pair of darkroom goggles  over the LCD display . The darkroom goggles  are well known in the art, and enable observing a faint optical image as a light optical image, so the data collector  can observe the job of the worker  in the darkroom .","To a forward protruding end of the darkroom goggle  is attached a work environment sensor  for measuring illuminance, noise, temperature, humidity and other environmental factors in the workplace. The data collector  also has an earphone  on his or her ear. The infrared video camera , the LCD display , the microphone , the work environment sensor  and the earphone  are connected to a portable personal computer  with an image recording function. Besides, a hand switch board  and a biological sensor  are connected to this portable personal computer . The data collector  carries the portable personal computer  on his or her shoulder.","The LCD display  displays pictures as photographed through the infrared video camera  in a real time fashion, or a list of titles of the job to observe, and a clock. The microphone  is used for entering unlisted job titles as sound signals. The earphone  is for listening to acoustic responses from the portable personal computer  that is generated in response to some operations on the portable personal computer , e.g. an alarm.","The hand switch board  is provided with a pointing device for pointing one of the job titles listed on the LCD display  with a cursor, an enter key for entering the job title as selected by the cursor, and a signal input button for inputting a break point signal. Upon the signal input button is operated, the break point signal is recorded along with video data of the photographed pictures on a hard disc of the portable personal computer . The break point signal is used as a cueing signal for cueing up the head of each video data that corresponds to one job, so the break point signal is a sequential signal recognizable for video players. For example, a mark or a sound that is recorded in the screen is used as the break point signal. Where the sound is used as the break point signal, the break point signal may be entered through the microphone .","The biological sensor  is an infrared sensor in this embodiment, that measures body temperature of the worker . Because the body temperature rises when the job is busy, the body temperature may be used as a measure of workload on the worker. The workload affects the degree of fatigue and the working efficiency of the worker.","In a light room, the data collector takes off the darkroom goggle , and replaces the infrared video camera  with a compact video camera whose sensitivity is set at a wavelength range of visible rays (about 400 nm to about 700 nm) for ordinary photography. In that case, the work environment sensor  is separated from the darkroom goggles , and is put on the head or another part of the data collector .","Now the operation of the first embodiment will be described with reference to the flow chart of . Prior to the observation, the objects of the observation is specified, and the fineness of data to observe and other parameters are predetermined. As concrete exemplary of the objects of the observation, there would be redesigning the working process, or changing the number of workers disposed for the same job. Also the titles of jobs to observe are listed while defining the titles and classifying them according to some definition, and the job title list is input in the portable personal computer  in advance.","The data collector  first puts the portable personal computer  on the shoulder and the LCD display  on the head, and then puts on the darkroom goggle . Thereby, the LCD display  is covered with the darkroom goggle  in a light-tight fashion. Next, the data collector  puts the infrared video camera  on the head and the earphone  on the ear, and then turns on the portable personal computer . While holding the hand switch board  in the hand, the data collector  enters the darkroom .","In the darkroom , the worker  is doing a series of different jobs successively, whereas the data collector  observes through the darkroom goggle  the worker  doing the jobs, and starts photography by the infrared video camera  before the worker  starts the series of jobs. Simultaneously with the start of the initial job of the series, the data collector  inputs a first break point signal by operating the signal input button on the hand switch board .","Thereafter, the data collector  looks for the title of the job photographed at that time while having the job title list displayed on the LCD display . When there is the corresponding job title in the list, the data collector  operates the pointing device on the hand switch board  to place the cursor on that job title, and presses the enter key. Thus, the job title is recorded along with the video data on the hard disc of the portable personal computer . In this way, the data collector  photographs the jobs by the infrared video camera  while inputting the break point signal and the job title at each break point between the jobs, till all the jobs in the series are done. Among the break point signals, special signals may be used as the first and last ones to represent the initial and final jobs of the series respectively.","If the corresponding job title is not included in the job title list on the LCD display , the job title is entered as a sound signal through the microphone  at the break point for that job. The portable personal computer  converts the sound signal representative of the job title into character data and stores the character data along with the video data. As the infrared video camera  photographs the jobs, the work environment sensor  measures illuminance, noise, temperature and humidity of the workplace, and enters the measured values in the portable personal computer . The biological sensor  feeds data of the body temperature of the worker  in the portable personal computer .","In the light room, the infrared video camera  is replaced with the ordinary compact video camera, the darkroom goggle  is taken off, and the work environment sensor  is removed from the darkroom goggle  and is put on the head of the data collector . Thereafter, the same operations are carried out as in the darkroom .","After the video data, the break point signals, the job title data, the work environment data, such as illuminance and noise, and the workload data are entered as work data with respect to all the jobs in one series, the portable personal computer  is connected through a cable to a personal computer  that is preset for data processing, and the work data is transferred from the portable personal computer  to the data processing personal computer . The work data may be transferred through a removable memory media, e.g. DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) and RAM.","The data processing personal computer  is used for monitoring the work data on a display , to correct or add necessary work data items. By retrieving the break point signals, the work data may be quickly played back at any break point between the jobs.","Since the time during which the infrared video camera  operates is recorded along with the video data in the portable personal computer , the work time taken for each individual job may be calculated based on the operation time of the infrared video camera . Thereafter, the work data is transformed into graphs or tables on the display , so as to make studies and analyses about the work data, e.g. about the relationship between the job content and the workload. If necessary, a hard copy of the work data is printed out through a printer .","It is possible to input the job titles in the data processing personal computer  after the photography is completed. In that case, the job titles may be entered in the data processing personal computer  through a keyboard or a bar code reader that is connected to the data processing personal computer  and is combined with a previously prepared bar code sheet having a plurality of bar codes representative of the job titles. This configuration permits recording the job titles while monitoring the photographed pictures, so it is applicable to those cases where there are a large number of different kinds of jobs, or the contents of the jobs are difficult to recognize or discriminate, or it is difficult to select and enter the job title while observing the job, for example where the work time for the job is very short.","It is also possible to record the video data in an ordinary digital video recorder instead of the portable personal computer. In that case, the break point signals are also recorded on the memory medium incorporated into or attached to the digital video recorder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","14","15","20","12","22","30"]},"Where the data collector  is supposed to move around on a small electric car , a personal computer  installed in the car  may be used in place of the portable personal computer . It is possible to carry a video camera with a higher performance on the car instead of the compact video camera  on the head. It is also possible to use an automatic vehicle that carries the personal computer and other machines and moves along with the data collector . In the first and the present and following embodiments, the data collector may collect the work data in those workplaces where a plurality of workers cooperate. Also, in the following embodiments, the workers themselves can double as the work data collectors, like in the second embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["12","11","10","15","12","21","20"]},"At the conclusion of each job, the data collector  presses the enter key while placing the cursor on the corresponding job title. Then, end time data representative of the time of finishing the job is recorded along with the job title on the memory device of the portable personal computer . Where a plurality of different kinds of jobs are to be carried out in succession, the sequence of doing the respective jobs is previously checked out, and the job title of the next job is entered at the break point.","If the corresponding job title is not included in the job title list on the LCD display , the job title is entered as a sound signal through the microphone . In the light room, the data collector  takes off the darkroom goggle  and makes the same operation as in the darkroom .","In another embodiment shown in , the data collector  uses a sound recording player  in place of the portable personal computer . When the data collector  tells a job title to the microphone  at the start and the end of one job, the job title is recorded on a memory of the sound recording player  along with the time when the job title is recorded. The sound recording player  may displays the recorded time on an LCD panel  when the sound recording player  plays back the voice telling the corresponding job title.","After the job tiles of all jobs to observe are recorded in the sound recording player  at respective break points between the jobs, an operator enters job title data and break point time data in the data processing personal computer  by use of previously prepared bar code sheets  and  and a bar code reader  that is connected to the data processing personal computer . The bar code sheet  has bar codes representative of different job titles, whereas the bar code sheet  has bar codes for entering the time data. While playing back the sound recording player  and listening to the job title from the speaker of the sound recording player , the operator enters the job title by scanning a corresponding one of the bar codes on the bar code sheet  with the bar code reader . The operator also enters the break point time data by scanning those bar codes on the bar code sheet  with the bar code reader , which correspond to the job starting time displayed on the LCD panel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44","44"],"i":["a ","b ","c, ","d, ","e, ","f, ","g, ","h, ","i, ","j, ","k ","l ","m, ","n ","o ","a ","d, ","c ","m ","d, ","h ","n ","e, ","k ","o "]},"The bar code reader  may be a code-less type. In that case, data is transferred from the bar code reader  to the data processing personal computer  after the completion of scanning, by connecting the bar code reader  to the data processing personal computer  through a cable, or by use of infrared communication. It is also possible to use a signal collector that is previously connected to the data processing personal computer , and reads the work data from the bar code reader  automatically or upon a button operation when the bar code reader  is put on the signal connector, to transfer the work data to the data processing personal computer .","Instead of using the bar code sheet, it is possible to display the job titles on the display  of the data processing personal computer , for selecting appropriate ones from these job titles by means of a touch panel device or through the keyboard connected to the data processing personal computer . The same data collecting method as shown in  is applicable to work data collection in the light room, though the data collector does not use the darkroom goggles  in the light room.","It is alternatively possible to use different data collection methods for the darkroom and the light room. That is, work data is collected in the darkroom according to the embodiment shown in , using the sound recording player . In the light room, on the other hand, the data collector scans appropriate bar codes on the bar code sheet  at each break point between the jobs while observing the jobs. In that case, the bar code reader has a built-in clock, so the time when the bar code is scanned is recorded along with the corresponding work data. Thereby, the work data collected in the light room is transferred from the bar code reader to the data processing personal computer  through a connection wire or cable, infrared communication or the signal collecting device. So the labor for entering the work data in the data processing personal computer  is reduced as for the data collected in the light room.","In a further embodiment of the invention as shown in , the work data is collected in through a sound recording player  in the same way as described with respect to the embodiment shown in , but the sound recording player  is connected to the data processing personal computer  through a cable, to transfer the voice data of the job titles and the time data of the break points to the data processing personal computer . The transferred voice data is converted into character data through an appropriate function that is provided in the data processing personal computer , e.g. an application package. This method is used for the light room. It is possible to transfer the data from the sound recording player  to the data processing personal computer  through infrared communication or other device than the cable.","According to another embodiment a portable personal computer with an interactive voice response system is used, wherein the data collector says a job title \u201cX\u201d to a microphone, then the portable personal computer retrieves the job title \u201cX\u201d from a job title list that is entered previously. If there is the job title \u201cX\u201d in the job title list, the portable personal computer repeats the job title \u201cX\u201d. The data collector listens to the repeated voice from the portable personal computer through an earphone. When the data collector answers \u201cYES\u201d reply to the repeated voice at the start of each job, the job title is recorded as character data in a memory device of the portable personal computer, and the time when the job title \u201cX\u201d is recorded is concurrently recorded as time data of a break point.","If the said job title \u201cX\u201d is not registered in the job title list, the portable personal computer responds \u201cThe job title X is unlisted. Register the job title X?\u201d through the earphone. If the data collector says \u201cYES\u201d in reply, the job title \u201cX\u201d is added to the job title list. Thereafter when the data collector says the job title \u201cX\u201d again, the portable personal computer repeats the job title \u201cX\u201d then, so the data collector may answer \u201cYES\u201d at the start of that job, to let the personal computer store the job title \u201cX\u201d in the memory device along with the time data of that break point. Since the job titles are recorded after being confirmed in this embodiment, data input error is prevented. The same method is applicable to collecting work data in the light room. Because this embodiment may be illustrated approximately equivalently to , this embodiment is not illustrated in the drawings.","In an alternative, the data collector says a job title to record the job title in the sound recording player through the microphone, and thereafter turns on a voice switch of a voice clock at a break point between the jobs, to cause the voice clock to generate a voice saying the time of that break point, for recording the voice from the voice clock in the sound recording player through the microphone. It is possible to record the time of the break point prior to the job title.","Next, an embodiment shown in  will be described. In this embodiment, a worker  is equipped with more than one biological sensor, i.e. three biological sensors ,  and  on the head, on the back of his or her hand and on the hip in the illustrated example. Output signals from the biological sensors  to  are entered through a radio communication device , e.g. a blue tooth, into a portable personal computer . In that case, the portable personal computer  is equipped with a counterpart radio communication device to the radio communication device .","On the other hand, a data collector  to observe the worker  doing jobs has a work environment sensor , a very small video camera  and a goggle  on his or her head in a work area . An LCD display  is mounted inside the goggle , such that the data collector can look up the screen of the LCD display . The work environment sensor  may be put on the worker  or disposed on any appropriate locations in the work area , besides the data collector . In that case, the work environment sensor  remote from the data collector  is connected through a communication device to the portable personal computer . Like or equivalent elements are designated by the same reference numbers as used in the above embodiments, and the description of these elements are omitted.","For example, the biological sensors  to  are acceleration sensors that quantitatively determine the degree of workload on the basis of movements or physical displacements of the worker's head, hand and hip. Although the worker puts on only three biological sensors in the embodiment of , this is only for the sake of simplifying the explanation and the illustration. In practice, it is desirable for the worker to put as many biological sensors as possible on his or her body, e.g. on the shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle and so forth.","Besides the acceleration sensors, the biological sensors may be well-known gyroscopes or relative position sensors that use magnetic wave or electronic wave. A magnetic sensor for detecting relative positions of respective portions of the worker's body, or illumination sensor for measuring illuminance of the field of view may also be used as the biological sensor. According to the purpose, it is possible to use a sensor for measuring myogenic potential, pulses, heart beats, or brain wave. Besides the illuminance sensor, it is possible to use a temperature sensor, humidity sensor, gas density sensor or sound volume sensor. As for the infrared sensor that measures the body temperature, it is carried by the data collector to measure the body temperature of the remote worker. To measure the body temperature at different portions of the worker, a plurality of thermometers are put on the respective portions of the worker.","As the biological sensor, it is also possible to put a CCD camera with a super wide angle lens on the top of the worker while directing the camera upward, to calculate the direction of movement of the worker's head and the change of the direction quantitatively on the basis of image data picked up through the CCD camera. By use of data from the acceleration sensors on the worker's hand, leg and corporal portion, and data from a sensor detecting distances between these acceleration sensors, it is possible to obtain data showing the movement of the worker's body as a total, the movement of the worker's hands, the movement of the worker's legs, and which portions of the worker's body are overused.","It is known in the art that the number of blinks and winks of the worker, the movement of the eyeballs, the variation in worker's expression, the amount of movement of worker's gaze, and variation in brightness in the direction the worker is looking may be used as properties representative of worker's thinking and attention. Accordingly, it is possible to quantify data of these representative properties by photographing worker's face through a video camera.","It is also possible to provide specific marks on worker's hand, work, note book or the like, for recording whether these marks are included in designated positions in the image screen that corresponds to the field of view of the worker. Thereby, it becomes possible to record the frequency of worker's movements to look at a range around his or her hand during the respective job.","Furthermore, by providing sound volume sensors on worker's head and in the vicinity of worker's mouth, it is possible to obtain data of worker's voice and ambient sounds separately from each other, and check if any conversation is always held in the job. It is preferable to use such a data input device for the biological sensors that permits obtaining data from the worker without the need for contact with the worker, in view of the advantages that such sensors are easy to put on and take off, that data becomes less dependent on the wearing conditions of the sensors, and that mental pressure on the worker or invasion of worker's privacy from wearing the sensors are reduced. It is possible to use these non-contact type sensors in combination with contact type sensors, such as the myogenic potential sensor.","Data from the biological sensors  to  is stored in the hard disc of the portable personal computer  as attribution data for the respective jobs which are sectioned by the break point signals. It is possible to previously define judgement logic for comparison with threshold values and patterns that represent the degree and characteristics of the load, and stores the judgement data concurrently with the storage. For example, a preliminary observation is carried out once without setting any time limit for each job, and maximum values of the data obtained from the biological sensors on the respective jobs are defined to be the threshold values. If the data obtained in the observation on the actual job goes above the threshold value of that job, judgement data may be stored showing that the time limit for that job results a higher workload.","Now the operation of the embodiment shown in  will be described with reference to the flowchart of .","Prior to the observation, the objects of the observation is specified, and the fineness of data to observe and other parameters are predetermined. As concrete exemplary of the objects of the observation, there would be redesigning the working process, or changing the number of workers disposed for the same job. Also the titles of jobs to observe are listed while defining the titles and classifying them according to some definition, and the job title list is input in the portable personal computer  in advance. In addition, according to the purpose of the analysis, it is determined what kinds of biological sensors and environment sensors should be used, what the purpose of obtaining the data, how much sensors should be placed in which locations, and how to process the data, and the portable personal computer  is preset correspondingly.","The data collector  first puts the portable personal computer  on the shoulder and the LCD display  on the head, and then puts on the darkroom goggle . Thereby, the LCD display  is covered with the darkroom goggle  in a light-tight fashion. Next, the data collector  puts the infrared video camera  on the head and the earphone  on the ear, and then turns on the portable personal computer . While holding the hand switch board  in the hand, the data collector  enters the darkroom .","The data collector  observes the worker  doing a series of different kinds of jobs, and starts photography by the video camera  before the worker  starts the series of jobs.

The portable personal computer  converts the sound signal representative of the job title into character data and stores the character data along with the video data. As the video camera  photographs the jobs, the work environment sensor  measures illuminance, noise, temperature and humidity of the workplace, and enters the measured values in the portable personal computer . The biological sensors  to  supply the portable personal computer  with data of the body temperature of the worker , data of movements of the worker's head, hand and hip, and data obtained through the load judgement logic.","As exemplary of the workload data, temperature data detected through an infrared sensor includes prime data \u03b1 and \u03b2, as shown in , both showing changes in worker's body temperature with time during a job \u201cA\u201d, but measured under different conditions, e.g. a large restriction on time is imposed in one case, whereas the time restriction is not so hard in the other case. The temperature data also include prime data that show changes in worker's body temperature with time during each of different jobs A, B, C and D, as shown in . As for the data of relative positions of the respective body portions, that is detected for example through a magnetic sensor, or the data of displacement of the respective body portions, that is detected through the acceleration sensors, prime data representative of amounts of displacement in a time section for each job, e.g. variations in position and inclination to front, rear, left, right, up and down, and mean values and maximum values of the displacements are stored. Where the workload data is illuminance data in the direction of view field, prime data representative of changes in illuminance with time during each individual job and mean values as well as maximum values are stored. If a sensor measuring the blinks and winks or the movement of the eyeballs through a camera is used as the biological sensor, variations in blinking timing, in the number of blinks and in the time interval of blinks during each job are stored as workload data.","After the completion of the observation on the jobs, the portable personal computer  is connected through a cable to a personal computer  for data processing, for transferring the work data from the portable personal computer  to the data processing personal computer . The work data may be transferred through a removable memory media, e.g. DVD or RAM. The data processing personal computer  transforms the work data into graphs or tables and displays the graph or table on the display , so as to make studies and analyses about the work time and workload for each job. If necessary, a hard copy of the work data is printed out through a printer .","For analysis of the work data, the work data is tallied up for the respective jobs in a process, and the content of each job is analyzed. In the analysis for each job, it is usual for the analysis with the job title and time to use tables in which a mean time, a total time and a ratio to the total time are obtained for each job title, and a Pareto diagram in which the job titles are arranged in a sequence from the longest total time, as shown in . By displaying a graph showing the workload data, as shown in , in addition to the graph of , it is possible to show characteristics of the process and get priorities right for improvement in working conditions with respect to each job. According to the example shown in , the job titled \u201cA\u201d is largely affected by the time restriction, and the illuminance in the direction of the view field is high for a longest time in this job. That is, the job \u201cA\u201d is to input data while staring in a CRT display with a relatively high brightness, and thus the workload is very high. On the contrary, the job \u201cB\u201d is not largely affected by the time restriction, and the total work time is short, through the illuminance in the direction of the view field is high. Therefore, the workload of the job \u201cB\u201d in total may be considered to be relatively low.","For analysis of job sharing and timing, it is usual to display the contents of jobs in a time sequential fashion in the form of a man-machine chart or Gantt chart, as shown in . By displaying a chart showing the workload data obtained by the length of high illuminance time period in the view field direction, as shown in , in addition to the Gantt chart, it is possible to show the viewpoints for improvement in the job sequence and shares. In these charts, the time is the work time, and the total work time is  hours in this instance.","According to the data analysis based on the charts shown in , a worker W does a constant speed job, a job to be done at an approximately constant speed, in a process with heavy restriction of time, so the workload is highly dependent upon time. Since the high illuminant time in the view field direction is short, the worker's attention or carefulness is also dependent upon time. On the other hand, a worker W is less affected by the time restriction, but the workload on the eyes may be judged to be large in view of the data of illuminance in the view field direction. The worker W is presumed to be in charge of a job that requires the worker to stare in a bright object, like a display or an inspection box (Schaukasten).","Furthermore, by entering those data in the PERT (Program Evolution And Review Technique) software that represents restrictions applied by installations onto the movement and the sequence of jobs, so as to display workload conditions in combination, as shown in , it is possible to provide a Gantt chart showing the offset in work time or in workload as the results of job allocation in the process. In , hatched sections  represent jobs with relatively high workload, dotted sections  represent jobs with relatively low workload, and blank sections  represent standby state.","In the illustrated example, the worker W, W and W do the respective jobs in an installation E during the first two third and more of a total work time T, and then in another installation F almost during the last one third of the total work time T. The worker W is busy working through the total work time T. The worker W is in the standby state in the first half of the total work time T, and starts a job with a low workload from the last half of the job in the installation E, and gets busy after shifting to the job in the installation F, but comes into the standby state in the last half of the job in the installation F. The worker W is in an easy condition with the standby state and the easy job during the job in the illustration A, but gets busy immediately before shifting to the installation F, and then comes to the standby state in the last half of the job in the installation F. In view of this situation, it is easy to think of an improvement that the worker W and W whose workloads have been very low can share the job of the worker W at least in the first half of the total work time T. In this example, the total work time T is one hour.","By use of the workload data and dividing the jobs into several segments, it is also possible to express the characteristics of the process by the number of jobs and the total time in each segment. For example, standards for discrimination between large, middle and small values of the workload data about each job are determined to sort the data for each job. It is also possible to divide the data into segments by combining the data with one another, or rank the jobs by use of total indexes that are obtained by weighting the load data. Analyzing the job in this way makes it easy to find out those jobs which should be inspected and improved.","The following Table 1 shows the ranking of jobs P, Q, R and S in view of the workload, along with the work time ratio and the frequency. Table 2 and Table 3 show the work time ratio and the frequency of the workloads of the respective ranks, with respect to different workers W and W.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

this way, characteristics of the job may be compared and analyzed with respect to each process or with respect to each worker, for the sake of distributing or equalizing the workload on the workers, or examining how to assign the jobs to the workers according to their skills, or setting goals for improvement in job quality.","For instance, because the data is previously sectioned by each job in Table 1, it is easy to pick up only those data which relate to the aimed job from among the data of all jobs. If there are a plurality of data pieces for the same job title, these data pieces may be compared to each other or tallied up.

For example, as for the job P in Table 1, the starting time, the ending time, the requisite time duration, changes or progresses in movements of respective portions of the worker's body, direction of the movements, mean values and maximum values of the moved amounts, changes with time in illuminance in the view field direction, a mean value and a maximum value of the illuminance, changes with time in body temperature in the view field direction, a mean value and a maximum value of the body temperature, and other data are shown in a lookup table. Based on the lookup table, it is possible to analyze how the workloads in the job P affect the worker, and find out necessary points for improvements in the facilities or in the working method, including job collaboration.","Specifically, it becomes possible to eliminate, combine, rearrange and simplify the jobs by optimizing load allocation during the work time and among respective workers in a collective work, by optimizing job allocation to unskilled workers, by extracting problems in calculating wages per unit job, in frequency of the workload, and in the progress of the workload with time, and by applying such viewpoints for improvement that is a kind of Industrial Engineering (IE) to examining the workloads.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIGS. 9 to 17"],"b":["68","30","69","63","65"]},"Although the break point signal is entered by means of the hand switch board in the above embodiment, it is possible to predetermine the break point as a time when a particular mark comes in the view field, or by a particular sound from an installation during the process, so that the break point signal may be automatically entered. This embodiment allows to substitute a robot or the like for the data collector .","It is not always necessary to actuate the environment sensor and the biological sensors in cooperation with the video camera, but these sensors may operate independently. Although the workload is measured through the biological sensor in the above embodiments, the data collector may judge the degree of the workload on the worker from the observation, and input the degree of the workload through an appropriate data input device, such as a bar code reader in the workplace or while observing the photographed video pictures afterward.
