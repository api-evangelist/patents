title: Methods for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using pro-neurogenic compounds
abstract: This technology relates generally to compounds and methods for stimulating neurogenesis (e.g., post-natal neurogenesis, including post-natal hippocampal and hypothalamic neurogenesis) and/or protecting neuronal cell from cell death. Various compounds are disclosed herein. In vivo activity tests suggest that these compounds may have therapeutic benefits in neuropsychiatric and/or neurodegenerative diseases such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, normal aging, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, stroke, radiation therapy, chronic stress, abuse of a neuro-active drug, retinal degeneration, spinal cord injury, peripheral nerve injury, physiological weight loss associated with various conditions, as well as cognitive decline associated with normal aging, chemotherapy, and the like.

However, it was long thought that no new neurons could be added to the adult mammalian brain. This dogma was challenged in the 1960's when autoradiographic evidence of new neuron formation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex of the adult rat was presented (Altman, J. Science 1962, 135, 1127-1128; Altman, J. J Comp Neurol 1966, 128:431-474; Altman, Anat Rec 1963, 145:573-591; Altman and Das, J. Comp. Neurol. 1965, 124, 319-335; Altman and Das, J Comp Neurol 1966, 126:337-390). It is now accepted that within all mammalian species, including humans (Eriksson et al., Nat. Med. 1998, 4(11), 1313-1317), there are two major reservoirs of neuronal stem cells, one located in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and another in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Gross, Natl. Rev. 2000, 1, 67-72). Neural stem cells in the SVZ facilitate formation of new neurons that migrate rostrally to populate the olfactory bulb, while neural stem cells in the SGZ produce neurons that integrate locally in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, a region of the hippocampus that exhibits lifelong structural and functional plasticity.","The process of new neuron formation in the adult mouse brain can be influenced by environmental, chemical and genetic variables. As demonstrated by Gage and colleagues, neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain is enhanced when animals are exposed to an enriched environment (Kempermann et al., Nature 1997, 386, 493-495) or able to exercise voluntarily (van Praag et al., Nat. Neuro-sci. 1999, 2, 266-270). More recently, antidepressant drugs have been shown to enhance levels of adult neurogenesis in animals, including humans (Schmidt et al., Behav Pharmacol. 2007 September; 18(5-6):391-418; Boldrini et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 2009, 34, 2376-2389). Among many genes reported to impact adult neurogenesis is the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3), a central nervous system (CNS)-specific transcription factor that has been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Kamnasaran et al., J. Med. Genet. 2003, 40, 325-332; Pickard et al., Am. J. Med. Genet. B. Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 2005, 136B, 26-32; Pickard et al., Ann. Med. 2006, 38, 439-448; Pickard et al., Mol. Psychiatry. 2009, 14, 874-884; Lavedan et al., Pharmacogenomics 2008, 9: 289-301). Animals missing both copies of the NPAS3 gene suffer a profound loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis coupled with significant behavioral deficits (Pieper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005, 102, 14052-14057). Knowing that impaired post-natal neurogenesis elicits unfavorable phenotypic deficits, it is predicted that pro-neurogenic chemical compounds should exhibit favorable therapeutic benefits.","This invention relates generally to compounds that promote the generation or the survival of existing neurons in the mammalian brain. For the purpose of simplicity these compounds are referred to as being pro-neurogenic. In certain embodiments, the compounds promote the generation or survival of neurons in the post-natal mammalian brain. In certain embodiments, the compounds promote the survival, growth, development and\/or function of neurons, particularly CNS, brain, cerebral, and hippocampal neurons. In certain embodiments, the compounds stimulate post-natal hippocampal neurogenesis, which while not wishing to be bound by theory, is believed to represent a therapeutic target for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including (but not limited to) schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, normal aging, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, stroke, radiation therapy, chronic stress, abuse of neuro-active drugs (such as alcohol, opiates, methamphetamine, phencyclidine, and cocaine), retinal degeneration, spinal cord injury, and peripheral nerve injury. In certain embodiments, the compounds stimulate post-natal hypothalamic neurogenesis, which can provide therapeutic benefits in weight management, such as physiological weight loss associated with various conditions, including but not limited to, normal aging, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stress, drug abuse, anorexia, as well as other diseases discussed herein.","The presently disclosed embodiments also feature compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) that include such compounds as well as methods of making, identifying, and using such compounds.

It is also understood that the presently disclosed embodiments encompass all possible regioisomers, and mixtures thereof, which can be obtained in pure form by standard separation procedures known to those skilled in the art, and include, but are not limited to, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography.","The compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments include the compounds themselves, as well as their salts and their prodrugs, if applicable. A salt, for example, can be formed between an anion and a positively charged substituent (e.g., amino) on a compound described herein. Suitable anions include chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, citrate, methanesulfonate, trifluoroacetate, and acetate. Likewise, a salt can also be formed between a cation and a negatively charged substituent (e.g., carboxylate) on a compound described herein. Suitable cations include sodium ion, potassium ion, magnesium ion, calcium ion, and an ammonium cation such as tetramethylammonium ion. Examples of prodrugs include Calkyl esters of carboxylic acid groups, which, upon administration to a subject, are capable of providing active compounds.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. As used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a salt formed by the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to a compound disclosed herein. As used herein, the phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d refers to a substance that is acceptable for use in pharmaceutical applications from a toxicological perspective and does not adversely interact with the active ingredient.","Examples of suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(alkyl) salts. The presently disclosed embodiments also envision the quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization. Salt forms of the compounds of any of the formulae herein can be amino acid salts of carboxyl groups (e.g. L-arginine, -lysine, -histidine salts).","Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418; Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977); and \u201cPharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use A Handbook\u201d; Wermuth, C.

The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the presently disclosed embodiments.","In addition to salt forms, the presently disclosed embodiments provide compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be more bioavailable by oral administration than the parent drug. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmacological compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the presently disclosed embodiments which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound of the presently disclosed embodiments.","The presently disclosed embodiments also include various hydrate and solvate forms of the compounds.","The compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (H), iodine-125 (I) or carbon-14 (C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the presently disclosed embodiments.","Synthesis","The compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can be conveniently prepared in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Examples section, from commercially available starting materials, compounds known in the literature, or readily prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic methods and procedures known to those skilled in the art. Standard synthetic methods and procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and functional group transformations and manipulations can be readily obtained from the relevant scientific literature or from standard textbooks in the field. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures. Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis will recognize that the nature and order of the synthetic steps presented may be varied for the purpose of optimizing the formation of the compounds described herein.","Synthetic chemistry transformations (including protecting group methodologies) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. C. Larock, 2d. ed., Wiley-VCH Publishers (1999); P. G. M. Wuts and T. W. Greene, 4th Ed., John Wiley and Sons (2007); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, , John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., , John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof.","The processes described herein can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., H or C), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), or mass spectrometry (MS), or by chromatography such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC).","Preparation of compounds can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in Greene, et al., 2d. Ed., Wiley & Sons, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out in suitable solvents which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially nonreactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, i.e., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvents. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected.","Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes preparation of the Mosher's ester or amide derivative of the corresponding alcohol or amine, respectively. The absolute configuration of the ester or amide is then determined by proton and\/or F NMR spectroscopy.

The cold bath was removed immediately upon completion of Red-A1 addition. The reaction was allowed to warm slowly to about \u221223\u00b0 C. at which time the reaction flask was transferred to a heating block. The reaction flask was heated until the internal temperature was 59.3-62.0\u00b0 C. Heating was continued for an hour, and then the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature over 30 minutes. Analysis by HPLC\/MS-ESI revealed the following: 92% consumption of SM, 75% product (N-(3-(3,6-dibromo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-2-fluoropropyl)-3-methoxyaniline), 1% carbazole and 7% des-bromo decomposition products, 3% N-(3-(3,6-dibromo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl)-1,1,1-trifluoro-N-(3-methoxyphenyl)methanesulfonamide and less than 5% elimination products (P7C3-S179). The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed with water until white solid Al salts were no longer observed. The organic layer was then washed with 6M HCl a few times until yellow precipitate formed. The hydrochloride salt was filtered to give 3.60 g (85% yield). This salt formation removes the carbazole decomposition product, unreacted SM and some elimination products from the crude reaction mixture. The salt was free-based by vigorously stirring in a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride and saturated bicarbonate solution until a translucent two-phase mixture was obtained. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with methylene chloride. The combined organics were dried over MgSO, filtered and condensed to give a solid that contained the des-brominated product as a minor impurity (ca. 3%). The solid was washed several times by stirring successively overnight in 40% EtO\/hexanes and 30% DCM\/hexanes and filtering the solid. For the final purification, solids from 3 reactions (19.5 g triflate SM total) were combined and assessed at 96% purity.

efficacy\/neuroprotection in our standard in vivo assay at 10 \u03bcM concentration in four 12 week old adult male C57\/Bl6 mice.","The (+) (dextrorotatory) enantiomer of 1-(3,6-Dibromo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenylamino)-propan-2-ol as described herein exhibited higher activity.","The (\u2212) (levorotatory) enantiomer of 1-(3,6-Dibromo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenylamino)-propan-2-ol as described herein exhibited lower activity.","Previously, a commercial sample of P7C3-S229 was tested in the neurogenesis assay and found to be indistinguishable from vehicle when dosed intracranially as a 10 micromolar solution (MacMillan et al., 2011; (133):1428-1437). Subsequently, a separate sample was independently synthesized and tested analogously, and found to be active. While there may be many reasons for this discrepancy, without wishing to be bound by theory, it has been hypothesized that possible explanations include: 1) The identity of the commercial sample was not rigorously confirmed; it may have been a different substance. 2) The purity of the commercial sample was not rigorously confirmed; an impurity may have counteracted the pro-neurogenic activity of the commercial sample. 3) P7C3-S229 displays low solubility. Slight variation in the formulation of different samples or the physical characteristics of the sample (e.g. crystalline vs. amorphous solid) may have resulted in differences in exposure in the in vivo experiment.","It is also believed that P7C3-S295 (Example 219), based on the structure, can have high biological activity (e.g., in the pro-neurogenic efficacy\/neuroprotection assay in mice models described herein). Additional experiments (in vitro and in vivo) are underway to further characterize the effect of P7C3-S295 in disease models described herein.","Identification of Pro-Neurogenic or Neuroprotective Compounds:","In an effort to identify compounds that might stimulate the birth of new neurons, or protect newborn neurons from cell death, a library of 1,000 compounds was screened using an in vivo assay. In the initial screen, compounds were randomly pooled into groups of ten and administered intracerebroventricularly at a constant rate over seven days into the left lateral ventricle of living mice via Alzet osmotic mini-pumps. Compounds were administered at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM for each molecule, making a total solute concentration of 100 \u03bcM. After seven days of infusion at a constant rate of 0.5 \u03bcL\/hour, a total of 84 \u03bcL of volume will have left the pump (0.00084 \u03bcMoles) and entered the cerebrospinal fluid. The average volume of a brain from a 12 week old male, C57\/B6 mouse in our study is 500 mm. The maximal amount of drug was estimated that could potentially be present in the brain, taking the extreme and unlikely scenario of 100% absorbance of the drug into brain tissue and 0% clearance throughout the seven day infusion period. Under these conditions, at the end of one week of infusion each compound would be present at 1.7 \u03bcMolar concentration. Since the actual amount of chemical compound in the brain is likely to be only a fraction of this predicted level, it is reasonable to estimate that compounds were administered at mid to low-nanomolar concentrations.","During compound infusion, animals were intraperitoneally (IP) injected daily with the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), as a means of scoring the birth and survival of proliferating neural precursor cells in the hippocampus. Because both social interaction and voluntary exercise are known to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis, mice were housed individually without access to running wheels throughout the screening period. Following the week-long period of compound administration, animals were perfused and sacrificed. Dissected brain tissue was fixed, embedded, sectioned, stained with antibodies to BrdU, and evaluated by light microcopy as a means of quantifying neurogenesis and survival of newborn neural precursor cells localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus on the brain hemisphere contralateral to the side of mini-pump cannulation. Every fifth section throughout the entire rostral-caudal extent of the hippocampus was analyzed, and the total number of BrdU+ cells was normalized against the measured volume of the dentate gyrus. Because both increased proliferation and survival of newborn neurons are important screening parameters, the screen was conducted over seven days in order to cast a wide net to detect molecules that might augment either process. The choice of parameters for the screen was based on pulse-chase experiments with a single injection of BrdU, under identical conditions to those used in our screen, which revealed that 40% of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus die within the first five days of their birth (). Intracranial infusions of either fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) or artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) vehicle via the same, week-long protocol were employed as positive and negative controls. There was no difference in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus between mice subjected to surgical pump implantation and infusion with vehicle, and mice having had no surgery (). This confirmed the validity of the in vivo approach to assess the ability of intracerebroventricularly infused compounds to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the contralateral hemisphere.","Considered to be important is that stimulation of neurogenesis triggered by any compound be localized to the exact region of the brain known to produce new neurons at an enhanced level in response to healthy activities such as wheel running, access to an enriched environment, or access to social interaction. For this reason attention was focused solely on compound pools that stimulated BrdU incorporation only in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Prominent nonspecific incorporation of BrdU in ectopic regions, such as CA3, CA1, cortex, or striatum, was presumed to reflect pathological inflammation, as proliferating cells incorporate BrdU in DNA synthesis, or to indicate other forms of toxicity, as cells also incorporate BrdU during DNA repair. Any compound pools yielding ectopic BrdU incorporation were eliminated from the screen. For an example, see .","Each of the 100 pools was tested on two independent mice. As shown in , ten of the 100 test pools were observed to enhance dentate gyms-specific neurogenesis to an extent roughly equivalent to FGF-2. Each pool that scored positive in the initial two test animals was subsequently re-evaluated in two additional mice, and all ten pools were found to exert their pro-neurogenic effect with statistical significance (). In order to identify single, pro-neurogenic compounds, positive pools were broken down into their ten component molecules, each of which was infused individually at two concentrations (10 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM) in two mice per concentration.  shows the results of break-down assays on pool #7, wherein it was discovered that neurogenesis was selectively stimulated by one of the constituent chemicals of the pool (compound #3), chemicals in the pool demonstrating no effect. This molecule was designated as Example 45 Compound or P7C3. In breaking down the ten positive pools, eight pools yielded a single pro-neurogenic compound (). To ensure that the pro-proliferative or neuroprotective effect on neural stem cells was not an artifact of storage conditions in the UTSWMC chemical compound library, re-supplied compounds were verified to by 99% pure by mass spectrometry, evaluated in 4 mice each at 10 \u03bcM concentration, and shown to retain either pro-proliferative or neuroprotective properties in neural stem cells ().","Pharmacokinetic analysis of Example 45 Compound in plasma and whole brain tissue was undertaken after single IV, IP and oral gavage administrations. Example 45 Compound was noted to be orally bioavailable, readily able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and endowed with a plasma terminal half life of 6.7 hours after IP delivery. These favorable pharmacological properties facilitated a dose response experiment wherein daily oral administration of Example 45 Compound to adult mice was monitored for both brain levels of the chemical and pro-neurogenic efficacy (). Maximal, pro-neurogenic efficacy was observed at oral doses of 5 mg\/kg and above, and graded reductions in efficacy were observed at doses of 2.5 and 1 mg\/kg. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the brain levels of Example 45 Compound in the dose ranges of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg\/kg revealed corresponding compound concentrations of 213 nM (1010 ng\/g brain tissue), 1.13 \u03bcM (534 ng\/g brain tissue) and 1.35 \u03bcM (640 ng\/g brain tissue) five hours after dosing.","Enantiomer Selective Activity of Example 45 Compound Derivatives:","In order to further study Example 45 Compound, an in vivo structure activity relationship (SAR) study was conducted using 37 chemical derivatives of the compound for pro-neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. Compounds were administered for one week at 10 uM into 4 mice per compound, along with daily IP injections of BrdU. Following compound administration, animals were perfused, sacrificed and subjected to sectioning, staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Roughly 10% of the variant compounds retained pro-neurogenic activity indistinguishable from the parent compound. An approximately equal number of compounds yielded slightly diminished activity, yet the majority of variants were of significantly diminished activity (). For example, a variant of Example 45 Compound having a methoxy substitution on the aniline ring (Example 62 Compound) was re-tested for pro-neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. The compound was administered for one week at 10 \u03bcM into 4 mice which were injected daily with BrdU. Following compound administration, animals were perfused, sacrificed and subjected to sectioning, staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. The methoxy derivative exhibited activity comparable to Example 45 Compound. Subsequently, the (+) and (\u2212) enantiomers of Example  Compound were prepared (). The two enantiomers were evaluated in the in vivo neurogenesis assay. The (+)-enantiomer of Example 62 Compound retained potent pro-neurogenic activity, and the (\u2212) enantiomer displayed diminished activity (). Other derivatives have also been resynthesized and retested, as described above.","The nature of the cells produced in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus was investigated when Example 45 Compound was administered as follows. Animals were exposed to oral administration of Example 45 Compound for 30 days. Brain tissue was then prepared for immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated protein that serves as a marker of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by virtue of transient expression in newly formed neurons, but not glial cells, between the timing of their birth and final maturation (Brown et al., 2003). As shown in , the relative abundance of doublecortin-positive neurons increased dramatically as a function of exposure to prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound. Although this observation does not rule out the possibility that the compound might also enhance the formation of glial cells, it clearly shows that Example 45 Compound enhanced the formation of cells destined to become neurons.","Example 45 Compound-mediated neurogenesis was next investigated to see whether it was attributable to increased cell proliferation or protection of newborn cells from cell death during the time between their birth and eventual incorporation into the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. This was accomplished by comparing the ability of Example 45 Compound to enhance either short- or long-term increases in the incorporation of BrdU in the dentate gyms (). Animals exposed to orally-delivered Example 45 Compound or vehicle for 30 days were administered a single pulse of BrdU via IP injection. Short-term effects on neuron birth were monitored by sacrificing animals one hour post-BrdU injection, followed by fixation of the tissue, sectioning and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU incorporation into cells localized in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Example 45 Compound administration did not lead to an elevation in the level of BrdU-positive cells relative to vehicle in this short-term assay. At one day after BrdU administration both groups still showed no statistically significant differences in number of BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyrus. By contrast, at the 5 day time point, by which time 40% of newborn cells in our assay normally die (), animals that received Example 45 Compound showed a statistically significant, 25% increase in BrdU+ cells compared to the vehicle-only control group. This difference between groups progressed with time such that mice that received a daily oral dose of Example 45 Compound for 30 days starting 24 hours after the pulse treatment of BrdU exhibited a 5-fold increase in the abundance of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus relative to vehicle-only controls. Notably, in this longer-term trial, BrdU-positive cells were observed not only along the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms where new neurons are known to be born, but also within the granular layer itself. It is hypothesized that these cells represent mature neurons that have migrated into the granular layer, completed the differentiation process, and incorporated themselves into the dentate gyrus as properly wired neurons. Observations supportive of this interpretation will be presented in a subsequent section of this document. In summary, these experiments give evidence that Example 45 Compound enhances the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus, and that its mode of action would appear to take place at some point subsequent to their birth.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described cell proliferation tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Mice lacking both copies of the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) suffer a profound impairment in adult neurogenesis (Pieper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005, 102, 14052-14057). By evaluating BrdU incorporation in a short-term assay of neurogenesis by sacrificing animals 1 hours after BrdU pulse, it was observed that NPAS3-deficient animals have no detectable deficit in the birth of neurons in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus (). This is in contrast to our earlier observations of profoundly diminished BrdU labeling in the dentate gyrus of NPAS3-deficient animals when BrdU is administered for a longer period of time (12 days) (Pieper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005, 102, 14052-14057). Knowing that the NPAS3 transcription factor is required for proper expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the hippocampus (Pieper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005, 102, 14052-14057), it is possible that impediments in growth factor signaling might impair the trophic environment critical for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms. As an initial test of this hypothesis, brain tissue prepared from NPAS3-deficient animals was compared with that of wild type littermates for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 (CCSP3)-positive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. A statistically significant, 2-fold increase in CCSP3-positive (apoptotic) cells was observed in the dentate gyrus of NPAS3-deficient animals (). This enhanced rate of programmed cell death is likely to account, at least in part, for the nearly complete elimination of adult neurogenesis in mice lacking the NPAS3 transcription factor (Pieper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005, 102, 14052-14057).","In addition to this quantitative deficit in adult neurogenesis, abnormalities have been observed in both the morphology and electrophysiology of granular neurons of the dentate gyrus of NPAS3-deficient animals. Relative to wild type animals, Golgi-Cox staining revealed severe attenuation in dendritic branching and spine density of dentate gyrus granular neurons of NPAS3-deficient animals (). By contrast, no genotype-dependent differences in these measures were observed in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Equivalently specific deficits were observed by electrophysiologic recordings of NPAS3-deficient animals compared with wild type littermates (). Whole field recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) revealed significant deficits in NPAS3-deficient animals, relative to wild type littermates. In the dentate gyrus, stimulating and recording electrodes were positioned in the outer molecular layer, which is innervated by axons of the perforant pathway originating from the entorhinal cortex. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, stimulation and recording electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum, which is innervated by the Schaffer collateral axons of CA3 pyramidal cells. Stimulus intensity was increased in 5 \u03bcA increments, the slope of the decreasing part of field potentials was measured, and fEPSP was quantified relative to the amplitude of the fiber volley, which represents firing of action potentials in pre-synaptic axons. This analysis revealed aberrant hyper-excitability of synaptic transmission in npas3 mice both in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the CA1 region ().","Armed with these genotype- and region-specific deficits in both neuron morphology and electrophysiological activity, whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might favorably repair either deficit in NPAS3-deficient animals was tested. Before embarking on this effort, it was first confirmed that Example 45 Compound was capable of enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis in NPAS3-deficient mice, by demonstrating that Example 45 Compound enhances both BrdU incorporation as well as expression of doublecortin in newborn neurons in the dentate gyms of npas3 mice (). Knowing that formation of the dentate gyrus initiates in the late pre-natal mouse embryo around embryonic day 14 (Stanfield and Cowan, 1988, The development of the hippocampal region. In Cerebral Cortex, E.G. Jones and A. Peters, eds. (New York: Plenum Press), pp. 91-131), animals were exposed to Example 45 Compound for as extended a period of time as possible in order to give the compound the best possible chance for exhibiting favorable effects. Following oral gavage of pregnant female mice, 14 day embryos were recovered, dissected and processed by acetonitrile:water extraction so that Example 45 Compound levels could be measured in the embryonic brain. Daily administration of 20 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound to pregnant females yielded appreciable levels of the compound in the brain tissue of developing embryos. It was similarly observed that oral administration of the compound to lactating females led to delivery of Example 45 Compound to the brain tissue of weanling pups. In both cases, LC\/MS-based quantitation of Example 45 Compound revealed levels of compound accumulation at or above the 1.35 \u03bcM limit required to support adult neurogenesis (). Finally, it was observed that daily IP administration of Example 45 Compound to weaned pups at 20 mg\/kg was sufficient to yield brain levels of Example 45 Compound at or above the level required to enhance adult neurogenesis.","Female mice heterozygous at the NPAS3 locus were mated to heterozygous males. Two weeks post-mating, females were given a daily oral gavage of either 20 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle-only formula. Dosing was continued throughout the last trimester of pregnancy, as well as the two week post-natal period of lactation. Following weaning, pups were given a daily IP dose of either 20 mg\/kg Example 45 Compound or vehicle control. At about 7 weeks of age, mice were switched to oral gavage delivery of the same dose of Example 45 Compound. When mice were 3 months of age they were sacrificed and brain tissue was dissected and subjected to either Golgi-Cox staining or electrophysiological recording. As shown in , prolonged exposure to Example 45 Compound robustly repaired morphological deficits in the dendritic branching of granular neurons of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3-deficient mice. Moreover, as shown in , the electrophysiological deficit in the dentate gyrus of NPAS3-deficient mice was also corrected following prolonged exposure of mice to Example 45 Compound. The corresponding electrophysiological deficit in CA1 region of the hippocampus, however, was not affected (), underscoring the specificity of Example 45 Compound to improving functioning of the dentate gyrus in this animal model.","It is also notable that, relative to vehicle-only controls, administration of Example 45 Compound did not affect any aspect of the health of mothers, embryos, weanlings or young adult mice. Gross histology of brain tissue was normal in both compound- and vehicle-treated animals, and there was no evidence of neuronal cell loss or degenerative changes (cytoplasmic eosinophilia, vacuolization or nuclear pyknosis). The only morphological change, other than normalization of dendritic arborization of granular neurons of the dentate gyrus, was a compound-dependent increase in the thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus itself (). The thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus is roughly 40% less in NPAS3-deficient animals than wild type littermates. Prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound through late embryonic development, early post-natal development, and two months post-weaning significantly corrected this deficit without affecting the thickness of other hippocampal layers in NPAS3-deficient mice ().","Recognizing that the reduced thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3-deficient animals could be attributed to elevated levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells, the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of NPAS3-deficient animals was examined through immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase 3 (CCSP3). As shown in , 12 days of treatment with orally delivered Example 45 Compound (20 mg\/kg) to adult NPAS3-deficient animals significantly reduced CCSP3 staining in the dentate gyrus, whereas vehicle-treatment had not effect. It is thereby proposed that Example 45 Compound facilitated repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3-deficient mice by ameliorating a genotype-specific exacerbation of programmed cell death.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described apoptosis tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Extensive evidence pioneered by the laboratory of Xiaodong Wang has shown that an intrinsic pathway leading to programmed cell death emanates from mitochondria (Liu et al., Cell 1996, 86, 147-157; Yang et al., Science 1997, 275, 1129-1132). With the help of the Wang lab, assays were established to test whether Example 45 Compound might protect mitochondria from calcium-induced dissolution (Distelmaier et al., Cytometry A 2008, 73, 129-138). Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) is a cell-permeant, cationic red-orange fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria. When loaded with TMRM dye, vehicle-only treated cells released the dye within 15 minutes of exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. By contrast, dye release was prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 ng of Example 45 Compound (). As with in vivo neurogenesis assay, as well as the in vitro protection from A\u03b2-mediated toxicity of cultured cortical neurons, preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed only with the (+) enantiomer of Example 62 Compound ().","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mitochondrial integrity tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Comparison of Example 45 Compound and Dimebon:","A chemical compound sharing structural similarity to Example 45 Compound is 2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-2,8-dimethyl-5-(2-(6-methyl-3-pyridyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrido(4,3-b)indole (). An anti-histamine, trade named Dimebon, was anecdotally noticed over the decades to ameliorate symptoms of dementia (O'Brien, Lancet Neurol. 2008, 7, 768-769; Burns and Jacoby, Lancet 2008, 372, 179-180). More recently, an American biotechnology company designated Medivation initiated clinical trials to formally test whether Dimebon might improve the symptoms of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The results of FDA-sponsored, phase 2 clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease were recently published, reporting favorable response rates (Doody et al., Lancet 2008, 372, 207-215). Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were compared in three functional assays. The in vivo test for effects on hippocampal neurogenesis revealed activity for both compounds, with Example 45 Compound exhibiting between 10- and 30-fold higher level of potency and a ceiling of efficacy roughly 40% higher than the anti-histamine drug (). Dimebon has been implicated in protecting mitochondria (Bachurin et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2001, 939, 425-435; Bachurin et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2003, 993, 334-344, discussion 345-349). Therefore Dimebon was compared with Example 45 Compound in the calcium-induced mitochondrial dissolution assay. Both compounds were observed to be active, and it was again observed that the relative potency of Example 45 Compound was superior to Dimebon (). Protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was lost for Example 45 Compound between the 10 and 1 nM doses, whereas that of Dimebon was lost between 10 and 1 \u03bcM.","Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were tested for binding to the H1 histamine receptor. While Dimebon displayed high affinity for this receptor (IC50<100 nM), both enantiomers of Example 45 Compound display low H1 affinity (IC50>10 \u03bcM).","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described binding activity tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Effect of Example 45 Compound on Aged Rats","Next, aged Fisher rats were used as a means of performing behavioral tests capable of assessing the potential benefits of Example 45 Compound on hippocampus-dependent learning. It is well established that normal rodent aging is associated with attenuation of hippocampal neurogenesis (Kuhn et al., J. Neurosci. 1996, 16, 2027-2033; Driscoll et al., Neuroscience 2006, 139, 1173-1185). Reduced neurogenesis in aged rats is likely related to increased neuronal apoptosis in the aged rat brain (Martin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2002, 277, 34239-34246; Kim et al., Exp. Gerontol. 2010, 45, 357-365). These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive decline as a function of terminal aging.","It was first evaluated whether Example 45 Compound would enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in aged rats as it does in adult mice. Rats were injected with a daily, IP dose of either 10 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle, coinjected with a daily dose of BrdU, and then sacrificed after 7 days for immunohistochemistry. As shown in , compound-treated animals revealed a 500% increase in BrdU labeling in the dentate gyrus relative to vehicle-treated controls. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to doublecortin likewise revealed a robust, compound-specific enrichment in this marker of newborn neurons. Having observed proneurogenic efficacy of Example 45 Compound in this short term assay, it was then tested whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might ameliorate age-related decline in cognition by subjecting 18-month-old rats to daily administration of either 10 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only for 2 months. Animals of both groups were further subjected to weekly IP administration of BrdU (50 mg\/kg) for later immunohistochemical measurements of hippocampal neurogenesis. As a control, both Example 45 Compound- and vehicle-treated groups were confirmed to display equal ability to physically participate in the task, and learn the task, as shown by decreased latency times to find the hidden platform over the 5 day training period, both before and after 2 months of treatment (). Moreover, neither swim speed () nor locomotor activity () varied with age or treatment paradigm.","After 2 months of compound or vehicle administration, cognitive ability was assessed blind to treatment group by removing the goal platform. Animals of the Example 45 Compound-treated group retained a statistically significant improvement in ability to navigate to the region of the missing platform, as evidenced by performance in the probe test. As shown in , when the platform was removed from the maze, rats treated with Example 45 Compound crossed the precise location previously containing the platform significantly more often than vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, Example 45 Compound-treated rats spent a higher percentage of time in the general goal area, defined as the quadrant previously containing the platform, than vehicle-treated rats (35.5%\u00b12.2% for Example 45 Compound treated, 28.1%\u00b12.6% for vehicle treated, Student's t Test, p<0.02).","After behavioral testing, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and CCSP3. As shown in , the dentate gyms of rats exposed to Example 45 Compound showed a 3-fold higher level of BrdU-positive neurons than that of the vehicle group. Moreover, Example 45 Compound-treated animals showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of CCSP3-positive cells relative to vehicle controls (). Unexpectedly, administration of Example 45 Compound helped rats maintain stable body weight with aging, in contrast to vehicle-treated rats, whose weight declined steadily with age (). Example 45 Compound-mediated effects on body weight were independent of food intake (), and treatment of aged rats with Example 45 Compound had no effect on postfasting blood glucose levels (). Next it was tested whether Example 45 Compound-mediated preservation of body weight in aged rats operates via central or peripheral modes of action.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described in vivo tests in rats or other animal models can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Positioned immediately below the thalamus and forming the floor and lower lateral walls of the third ventricle, the hypothalamus consists of multiple groups of cells that regulate the autonomic nervous system and also control motivational behaviors via extensive neuronal connections to the pituitary gland, thalamus, midbrain and cerebral cortex. These functions include water balance, biological rhythms, feeding and drinking drive, sexual activity, pituitary gland function and temperature regulation. Neural stem cells in the adult brain reside in the wall of the third ventricle and proliferate in response to various stimuli, and formation of new neurons in the hypothalamus has also been observed in the hypothalamic parenchyma. Administration of trophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor enhances neurogenesis in the rodent hypothalamus. Furthermore, newborn neurons in the adult hypothalamus integrate into existing hypothalamic neural circuits and express neuronal markers such as POMC (phosphorylated signal transducer of activator of transcription), neuropeptide Y, ocytocin and vasopressin. During hypothalamic development, POMC-expressing progenitor cells differentiate into two populations of cells with antagonistic roles, expressing either POMC or neuropeptide Y, that exert opposite effects in regulating energy balance. It is thus proposed that differential regulation of postnatally-generated neurons in the hypothalamus might form the basis of developing new treatments to regulate food intake behavior. This hypothesis is supported by observations that acute ablation of new hypothalamic neurons leads to severe anorexia and weight loss.","It was evaluated whether P7C3 might augment hypothalamic neurogenesis by administering either vehicle or P7C3 (10 mg\/kg twice daily, i.p.) to nine week old male C57BL\/6 mice, starting two days before implantation of 7 day Alzet osmotic minipumps (model 1007d) loaded with BrdU (1 mg\/kg). Pumps were connected to a cannula that delivered BrdU at a constant rate into the left lateral ventricle for the seven day period, during which time animals continued to receive either vehicle or P7C3. Pumps were surgically removed at the conclusion of their 7 day operating period, and mice were allowed to survive for 4 more weeks, during which time they continued to receive either vehicle or P7C3. At the end of the 4 week period, mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of mouse anesthetic cocktail and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). Brains were then dissected and post-fixed overnight at 4 degrees Celsius in 4% PFA, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Fixed brains were embedded in O.C.T and cut at 20 micrometer thickness with a cryostat. Every third section was immunohistochemically stained for BrdU (Accurate, rat anti-Brdu, 1:400) per our standard procedures. Anti-rat Dylight 596 was used to visualize BrdU incorporation. As can be seen from , treatment with P7C3 markedly enhances hypothalamic neurogenesis in the rodent brain, with a significantly increased amount of BrdU positive staining.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described hypothalamic neurogenesis tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Because P7C3 (and its derivatives and analogs) can enhance hypothalamic neurogenesis, compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can be useful for regulating hypothalamic functions such as water balance, biological rhythms, feeding and drinking drive, sexual activity, pituitary gland function and temperature regulation. For example, given P7C3's role in maintaining stable body weight in aging rats, compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can provide therapeutic benefits to patients experiencing physiological weight loss for various reasons, such as normal aging, radiation treatment, chemotherapy, anorexia, cachexia, diabetes, stress, substance abuse, dementia, stroke, cancer, infection, as well as other diseases and\/or conditions.","Since P7C3 ameliorates the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus in living mice, it is possible that its function might relate to mitochondrial integrity. Assays were established to test whether P7C3 might protect cultured U2OS cells from calcium-induced mitochondrial dissolution (Distelmaier et al., Cytometry A 2008, 73, 129-138). Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) dye is sequestered by active mitochondria, and, when loaded with TMRM, vehicle-treated cells released the dye within 15 rain of exposure to the calcium ionophor A23187. By contrast, dye release was fully prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 nM of P7C3 (). Compounds known to be less active in vivo were also less active in this assay (not shown). Preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed for the R-enantiomer of P7C3-OMe, Example 1b, (), but not the S-enantiomer, Example 1a, (). Finally, protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was observed at an enhanced level for a compound variant P7C3A20 (Example 6a), which also exhibited a high level of proneurogenic activity (). Derivatives that have less proneurogenic activity than P7C3 such as Example 33 () and Example 21 (), displayed less protective effect in preserving mitochondrial integrity at the tested doses in cultured primary cortical neurons.","It was also examined whether Example 45 Compound preserves mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured primary cortical neurons (). Cortical neurons cultures from rats on embryonic day 14 were loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) dye after 6 days of maturation. The top panels (no calcium ionophore) show that the dye alone did not affect the health of neurons. The remaining panels are from cells that were exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187 at time zero. With vehicle-alone, cortical neuron mitochondrial membrane potential was rapidly lost after exposure to the ionophore. Escalating doses of Example 45 Compound preserved mitochondrial membrane potential following exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 in a dose dependent manner, with full protection achieved at 1 mM. The less active compound (Example 33) was less effective in preserving mitochondrial membrane potential at any dose tested. Results shown are representative of 10 fields analyzed in each of 2 experimental runs for all conditions.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mitochondrial tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Recognizing that reduced thickness of the npas3 dentate gyrus granular layer could be attributed to increased apoptosis of proliferating neural precursor cells, the effect of Example 45 Compound (P7C3) treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of npas3 mice was examined through immunohistochemical staining of CCSP3. As shown in , after 12 days of orally delivered Example 45 Compound (20 mg\/kg) to adult npas3\u2212\/\u2212 mice, a statistically significant reduction in CCSP3 staining was observed in the dentate gyms. It is thereby proposed that Example 45 Compound facilitates repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in npas3 mice by overcoming a genotype-specific enhancement in apoptosis.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mice model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is an adult-onset (typically between ages 40-70), rapidly progressive and fatal disease caused by selective degeneration of upper (cortical layer V within the primary motor cortex) and lower (spinal cord) motor neurons, the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. An estimated 5000 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS every year. This disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body, and patients with ALS ultimately lose their ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement. The earliest parts of the body affected in ALS reflect those motor neurons that are damaged first. About 75% of patients experience onset of symptoms in their arms or legs manifested as difficulty with manual dexterity or ambulation, while about 25% experience \u2018bulbar onset\u2019 of ALS\u2014difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. A small proportion of patients have respiratory onset of ALS in the form of weakness of the intercostal muscles that support breathing. Regardless of the region of onset, muscle weakness and atrophy invariably spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Most patients develop a constellation of symptoms that includes difficulty moving, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking or forming words) and classical manifestations of loss of upper motor neurons (muscular spasticity, hyperreflexia and overactive gag reflex) and lower motor neurons (muscular weakness, muscle atrophy, muscle cramps and fasciculations). Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are usually spared, though may be involved in some patients. About 20% of ALS patients also develop frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), while 30-50% of patients develop subtle cognitive changes that can be observed with detailed neuropsychological testing. Around 15-45% of patients with ALS also experience what is called \u201cpseudobulbar affect\u201d\u2014a form of emotional lability in which patients manifest intermittent bouts of uncontrollable laughter, crying or smiling. This symptom domain is thought to be related to degeneration of bulbar upper motor neurons, resulting in exaggerated motor expressions of emotion. Although disease progression varies between individuals, most patients are eventually unable to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. Difficulty chewing and swallowing further leads to progressive weight loss and increased risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia. Towards the end stages of disease, as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles weaken, most patients require ventilator support. Individuals with ALS most commonly die of respiratory failure or pneumonia within 2-5 years of diagnosis.","Ninety-five percent of ALS cases occur sporadically (SALS), with no identifiable cause or family history of the disease. The remaining 5% of cases are inherited, known as Familial ALS (FALS). Because FALS and SALS are clinically and neuropathologically similar, the pathogenesis of these forms of ALS may converge on a common pathogenic pathway. Approximately 20% of FALS and 3% of SALS cases are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21, and about 150 different mutations dispersed throughout this gene have been identified in FALS. SOD1 encodes cytosolic Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by converting superoxide (a toxic free radical generated through normal metabolic activity of mitochondria) to hydrogen peroxide. Unchecked, free radicals accumulate and damage both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as proteins within cells. In ALS linked to mutations in SOD1, cytotoxicity of motor neurons appears to result from a gain of toxic SOD1 function, rather than from loss of dismutase activity. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity are unclear, mutation-induced conformational changes in SOD1 are known to lead to misfolding and subsequent cytotoxic aggregation of mutant SOD1 in cell bodies and axons. Aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 is thought to disrupt cellular functions and precipitate neuron death by damaging mitochondria, proteasomes, protein folding chaperones, or other proteins.","Transgenic animal models of mutant SOD1 are currently used for research into the pathogenic mechanisms thought to broadly underlie ALS, such as G93A SOD1 mutant mice. Mice hemizygous for the G93A-SOD1 transgene express 18+\/\u22122.6 copies of a form of SOD1 found in some patients with FALS (a substitution of glycine to alanine at codon 93). This was the first mutant form of SOD1 to be expressed in mice, and is the most widely used and well-characterized mouse model of ALS. Superoxide dismutase activity in these mice is left intact such that the pathogenic effect of the mutant transgene appears to be gain of function, as is thought to occur in human patients. In these mice, death of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and loss of myelinated axons in ventral motor roots leads to paralysis and muscle atrophy. Upper cortical motor neurons in these mice also die as the disease progresses, and protein aggregates of mutant SOD1 are found only in diseased tissues, with greater amounts being detected during motor neuron degeneration. Around 100 days of age, G93A-SOD1 mice become paralyzed in one or more limbs with paralysis due to loss of motor neurons from the spinal cord. This paralysis rapidly spreads throughout the body, culminating in 50% death when mice are 128.9+\/\u22129.1 days old.","P7C3 was intraperitoneally administered to female G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice using a treatment paradigm of 10 mg\/kg P7C3 i.p. twice a day, compared to vehicle, starting at 40 days of age. This treatment scheme was selected based on standard protocols for initial proof of concept screens in these mice. To control for transgene copy number, mice are sibling matched between treatment groups, as per standard protocol. After initiation of P7C3 or vehicle treatment, date of onset of illness is determined by peak weight, and initial progression of disease is defined as the day at which mice fall to 10% below their maximum weight. Mice are also assessed daily by a standard determination of neurological severity score, with a score of 2 or worse for two consecutive days serving as an additional marker of illness progression. This score is determined blind to treatment group with the scoring system described in the legend for the figure. As shown in , P7C3 treatment slows disease progression in G93A-SOD1 mice in terms of delaying the time point at which mice drop to 10% below their maximum weight. Treatment with P7C3 also significantly delays the age at which G93A-SOD1 mice attain a neurological severity score of 2, another marker of disease progression, as shown in . Furthermore, P7C3 treatment significantly improved performance in the accelerating rotarod task as the disease progressed in these mice, as shown in , indicating a slowing of progression of motor impairment in the disease process. This protective effective of P7C3 on motor performance in G93A-SOD1 mice is also observed in the ink footprint analysis of walking gait, as shown in .","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described ALS model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which project to the striatum to control normal movement. Though it is one of the most common nervous system disorders of the elderly, the cause of PD remains uncertain. Symptoms early in the disease are movement-related, including shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking gait. More advanced stages of the disease are typically associated with cognitive and behavioral problems, including dementia. The early motor symptoms are partially managed by administration of drugs that enhance dopaminergic signaling. However, as the disease progresses and the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra continue to die, patients reach a point at which these drugs become ineffective at treating the symptoms and additionally produce the complication of dyskinesia. Effectively preventing the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra would therefore be an ideal treatment approach for patients with PD.","MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) is a potent neurotoxin that selectively kills dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of both mice and monkeys, causing a clinical picture resembling PD. The MPTP toxicity model can therefore be used to study the death of dopaminergic neurons with the goal of developing new treatments for PD based on neuroprotective strategies found to be effective in these neurons. To determine if P7C3A20 might be neuroprotective in the substantia nigra, the well-characterized and popular MPTP administration regimen was employed, as developed by Tatton and Kish (1997), 77: 1037-1048, and Jakson-Lewis et al. (2007), 2: 141-151. Here, 12 week old wild type male C57BL\/6 mice were treated for 3 days with P7C3A20 (10 mg\/kg i.p. twice daily) or vehicle, and on the fourth day a five day regimen of 30 mg\/kg\/day i.p. free base MPTP was initiated. During this five day period of MPTP administration the mice continued to receive P7C3A20 or vehicle. Mice continued to receive the same dose of P7C3A20 or vehicle every day for 21 more days, at which point they were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 degrees Celsius overnight and then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed brains were cut at 30 microns with a sliding microtone, and every 4th section (spaced 120 microns apart) was stained with antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Abcam, rabbit anti-TH, 1:2500). TH-positive cells were counted in the substantia nigra area. As shown in  and , treatment with P7C3A20 significantly attenuates MPTP-mediated killing of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. These observations suggest that P7C3A20 and related compounds may form the basis of new neuroprotective strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease.","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described PD model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by the insidious and progressive development of mood disturbances, behavioral changes, involuntary choreiform movements (ceaseless and complex writhing movements of the limbs) and cognitive impairment. HD has a prevalence of about 1 in 10,000 people in the U.S., and is caused by a polyglutamine expansion of greater than 36 repeats in the N terminus of the protein huntingtin (Htt). There are currently no treatments that delay the appearance or progression of this disease. HD is pathologically characterized by a dramatic loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex, and therapeutic strategies to protect these neurons from dying might provide new treatment options for patients. The physical symptoms of HD typically have their onset between 35-44 years of age, though onset has been reported to occur at times ranging from infancy to old age. The exact way in which HD affects an individual varies and can differ even between members of the same family, but symptoms progress predictably in most cases. The earliest symptoms include a general lack of coordination and unsteady gait, and as the disease advances uncoordinated and jerky body movements become more apparent. More advanced stages are typically accompanied by an observable decline in mental abilities, associated with behavioral and psychiatric problems, such as anxiety, severe depression, blunted affect, egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behaviors such as alcoholism, gambling or hypersexuality. Over time, physical abilities are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult, and mental abilities generally decline into dementia. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, eating difficulties leading to weight loss and malnutrition, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around twenty years after onset of symptoms. There is no cure for HD, and full-time care is required in later stages of disease.","Htt is a large cytoplasmic protein that interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have multiple biological functions. The behavior of mutated Htt (mHtt) protein is not completely understood, but it is known to be toxic to neurons. Damage mainly occurs in the striatum, but in later stages other areas of the brain are also attacked, such as the cerebral cortex. As neuronal cell death progresses, symptoms associated with the functions of the affected brain areas appear. For example, planning and modulating movement are the main functions of the striatum, and difficulties with these tasks are frequent initial symptoms of HD. Disease initiation and progression are thought to involve in large part a conformational change in the mHtt protein due to the polyglutamine expansion, altered protein-protein interactions, abnormal protein aggregation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and proteolysis, which in turn may lead to transcriptional dysregulation, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal apoptosis. In addition to a role for a gain of new toxic properties of mHtt in HD pathology, there is increasing evidence that loss of wild-type Htt function also contributes to pathogenesis. For example, an essential role of Htt in mitotic spindle formation and mammalian neurogenesis has recently been identified.","One animal model of HD that can be employed for screening potential therapeutic agents is R6\/2 transgenic mice. These mice express a mutant exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene, engineered to include an approximately 145-155 CAG repeat expansion. R6\/2 mice phenocopy much of the neuropathology (striatal and cortical neuron cell death) and behavioral manifestations of clinical HD. They display progressive motor and cognitive impairments, ubiquitinated nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of mutant Htt, weight loss, decreased striatal and brain size, altered levels of neurotransmitters and their receptors, and premature death. They exhibit motor deficits as early as 5-6 weeks of age, display overt behavioral abnormalities at 8-9 weeks, and typically die between 11 and 13 weeks of age. R6\/2 mice also display significantly lower levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis relative to wild-type littermates, even before onset of symptoms.","In one hypothesis, P7C3 (and its derivates) may enhance the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus by preventing death rather than promoting proliferation of these cells. As such, P7C3 is \u201cproneurogenic\u201d by virtue of its neuroprotective activity. It is also possible that P7C3 (and its derivates) prevents cell death and promotes cell proliferation. It was evaluated whether P7C3 might provide therapeutic benefit in R6\/2 mice. P7C3 (10 mg\/kg i.p. twice daily starting at 6 weeks of age) or vehicle were administered to 40 female R6\/2 mice. As shown in , 50% of vehicle-treated R6\/2 mice die at approximately 15 weeks of age, and treatment with P7C3 delays animal death by about three weeks. At 14 weeks of age, R6\/2 mice treated with P7C3 showed improved general condition score and appearance as shown in , as compared to vehicle-treated littermates. General condition score was determined by a 3 point scoring system that was conducted blind to genotype and treatment group (score of 0=fur looks groomed, normal posture (no hunch), clear eyes, alert; score of 1=fur beginning to stick up, slight hunch; score of 2=piloerection (fur sticking up), unkempt fur, hunch in back or neck area, crusty eyes). Death was monitored twice daily, and defined as either when animals were found dead, or when they were unable to right themselves after being placed on their backs with movement subsequently initiated by gentle prodding for 30 seconds. By general appearance of coat condition, grooming and spontaneous activity in the home cage, R6\/2 mice treated with P7C3 also appear qualitatively better than VEH-treated R6\/2 mutant mice (not shown).","It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described HD model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.","Neuroprotective Efficacy of Aminopropyl Carbazoles in a Mouse Model of Parkinson'S Disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of predominantly idiopathic origin that is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a region of the brain that controls motor activity by projecting dopaminergic axons to the striatum (Lees A. J., Hardy J., Revesz T (2012) Parkinson's disease. 373:2055-2066). Early symptoms in PD are primarily movement-related, including shaking, rigidity, brady- and hypo-kinesia, tremor and difficulty walking. More advanced stages of PD are associated with cognitive and behavioral problems, including dementia. Current treatment strategies for PD consist primarily of partial management of early motor symptoms with drugs that enhance dopaminergic signaling, such as L-DOPA or dopamine receptor agonists. Unfortunately, as greater numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc die, these drugs fail to alleviate symptoms and additionally produce dyskinesia. There is thus a significant unmet need for new pharmacologic strategies to slow the progression of PD, such as drugs capable of blocking the death of SNc dopaminergic neurons.","We have previously reported the identification of an aminopropyl carbazole (P7C3) discovered via an unbiased, in vivo screen for small molecules capable of enhancing postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. P7C3 displays enantiomeric-selective stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhances neurogenesis by blocking apoptosis of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus (Pieper A. A., et al. (2010) Discovery of a Proneurogenic, Neuroprotective Chemical. Cell 142:39-51). Prolonged oral or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of P7C3 to rodents safely improves hippocampal functioning. For example, administration of P7C3 to mice suffering from pathologically high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus, neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3)-deficient mice (Pieper A. A., et al. (2005) The neuronal PAS domain protein 3 transcription factor controls FGF-mediated adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. 102:14052-14057), restored hippocampal structure and function with no obvious physiologic side effects (Pieper A. A., et al. (2010) Discovery of a Proneurogenic, Neuroprotective Chemical. Cell 142:39-51). In addition, extended administration of P7C3 to aged rats safely impeded hippocampal cell death and preserved cognitive ability as a function of terminal aging (Pieper A. A., et al. (2010) Discovery of a Proneurogenic, Neuroprotective Chemical. Cell 142:39-51).","Through an in vivo structure-activity relationship (SAR) study, we have identified analogs of P7C3 displaying either increased or decreased activity. In particular, a chemical variant known as P7C3A20 was observed to have greater potency and efficacy than P7C3. P7C3A20 differs from P7C3 by virtue of replacing the hydroxyl group at the chiral center of the linker with a fluorine, and the addition of a methoxy group to the aniline ring. This analog displays a more favorable toxicity profile than P7C3, with no hERG channel binding, histamine receptor binding or toxicity to HeLa cells. We have also found that Dimebon, an antihistaminergic drug long deployed in Russia that is claimed to have anti-apoptotic and mitochondrial protective properties, displays modest efficacy in the same biologic assays employed to discover and characterize P7C3 and P7C3A20. The chemical structure of Dimebon is related to the P7C3 class of aminopropyl carbazoles, yet its rank order of activity relative to chemical derivatives of P7C3 is very low. Here, we report that the neuroprotective activity of these agents extends beyond promoting long-term survival of newborn cells in the adult hippocampus. Specifically, we show that the most active variants of P7C3 exhibit robust protection of mature dopaminergic neurons in both mouse and worm models of neurodegeneration, and propose that substituted carbazoles may represent attractive chemical scaffolds for the optimization of therapeutic agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.","Results","Neuroprotective Efficacy of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon for Newborn Hippocampal Neurons.","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice is an approximately month-long process, during which time the majority of newborn cells die as they transition through a \u201cdifferentiation gauntlet\u201d lasting about 1 month before surviving cells become functionally wired into the central nervous system. We have previously found that approximately 40% of these newborn cells die within the first week following their birth in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. P7C3 was originally discovered through a week-long in vivo screen designed to identify small molecules that might enhance either proliferation or survival of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells. Subsequent bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase labeling studies revealed that P7C3 does not affect neural precursor proliferation, but instead augments survival of newborn cells by blocking apoptosis. P7C3A20 was found to be active at lower doses and to have a higher ceiling of efficacy (CoE) than P7C3 in this 7 day in vivo assay, whereas Dimebon was shown to be substantially less potent and efficacious than P7C3.","In order to more carefully compare the neuroprotective efficacy of these compounds in abetting hippocampal neurogenesis, we conducted dose-response studies in a 30 day BrdU pulse-chase survival assay (). Briefly, newborn cells were labeled with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of BrdU (150 mg\/kg), followed by daily treatment with the three test compounds beginning the following day. After 30 days of compound administration, mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, brains were dissected, and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU followed by standard microscopic imaging and normalization for dentate gyms volume was used to quantify the number of surviving cells. As shown in , P7C3A20 increased neuron survival by almost 100% at the lowest dose tested (5 mg\/kg\/day). By contrast, neither P7C3 nor Dimebon exhibited any effect at this dose. At the next higher dose (10 mg\/kg\/day), P7C3 and Dimebon showed 65% and 15% neuroprotective efficacy, respectively, whereas P7C3A20 showed neuroprotective ceiling of efficacy (CoE) of about 175%. All three compounds exhibited their maximal individual CoEs at the two highest doses tested (20 or 40 mg\/kg\/day), with P7C3A20's CoE being highest (\u2248230% increase in survival), P7C3's CoE being intermediate (\u2248130% increase in survival) and Dimebon's CoE being the lowest (\u224830% increase in survival).","Efficacy Assays for P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon for Protection from MPTP-Toxicity to Dopaminergic Neurons in Mice.","The protective efficacy of the three test compounds for newborn hippocampal neurons in the 30 day survival assay prompted us to investigate whether they might also have neuroprotective efficacy in mature neurons outside of the hippocampus. To investigate this hypothesis, we utilized the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of neuronal cell death. MPTP is a potent toxin that selectively kills neurons in the substantia nigra of both rodents and primates, causing clinical manifestations resembling PD (Fukuda T. (2001) Neurotoxicity of MPTP. 21:323-332). MPTP is lipophilic and readily crosses into the brain, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase B in glial cells into the highly toxic cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP). MPP is selectively concentrated in SNc dopaminergic neurons by virtue of its high affinity for the plasma membrane dopamine transporter, and toxicity is further potentiated by binding of MPP to melanin in these cells, creating a depot mechanism that maintains prolonged high intracellular concentrations of MPP. MPTP toxicity is routinely used to study the death of dopaminergic neurons as a possible means of discovering new treatments for PD based on neuroprotective strategies found to be effective in this model.","We compared the protective efficacy of our agents in the Tatton and Kish model of MPTP administration, which induces prolonged apoptotic death of SNc dopaminergic neurons lasting about 3 weeks after a short course of daily MPTP administration. Mice were treated daily for 5 days with 30 mg\/kg\/day free base MPTP. On the sixth day, 24 hours after receiving the fifth and final dose of MPTP, daily treatment with P7C3, P7C3A20, Dimebon or vehicle was initiated. This testing paradigm ensured that any observed activity of P7C3 or its analogs could be attributed to neuroprotective effects, and not to disruption of MPTP uptake or metabolism. Dose-response studies were conducted in which mice received twice daily doses of each compound (or vehicle) for the ensuing 21 days (). Treatment groups consisted of 15 animals each. At the end of the 21 day treatment period, mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde, and fixed brains were sectioned through the striatum and SNc at 30 \u03bcM intervals. Every fourth section (spaced 120 \u03bcM apart) was stained with antibodies specific to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Abcam, rabbit anti-TH, 1:2500). The TH enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid L-tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which serves as the precursor for dopamine. TH staining thus provides a means to immunohistochemically identify dopaminergic neurons. By counting the number of TH+ cells in the SNc, we were able to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of the three chemicals following MPTP exposure. All microscopic analysis was performed by two investigators, blind to treatment group.","As has been observed by others, MPTP administration reduced the number of TH+ neurons in the SNc by about 50% (VEH) (). This neurotoxicity was blocked to varying degrees by both P7C3 and P7C3A20. P7C3 enhanced survival by about 40% over VEH at a dose of 5 mg\/kg\/day, and the highest dose of P7C3 (20 mg\/kg\/day) afforded almost 60% protection relative to vehicle. By contrast, the 20 mg\/kg\/day dose of P7C3A20 preserved the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc to about 85% of that seen in normal mice not exposed to MPTP. At every dose tested, P7C3A20 provided superior protection to P7C3. Both CoE and potency of P7C3A20 were greater than P7C3, with the onset of P7C3A20 efficacy (30% over VEH) at a dose of 1 mg\/kg\/day. Dimebon failed to confer any measurable degree of protection from MPTP at any dose.","In addition to allowing quantification of dopaminergic cells in the SNc, TH staining is also routinely employed to visualize the integrity of dopaminergic axonal protections from SNc cell bodies into the striatum.  shows that the highest dose of P7C3A20 (20 mg\/kg\/day) almost completely blocked depletion of dopaminergic axons in the striatum after MPTP exposure. The highest dose of P7C3 also revealed qualitatively notable protection. By contrast, Dimebon offered no protection of dopaminergic axons in the striatum, corresponding to its lack of neuroprotective efficacy in the SNc. As shown in , LC\/MS\/MS quantification of brain and blood levels of P7C3A20 and P7C3 confirmed that the neuroprotective efficacy for each compound correlated with brain and blood levels for each chemical. Notably, P7C3A20 displayed significantly greater protective efficacy than P7C3 in spite of the fact that P7C3A20 accumulated in brain tissue at less than one-tenth the concentration of P7C3. Dimebon, which displayed no neuroprotective efficacy in the MPTP model of dopaminergic neuron cell death, showed comparable levels of brain accumulation to P7C3A20.","Efficacy Assays of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon for Protection from MPP-Toxicity to Dopaminergic Neurons in ","Genes, metabolic signaling pathways, neurotransmitters and receptor pharmacology are highly conserved between and vertebrates, and exposure of to MPP has been reported to selectively kill dopaminergic neurons and impair mobility. To investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of P7C3A20, P7C3 and Dimebon from MPP toxicity in , we monitored dopaminergic cell death in a transgenic strain of worms in which dopaminergic neurons fluoresce green by virtue of GFP expression driven by the dopaminergic neuron-specific promoter dat-1. As shown in , incubation of synchronized L1 larvae for 40 hours with 5 mM MPP elicited virtually complete destruction of all four cephalic sensilla dopaminergic dendrites. For this assessment, GFP fluorescence was observed in 20 worms per group, and was performed in triplicate. Cephalic sensilla dopaminergic dendrites were observed under 40\u00d7 magnification (AMG, Evos fl microscope), and GFP signal was followed from the nerve ring to the tip of the nose, following established protocols. If any part of a dendrite was absent, as evidenced by loss of GFP signal, it was counted as degraded. All analyses were performed blind to treatment group.","Co-treatment of MPP-exposed worms with 10 \u03bcM P7C3A20 conferred 80% protection. By comparison, the neuroprotective efficacy of the same dose of P7C3 was only about 50%. Neuroprotective efficacy of both agents was diminished as the chemical dose was gradually reduced. By these measures, P7C3A20 showed greater potency than P7C3, with an onset of neuroprotective efficacy of 30% at the 0.1 \u03bcM dose. By comparison, P7C3 did not show efficacy (35%) until administered at 1.0 \u03bcM. Administration of Dimebon at the highest dose (10 \u03bcM) failed to protect dopaminergic neurons in worms from MPP-induced toxicity.","Efficacy Assays of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon for Protection from MPP-Induced Mobility Deficits in ","As a behavioral measure of toxicity, worm mobility was assessed 32 hours after MPP-exposure. To quantify worm locomotion, video representations were recorded for 10 seconds at 4\u00d7 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. Each video segment consisted of 160 frames, and the head of each worm (10-20 worms per group, repeated in triplicate) was manually tracked in each frame using Imera software. The body length of each worm was also measured by Imera software. The ratio of distance traveled to body length was used to determine the movement index, defined as locomotion, as previously established (Wang J., et al. (2009) An ALS-linked mutant SOD1 produces a locomotor defect associated with aggregation and synaptic dysfunction when expressed in neurons of . PLoS Genetics e10003350). As shown in , locomotion was reduced in by 50% after 32 hours of exposure to 5 mM MPP. Co-incubation of MPP-exposed worms with 10 \u03bcM P7C3A20 conferred 80% preservation of locomotion, while 10 \u03b7M P7C3 protected to about 60% of normal levels. Dimebon offered no protective efficacy in this behavioral assay.","Correlation of Efficacy of New Analogs of P7C3 in the In Vivo Hippocampal Neurogenesis Assay with Neuroprotective Efficacy in MPTP-Mediated Dopaminergic Cell Death.","Over the past two years, we have conducted a comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) study in order to improve the potency, efficacy and physical properties of the P7C3 series of molecules, as well as to eliminate real or perceived chemical liabilities. To date, we have synthesized over 300 analogs of P7C3, all of which have been evaluated by primary screening in the in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay. Our efforts include, but are not limited to, eliminating the bromines and aniline ring, increasing biologic activity, decreasing lipophilicity, eliminating toxicities such as hERG channel binding, increasing solubility and reducing molecular weight. Here, we show the results of evaluation of 8 of these new analogs () in both the hippocampal neurogenesis assay (4 mice for each compound) and the MPTP protection assay (10 mice for each compound) (). All analyses were conducted blind to treatment group.","With respect to the original P7C3 scaffold, P7C3-S7 differs by replacing the aniline NH with a sulfide linker, P7C3-S8 differs by replacing the aniline phenyl ring with a pyrimidine, and P7C3-S25 differs by replacing the aniline moiety with a dimethylpyrazole (). As shown in , all of the eight test molecules crossed the blood brain barrier. P7C3-S7 and P7C3-S25 were active in both the hippocampal neurogenesis assay and the MPTP protection assay. By contrast, P7C3-S8 was devoid of activity in both assays. We also compared the efficacy of members of a new enantiomeric pair in these assays. P7C3-S40 and P7C3-S41 differ from P7C3 by replacing the aniline NH with an oxygen linker (). P7C3S40 and P7C3S41 are the R and S single enantiomers, respectively, and  shows that neuroprotective activity in both assays resides exclusively in the S enantiomer. P7C3-S54 differs from P7C3 mainly by the addition of a methyl group to the central carbon of the propyl linker, and additionally has an OMe group on the aniline ring (). This analog was observed to retain neuroprotective activity in both assays. P7C3-S165 differs from P7C3 by replacing the aniline and carbinol fragments with a carboxylic acid, a change that dramatically increases polarity (). Encouragingly, neuroprotection was observed in both assays ().","Finally, P7C3-S184 differs from P7C3 by replacing the bromines on the carbazole with chlorines, and by replacing the aniline with a naphthyl amine (). This molecule was inactive in both in vivo assays. P7C3-S184 has been reported as a \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) inhibitor (Asso V., et al. (2008) alpha-naphthylaminopropan-2-ol derivatives as BACE1 inhibitors. 3:1530-1534). BACE1 is an aspartate proteolytic enzyme that catalyzes the formation of A\u03b2 peptide from amyloid precursor protein, which has been proposed as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. By analyzing BACE1 inhibition with multiple molecules in our P7C3 series, we have found no correlation between neuroprotective efficacy in our in vivo models and BACE1 inhibition (data not shown).","Discussion","The results of a target-agnostic, unbiased screen of 1,000 chemically diverse, drug-like compounds led to the identification of an aminopropyl carbazole endowed with the capacity to enhance adult neurogenesis. This compound, designated P7C3, was found to act by blocking the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. Here we have sought to answer a simple question. If P7C3 is capable of preventing the death of newborn neurons during hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice, this compound may also prevent death of existing neurons in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. More specifically, we have administered MPTP to mice as a means of killing dopamine neurons. Fully 24 hours after removal of the toxin, mice were treated with varying doses of one of three compounds for a period of three weeks. Thereafter mice were sacrificed and assayed for evidence of neuroprotective efficacy. As a second, related animal model of neuron death, worms were co-treated with MPP and varying doses of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon as a means of assessing neuroprotective activity.","The three compounds chosen for extensive testing, P7C3, its structurally related analog P7C3A20, and Dimebon, were selected by virtue of the knowledge that they demonstrate distinct pro-neurogenic activities. Among dozens of chemical analogs of P7C3 evaluated in the study first reporting this category of pro-neurogenic compounds, P7C3A20 displayed the highest potency and ceiling of pro-neurogenic efficacy. In addition to the P7C3 and P7C3A20 chemicals, we included Dimebon in the present study for two reasons. First, even though P7C3 and Dimebon both contain three-ring heterocycles, Dimebon was found to display significantly diminished levels of potency and efficacy relative to P7C3 in our original study. Its pro-neurogenic activity in the hippocampus of adult mice was observed only at relatively high doses, and its ceiling of efficacy was clearly diminished relative to both P7C3 and P7C3A20. Likewise, when tested for its ability to protect mitochondrial membrane integrity following exposure of cultured cells to a calcium ionophore, Dimebon exhibited a protective potency between 100- and 1.000-fold lower than P7C3. Second, Dimebon has been the subject of extensive clinical studies in both Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Despite early indications of efficacy in a phase 2 trial for Alzheimer's disease (Doody R. S., et al. (2008) Effect of Dimebon on cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, and global function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 372:207-215), Dimebon failed in two independent phase 3 trials. By testing the properties of these three compounds in the present study of neuroprotective efficacy, one having a very favorable efficacy profile as a pro-neurogenic chemical (P7C3A20), another having an intermediate efficacy profile (P7C3), and a third having a far more modest efficacy profile (Dimebon), we sought to determine whether this hierarchy of activities might be preserved.","Encouragingly, we observe that the A20 chemical variant of P7C3 displays significant neuroprotective efficacy in the MPTP model of dopaminergic neuron cell death in both rodents and worms. P7C3, the original compound discovered in the unbiased screen of 1,000 drug-like chemicals for pro-neurogenic activity, displayed a lower level of neuroprotective activity in the mouse and worm models of dopaminergic neuron death than P7C3A20. By contrast, Dimebon showed no protective activity in either assay. Although others have recently demonstrated that treatment of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model (TgCRND8 mice) with Dimebon improves memory and lowers accumulation of insoluble A\u03b242 in the brain, Dimebon appears too weakly active to afford neuroprotection in the models of Parkinson's disease that we have utilized.","We conclude that P7C3 and P7C3A20 protect dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced cell death with a hierarchy of activity that is analogous to their abilities to protect newborn hippocampal neurons from cell death. If correct, this interpretation offers the possibility that the relatively straightforward assay we have employed to monitor the activities of hundreds of chemical variants of P7C3, wherein adult neurogenesis is monitored over a seven day period following direct administration of test compounds into the adult mouse brain, may represent a trusted surrogate for the refinement of drug-like chemicals having broad neuroprotective activity. Indeed, we hereby observe that an unbiased, blinded analysis of nine analogs of P7C3 confirms this correlation. Five of these molecules showed significant efficacy in our standard in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay, and these same five molecules also showed significant neuroprotective efficacy from MPTP-mediated neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons. The four analogs that were inactive in the in vivo neurogenesis likewise showed no efficacy in the in vivo MPTP neurotoxicity assay. Taken together, these results show that the relatively rapid evaluation of new molecules in the in vivo neurogenesis assay is predictive of their neuroprotective efficacy in the MPTP assay.","Ongoing SAR efforts with our P7C3 series of molecules using the in vivo neurogenesis assay appears to qualify as a rapid and accurate way to guide the refinement of this series of molecules into a neuroprotective drug for Parkinson's disease. In this context, several of the analogs shown in  represent potential improvements to P7C3. We have been primarily concerned with the presence of an aniline ring, as this functionality can be associated with toxicity. Encouragingly, three of the analogs (P7C3S7, -S41, and -S165) lack aniline rings and display potency equal to or greater than P7C3 in both in vivo assays. We further note that P7C3 was originally identified as a racemic mixture, and that racemic mixtures may require additional characterization for clinical development. P7C3S41 and P7C3S165 address this limitation because the former is a single enantiomer while the latter lacks stereochemistry altogether. Finally, we have sought to reduce the polarity and molecular weight of these neuroprotective compounds. P7C3S165 is significantly lighter than P7C3 (mw=383 Da, vs 474 Da for P7C3) and, by virtue of the carboxylic acid, substantially more polar. These results suggest that it should be possible to further improve the physical properties of these analogs in efforts to optimize derivatives suitable for clinical testing.","Consistent with the interpretation that the activity of P7C3 analogs in the in vivo neurogenesis assay correlates with neuroprotective efficacy in mature neurons are the results of assays of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this model, using mice expressing a high level of a human transgene encoding a mutated variant of the gene encoding human Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase, we have observed the same hierarchy of activities wherein P7C3A20 is active, P7C3 is intermediately active and Dimebon is inactive. If the more active variants of this class of compounds indeed possess neuroprotective properties, and if we can rely on the relatively rapid in vivo assay of enhanced neurogenesis in order to rank order compounds for structure-activity relationship (SAR) scoring, it should be possible to optimize variants with the goal of selecting an appropriately qualified chemical to advance for human testing. To date, no safely tolerated, neuroprotective chemical is available for the treatment of any of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based upon the observations reported herein, we propose that a properly optimized variant of the P7C3 class of pro-neurogenic, neuroprotective chemicals may offer promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.","Materials and Methods","Approval for the animal experiments described herein was obtained by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.","Statistics:","All p values were obtained with the Student's t test.","Day Survival Assay of Newborn Hippocampal Neurons:","Because both social activity and voluntary exercise enhance hippocampal neurogenesis, mice were individually housed without access to running wheels throughout the entire procedure, beginning one week prior to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich) labeling of newborn cells. Throughout the study, mice had ad libitum access to food and water. BrdU was injected intraperitoneally at 150 mg\/kg i.p., and 24 hours later administration of test compounds or vehicle was initiated. P7C3 and P7C3A20 were dissolved in 5% dextrose (pH 7.0) with 2.5% DMSO and 10% Cremaphor EL (Sigma, C5135). Dimebon was dissolved in normal saline. Compounds were compared to their respective controls, and were tested at 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg\/kg twice daily (i.p.) for 30 days. The injection site was alternated between right and left sides. Each group consisted of six 12-week-old adult male C57 Bl\/6 mice. Animals were monitored daily for general health and weight loss. Cage changes were performed per routine scheduling. After 30 days of compound administration, mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde at pH 7.4, and their brains were processed for immunohistochemical detection of incorporated BrdU in the dentate gyrus. Dissected brains were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 degrees Celsius, then cryoprotected in sucrose before being sectioned with a Leica SM2000R sliding microtome coronally into 40 \u03bcM thick free-floating sections. Unmasking of BrdU antigen was achieved through incubating tissue sections for two hours in 50% formamide\/2\u00d7SSC at 65 degrees Celsius, followed by five minute wash in 2\u00d7SSC and subsequent incubation for thirty minutes in 2M HCl at 37 degrees Celsius. Sections were processed for immunohistochemical staining with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:100, Roche). Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen, and tissue was counter-stained with hematoxylin to aid in visualization of the neuroanatomy. Images were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized research microscope with Plan Apo lenses coupled with Metamorph Image Acquisition software (Nikon). Quantification of all staining was done blind to treatment group. The number of BrdU+ cells in the entire dentate gyrus was quantified by counting BrdU+ cells within the dentate gyrus in every fifth section throughout the entire hippocampus and then normalizing for dentate gyrus volume.","P7C3-S7, -S8, -S40, -S41, -S54, -S165 and -A20 were synthesized as previously described.","P7C3-S184 was synthesized as previously described by Asso et al.

In a separate set of experiments designed to test the ability of new P7C3 analogs to cross the blood brain barrier, C57BL\/6 mice were dosed IP a single time with compounds at 10 mg\/kg. P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon were formulated for administration as described above. Analogs were formulated in 5% Dextrose, pH 7.4, containing 5% DMSO and 10% Cremophor EL with the exception of P7C3-S8 which required 10% DMSO and 20% Cremophor EL dissolved in 5% Dextrose for delivery. Six hours after the final compound dose, animals were given an inhalation overdose of COand whole blood and brain collected. Plasma was prepared from blood and was stored along with the brain tissue at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analysis. Brain homogenates were prepared by homogenizing the tissues in a 3-fold volume of PBS. Total brain homogenate volume was estimated as volume of PBS added plus volume of brain in mL. One hundred mL of either plasma or brain homogenate was processed by addition of a two- or four-fold excess of methanol or acetonitrile containing formic acid and an internal standard (IS), N-benzylbenzamide (Sigma-Aldrich, lot #02914LH) to precipitate plasma or tissue protein and release bound drug. The final formic acid concentration was 0.1%, and the final IS concentration was 25 ng\/ml. Extraction conditions were optimized prior to PK analysis for efficient and reproducible recovery over a three log range of concentrations. The samples were vortexed 15 sec, incubated at room temp for 10\u2032 and spun 2\u00d716,100 g in a standard refrigerated microcentrifuge. The supernatant was then analyzed by LC\/MS\/MS. Standard curves were prepared by addition of the appropriate compound to plasma or brain homogenate. A value of 3\u00d7 above the signal obtained in the blank plasma or brain homogenate was designated the limit of detection (LOD). The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was defined as the lowest concentration at which back calculation yielded a concentration within 20% of the theoretical value and above the LOD signal. LOQ values for plasma and brain ranged from 0.5 to 500 ng\/ml but were well-below the concentrations measured at 6 hours for all of the compounds. Compound levels were monitored by LC\/MS\/MS using an AB\/Sciex (Framingham, Mass.) 3200 Qtrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Shimadzu (Columbia, Md.) Prominence LC. The compounds were detected with the mass spectrometer in MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode by following the precursor to fragment ion transition 474.9\u2192337.8 for P7C3 (pos. mode; M+H), 507.0\u2192204.1 for P7C3A20 (pos. mode; M+H), 320.3\u2192277.3 for Dimebon (pos. mode; M+H), 381.9\u219280.7 for P7C3-S165 (neg. mode; M\u2212H), 519.0\u2192338.0 for P7C3-S54 (pos. mode; M+H), 536.0\u2192536.0 (redundant MRM) for P7C3-S7 (neg mode; M+HCOO), 520.0-520.0 for P7C3-S41 (neg mode; M+HCOO); 520.1\u2192520.1 for P7C3-S40 (neg mode; M+HCOO), 477.1\u2192138.2 for P7C3-S8 (pos. mode; M+H), 478.0\u2192153.2 for P7C3-S25 (pos. mode; M+H), and 435.2\u2192248.2 for P7C3-S184 (pos. mode; M+H). The IS, N-benzylbenzamide, was monitored using a 212.1\u219291.1 transition (pos. mode; M+H). An Agilent (Santa Clara, Calif.) XDB C18 column (50\u00d74.6 mm, 5 micron packing) was used for chromatography with the following conditions: Buffer A: dH20+0.1% formic acid, Buffer B: methanol+0.1% formic acid, 0-1.5 min 0% B, 1.5-2.5 min gradient to 100% B, 2.5-3.5 min 100% B, 3.5 to 3.6 min gradient to 0% B, 3.6 to 4.5 min 0% B. Chromatography conditions were identical for all compounds, except the initial and final concentration of Buffer B, which was set to 0% for P7C3 and P7C3A20 and 3% for Dimebon and all of the other P7C3 analogs.","Maintenance of ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1792","num":"2493"},"i":["C. elegans ","Escherichia coli ","Ceanorhabditis "]},"Assessment of MPTP-Mediated Neurotoxicity to Murine SNc Neurons:","15 adult male C57Bl\/6 mice were individually housed for one week and then injected daily for 5 days with 30 mg\/kg\/day (i.p.) free base MPTP (Sigma). On day 6, 24 hours after receiving the fifth and final dose of MPTP, daily treatment with P7C3, P7C3A20, Dimebon or vehicle was initiated. Mice were housed in disposable caging, and protective gear and precautions were implemented for handling MPTP in accordance with UT Southwestern Medical Center policy. Dose response studies were conducted in which mice received twice daily doses of each compound (or vehicle) by intraperitoneal injection for the following 21 days, after which mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and cryoprotected in sucrose for freezing by standard procedures. Frozen brains were sectioned through the striatum and SNc at 30 uM intervals, and every fourth section (spaced 120 \u03bcM apart) was stained with antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Abcam, rabbit anti-TH, 1:2500). Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen, and tissue was counter-stained with hematoxylin to aid in visualization of the neuroanatomy. Images were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized research microscope with Plan Apo lenses coupled with Metamorph Image Acquisition software (Nikon). TH+ neurons were counted with Image J software (NIH) in every section by 2 blinded investigators and results were averaged and multiplied by the sectioning interval to determine the total number of TH+ neurons per SNc.","Assessment of MPP Dopaminergic Neuron Toxicity in ","Synchronized L1 larvae were plated into each well of a 12-well plate (approximately 400 larvae per well) containing PBS, Vehicle or compounds, with or without 5 mM MPP iodide (Sigma) freshly diluted in PBS. DMSO was used as vehicle (VEH) and the concentration in treatment groups was maintained below 1%. The assay solution (500 ml) was incubated for 40 hrs at 20 degrees Celsius. The worms were then washed in dHO and supernatant was aspirated. To examine dopaminergic neuron toxicity, worms were anesthetized (0.1% tricaine, 0.01% tetramizole) for 5 min and then transferred to microscope slides and coverslipped. Pictures were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification (AMG, Evos fl microscope). Each experiment was conducted in triplicate with 10-20 worms counted per condition. For quantification, investigators were blind to treatment condition. Quantification was done by observing all four cephalic sensilla (CEP) dendrites, per standard protocol. Briefly, GFP fluorescence was visualized from the nerve ring to the tip of the nose, and if any portion of a dendrite was absent then it was counted as being degenerated.","Locomotion Analysis of ","A video-based assay was used to assess the swim speed, distance traveled and length of worms. After exposure to MPP for 32 hrs, worms were washed, resuspended in M9 buffer (500 ul) and transferred to microscope slides. A 10 second movie was recorded at 4\u00d7 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. Each movie consisted of 160 frames and the distance traveled by the head of each worm was manually tracked in each frame using Imera software. This software was also used to measure the length of the worm body. The ratio of movement distance to body length was used as a movement index, and defined as locomotion per standard protocols.","Neuroprotective Efficacy of Aminopropyl Carbazoles in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a relatively rare, adult-onset, rapidly progressive and fatal disease that involves degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons (Tandan R, Bradley W. G. (1985) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Part 1. Clinical features, pathology, and ethical issues in management. 18:271-280). This disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body, and patients with ALS ultimately lose all voluntary movement. The earliest parts of the body affected in ALS reflect those motor neurons that are damaged first. Regardless of the region of onset, however, muscle weakness and atrophy invariably spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Although disease progression varies between individuals, most patients are eventually unable to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. Difficulty with chewing, swallowing and breathing leads to progressive weight loss and increased risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia. Towards the end stages of disease, as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles weaken, most patients require ventilator support. Individuals with ALS most commonly die of respiratory failure or pneumonia within 2-5 years of diagnosis. There are no current treatments for ALS.","Approximately 20% of inherited cases of ALS, and 3% of sporadic cases, are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21, and about 150 different mutations dispersed throughout the gene have been identified thus far. SOD1 encodes cytosolic Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by converting superoxide (a toxic free radical generated through normal metabolic activity of mitochondria) to hydrogen peroxide. Unchecked, free radicals damage both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as proteins within cells. In ALS linked to mutations in SOD1, cytotoxicity of motor neurons appears to result from a gain of toxic SOD1 function, rather than from loss of dismutase activity. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity are unclear, mutation-induced conformational changes in SOD1 lead to misfolding and subsequent aggregation of mutant SOD1 in cell bodies and axons. Aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 is thought to disrupt cellular functions and precipitate neuron death by damaging mitochondria, proteasomes, protein folding chaperones, or other proteins.","Transgenic animal models of mutant SOD1, such as G93A-SOD1 mutant mice, are currently used for research into the pathogenic mechanisms thought to broadly underlie ALS. Mice hemizygous for the G93A-SOD1 transgene express 18+\/\u22122.6 copies of a form of SOD1 found in some patients with inherited ALS (a substitution of glycine to alanine at codon 93). This was the first mutant form of SOD1 to be expressed in mice, and is the most widely used and well-characterized mouse model of ALS. Superoxide dismutase activity in these mice is intact, and the pathogenic effect of the mutant transgene appears to be gain of function, as is thought to occur in human patients. Death of motor neurons in these mice occurs in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and is associated with paralysis and muscle atrophy. Around 100 days of age, G93A-SOD1 mice characteristically experience the onset of paralysis in one or more limbs, due to loss of spinal cord motor neurons. Paralysis spreads rapidly throughout the body, culminating in death of 50% of the mice within seven weeks of disease onset.","We have previously reported the identification of a proneurogenic, neuroprotective aminopropyl carbazole (P7C3) discovered through a target-agnostic in vivo screen of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis (Pieper et al. (2010) Discovery of a Proneurogenic, Neuroprotective Chemical. Cell 142:39-51). Prolonged administration of P7C3 to mice suffering from pathologically high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus safely restored hippocampal structure and function with no observable physiologic side effects. Furthermore, extended administration of P7C3 to aged rats impeded hippocampal cell death and preserved cognitive ability as a function of terminal aging.","We have synthesized and characterized a variant of P7C3, known as P7C3A20, which has greater potency and pro-neurogenic efficacy than the parent compound. P7C3A20 differs structurally by replacement of the hydroxyl group at the chiral center of the linker with a fluorine, and the addition of a methoxy group to the aniline ring. P7C3A20 also displays a more favorable toxicity profile than P7C3, with no hERG channel binding, histamine receptor binding or toxicity to HeLa cells. We have also found that Dimebon, an antihistaminergic drug that is chemically related to P7C3 and reported to have anti-apoptotic and mitochondrial protective properties, displays modest efficacy in the same biologic assays employed to discover and characterize P7C3 and P7C3A20. However, it does so with substantially less potency and ceiling of efficacy (CoE).","Armed with three related chemicals, one having very high pro-neurogenic activity (P7C3A20), one having intermediate activity (P7C3), and one having only modest activity (Dimebon), we initiated efficacy studies in two animal models of neurodegenerative disease. We report above evidence of significant neuroprotective activity of P7C3A20 in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD). P7C3 exhibited intermediate activity in the PD animal model, and Dimebon showed no evidence of efficacy. The correlative activities of chemicals tested in the neurogenesis and PD assays were extended to eight additional analogs of P7C3. In every case, derivatives of P7C3 that were active in the neurogenesis assay were also active in the animal model of PD, and inactive variants were inactive in both assays.","Here, we have employed the same approach to score the activities of P7C3A20, P7C3 and Dimebon in a model of neuron death outside of the brain. To address this question, we utilized G93A-SOD1 mutant mice, a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) characterized by spinal motor neuron death associated with decreased motor functioning. As was observed for the rodent model of PD, we hereby report robust activity of P7C3A20 in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS, intermediate activity for P7C3, and no activity for Dimebon.","Results","Efficacy of Early Administration of P7C3 to G93A-SOD1 Mutant Mice Before Disease Onset.","As an initial test of efficacy in this disease model, we intraperitoneally administered P7C3 to female G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice using a treatment paradigm of 20 mg\/kg\/day P7C3, with vehicle administered to siblings, starting at 40 days of age. This treatment scheme was selected based on standard protocols for initial proof of concept screens in G93A-SOD1 mutant mice. To control for transgene copy number, mice were sibling matched between treatment groups, as per standard protocol, and quantitative PCR was performed to ensure that the copy number was maintained within the normal range. After initiation of P7C3 or vehicle treatment, date of onset of illness was determined by peak weight, and initial progression of disease was defined as the day at which mice fell to 10% below their maximum weight. Mice were also assessed daily by a standard measure of neurological severity score ranging from 0-4, with a higher number reflecting greater neurologic impairment. In addition to weight loss, a score of 2 or greater for two consecutive days was also employed as an indication of disease progression.","P7C3 treatment slowed disease progression in G93A-SOD1 mice, as indicated by delaying the time point at which mice dropped to 10% below their maximum weight. Treatment with P7C3 also delayed the age at which G93A-SOD1 mice advanced to a neurological severity score of 2. Furthermore, P7C3 treatment improved performance in the accelerating rotarod task as a function of disease progression, indicating a slowing of progression of motor impairment. This effect of slowing disease progression did not translate into increased survival of the animals, which is consistent with other interventions that have ameliorated disease symptoms in rodent models of ALS without improving survival.","Comparison of the Efficacy of Administration of P7C3A20, P7C3 and Dimebon at Disease Onset for Blocking Spinal Motor Neuron Cell Death in G93A-SOD1 Mutant Mice.","Based on the promising results of early (day 40) administration of P7C3 to G93A-SOD1 mutant mice, we next sought to determine whether P7C3A20, P7C3 or Dimebon could protect ventral horn spinal motor neurons when administered at the expected time of disease onset (day 80). We initiated administration of either P7C3, P7C3A20 or Dimebon, each at a dose of 20 mg\/kg\/day, and analyzed motor neuron cell survival by staining lumbar spinal sections for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). ChAT, the enzyme that synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, serves as a marker for spinal cord motor neurons. All sections were counted blind to treatment group in order to quantify motor neuron survival, and five mice for each treatment group were analyzed at 90, 100, 110 and 120 days. Each treatment group was compared to its own sibling-matched group that received the corresponding vehicle.","As shown in , the wild type bar represents the average number of spinal motor neurons in 110 day old, vehicle-treated, wild-type littermate mice. Because survival of motor neurons did not differ between the various vehicle treatment groups within any given time point, the results were combined for ease of presentation. For animals expressing the G93A-SOD1 transgene, the number of spinal cord motor neurons steadily declined between days 90 and 120 (). At every time point, treatment with P7C3A20 provided significant protection from spinal motor neuron cell death (). Treatment with Dimebon revealed a rate of motor neuron loss indistinguishable from vehicle treatment groups. P7C3, by contrast, provided intermediate protection on days 100 (p=0.048) and 110 (p=0.01). By the time mice reached 120 days of age, however, the P7C3-treated group showed the same degree of motor neuron cell loss as vehicle and Dimebon-treated groups. Representative immunohistological staining of spinal cord sections is shown in  from each of the five mice examined on day 110. Taken together, these results demonstrate that daily administration of P7C3A20 starting at disease onset effectively blocks spinal motor neuron cell death in G93A-SOD1 mutant mice. P7C3 was active by these measures, but to a lesser extent than P7C3A20, whereas Dimebon was completely devoid of neuroprotective activity.","Comparison of the Efficacy of Administration of P7C3A20, P7C3 and Dimebon at Disease Onset for Preserving Rotarod Performance in G93A-SOD1 Mutant Mice.","Having observed evidence of compound-mediated protection of spinal cord motor neurons, we next sought to determine whether motor performance might also be protected in these mice. Motor performance was monitored by the accelerating rotarod task standardly employed for evaluation of rodent models of ALS. We again initiated administration of P7C3, P7C3A20 or Dimebon on day 80, at 20 mg\/kg\/day, starting with no less than 20 mice per treatment group. Each animal in each group had its own sibling-matched vehicle control, and testing was conducted blind to treatment group. Rotarod training was initiated on day 50 for 2 days, and repeated weekly testing was conducted every 7 days thereafter. Each mouse was subjected to four trials of 600 seconds each, with a 20 minute recovery break between each trial. The latency time to fall was averaged across all 4 trials.","As shown in , performance in all treatment groups was equal at weeks 10 and 11. Treatment with the test compounds was initiated midway between weeks 11 and 12, on day 80, and at week 12 there were no significant differences between groups. By week 13, however, P7C3A20-treated mice showed significantly better performance (p=0.019) than the corresponding vehicle treatment group. In subsequent weeks, both P7C3 and Dimebon, as well as all vehicle groups, continued to decline at a steady pace in performance in this task, with P7C3A20-treated mice performing significantly better at each time point. Rotarod data were not collected beyond week 16 because too few animals survived to this time point for valid comparison across groups.","As noted with early initiation of administration (day 40) of P7C3, this intervention improved rotarod performance but did not extend survival of the mice. Also, despite improvement in rotarod performance in P7C3A20-treated mice when daily treatment was initiated on day 80, we did not observe any delay in other measures of disease progression (neurological score or weight loss). This observation may reflect the increased challenge for efficacy associated with administering compounds at the time of disease onset. Taken together, our results show that administration at the time of disease onset of the most potent member of the P7C3 series of neuroprotective drugs, P7C3A20, significantly improves performance of G93A-SOD1 mice in the accelerating rotarod test. Both P7C3 and Dimebon were insufficiently active to preserve motor function in the accelerating rotarod task at 20 mg\/kg\/day when administration was initiated at the time of disease onset.","Comparison of the Efficacy of Administration of P7C3A20, P7C3 and Dimebon at Disease Onset for Preserving Walking Gait in G93A-SOD1 Mutant Mice.","Analysis of walking gait offers a second means of assessing motor limb strength and coordination in rodent models of ALS. We conducted this analysis in the same mice used for the accelerating rotarod task, at three time points: 90, 118 and 132 days. Briefly, the front paws of each test mouse were dipped in orange tempera paint, and the back paws in blue tempera paint. Mice were then directed into a bisected PVC-tube placed on top of artists easel paper, such that the mouse was prompted to walk through the tunnel for a distance of 30 inches, leaving a trail of pawprints on the paper. Key parameters of the pawprints were then manually measured, as described in Methods. These parameters included front and back stride length, front and back width, and front-to-back paw distance ().","Twenty total measurements (10 on each side) for each parameter were recorded per mouse, and 20 mice per group were evaluated at the 90 and 118 day time points. All measurements were conducted blind to treatment group. Front and back widths showed no difference as a function of treatment group or disease progression until day 132, at which point P7C3A20 treatment was observed to preserve back width. Three of the measured parameters (back stride, back-front distance and front stride) showed significant improvement as a function of treatment with P7C3A20 earlier in the disease process, whereas none of these parameters in the walking gait analysis at 20 mg\/kg\/day were significantly improved by treatment with P7C3 or Dimebon ().","Back stride is defined as the distance between each successive back paw print on a single side, and one of the first features of disease in G93ASOD1 mutant mice is the onset of hind limb muscle weakness. As the disease progresses, mice are unable to move their hind limbs as much with each step, and back stride distance decreases. This was evident on day 118, in which P7C3, Dimebon and all vehicle treatment groups showed reduced back stride length (). Back stride measure was significantly (p=0.0016) preserved to a near-normal level in P7C3A20-treated mice (). Front stride is analogously defined as the distance between each successive front paw print on a single side, and as the disease progresses this measure also shortens as a consequence of the reduced hind limb stride that prevents the mouse from moving as great a distance with each step. Compromised front stride length thus confirms the deficit associated with back stride length, and we observed that on day 118 this measure was indeed reduced in P7C3, Dimebon and all vehicle treatment groups, yet preserved to almost normal levels in P7C3A20-treated mice ().","On day 132, there were insufficient numbers of mice in the P7C3-VEH and Dimebon-VEH groups that could participate in the task, due to complete paralysis of one or more limbs in the majority of the original test group. In the A20-VEH group, however, there were still ten P7C3A20 mice that were able to walk across the paper. Here, we observed that improvements in back stride and front stride were preserved, but there was no longer a difference in back-front distance. Back-front distance is defined as the distance between a back pawprint and the front pawprint on the same side. Early on, as the disease progresses in this animal model of ALS, the back-front distance steadily increases because the front limbs are able to extend normally, but the hindlimbs are not strong enough to formulate proper steps that should result in the back paw landing on top of the front paw print. It is evident in  that as assayed on day 118, treatment with P7C3A20 attenuated this increase in back-front distance. On day 132, however, the differences between VEH and P7CA20 treated mice in back-front distance were lost. At this stage, the disease was sufficiently advanced that this measure reflects the additional complication of front limb weakness, such that the mice were unable to extend their front limbs normally. As a result, the back-front distance declined, and there were no differences between P7C3A20 and its sibling-matched vehicle group. Taken together, our results of gait analysis demonstrate that treatment with P7C3A20 at the time of disease onset helps preserve walking gait in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS.","Analysis of Plasma, Brain and Spinal Cord Levels of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon.","LC\/MS\/MS quantification of brain and blood levels of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon confirmed that all three compounds were able to enter both the brain and spinal cord (). Notably, P7C3A20 displayed significantly greater protective efficacy compared to the other two compounds, despite the fact that P7C3A20 accumulated in spinal cord tissue at less than one-twentieth the concentration of P7C3. Dimebon, which displayed no protective efficacy in G93A-SOD1 mice, showed comparable levels of spinal cord accumulation to P7C3A20. These results parallel findings observed in evaluation of the neuroprotective efficacy of these same three compounds in MPTP-treated mice.","Discussion","The results of an unbiased screen of 1,000 chemically diverse, drug-like compounds led to the identification of an aminopropyl carbazole endowed with the capacity to enhance adult neurogenesis. This compound, designated P7C3, was found to act by blocking the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. We have also found that P7C3, P73A20 and other active analogs protect dopamingergic neurons of the substantia nigra from MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Here we have sought to determine whether this class of pro-neurogenic compounds might also block nerve cell death outside of the brain.","We selected P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon for testing because they display distinct levels of pro-neurogenic, neuroprotective activity when assayed for protection from apoptotic cell death of either newborn hippocampal neurons or following MPTP-toxicity to mature dopaminergic neurons. P7C3A20 displays the highest potency and ceiling of efficacy amongst these three molecules. We evaluated Dimebon because of extensive studies in human clinical trials, and its relative similarity in chemical structure to P7C3. When tested for its ability to protect mitochondrial membrane integrity following exposure of cultured cells to a calcium ionophore, Dimebon exhibited a protective potency between 100- and 1,000-fold lower than P7C3. Similarly modest activity was observed when Dimebon was assayed in our standard model of hippocampal neurogenesis. The reduced potency and efficacy of Dimebon has been further revealed in its inability to protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra from MPTP-toxicity. Finally, Dimebon has been extensively studied in human clinical trials of both Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Although early indications in a phase 2 trial suggested that Dimebon might be efficacious for Alzheimer's disease, the drug failed in two independent phase 3 trials. By testing the properties of these three related compounds in the present study of protective efficacy in an animal model of ALS, we sought to determine whether the hierarchy of activities amongst these three molecules might be preserved.","Encouragingly, we observe that P7C3A20 significantly blocks death of spinal motor neurons in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS. Importantly this protective effect is observed when administration of the compound is initiated at the time of disease onset, and it correlates with preservation of muscle strength and coordination as assessed through the accelerating rotarod test and analysis of walking gait. P7C3 offered intermediate protection from cell death when administered at the time of disease onset. Administration of P7C3 for a prolonged period of time by initiating treatment much earlier (day 40) did preserve motor function as assayed by the accelerating rotarod task. Dimebon offered no protection in any of these measures. Although efficacy of Dimebon in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (TGCRND8) mice has recently been reported, this drug appears too weakly active to afford any protection in the G93A-SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS.","We conclude that P7C3A20 and P7C3 display a hierarchy of activities analogous to their abilities to protect newborn hippocampal neurons from cell death, to block MPTP-mediated killing of mature dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and to protect spinal motor neurons from dying in G93A-SOD1 mutant mice. These collective observations give evidence that the relatively straightforward assay of monitoring adult hippocampal neurogenesis over a seven day period following direct administration of new analogs of P7C3 into the adult mouse brain may represent a trusted surrogate for the refinement of drug-like chemicals having neuroprotective activity. Over the past two years we have conducted a comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) study in order to improve the chemical scaffold of the P7C3 series of molecules. To date, we have synthesized over 250 analogs of P7C3, all of which have been evaluated in the in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay. Our goal in these efforts to foster the discovery of a neuroprotective drug is to maximize neuroprotective efficacy and alleviate real or perceived vulnerabilities in the chemical structures. These efforts include, but are not limited to, eliminating the carbazole bromines, eliminating the aniline ring, increasing biologic activity, decreasing lipophilicity, eliminating any toxicities including hERG channel binding, increasing solubility and reducing molecular weight. By use of the in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay, these ongoing SAR efforts with P7C3 analogs may offer an effective way to guide optimization of this series of molecules towards a neuroprotective drug candidate.","No safely tolerated, neuroprotective chemical is available for the treatment of any form of neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based upon the observations reported herein, we propose that a properly optimized variant of the P7C3 class of pro-neurogenic, neuroprotective chemicals may represent a viable candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.","Materials and Methods","Approval for the animal experiments described herein was obtained by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.","Statistics:","All p values were obtained with the Student's t test, by comparing treatment groups to their individual sibling-matched vehicle treatment groups.","Analysis of Motor Neuron Survival in the Spinal Cord:","After transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), lumbar spinal cord was dissected and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, cryo-protected in 30% sucrose at 4 degrees Celsius, and then embedded in OCT and sectioned on a Thermo-Fisher cryostat (HM550) at 30 \u03bcM thickness. Every seventh section was immunohistochemically stained with goat anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (Millipore). Briefly, sections were incubated in 1% HOfor 45 minutes at room temperature, rinsed in tris-buffered saline (TBS), treated with 0.1% Triton-TBS and then blocked for 60 minutes in 3% BSA, 5% donkey serum, 0.3% triton-100 in TBS. Sections were then incubated in goat anti-ChAT (1:100) in the same blocking solution overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. The next day, sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat biotin (1:200, Jackson Immune). Signal was amplified with an ABC kit from Vector Labs, and diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen. Immunostained tissue was then photographed at 4\u00d7 using a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized microscope, and the number of ChAT-positive neurons was counted in a blinded manner by two investigators, followed by normalization for ventral horn volume.","Rotarod:","Beginning on day 50, mice were trained on the accelerating rotarod using Colombia Instruments Rotamex-5. Training consisted of mice being placed on a rotarod moving at 5 rpm for 300 seconds. Mice were trained to stay on the rotarod for the entire 300 seconds. If a mouse fell, it was placed back on the rotarod and the 300 second trial was started again. Training took place on two consecutive days. On day 52, mice ran their first full rotarod test, as described in Current Protocols for Neuroscience. The rotarod began at 4 rpm and accelerated to 40 rpm over 600 seconds, increasing by 1.25 rpm every 20 seconds. The time to fall was automatically recorded. Each run was separated by 20 minutes to allow the mice to rest, and each mouse participated in 4 runs. Mice were run every seven days until the time at which they were unable to stay on the rotarod for more than 10 seconds for 3 trials.","Pawprint Analysis:","Five measurements were taken: front and back stride, front and back width, and front to back distance, as described in Current Protocols for Neuroscience. 20 total measures were taken for each measurement. Front and back stride were collected as a straight line from paw print to the following paw print. Front to back distance was collected as a straight line from back paw print to corresponding front paw print. Correspondence was based on closest front footprint. Width from paw print was measured by drawing a line at a 90 degree angle from the line connecting the stride previous and the paw being analyzed. The distance was recorded as length of line from paw to the stride line opposite the paw print. Mice attaining a score of three were eliminated from analysis as measurements could not be taken for a foot not being used in forward motion.","Pawprints were recorded at 90, 118 and 132 days of age. A 6 inch by 42 inch PVC pipe cut in half lengthwise was placed on top of a piece of easel paper (27\u2033\u00d730\u00bc\u2033). Each mouse had paws covered in non-toxic tempera paint (orange front, blue back) and was placed at one end of the pipe. The mouse ran quickly to the other end of the pipe when released, and the procedure was repeated until 10 clear back and front prints were made for each side while the subject was running. Pawprints were scanned using a hand scanner, and then visualized for measurement in Nikon Metamorph software. Measurements were based on established guidelines.","Neurological Scoring:","Neurological score was performed every day starting with compound treatment at 80 days, and was determined as follows: \u20180\u2019=full extension of hind legs away from lateral midline when the test mouse was suspended by its tail, and could hold this for 2 seconds, suspended 2-3 times; \u20181\u2019=collapse or partial collapse of leg extension towards lateral midline (weakness) or trembling of hind legs during tail suspension; \u20182\u2019=toes curl under at least twice during walking of 12 inches, or any part of foot drags along cage bottom\/table; \u20183\u2019=rigid paralysis or minimal joint movement, foot not being used for forward motion; and \u20184\u2019=mouse cannot right itself within 30 seconds from either side. Upon reaching a score of 2, animals were given a fresh Petri dish with wet food in the dish daily. When mice achieved a score of 4 for two consecutive days they were euthanized.","Weight Data:","Mice were weighed daily starting on the day of initiation of compound administration in order to assess disease progression and readjust compound dosage. A digital balance with a step of 0.01 g was used, and mice were placed in a small plastic container on the scale when weighed. Weight was taken between 11 am and 1 pm every day.","Quantitative PCR:","Quantitative PCR done in accordance with guidelines established by Jackson Laboratory protocol for SOD1-G93A mice.","Synthesis and Preparation of P7C3A20:","Preparation of compound as described above.","Pharmacokinetic Analysis of P7C3, P7C3A20 and Dimebon:","Analysis of compound as described above.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/143,755, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In another embodiment, an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted.","Preferred substituents for aryl and heteroaryl groups are selected from: halogen, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, \u2014R\u2032, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014SOR\u2032, \u2014SONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033SOR\u2032, \u2014N, \u2014CH(Ph), perfluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy and perfluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, where R\u2032 and R\u2033 are as defined above. Further preferred substituents are selected from: halogen, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014R\u2032, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014SOR\u2032, \u2014SONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033SOR, perfluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy and perfluoro(C1-C4)alkyl.","The substituent \u2014COH, as used herein, includes bioisosteric replacements therefor; see, e.g., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry; Wermuth, C. G., Ed.; Academic Press: New York, 1996; p. 203.","Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)\u2014(CH)q-U\u2014, wherein T and U are independently \u2014NH\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014 or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 2. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH2)\u2014B\u2014, wherein A and B are independently \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014NH\u2014, \u2014S\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032\u2014 or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 3. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula \u2014(CH)s-X\u2014(CH)t-, where s and t are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X is \u2014O\u2014, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014, \u2014S\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, or \u2014S(O)NR\u2032\u2014. The substituent R\u2032 in \u2014NR\u2032\u2014 and \u2014S(O)NR\u2032\u2014 is selected from hydrogen or unsubstituted (C1-C6)alkyl."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0365","num":"1023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0366","num":"1024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0367","num":"1025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0368","num":"1026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0369","num":"1027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0370","num":"1028"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"],"b":["6","6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0371","num":"1029"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0372","num":"1030"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0373","num":"1031"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"],"b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0374","num":"1032"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10B"],"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0375","num":"1033"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0376","num":"1034"},"figref":["FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B"],"sup":["\u2212\/\u2212 ","\u2212\/\u2212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0377","num":"1035"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"],"sup":["\u2212\/\u2212 ","\u2212\/\u2212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0378","num":"1036"},"figref":"FIG. 14","sup":["\u2212\/\u2212","\u2212\/\u2212","\u2212\/\u2212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0379","num":"1037"},"figref":"FIG. 15","sup":"\u2212\/\u2212"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0380","num":"1038"},"figref":"FIG. 16","sup":"\u2212\/\u2212 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0381","num":"1039"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0382","num":"1040"},"figref":["FIG. 18A","FIG. 18B","FIG. 18A","FIG. 18B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0383","num":"1041"},"figref":["FIG. 19A","FIG. 19B","FIG. 19C","FIG. 19A","FIG. 19B","FIG. 19C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0384","num":"1042"},"figref":["FIG. 20A","FIG. 20B","FIG. 20C","FIG. 20D","FIG. 20E","FIG. 20A","FIG. 20B","FIG. 20C","FIG. 20D","FIG. 20E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0385","num":"1043"},"figref":["FIG. 21A","FIG. 21B","FIG. 21C","FIG. 21D","FIG. 21A","FIG. 21B","FIG. 21C","FIG. 21D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0386","num":"1044"},"figref":["FIG. 22A","FIG. 22B","FIG. 22C","FIG. 22D","FIG. 22E","FIG. 22F","FIG. 22A","FIG. 22B","FIG. 22C","FIG. 22D","FIG. 22E","FIG. 22F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0387","num":"1045"},"figref":["FIG. 23A","FIG. 23B","FIG. 23A","FIG. 23B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0388","num":"1046"},"figref":["FIG. 24A","FIG. 24B","FIG. 24C","FIG. 24D","FIG. 24A","FIG. 24B","FIG. 24C","FIG. 24C","FIG. 24D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0389","num":"1047"},"figref":["FIG. 25A","FIG. 25B","FIG. 25A","FIG. 25B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0390","num":"1048"},"figref":["FIG. 26A","FIG. 26B","FIG. 26A","FIG. 26B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0391","num":"1049"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0392","num":"1050"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0393","num":"1051"},"figref":["FIG. 29A","FIG. 29B","FIG. 2"],"b":["29","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0394","num":"1052"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0395","num":"1053"},"figref":"FIG. 31","sup":["+","+","+","+","+"],"i":"C. elegans"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0396","num":"1054"},"figref":"FIG. 32","sup":["+","+"],"i":"C. elegans"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0397","num":"1055"},"figref":["FIG. 33A","FIG. 33B"],"b":["33","33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0398","num":"1056"},"figref":["FIG. 34A","FIG. 34B","FIG. 34A","FIG. 34B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0399","num":"1057"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0400","num":"1058"},"figref":["FIG. 36A","FIG. 36B"],"b":["36","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0401","num":"1059"},"figref":"FIG. 37"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
