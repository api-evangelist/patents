title: Search enhancement system and method having rankings, explicitly specified by the user, based upon applicability and validity of search parameters in regard to a subject matter
abstract: The system and method comprises enhancement of results for a search engine, wherein the results from the search engine are refined or reorganized, based upon information from an identified secondary source. The results obtained using a conventional search are compared against the identified secondary source, e.g. a ratings service, and are filtered and/or sorted appropriately. In some embodiments, identification of the secondary source, such as a ratings service comprising information which may supplement the subject of a search query, is based upon information entered by the user. In alternate embodiments, the secondary source is associated with a user, as part of general user-specified search parameters, wherein one or more parameters are consulted automatically for searches for appropriate subject matter.

No. 10\/685,749, originally entitled Search Enhancement System Having Personal Search Parameters, filed Oct. 14, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,165,119 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference thereto.","This Application is also a Continuation of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/685,747, entitled Search Enhancement System with Information from a Selected Source, filed Oct. 14, 2003, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference thereto.","The invention relates to the search and retrieval of information or content in a network environment. More particularly, the invention relates to the enhancement of search results, based upon information received from a user and\/or an external source.","Conventional search engines compare input search terms against metadata, to identify displayable results. Some search processes also allow for refined searching in input terms, against particular identified types of metadata. For example, during a search query at a search engine, a user may be able to enter either a word string, e.g. \u201cserial number\u201d, or a corresponding abbreviation, e.g. \u201cSN\u201d, to indicate that subsequent search terms should be applied against serial number metadata. Furthermore, some conventional search engines permit comparison of input search terms against full or partial text.","When applying conventional search technology, users typically obtain several pages of search results for any given search query, necessitating an extended period of review. For example, a common problem which is often encountered with conventional search queries is that the found set of matching sites or information sources, or documents is often too large, i.e. too broad, such as if too few search terms are entered within a search string, or if the search terms are too general. A user must often either manually browse through a large number of found sources to find relevant sites, or must perform a different search, typically having different terms and\/or additional terms, in the hopes of more accurately finding the desired sites and\/or information.","A similar problem that is also encountered with conventional search inquires is that the found set of matching sites, information sources, or documents is often too small, i.e. too narrow, such as if too many search terms are entered within a string, or if the search terms are too narrow in scope. A user is then typically required to perform one or more subsequent searches, typically having different terms and\/or fewer terms, in the hopes of finding a larger found set of desired sites and information.","Several structures and methods have been described for the searching and retrieval of information in a network environment.","J. Breese and C. Kadie, Methods and Apparatus for Tuning a Match Between Entities Having Attributes, U.S. Pat. No. 6,144,964, describe a matching of \u201centities having attributes, some of which have associated values. The values of the attributes may be adjusted based on number of entities that have values for a particular attribute so that the values decrease as the number increases. The attributes of the entities may be harmonized and provided with default values so that entities being matched have common attributes defined by the union of the attributes of the entities being matched. The attributes of the entities may be expanded and provided with default values so that the entities being matched have attributes that neither had originally. Match values may be normalized to provide a weight value which may be used to predict an attribute value of a new entity based on known attribute values of known entities. The weight values may be tuned such that relatively high weights are amplified and relatively low weights are suppressed.\u201d","B. Hazlehurst, S. Burke, and K. Nybakken, Intelligent Query System for Automatically Indexing in a Database and Automatically Categorizing Users, U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,353 B1, describe a system which \u201cdevelops multiple information spaces in which different types of real-world objects (e.g., documents, users, products) can be represented. Machine learning techniques are used to facilitate automated emergence of information spaces in which objects are represented as vectors of real numbers. The system then delivers information to users based upon similarity measures applied to the representation of the objects in these information spaces. The system simultaneously classifies documents, users, products, and other objects. Documents are managed by collators that act as classifiers of overlapping portions of the database of documents. Collators evolve to meet the demands for information delivery expressed by user feedback. Liaisons act on the behalf of users to elicit information from the population of collators. This information is then presented to users upon logging into the system via Internet or another communication channel. Mites handle incoming documents from multiple information sources (e.g., in-house editorial staff, third-party news feeds, large databases, World Wide Web spiders) and feed documents to those collators which provide a good fit for the new documents.\u201d","V. Berstis and H. Rodriguez, Blocking Saves to Web Browser Cache Based on Content Rating, U.S. Pat. No. 6,510,458 B1, describe a process in which a \u201cuser sets preference parameters that filter web page contents from being stored in the cache. The preferences relate to the web page's contents and attributes. Before caching the web page, the contents and attributes of the web page are filtered solely as a function of the web browser. Cache filters take a variety of forms, such as ratings filters, web page identifier filters, and key word filters, which scan accessed contents of a web page for user selected terms. The filtered web page is then blocked from entry in the browser's cache based on the filtering process. Conversely, a user sets preference parameters that filter web page contents to override the block from cache preferences. The browser responds by storing the filtered web pages that were previously designated as web pages not to be cached.\u201d","Other structures and methods for the searching and retrieval of information include: Y. Freund et al., AT&T Labs, MIT Laboratory for Computer Science; J. Shavlik et al., --University of Wisconsin-Madison; and J.

A user is often required to repeatedly input such parameters, along with other parameters that are unique to search.","Several structures and methods have been described for the searching and sorting of information, based on relevance, personal information, or profiles.","J. Driscoll, Method and System for Searching for Relevant Documents from a Text Database Collection, Using Statistical Ranking, Relevancy Feedback and Small Pieces of Text, U.S. Pat. No. 5,642,502, describes a search system and method \u201cfor retrieving relevant documents from a text data base collection comprised of patents, medical and legal documents, journals, news stories and the like. Each small piece of text within the documents such as a sentence, phrase and semantic unit in the data base is treated as a document. Natural language queries are used to search for relevant documents from the data base. A first search query creates a selected group of documents. Each word in both the search query and in the documents are given weighted values. Combining the weighted values creates similarity values for each document which are then ranked according to their relevant importance to the search query. A user reading and passing through this ranked list checks off which documents are relevant or not. Then the system automatically causes the original search query to be updated into a second search query which can include the same words, less words or different words than the first search query. Words in the second search query can have the same or different weights compared to the first search query. The system automatically searches the text data base and creates a second group of documents, which as a minimum does not include at least one of the documents found in the first group. The second group can also be comprised of additional documents not found in the first group. The ranking of documents in the second group is different than the first ranking such that the more relevant documents are found closer to the top of the list.\u201d","T. Gerace, Method and Apparatus for Determining Behavioral Profile of a Computer User, U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,396, describes a computer network method and apparatus which \u201cprovides targeting of appropriate audience based on psychographic or behavioral profiles of end users. The psychographic profile is formed by recording computer activity and viewing habits of the end user. Content of categories of interest and display format in each category are revealed by the psychographic profile, based on user viewing of agate information. Using the profile (with or without additional user demographics), advertisements are displayed to appropriately selected users. Based on regression analysis of recorded responses of a first set of users viewing the advertisements, the target user profile is refined. Viewing by and regression analysis of recorded responses of subsequent sets of users continually auto-targets and customizes ads for the optimal end user audience.\u201d","F. Herz, System for Customized Electronic Identification of Desirable Objects, U.S. Pat. No. 6,029,195, describes \u201ccustomized electronic identification of desirable objects, such as news articles, in an electronic media environment, and in particular to a system that automatically constructs both a \u201ctarget profile\u201d for each target object in the electronic media based, for example, on the frequency with which each word appears in an article relative to its overall frequency of use in all articles, as well as a \u201ctarget profile interest summary\u201d for each user, which target profile interest summary describes the user's interest level in various types of target objects. The system then evaluates the target profiles against the users' target profile interest summaries to generate a user-customized rank ordered listing of target objects most likely to be of interest to each user so that the user can select from among these potentially relevant target objects, which were automatically selected by this system from the plethora of target objects that are profiled on the electronic media. Users' target profile interest summaries can be used to efficiently organize the distribution of information in a large scale system consisting of many users interconnected by means of a communication network. Additionally, a cryptographically-based pseudonym proxy server is provided to ensure the privacy of a user's target profile interest summary, by giving the user control over the ability of third parties to access this summary and to identify or contact the user.\u201d","A. Lang and D. Kosak, Collaborative\/Adaptive Search Engine, U.S. Pat. No. 6,314,420 B1, describe a search engine system \u201cfor a portal site on the internet. The search engine system employs a regular search engine to make one-shot or demand searches for information entities which provide at least threshold matches to user queries. The search engine system also employs a collaborative\/content-based filter to make continuing searches for information entities which match existing wire queries and are ranked and stored over time in user-accessible, system wires corresponding to the respective queries. A user feedback system provides collaborative feedback data for integration with content profile data in the operation of the collaborative\/content-based filter. A query processor determines whether a demand search or a wire search is made for an input query.\u201d","D. Kravets, L. Chiriac, J. Esakov, and S. Wan, Search Data Processor, U.S. Pat. No. 6,363,377 B1, describe a \u201ctool to be used with a search engine for a information management system includes methods for refining, filtering, and organizing search queries and search results. A query tuner in the tool allows a user to automatically reformulate a query in order to find a reasonable number of matching documents from the search engine by selectively modifying individual search terms to be weaker or stronger and concurrently requesting a plurality of searches, each with a respectively different modified query. The tool also uses a dynamic filter which employs a dynamic set of record tokens to restrict the results of an arbitrary search query to selectively include or exclude records which correspond to the set of record tokens. The tool also includes a results organizer which aids the user in understanding and visualizing a large number of matching documents returned in response to a search query by clustering like items returned from the search. The query tuner, dynamic filter and results organizer may be used individually or in conjunction. The searched information management system may be consolidated or distributed and may span a global information network such as the Internet.\u201d","P. Biffar, Self-Learning and Self-Personalizing Knowledge Search Engine That Delivers Holistic Results, U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,212 B1, describes a search engine which \u201cprovides intelligent multi-dimensional searches, in which the search engine always presents a complete, holistic result, and in which the search engine presents knowledge (i.e. linked facts) and not just information (i.e. facts). The search engine is adaptive, such that the search results improve over time as the system learns about the user and develops a user profile. Thus, the search engine is self personalizing, i.e. it collects and analyzes the user history, and\/or it has the user react to solutions and learns from such user reactions. The search engine generates profiles, e.g. it learns from all searches of all users and combines the user profiles and patterns of similar users. The search engine accepts direct user feedback to improve the next search iteration One feature of the invention is locking\/unlocking, where a user may select specific attributes that are to remain locked while the search engine matches these locked attributes to all unlocked attributes. The user may also specify details about characteristics, provide and\/or receive qualitative ratings of an overall result, and introduce additional criteria to the search strategy or select a search algorithm. Additionally, the system can be set up such that it does not require a keyboard and\/or mouse interface, e.g. it can operate with a television remote control or other such human interface.\u201d","G. Cullis, Personalized Search Methods, U.S. Pat. No. 6,539,377 B1, describes a \u201cmethod of organizing information in which the search activity of previous users is monitored and such activity is used to organize articles for future users. Personal data about future users can be used to provide different article rankings depending on the search activity and personal data of the previous users.\u201d","Other structures and methods have been described which provide background information regarding the searching and sorting of information, based on relevance, personal information, or profiles, such as: J.

Furthermore, the determined subject matter of the search allows the enhanced results  to reflect more subjective results than are provided in an objective search engine alone.","Although the enhanced search system and methods of use are described herein in connection with a user terminal, the apparatus and techniques can be implemented for a wide variety of electronic devices and systems, such as personal computers, mobile devices, and other microprocessor-based devices, such as portable digital assistants or network enabled cell phones, or any combination thereof, as desired.","As well, while the enhanced search system and methods of use are described herein in connection with interaction between a user terminal and an application module and search engine across a network such as the Internet, the enhanced search system and methods of use can be implemented for a wide variety of electronic devices and networks or any combination thereof, as desired.","Accordingly, although the invention has been described in detail with reference to a particular preferred embodiment, persons possessing ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains will appreciate that various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claims that follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
