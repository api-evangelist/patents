Each of the device vulnerabilities is associated with at least one remediation technique. Each remediation technique associated with a particular device vulnerability remediates that particular vulnerability.

It will, nevertheless, be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended; any alterations and further modifications of the described or illustrated embodiments, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.","Generally, the present invention in one embodiment operates in the context of a network as shown in . System  includes a vulnerability and remediation database  connected by Internet  to subnet . In this exemplary embodiment, firewall  serves as the gateway between Internet  and the rest of subnet . Router  directs connections between computers  and each other and other devices on Internet . Server  collects certain information and provides certain data services that will be discussed in further detail herein.","In particular, security server  includes processor , and memory  encoded with programming instructions executable by processor  to perform several important security-related functions. For example, security server  collects data from devices , , , and , including the software installed on those devices, their configuration and policy settings, and patches that have been installed. Security server  also obtains from vulnerability and remediation database  a regularly updated list of security vulnerabilities in software for a wide variety of operating systems, and even in the operating systems themselves. Security server  also downloads a regularly updated list of remediation techniques that can be applied to protect a device from damage due to those vulnerabilities. In one embodiment, each vulnerability in remediation database  is identified by a vulnerability identifier, and the vulnerability identifier can be used to retrieve remediation information from database  (and from database , discussed below in relation to ).","In one embodiment, computers  and  each comprise a processor , , memory , , and storage , . Computer  executes a client-side program (stored in storage , loaded into memory , and executed by processor ) that maintains an up-to-date collection of information regarding the operating system, service pack (if applicable), software, and patches installed on computer , and the policies and configuration data (including configuration files, and elements that may be contained in files, such as *.ini and *.conf files and registry information, for example), and communicates that information on a substantially real-time basis to security server . In an alternative embodiment, the collection of information is not retained on computer , but is only communicated once to security server , then is updated in real time as changes to that collection occur.","Computer  stores, loads, and executes a similar software program that communicates configuration information pertaining to computer  to security server , also substantially in real time. Changes to the configuration registry in computer  are monitored, and selected changes are communicated to security server  so that relevant information is always available. Security server  may connect directly to and request software installation status and configuration information from firewall  and router , for embodiments wherein firewall  and router  do not have a software program executing on them to communicate this information directly.","This collection of information is made available at security server , and combined with the vulnerability and remediation data from source . The advanced functionality of system  is thereby enabled as discussed further herein.","Turning to , one sees additional details and components of the devices in subnet . Computers  and  are traditional client or server machines, each having a processor , , memory , , and storage , . Firewall  and router  also have processors ,  and storage , , respectively, as is known in the art. In this embodiment, devices  and  each execute a client-side program that continuously monitors the software installation and configuration status for that device. Changes to that status are communicated in substantially real time to security server , which continuously maintains the information in database . Security server  connects directly to firewall  and router  to obtain software installation and configuration status for those devices in the absence of a client-side program running thereon.","Processors , ,  may each be comprised of one or more components configured as a single unit. Alternatively, when of a multi-component form, processor , ,  may each have one or more components located remotely relative to the others. One or more components of processor , ,  may be of the electronic variety defining digital circuitry, analog circuitry, or both. In one embodiment, processor , ,  are of a conventional, integrated circuit microprocessor arrangement, such as one or more PENTIUM 4 or XEON processors from INTEL Corporation of 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, Calif., 95052, USA, or ATHLON XP processors from Advanced Micro Devices, One AMD Place, Sunnyvale, Calif., 94088, USA.","Memories , ,  may include one or more types of solid-state electronic memory, magnetic memory, or optical memory, just to name a few. By way of non-limiting example, memory may include solid-state electronic Random Access Memory (RAM), Sequentially Accessible Memory (SAM) (such as the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) variety or the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) variety), Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM), Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), or Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM); an optical disc memory (such as a DVD or CD ROM); a magnetically encoded hard drive, floppy disk, tape, or cartridge media; or a combination of any of these memory types. Also, memories , ,  may be volatile, nonvolatile, or a hybrid combination of volatile and nonvolatile varieties.","In this exemplary embodiment, storage , ,  comprises one or more of the memory types just given for memories , , , preferably selected from the non-volatile types.","This collection of information is used by system  in a wide variety of ways. With reference to , assume for example that a connection request  arrives at firewall  requesting that data be transferred to computer . The payload of request  is, in this example, a probe request for a worm that takes advantage of a particular security vulnerability in a certain computer operating system. Based on characteristics of the connection request , firewall  sends a query  to security server . Query  includes information that security server  uses to determine (1) the intended destination of connection request , and (2) some characterization of the payload of connection request , such as a vulnerability identifier. Security server  uses this information to determine whether connection request  is attempting to take advantage of a particular known vulnerability of destination machine , and uses information from database  (see ) to determine whether the destination computer  has the vulnerable software installed, and whether the vulnerability has been patched on computer , or whether computer  has been configured so as to be invulnerable to a particular attack.","Security server  sends result signal  back to firewall  with an indication of whether the connection request should be granted or rejected. If it is to be granted, firewall  passes the request to router  as request , and router  relays the request as request  to computer , as is understood in the art. If, on the other hand, signal  indicates that connection request  is to be rejected, firewall  drops or rejects the connection request  as is understood in the art.","Analogous operation can protect computers within subnet  from compromised devices within subnet  as well. For example,  illustrates subnet  with computer  compromised. Under the control of a virus or worm, for example, computer  sends connection attempt  to router  in an attempt to probe or take advantage of a potential vulnerability in computer . On receiving connection request , router  sends relevant information about request  in a query  to security server . Similarly to the operation discussed above in relation to , security server  determines whether connection request  poses any threat, and in particular any threat to software on computer . If so, security server  determines whether the vulnerability has been patched, and if not, it determines whether computer  has been otherwise configured to avoid damage due to that vulnerability. Security server  replies with signal  to query  with that answer. Router  uses response  to determine whether to allow the connection attempt.","In some embodiments, upon a determination by security server  that a connection attempt or other attack has occurred against a computer that is vulnerable (based on its current software, patch, policy, and configuration status), security server  selects one or more remediation techniques from database  that remediate the particular vulnerability. Based on a prioritization previously selected by an administrator or the system designer, the remediation technique(s) are applied (1) to the machine that was attacked, (2) to all devices subject to the same vulnerability (based on their real-time software, patch, policy, and configuration status), or (3) to all devices to which the selected remediation can be applied.","In various embodiments, remediation techniques include the closing of open ports on the device; installation of a patch that is known to correct the vulnerability; changing the device's configuration; stopping, disabling, or removing services; setting or modifying policies; and the like. Furthermore, in various embodiments, events and actions are logged (preferably in a non-volatile medium) for later analysis and review by system administrators. In these embodiments, the log also stores information describing whether the target device was vulnerable to the attack.","A real-time status database according to the present invention has many other applications as well. In some embodiments, the database  is made available to an administrative console running on security server  or other administrative terminal. When a vulnerability is newly discovered in software that exists in subnet , administrators can immediately see whether any devices in subnet  are vulnerable to it, and if so, which ones. If a means of remediation of the vulnerability is known, the remediation can be selectively applied to only those devices subject to the vulnerability.","In some embodiments, the database  is integrated into another device, such as firewall  or router , or an individual device on the network. While some of these embodiments might avoid some failures due to network instability, they substantially increase the complexity of the device itself. For this reason, as well as the complexity of maintaining security database functions when integrated with other functions, the network-attached device embodiment described above in relation to  is one possible embodiment.","In one embodiment, a software development kit (SDK) allows programmers to develop security applications that access the data collected in database . The applications developed with the SDK access information using a defined application programming interface (API) to retrieve vulnerability, remediation, and device status information available to the system. The applications then make security-related determinations and are enabled to take certain actions based on the available data.","In these exemplary systems, \u201cconfiguration information\u201d for each device may take the form of initialization files (often named *.ini or *.conf), configuration registry (such as, the Windows Registry on Microsoft WINDOWS operating systems), or configuration data held in volatile or non-volatile memory. Such configuration information often determines what and how data is accepted from other devices, sent to other devices, processed, stored, or otherwise handled, and in many cases determines what routines and sub-routines are executed in a particular application or operating system.","In one embodiment, security information management system is provided, wherein a database of potential vulnerabilities is maintained, along with data describing remediation techniques (patches, policy settings, and configuration options) available to protect against them. At least one vulnerability is associated in the database with multiple available remediation techniques. In one embodiment, the system presents a user with the list of remediation techniques available to protect against a known vulnerability, accepts the user's selection from the list, and executes the selected technique. In other embodiments, the system uses a predetermined prioritization schedule to automatically select among the available remediation techniques, then automatically executes the selected technique.","One embodiment of the present invention is a database of information about a plurality of devices, updated in real-time and used by an application to make a security-related decision. The database stores data indicating the installed operating system(s), installed software, patches that have been applied, system policies that are in place, and configuration information for each device. The database answers queries by one or more devices or applications attached by a network to facilitate security-related decision making. In one form of this embodiment, a firewall or router handles a connection request or maintenance of a connection based on the configuration information stored in the database that relates to one or both of the devices involved in the transmission.","In one embodiment, database  includes vulnerability and remediation information such that, for at least one vulnerability, multiple methods of remediating the vulnerability are specified. When the system has occasion to implement or offer remediation of a vulnerability, all known alternatives are presented that are relevant to the device or machine's particular configuration or setup. For example, when a vulnerability of a device is presented to an administrator, the administrator is given a choice among the plurality of remediation options to remediate the vulnerability. In some embodiments, the administrator can select a preferred type of remediation that will be applied if available and a fallback type. For example, an administrator may select application of a policy setting over installation of a software patch, so that the risk of disruption of critical business systems is minimized.","In other embodiments, an administrator or other user is presented with a set of user interface elements that identify multiple options for remediating and identifying the vulnerability. The administrator or user selects the method to be used, and that remediation is applied to the vulnerable device(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},"In use, a database maintains security status information on each device in a network, based on whether the device's operating system, software, and patches are installed and configured to meet a baseline level of security. A network gateway proxy blocks connection attempts from devices for which the database indicates a substandard security status, but allows connections from other devices to pass normally. The database is preferably updated on a substantially real-time basis by client-side software run by each device in the network.","Another form of the present embodiment includes a connection proxy that filters connections originating within the network. In particular, one embodiment employs a proxy that denies connection attempts originating with devices in the network when the originating device has a status, reflected in the database, that fails to meet predetermined security characteristics in terms of installed operating system and software, patch levels, and system policy and configuration registry information.","In this embodiment, router  serves as a connection proxy for devices and subnet , as will be understood by those skilled in the art. In addition to basic proxy functionality, however, router  accesses database  on security server  via the SDK at each connection attempt. If, for example, device  attempts to connect to any device where the connection must pass through the proxy server (router  in this example), such as a device on Internet , router  checks the security status of device  in database , using the real-time status therein to determine whether device  complies with one or more predetermined security policies. If it does, router  allows the connection to be made. If it does not, router  prevents the connection, preferably redirecting the connection to a diagnostic page that explains why the connection is not being made.","This system is illustrated by method  in . Method  begins with start point . The proxy (router  in the above example) receives a connection request at block , then retrieves the security status of the source device at block . This preferably uses the real-time updated status information from database  (see ) at decision block . If the security status indicates that the source device complies with the predetermined security policy, the proxy allows the connection at block . If not, the proxy refuses the connection at block  and redirects the connection to an explanation message (such as a locally generated web page or other message source) at block . In either case, method  ends at end point .","In possible embodiments, the determination and decision at block  apply a comprehensive minimum policy set that protects other devices in subnet  (see ) from viruses, trojans, worms, and other malware that might be inadvertently and\/or carelessly acquired due to the requested connection.","In another embodiment, a security information management system is provided, wherein client-side devices preferably collect and monitor information describing the operating system, software, and patches installed on the device(s), as well as configuration thereof. A database of this information is maintained, along with data describing vulnerabilities of available software and associated remediation techniques available for it. The system exposes an API to support security-related decisions by other applications. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) accesses the database to determine whether an actual threat exists and should be (or has been) blocked.","In another form of this embodiment, client software runs on each monitored device and reports configuration information to the database, so that the database has substantially real-time-current information.","The present embodiment of the present invention advantageously acquires the real-time status information from each client using client-side software. In this manner, a resource burden of monitoring is spread among the devices being monitored, and uses far fewer network resources in the process.","In these exemplary systems, \u201cconfiguration information\u201d for each device may take the form of initialization files (often named *.ini or *.conf), configuration registry (such as the Windows Registry on Microsoft Windows operating systems), or configuration data held in volatile or non-volatile memory. Such configuration information often determines what and how data is accepted from other devices, sent to other devices, processed, stored, or otherwise handled, and in many cases determines what routines and sub-routines are executed in a particular application or operating system.","In one embodiment, a system maintains a database of vulnerabilities and associated remediation techniques. The remediation techniques include software patches, policy settings or changes, and registry settings or changes. This multi-faceted provides novel flexibility in management of security issues, and convenience for security administrators in both determining available options and selecting remediation steps for vulnerable systems.","In another embodiment of the present invention, patches, policy changes, software updates, and configuration changes are rolled out to devices on a network using a staged roll-out technique. In this technique, the change is applied to a selected device or set of devices identified by an administrator. After a predetermined amount of time passes, unless the administrator has canceled the roll-out, the change is applied to an additional group of devices on the network. Third- and fourth-tier groups may also be identified by the administrator, where implementation of the remediation or upgrade is automatically effected in subsequent stages a predetermined amount of time after the preceding stage roll-out. Thus, if no failures are noted following a more limited roll-out (on a first set of devices), then the remediation or upgrade is automatically applied to other devices. If, on the other hand, an error or failure is observed, the subsequent roll-out can be canceled so that further failures and problems are avoided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIGS. 5B and 6"},"In one possible embodiment, provided is a platform and underlying back end that includes a logic engine and vulnerability data warehouse. It may easily integrate with and enable network security products such as IDS, scanners, or firewalls to intelligently reference and share the same vulnerability data set, and independently provide complete vulnerability remediation (patching) functionalities such as that provided by the patch management and vulnerability remediation application. Thereby, the technology may improve system accuracy and efficiencies, minimize false positives and false negatives, and provide policy compliance and enforcement capabilities.","The latest network compromises are combining qualities of viruses, worms, and denial of service attacks into new blended attacks. Additionally, blended attacks may now utilize metamorphic or polymorphic abilities to change their signatures to avoid detection. To mitigate these new risks, organizations are now deploying a multi-tiered network defense strategy comprised of a variety of network security components layered at the perimeter and to internal network machines and devices. The security components are managed separately, and possibly their data is ported into a Security Information Management System (SIMS) correlation engine.","However, network security components and correlation engines rely on signatures or anomalies, producing an ever-increasing quantity of data, including false positive, benign, and erroneous events. They also lack the intelligence to identify, reference, or remediate the vulnerabilities targeted by the attack. Furthermore, the time and cost to acquire, manage, and maintain these numerous network security components is overwhelming the end user. Therefore, more sophisticated technology is provided to resolve these performance and management issues.","In one embodiment, technology may be provided that addresses these requirements by making each security component smarter and provides managers with remote remediation options. Thereby, improving system performance and streamlining management processes.","In one embodiment, an intelligent integration platform and SDK are provided to meet the above requirements.","In one embodiment, security products are enhanced and system intelligence may be provided. The same vulnerability data warehouse information is shared with the products so that more intelligent actions may then be taken to mitigate complex threats.","One embodiment cross-references the threat's identifier with the target's configuration. The threat's CVE ID, or other identifier, and the destination IP address are fed into the logic engine where it cross-references the threat with the machine's existing OS, application, and patch configuration profile. An answer is returned accurately indicating if the machine is vulnerable.","In one embodiment, network vulnerabilities are identified. The platform may independently identify which network machines and devices have vulnerabilities by querying a client agent, or a device's OS or firmware directly.","One embodiment proactively remediates the vulnerability. Once a vulnerability is identified, a remediation function may be provided that may remotely and automatically deploy the appropriate update to each machine or device, install it, and document it with change tracking and audit trail reports.","Examples of Anti-Vulnerability applications that may be integrated into network security products for enterprise and small office home office (SOHO) networks when integrated with one embodiment, via the SDK, will be described.","In one embodiment, update or patch deployment are provided, which remotely remediate network vulnerabilities and provide policy compliance and enforcement capabilities. And, for the consumer market, it may additionally support non-security related updates such as application version, performance, and bug-fix upgrades.","In one embodiment, an IDS may be provided that accurately determines if the targeted machine is actually vulnerable to an attack; virtually eliminates false positives and false negatives; and adds vulnerability remediation and policy compliance and enforcement functionalities.","In one embodiment, a scanner may be provided that virtually eliminates false positive and false negatives, and adds vulnerability remediation and policy compliance and enforcement functionalities.","In one embodiment, a firewall may be provided that virtually eliminates false positive and false negatives, preventing the security system from denying valid traffic to the organization\u2014self-inflicted denial of service attacks\u2014and adds vulnerability remediation, and policy compliance and enforcement functionalities.","In one embodiment, vulnerability management may be provided, as set forth above.","In one embodiment, multiple products are provided including an IDS, scanner, and firewall. Each may communicate with the same back-end data warehouse, sharing the same vulnerability information, attaining intelligence and more accurate information about the target and its vulnerabilities, thereby more effectively mitigating complex threats.","In one embodiment, change management may be provided, which may automatically create a change request in the system, specifying what update\/patch is applicable to what system or groups of systems by vulnerability. After approval of the request, they may automatically deploy and install the update\/patch. Finally, they may also verify correct operation after installation and automatically provide all necessary documentation and logging required.","Lastly, the platform may also provide product upgrades and signature updates to each of these various security products.","The platform is comprised of the following software components: SDK, client agent, logic engine, and data warehouse stored on a dedicated on-site server. Network operations center (NOC) Servers periodically synchronize the customers' servers with the latest vulnerability and update data. See .","The same client agent and on-site server support all security applications that are integrated onto the platform, thereby providing the added anti-vulnerability functionalities presented in the previous section.","There are two system requirements: TCP\/IP connectivity, and supported network machines and devices. In one embodiment, platforms supported are set forth below in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"All Windows Operating Systems and their applications"]},{"entry":[{},"All UNIX variants"]},{"entry":[{},"Cisco routers and firewalls"]},{"entry":[{},"Toshiba network devices"]},{"entry":[{},"Netgear network devices"]},{"entry":[{},"Linksys network devices, including wireless access points"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Platform support is scalable to any network size or architecture; consumer, small office home office (SOHO), enterprise, and distributed networks.","In one embodiment, technology may be provided that includes a backend platform that includes a logic engine and vulnerability data warehouse. It may easily integrate with and enable network security products such as IDS, scanners, or firewalls to intelligently reference and share the same vulnerability data set, and independently provide complete vulnerability remediation (patching) functionalities such as that provided by the patch management and vulnerability remediation application, update application and the intelligent IDS. Thereby, the technology may improve system accuracy and efficiencies, minimize false positives and false negatives, and provide policy compliance and enforcement capabilities.","As shown in , the technology may meet market requirements, presented in the next section.","For example, networks are probed at an ever-increasing frequency for vulnerabilities, which may be exploited with compromise attacks. To protect the network, administrators have traditionally set up perimeter defense strategies.","These strategies generally call for network managers to lock down core servers, and monitor\/scan\/filter all incoming and outgoing traffic at the network perimeter with several network security products such as antivirus and firewalls to identify and attempt to neutralize hackers and malicious code. In the past, these strategies worked well, however new threats are becoming more complex.","The latest malicious code may combine qualities of viruses, worms, and direct compromise attacks into new blended attacks. Virus payloads are becoming more complex and by using metamorphic or polymorphic abilities, viruses are able to change their signatures to avoid the fingerprint-type filtering that most applications employ.","To mitigate these new risks, organizations deploy a multi-tiered network defense strategy comprised of a variety of additional network security products layered at the perimeter and to internal network machines and devices. Such network security products include antivirus, firewall, scanners, and network and host based intrusion detection systems.","Each of these systems is based on specific signatures, rules, or anomalies of each attack and their variants, and do not identify and remediate the specific network vulnerabilities the attack is targeting. So each attack, and its variants, must be identified and analyzed, a signature prepared, then finally deployed to each point product on each customer's network. This process is uncoordinated among multiple disparate systems, and creates an ever-increasing number of signatures producing more and more attack alerts requiring immediate attention\u2014many of which are erroneous. The security components are managed separately, and possibly their data is ported into a security information management system (SIMS) correlation engine.","Additionally, to proactively remediate the vulnerabilities the malicious code is targeting, administrators quickly and diligently update or \u201cpatch\u201d each network machine and device, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Further compounding the burden on administrators, best practice and government compliance directives may require higher standards of network security and integrity to protect consumer privacy, and they are documented with change tracking and audit trail reports.","Therefore, it is increasingly difficult and costly to effectively mitigate new threats and manage numerous systems\u2014particularly in an environment of rising security standards and policy compliance requirements.","Thus, the multi-tiered network defense strategy is falling short primarily for four reasons. First, there is an inability of multi-tiered network security products to communicate and share information necessary to mitigate blended threats, and minimize false positives and false negatives. The vulnerabilities targeted by malicious code are not accurately identified nor proactively remediated. The associated excessive aggregate cost of ownership of multiple systems. The excessive administrative burden and cost of managing and maintaining multiple systems.","Hence, there is a need to integrate systems, share information intelligently to better defend against blended threats, reduce management and cost requirements, and automate vulnerability identification and remediation functionalities, as presented in the high-level requirements.","In one embodiment, technology is provided to meet the following market requirements: integrate network security products to share information; provide system intelligence; and remediate network vulnerabilities.","In one embodiment, technology may integrate with and enable network security products to intelligently reference and share information from the same vulnerability data set, provide vulnerability identification and remediation functionalities, and efficiently meet policy compliance and enforcement requirements.","In one embodiment, the platform is a complimentary network security technology. When integrated into the defense strategy, it adds intelligence that more accurately and efficiently mitigates blended threats and offloads the time-consuming functions that burden network administrators.","In one embodiment, the platform enables network security products to share information via its proprietary logic engine to automatically cross-reference the threat identifier with the targeted machine's configuration to determine if it is actually vulnerable to that threat. Previously separate and uncoordinated processes are now more intelligent and automated, resulting in improved system accuracy and efficiency. Therefore the need to layer more and more point products and add a SIMS is reduced, in-turn decreasing the amount of data\u2014particularly erroneous data\u2014to manage. Subsequently, the costs to acquire, operate, and manage the additional multiple point products, and the need to implement a SIMS, are also reduced.","In one embodiment, the platform may also remotely and proactively remediate vulnerabilities by first determining which updates are needed and compatible with each machine or device, taking into account the OS, applications, or firmware installed. Then, the updates may be deployed, installed, and validated. Thereby, policy compliance is effectively and efficiently enforced, and documented.","In one embodiment, the present technology fulfills market requirements noted in the previous section. For example, it may integrate network security products and provides system intelligence. The same vulnerability data warehouse information is shared with all products so that more intelligent actions may then be taken to mitigate complex threats.","Still yet, it may cross-reference the threat's identifier with the target's configuration. The threat's CVE ID, or other identifier, and the destination IP address are fed into the logic engine where it cross-references the threat with the machine's existing OS, application, and patch configuration profile. An answer is returned accurately indicating if the machine is vulnerable.

In one embodiment, a patch management and vulnerability remediation solution is provided. The technology enables products to add accurate vulnerability identification, remediation, verification, and policy compliance functions. With such technology, products may gain intelligence, accuracy and efficiency, eliminate false positives and false negatives, and ensure policy compliance, thereby saving the organization time and money. Such functionalities and benefits are available for both the enterprise and SOHO networks. And, for the consumer market, it may additionally support non-security related updates such as application version, performance, and bug-fix updates for widely distributed programs, which may optimize system performance and enhance the consumer experience.","In one embodiment, an IDS is provided. IDS products attempt to identify malicious code by signatures at both the network and host client level. While they may be able to identify malicious code by CVE ID or other identifier, and targeted machines by IP address, but they generally do not have the intelligence to determine if the any of the machines on the network are susceptible to that attack, or with finer granularity, if any machine has a specific vulnerability to that specific attack, or if the targeted vulnerability has already been patched. For example, if the malicious code has been written as a Windows based attack targeting a Windows vulnerability, is the Destination IP actually running Windows, or a UNIX variant? And, if Windows, is it vulnerable to the attack, or has it already been patched? IDS do not have the intelligence to answer these questions, and incident alerts are generated indiscriminately. Lastly, even if the targeted machine is vulnerable\u2014it remains unremediated\u2014an IDS does not have the capability to remediate it.","With the present embodiment, a product architect can integrate functionalities listed in the previous section to enable the IDS to access the Anti-Vulnerability logic engine and platform. It may then have the intelligence to determine if any machine on the network is susceptible to the attack, remediate the vulnerability, mitigate the attack, and verify policy compliance. Now, if no machines were susceptible to the attack, it is identified as an event but not an incident, no further data or alert is generated, and a management response is not required. Integrated products may gain intelligence, accuracy, and efficiency, eliminate false positives and false negatives, and ensure policy compliance, thereby saving the organization time and money. Such functionalities and benefits are available for both the enterprise and SOHO networks.","In one embodiment, scanners may be provided. Vulnerability scanners assess each machine on the network for vulnerabilities, and create lists of potential vulnerabilities to the system managers. The lists commonly contain many false positives and false negatives, burdening the system and managers with inaccuracies.","With the present embodiment, a product architect can integrate functionalities listed in the previous section to enable the scanner to access the logic engine and platform, and then have the intelligence to determine if the machine has actual vulnerabilities, remediate them, and verify policy compliance. Integrated products may gain intelligence, accuracy, and efficiency, eliminated false positives and false negatives, and ensured policy compliance, thereby saving the organization time and money.","In one embodiment, a firewall may be provided. \u201cSmart\u201d firewalls are based in part on signatures and other similar functionalities as the IDS products described above.","With the present embodiment, the firewall can determine whether an attack is valid or a false positive, thereby preventing the security system from denying valid traffic to the organization\u2014self-inflicted DoS attacks. Such functionalities and benefits may be available for both the enterprise and SOHO networks.","In one embodiment, vulnerability management may be provided. Vulnerability management products enable managers to set policy and identify potential network vulnerabilities. They typically do not accurately identify each vulnerability on each network machine and device, nor remediate each vulnerability, meeting policy compliance enforcement requirements.","The present embodiment offers similar functionalities and benefits as the patch deployment products described above. In short, it enables products to add accurate vulnerability identification, remediation, verification, and policy compliance and enforcement. Such functionalities and benefits are available for both the enterprise and SOHO networks.","To this end, multiple products may be provided: IDS, scanner, firewall, and vulnerability management. Each product functions as the individual products noted above. Each may be deployed and operated on the network in a multi-tiered network defense strategy. They may be disparate system, and their signatures and update deployment schedules may vary. Therefore, the probability of mitigating a new and complex threat decreases, while management requirements and cost increases.","In one embodiment, they each may communicate with the same backend data warehouse, sharing the same vulnerability information, attaining intelligence and more accurate information about the target and its vulnerabilities, thereby more effectively mitigating complex threats. It may also enable the products to add accurate vulnerability identification, remediation, verification, and policy compliance and enforcement functionalities.","In one embodiment, change management (CM) may be provided. Existing CM applications control the documentation and logging of change throughout the enterprise. These applications ensure that an organization maintains consistent records of what happened and when. Currently administrators must independently recognize that a security patch\/update must be deployed to a computer or group of computers.","The user enters the request in the system, through the pipelined process of change management the request would be approved, the patch\/update would be manually installed by a user, then documented in the change management software that the process has been completed. While CM software assists in documentation, very little if any assistance may be provided to identify the patches\/updates needed, nor verifying correct function after the update\/patch is installed.","With the current possible embodiment, change management integration may greatly streamline this process further reducing total cost of ownership, ease of use, and a higher standard of documentation. The products may then automatically create a change request in the system, specifying what update\/patch is applicable to what system or groups of systems by vulnerability. After approval of the request, they may automatically deploy and install the update\/patch. Finally, they may also verify correct operation after installation and automatically provide all necessary documentation and logging required.","Lastly, one possible embodiment may also provide product upgrades and signature updates to each of these various security products\u2014including all of the technology benefits such as ensuring compliance of signature versions, logging, reporting, and verification of installation.","Thus, one possible embodiment includes an intelligent platform that may supplement any existing defense strategy. Once integrated with the technology, security products may share the same vulnerability data set to improve automation and accuracy\u2014increasing efficiencies and minimizing false positives and false negatives. It also enables remote identification, management, and remediation of network vulnerabilities, and provides update deployment, validation, and reporting capabilities. Thereby, the technology improves network security and integrity, mitigation of blended threats, while increasing productivity, reducing total cost ownership, and more effectively and efficiently attaining policy compliance and enforcement requirements.","One embodiment provides IDS intelligence, accuracy and remote patching functions\u2014IDS data output integrated with the aforementioned platform via the SDK. The platform's underlying backend including a logic engine and vulnerability data warehouse provides the added functions and performance.","Conventional IDS produce an ever-increasing quantity of alert data, including erroneous and false positive data. They also lack the intelligence to identify or remediate the vulnerabilities targeted by the attack. Furthermore, the cost of the acquiring, managing, and maintaining conventional IDS is overwhelming the end user.","Therefore, a more sophisticated, intelligent technology is provided to resolve these issues. In one embodiment, an intelligent IDS is provided to meet market requirements. The alert data output from a distribution of Snort is integrated with the platform via the SDK, which may add the following functions.","In one embodiment, it cross-references the threat's identifier with the target's configuration. The CVE ID, or other identifier, and the Destination IP address are fed into the logic engine where it cross-references the threat with the machine's configuration profile.","In one embodiment, it virtually eliminates false positives and false negatives. The backend accurately determines in real time if the targeted machine is susceptible to the attack. And, if the machine is not susceptible, it is filtered and reported back as an event and not an incident. No further data or alert is generated, and a management response is not required.","In one embodiment, it remotely remediates the vulnerability. When a machine is identified as vulnerable to an attack, an incident, a remediation function may be provided to the administrator to remotely deploy the appropriate update to the machine or device, install it, verifies the files and hashes, and document it with change tracking and audit trail reports.","Table 3 sets forth a plurality of features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Supports Windows and UNIX variants"},{"entry":"Determines if targeted machine is vulnerable to an attack in real time"},{"entry":"Filters out erroneous, benign and false positive alerts"},{"entry":"Remotely patches targeted vulnerabilities in one click"},{"entry":"Installs in minutes"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"To this end, erroneous, benign, and false positive data is filtered out, and incidents may be remotely remediated.
