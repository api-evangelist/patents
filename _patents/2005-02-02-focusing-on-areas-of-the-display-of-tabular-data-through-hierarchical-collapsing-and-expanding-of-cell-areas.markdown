title: Focusing on areas of the display of tabular data through hierarchical collapsing and expanding of cell areas
abstract: A method, apparatus and program product for focusing the display of tabular data wherein the display has multiple rows and columns of cells. A computer running a tabular data application includes a display for displaying the tabular data. The tabular data application includes a routine for defining a user defined area in the tabular data display in a focused display. The routine places indicators at the top, bottom, right side and left side of the focused display. The indicators may be one of an expand indicator or a collapse indicator. A movable cursor in the tabular data display is used to select at least one of the indicators for focusing the display. The routine in the tabular data application expands or collapses the display of tabular data to give a focused display. The expanding or collapsing of the display is determined by whether the selected indicator is an expand indicator or a collapse indicator.

No. 5,450,538 issued Sep. 12, 1995 to Glaser et al. for GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE CONTROL FOR EXPANSION AND RE-SIZING OF DATA FIELDS IN FORMS discloses a computer interface system employing a menu-graphical user interface for the entry of text data in a data store receiving user inputs for controlling the graphical user interface.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,168 issued Sep. 7, 1999 to Simborg et al. for COLLAPSIBLE FLOWSHEET FOR DISPLAYING PATIENT INFORMATION IN AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD discloses a user interface which presents patient data on a computer display to a health care provider as a flowsheet including an array of category labels with indications of whether the category is in a collapsed state or an expanded state.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,585 issued Jul. 4, 2000 to Kraft et al. for SYSTEM FOR DIRECTLY ACCESSING FIELDS ON ELECTRONIC FORMS, discloses a computer system which provides a graphical user interface to assist a user in completing electronic forms.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,115,759 issued Sep. 5, 2000 to Sugimura et al. for SYSTEM FOR DISPLAYING DESIRED PORTIONS OF A SPREADSHEET ON A DISPLAY SCREEN BY ADJOINING THE DESIRED PORTIONS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INCREASING THE MEMORY CAPACITY discloses a data processing apparatus having a spreadsheet data storing section for storing spreadsheet data, a spreadsheet creating section for creating a spreadsheet consisting of at least one row and at least one column and a display section for displaying the spreadsheet on a screen. The data processing apparatus includes an inputting section for designating a row or a column to be subjected to a non-display operation, a non-display controlling section for removing row or column data in the non-display operation, and controlling the display section to display a modified spreadsheet by moving rows or columns previously located adjacent to the removed row or column into adjoining relation.","U.S. Pat.

Methods are provided for specifying an area of the model to track and capture various versions of the base model.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,711,715 B1 issued Mar. 23, 2004 to Grealish for METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENT STORAGE AND RESTORATION OF DISPLAY STATE DATA discloses storage and restoration of display state data for a display object having a display state that can be altered by display state changes made to other display objects in a hierarchical data structure where the display state of the display object being stored has more than on superior display object.","U.S. Patent Application Publication Number US 2003\/0188256 A1, published Oct. 2, 2003 by Augeglia et al. for SYSTEM AND METHOD IN AN ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET FOR COPYING AND POSTING DISPLAYED ELEMENTS OF A RANGE CELLS, and US 2003\/0188257 A1, US 2003\/0188258 A1, and US 2003\/188259 A1 published Oct. 2, 2003 by Aureglia et al. for SYSTEM AND METHOD IN AN ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET FOR DISPLAYING AND\/OR HIDING RANGE OF CELLS, all disclose a method, system and computer program for copying and pasting, in an electronic multidimensional spreadsheet, displayed elements of a source range of cells onto a destination range of cells, the source range of cells including one or more elements displayed on a user interface and one or more hidden elements, the elements being contiguous and aligned along a given spreadsheet dimension.","European Patent Application EP 1 256 890 A2 published Nov. 13, 2002 for Vosheli for SYSTEMS AND METHODS PROVIDING DYNAMIC SPREADSHEET FUNCTIONALITY discloses a system and method for supporting and\/or enabling the creation of dynamic reports and\/or data presentations in connection with a spreadsheet-based formatting and calculation capabilities. The disclosed system and method generally include an electronic spreadsheet having a plurality of cells that are arrayed in a defined number of columns and rows, a database in communication with the electronic spreadsheet, and an expansion formula that functions to control retrieval of data from the database and automatically varies\/expands at least one of the defined number of columns and rows to accommodate the data retrieval.","An article by Torres, SPREADSHEET DATA VISUALIZATION, Research Disclosure n334 02-92 (February 1992) discusses techniques to enhance processing of spreadsheet or deficiencies including the spreadsheet to be oriented along different axes in order to see the data from different perspectives, and to allow temporary hide\/remove\/add of rows and columns, as well as zoom in\/out.","The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided through the provision of a system to allow a user to focus on arbitrary regions of relevant data. The user hierarchically hides sections of data over arbitrary two dimension regions of the spreadsheet. This is especially useful within a large spreadsheet of numbers or images.","The present invention provides a system and method for focusing on relevant information by selectively collapsing the irrelevant cells. This may be done manually or automatically based on selection of relevant cells for exposing only the highlighted cells of interest.","The present invention provides a system and method wherein the user drags a cursor over a cell that has collapsible neighbors. The system and method further includes icons indicating the direction of collapsing. After a collapse operation is complete, a visual representation allowing the user to expand the cells. These indicators may take the form of plus (+) or minus (\u2212) icons, directional arrows, ellipsis, or other graphic icons to indicate the two possible operations of collapsing and expanding regions of interest.","System and computer program products corresponding to the above-summarized methods are also described and claimed herein.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention.
