{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a safety device for an undersea vehicle using lithium batteries. More particularly, this invention is to a pressure relief valve system for venting Li\/SO2 vapors created by lithium batteries to prevent damage to an undersea vehicle.","The long shelf-life and higher watt-hours per unit volume of lithium batteries as compared to other contemporary batteries is well known. Marine designers have included lithium batteries in unmanned submersibles where a compact high-power electrical source is needed to produce sufficient power for prolonged operations at considerable depth.","One of the major consequences of using high power density lithium batteries, however, is that they can produce considerable amounts of pungent and toxic Li\/SOvapors at temperatures above their venting point of about 200\u00b0 F. Such temperatures could be created in the event of a shipboard fire in either the magazine where the submersibles are stored or in an adjacent compartment. One instance where ambient temperatures increased from 200\u00b0 F. to about 251\u00b0 F. caused one lithium-battery equipped undersea vehicle to have its nosepiece portion separate from its body portion. When Li\/SOvapors reached oven temperatures of about 251\u00b0 F., internal pressures in the range between 100 psi and 200 psi were created by the Li\/SOvapors in the interior of the vehicle and the nose portion separated. Irrespective of the advantages of having a lithium battery power source aboard, the undersea vehicle could not be used until this damage was repaired.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a reliable internal pressure relief valve system for an undersea vehicle containing lithium batteries in an undersea vehicle capable of diving to considerable depths.","An object of the invention is to provide a pressure relief valve system for an undersea vehicle.","Another object of the invention is to provide a pressure relief valve system for an undersea vehicle containing lithium batteries.","Another object of the invention is to provide a reliable pressure relief valve system having two pressure relief valves fluidly communicating with an interior containing lithium batteries.","Another object of the invention is to provide a pressure relief valve system for an undersea vehicle containing lithium batteries and being capable of diving to considerable depths.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to a combination pressure relief valve system and undersea vehicle that vents pressurized gas from lithium batteries to ambient. An undersea vehicle has a pair of hollow pylons each having a passageway fluidly communicating with an interior of the undersea vehicle. A pressure relief valve is mounted on each pylon, and each pressure relief valve has a body portion having an inner bore fluidly communicating with a passageway. An elongate valve plug is interposed between each passageway and ambient, and the valve plug has a lateral bore and a circumferentially disposed O-ring. A nose portion is secured to the body portion, and the nose portion has a pair of laterally aligned bores aligned with the lateral bore of the elongate valve plug. A wire extends through the laterally aligned bores and lateral bore. The O-ring and wire retain the valve plug interposed between the passageway and ambient. When the pressurized gas exceeds a predetermined threshold in a passageway, the frictional force of the O-ring is overcome and the wire is sheared to displace a valve plug and vent the pressurized gas to the ambient. A stem portion of the valve plug extends through the nose portion to visually indicate that the pressurized gas has exceeded the predetermined threshold to permit appropriate action.","Referring to , pressure relief valve system  of the invention vents gases from an unmanned undersea vehicle  that could otherwise build in pressure and possibly compromise the integrity of a pressure hull . Undersea vehicle  can rapidly transit underwater and can be dropped through air  from an aircraft (not shown). Vehicle  is capable of diving to considerable depths in water , in excess of five hundred feet. Undersea vehicle  has lithium batteries  in an interior  in hull  and\/or in a pair of hollow pylons  located outside of and below hull .","An open duct  extends from the aft part  of each hollow pylon  to fluidly communicate with interior . Ducts  could couple harmful levels of pressurized vapors, or gas either to or from interior . This pressurized gas can include Li\/SOvapors as well as other vapors from other types of lithium batteries having other lithium chemistries. If batteries  are not contained in pylons  but are only in interior , then ballast (not shown) can be included in pylons  to help keep undersea vehicle  properly oriented. Irrespective if whether batteries  or ballast is contained in each pylon , a fluidly communicating passageway  extends between ducts  and a forward open end part  of each pylon  for venting pressurized gases as explained below. Ducts  may also contain electrical leads (not shown) that reach from batteries  in pylons , into interior , and to control\/sensor\/propulsion modules (not shown) for operating vehicle  during its successful completion of a mission.","Referring also to , , and , a pressure relief valve  of pressure relief valve system  is fitted into and secured in forward open end part  of each pylon  by bolts . An O-ring  on valve  prevents ambient air  or water  from leaking into passageway  in hollow pylon  and\/or pressurized gases from leaking from passageway  into the ambient.","Each pressure relief valve  is centered on a longitudinal axis  that extends through each hollow pylon . Each pressure relief valve  has a rounded cone-shaped nose portion  connected to an essentially cylindrically-shaped body portion  by four threaded bolts . Threaded bolts  each extend through a separate bore  in nose portion  to engage mating threads in a separate threaded bore  of body portion . After being tightened, bolts  securely hold nose portion  and body portion  together.","Each body portion  is machined to have four orthogonally disposed rectangular-shaped slots  communicating with an interior  within in an outer bore  coaxially extending in nose portion  and body portion . Body portion  has an inner bore  inwardly coaxially disposed with respect to outer bore . Inner bore  fluidly communicates with passageway  in pylon , and an angled annular shoulder  is machined in body portion  to span the transition between outer bore  and inner bore .","Each nose portion  has an intermediate bore  and central bore  both coaxially disposed with respect to outer bore . Bores ,  and  fluidly communicate with interior  and slots .","An elongate valve plug  has a round stem portion  sized to permit axial sliding displacement along longitudinal axis  in central bore  of nose portion , and a round valve head  sized to permit axial sliding displacement along longitudinal axis  in outer bore . Valve head  has an angled annular shoulder  oriented for substantially contiguously abutting angled annular shoulder  on body portion  when outer end  of stein portion  is at the outer forward surface A of nose portion , see FIG. . The contiguous abutment of shoulders ,  protects pressure relief valves  from damage when vehicle  is making a high-speed transit in water , and more particularly, when vehicle  is drop-launched a distance of up to forty feet in air  from an aircraft and impacts water .","When angled annular shoulder  contiguously abuts angled annular shoulder , valve head  partially extends into inner bore  and an O-ring  in a circumferential groove  around valve head  is held compressed between inner bore  and valve head  to seal passageway  from interior . The compression of O-ring  creates a frictional force that is exerted by O-ring  to hold, or retain valve head  inside of inner bore . This frictional retaining by O-ring  maintains the seal between passageway  and interior .","Retention of valve head  in inner bore  is further assured by a thin safety wire  threaded through aligned small lateral bores  in nose portion  that are aligned with a small lateral bore  in stem portion . Thin safety wire  extends through the aligned lateral bores ,  and is tied or otherwise joined at opposite ends to a heavier wire or looped and secured onto itself along loop section  that reaches across the front of forward surface A of nose portion . A 15 thousandths of an inch outer diameter copper wire was used as safety wire  and together with the frictional retaining force created between O-ring  and inner bore , gas pressures in the range of 13 to 30 psi could be retained in passageway  before O-ring  would be displaced in inner bore  and safety wire  would be sheared by the ends of lateral bore  in axially displaced stem portion  of valve plug , see FIG. . The threshold pressure range could be other than 13 to 30 psi, however this threshold range was found to be below the range of internal gas pressures that might disable or damage vehicle .","Pressure relief valve system  of the invention has two pressure relief valves  each mounted on a separate hollow pylon  that each fluidly communicates through an internal passageway  and through duct  to interior  of pressure hull . Excessive gas pressures created by lithium batteries  in any of interior  or passageway  in either hollow pylon  will be fluidly communicated to pressure relief valves  in both pylons . The excessive gas pressures can act on each elongate gas plug  in each pressure relief valve  until the threshold pressure range is exceeded. Then, the frictional retaining force between each O-ring  and inner bore  is overcome, and safety wire  is sheared in aligned lateral bores ,  in one or the other of pressure relief valves . Either elongate gas plug  is axially displaced along its longitudinal axis  during the overcoming of frictional retaining force of O-rings  and shearing of safety wire . The axial displacement also moves valve head  in inner bore . Displacement of valve head  separates abutting annular surfaces ,  and O-ring  is pulled from inner bore  and into interior . Pressurized gas (shown by arrows ) is vented from passageway  through slots  and into the ambient air or water ,  to alleviate an otherwise debilitating, hazardous condition.","When excessive pressurized gas  has been vented through slots , the axially displaced valve plug  has its stem portion  extended, or reaching from nose portion  as shown in FIG. . This extended condition of stem portion  can be observed and, when observed, undersea vehicle  can be inspected and repaired, if needed, to make sure that vehicle  is in a state of operational readiness. Usually after stem portion  has been extended, O-ring  is replaced on valve head , since it may have been damaged by vented gases  or displacement of valve head . Valve plug  then is reassembled with a new O-ring  and wire ,  in pressure relief valve  to again be as shown in FIG. .","Pressure relief valve system  is a sound marine engineering design having redundancy of mutually communicating pressure relief valves  and pylons  with interior  of undersea vehicle . This redundancy assures safe venting of excessive pressures by one of pressure relief valves  even if the other valve  is damaged or otherwise disabled.","Optionally, where higher pressures inside of passageway  (and interior ) can be tolerated, a coiled biasing spring (not shown) can helically extend around stem portion  and be held in compression between valve head  and end wall A of intermediate bore . The biasing spring could push against valve head  to force its angled annular shoulder  to contiguously abut angled annular shoulder  on body portion  more forcefully to allow O-ring  to withstand greater internal pressures in passageway .","The biasing force exerted by the coiled spring could be predetermined to hold abutting shoulders ,  together and O-ring  in its sealing relationship in inner bore  when the pressure created by gases in passageway  is below a certain threshold level range. A typical gas-pressure threshold can be in excess of the 15-30 psi range. Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of pressure relief valve system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design incorporates structures and technologies long proven to operate successfully in hostile land and marine environments associated with a host of undersea activities. Pressure relief valve system  of the invention can be made larger or smaller in different shapes and fabricated from a wide variety of materials to assure resistance to corrosion and sufficient strength for long-term reliable operation under a multitude of different operational requirements.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Therefore, pressure relief valve system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
