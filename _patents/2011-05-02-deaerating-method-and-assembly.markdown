{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/452,294, which was filed on 14 Mar. 2011 and is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N0019-06-C-0081, and Subcontract No. 4500019224, awarded by the United States Navy. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.","This disclosure relates generally to a deaerator and, more particularly, to a deaerator having an apertured stem that facilitates separating air from a coolant.","Generators provide electric power as is known. Aircraft auxiliary power units, for example, typically include a generator that is driven by a turbine engine. The turbine engine is rotatably coupled to the generator through a gearbox. Coolant, such as oil, is circulated through the gearbox and the generator. The coolant removes thermal energy and lubricates various components. Coolant mixes with air as the coolant circulates through the generator. As known, at least some of the air must be separated from the coolant before the coolant can be reintroduced to the gearbox and the generator. Deaerators are used to separate air from the coolant. The coolant is collected within a sump after the deaerator removes the air. The coolant is recirculated through the gearbox and the generator from the sump.","An example deaerator assembly includes a deaerating member disposed within a housing. The deaerating member includes an apertured stem extending from a pedestal. The apertured stem is configured to communicate air away from a mixture of air and coolant when the mixture of air and coolant is communicated about the apertured stem.","An example aircraft auxiliary power unit assembly includes a gearbox configured to rotatably couple a turbomachine to a generator and a coolant path configured to communicate a coolant through the gearbox and the generator. A deaerator assembly of the assembly has a deaerating member that includes an apertured stem extending from a pedestal. A mixture of air and the coolant is communicated about the apertured stem to separate air from the coolant.","An example method of removing air from a mixture of air and coolant includes spiraling a mixture of air and coolant about an apertured stem in a deaerator assembly. The method communicates some of the air from the mixture through an array of apertures in the apertured stem to a bore in the apertured stem. The method vents the air from the bore.","Referring to , an example auxiliary power unit arrangement  includes a turbomachine, turbine engine , rotatably coupled to a generator  through a gearbox . A pump  circulates a coolant, such as an oil, along a coolant path . The coolant cools and lubricates portions of the generator  and the gearbox .","The coolant mixes with air as when circulating through the generator  and the gearbox . Coolant mixed with a substantial amount of air is considered Cin this example. Coolant Cmoving from the generator  and the gearbox  is thus unsuitable for direct recirculation back to the gearbox  and the generator . Accordingly, the coolant Cis communicated to a deaerator  to remove the air. Deaerated coolant Cfrom the deaerator  is the collected within a sump . The deaerated coolant Cis communicated from the sump  through a chiller  back to the gearbox  and the generator .","Although the pump , the deaerator , the sump , and the chiller  are schematically shown as separate from the gearbox , some or all of these components may be disposed within the gearbox .","Referring now to , the gearbox  rotatably links the turbine engine  to the generator  through an arrangement of gears. The gears are not shown in this example for clarity reasons. However, a person having skill in this art would understand how to rotatably link the turbine engine  to the generator  using an arrangement of gears within the gearbox . In this example, the sump  is secured to a gearbox housing , and the deaerator  is disposed within the sump .","Referring to  with continuing reference to , the example deaerator  includes a deaerator housing  that is generally cylindrical and extends along an axis X. The deaerator housing  establishes an inlet  and a plurality of outlets . The inlet  communicates the coolant Cinto the deaerator . The outlets  communicate the deaerated coolant Cfrom the deaerator . The outlets  are positioned vertically below the inlet  in this example. The deaerator  is aluminum in this example.","The deaerator  includes a deaerating member  having a pedestal section  connected to a stem section . The deaerating member  is disposed within an interior of the deaerator housing  and aligned coaxially with the axis X.","An end portion  of the stem section  is received within a recess  established by the deaerator housing . An end portion  of the pedestal section  is secured to the deaerator housing  with a threaded attachment . The pedestal section  also includes a flange  at the end portion  received within the interior of the deaerator housing . The flange , the threaded attachment , and the end portion  received within the recess  maintain the position of the deaerating member  relative to the deaerator housing .","The example stem section  includes an array of apertures . Each of the apertures  extends radially relative to the axis X. The example array includes four groups -of apertures . Each of the groups -includes four individual apertures  that are circumferentially distributed about the axis X. The apertures  within each one of the groups -are axially aligned. Each of the groups -is axially spaced from the other groups -. Other example stem sections may include other arrangements of apertures.","The inlet  of the deaerator  has a generally oval and noncircular shape in this example. Notably, the inlet  is established within the deaerator housing  such that the inlet  communicates the coolant Cinto the deaerator housing  in a manner that encourages a spiraling movement of the coolant Cabout the axis X. That is, the coolant Cis not communicated through the inlet  directly toward the axis X.","After the coolant Cmoves through the inlet  into the interior of the deaerator housing , the mixture spirals around the stem section  toward the pedestal section . As the coolant Cspirals, centrifugal force tends to move the coolant within the coolant Caway from the axis C and air A within the coolant Ctoward the axis X. At least some of the air A moves toward the axis X and through the apertures  into a bore  established within the stem section . The air A communicates through the bore  and moves through a vent  to the surrounding environment. Accordingly, the coolant Cincludes less of the air A as the coolant Cspirals vertically downward toward the pedestal section .","After moving vertically past the stem section , the coolant Cis forced through a gap G established between a shelf portion  of the pedestal section  and an inner wall  of the deaerator housing . Moving the coolant Cthrough the gap G separates some of the remaining air A from the coolant C. The air A separated because of the gap G may move vertically upward and move through the apertures  where the separated air A is communicated to the surrounding environment through the vent . After moving through the gap G, the coolant C, which now includes considerably less of the air A than when the coolant Cwas moved into the deaerator , is considered deaerated coolant Cand suitable for recirculation through the gearbox  and the generator . That is, the deaerator  may not remove all of the air A from the coolant Cthat enters the deaerator , but removes enough of the air A from the coolant Cso that the coolant is suitable for recirculation as deaerated coolant C. A person having skill in this art and the benefit of this disclosure would understand how much of the air A must be removed from the coolant Cbefore the coolant Ccan be considered deaerated coolant Cthat is suitable for recirculation.","The level of deaerated coolant Cwithin the sump  is typically kept at a level that is vertically above the outlets . In one specific example, the level of deaerated coolant Cwithin the sump  is maintained at a vertical position coinciding approximately with the vertical position of the group of apertures ","Features of the disclosed examples include a deaerator utilizing centrifugal force to separate air from coolant. The disclosed examples more effectively and more quickly separate air from coolant. In one specific example, the disclosed example separates an acceptable level of air from a coolant five to six seconds faster than a prior art deaerator.","The preceding description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature. Variations and modifications to the disclosed examples may become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not necessarily depart from the essence of this disclosure. Thus, the scope of legal protection given to this disclosure can only be determined by studying the following claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["The various features and advantages of the disclosed examples will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description.
