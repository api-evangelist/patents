No. 61\/306,043, filed Feb. 19, 2010; which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Autoimmune polyneuropathies arise when nerves are damaged by the body's own immune system. Symptoms of these diseases include numbness, muscle weakness, limb pain, cramping, sensitivity to touch and reduced tendon reflex. In general, autoimmune polyneuropathies can be categorized into demyelinating and axonal neuropathies.","One type of demyelinating neuropathy is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The prevalence of CIDP is about 9 persons per 100,000 (Laughlin et al, 73:39 (2009)). However, the prevalence of all types of demyelinating neuropathies is about 20 per 100,000. Another type of demyelinating neuropathy is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP, Guillain-Barre Syndrome), which has an incidence of 2-3 per 100,000 per year. At least one type of neuropathy is associated with the presence of antibodies directed against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies.","Autoimmune axonal neuropathies include vasculitic neuropathy, sensory ganglioneuritis (Sjogren's syndrome and other collagen vascular diseases), autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, non-length dependent small fiber neuropathy and paraneoplastic neuropathy.","Corticosteroids and\/or immunosuppressants have been used to treat these types of autoimmune neuropathies but new therapies may be more effective when targeted to specific biological molecules that contribute to the development of the neuropathies.","The present invention is directed to a method of inhibiting autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy and other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases involving macrophage infiltration in a mammal in need thereof. This method involves administering to the mammal with such a disease an inhibitor that binds to macrophage scavenger receptor class 1 (MSR1) under conditions effective to inhibit the development of such autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. In one embodiment of this invention, the inhibitor is a Fab fragment of an antibody to MSR1. Such antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal or a functional portion thereof. The mammals can be rabbits, rats, mice, horses, cows, goats, primates or humans, preferably human.","One aspect of the invention is a method of treating an autoimmune or inflammatory disease in a mammal comprising: administering to a mammal in need thereof an inhibitor of MSR1 under conditions effective to inhibit an autoimmune or inflammatory disease, wherein the disease comprises macrophage infiltration. Examples of inhibitors of MSR1 include an anti-MSR1 antibody, an anti-MSR1 antibody fragment, a Fab fragment of an anti-MSR1 antibody, an F(ab)fragment of an anti-MSR1 antibody, and\/or any functional equivalents of these antibodies and antibody fragments. In some embodiments, a combination of inhibitors of MSR1 is employed.","When the inhibitor is an antibody, it can be any type of antibody. For example, the antibody can be a monoclonal antibody, and\/or the antibody fragment or the Fab fragment can be obtained from a monoclonal antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody is a polyclonal antibody and\/or the antibody fragment or the Fab fragment is obtained from a polyclonal antibody preparation.","In some embodiments, the antibody, the antibody fragment or the Fab fragment of an anti-MSR1 antibody is from a recombinant antibody library. Recombinant antibodies, antibody fragments and\/or Fab fragments can be expressed in eukaryotic cells (e.g., mammalian or yeast cells) or prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria). The antibody, the antibody fragment and\/or the Fab fragment of an anti-MSR1 antibody can also be generated through an in vitro technique. For example, a library of antibodies, antibody fragments or Fab fragments of an anti-MSR1 antibody can be generated, obtained or employed, where the antibodies, antibody fragments or Fab fragments are displayed on phage, cells or ribosomes.","The antibody, antibody fragment, Fab fragment or the functional equivalent thereof can bind to any MSR1 polypeptide or peptide, including any mammalian MSR1. For example, the mammalian MSR1 polypeptides and peptides to which the antibodies, antibody fragments, Fab fragments or functional equivalents thereof can bind include human, rat, mouse, goat, horse, dog, cat or avian MSR1. In some embodiments, the antibody, antibody fragment, Fab fragment or the functional equivalent thereof can bind to any of SEQ ID NO:1-9.","The mammal treated by the methods described herein can be a human or a domesticated or zoo animal.","In some embodiments, the disease is an autoimmune disease, including any of the autoimmune diseases disclosed herein. For example, the autoimmune disease can be an autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). In other embodiments, the disease is an inflammatory disease, including any of the inflammatory diseases disclosed herein.","While not being limited to a specific mechanism of action, the inhibitor of MSR1 can for example, deactivate previously activated macrophages, inhibit macrophage activation, inhibit macrophage interactions, inhibit antigen presentation, and\/or inhibit extracellular adhesion in the mammal.","The conditions effective to inhibit an autoimmune or inflammatory disease can include administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the inhibitor of MSR1. Such a therapeutically effective amount of the inhibitor of MSR1 can deactivate previously activated macrophages, inhibit macrophage activation, inhibit macrophage interactions, inhibit antigen presentation and\/or inhibit extracellular adhesion. In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of the inhibitor of MSR1 reduces inflammation, reduces demyelination, reduces axonal loss and\/or reduces neuronal loss in the mammal.","Conditions effective for inhibiting the onset or duration of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease can also include administering the inhibitor of MSR1 at dosing intervals effective for treating the disease or inhibiting the onset of the disease. For example, in some embodiments the inhibitor is administered once, twice or three times per day. In other embodiments, the inhibitor is administered once, twice or three times per week, or once, twice or three times per month.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and which show by way of illustration specific embodiments that may be practiced. These embodiments are described in detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural and logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following description of example embodiments is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.","The present invention relates to a method of inhibiting the onset and\/or treating the progression of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a mammal in need thereof. Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that can be inhibited or treated by the methods of the invention include those involving macrophage infiltration. In some embodiments, the autoimmune disease is an autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy.","The method involves administering to the mammal an inhibitor of macrophage scavenger receptor class 1 (MSR1) under conditions effective to inhibit the development of autoimmune and\/or inflammatory diseases. The mammal can have an autoimmune or inflammatory disease or be predisposed to development of such an autoimmune or inflammatory disease.","As used herein, the inhibitor of MSR1 inhibits the onset, and\/or treats, an autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disease in a mammal. Thus, the inhibitor is a disease inhibitor and, in some embodiments, the inhibitor may not directly inhibit the function of MSR1. Instead, the inhibitor binds to MSR1 and thereby effectively treats and\/or inhibits disease. In other embodiments, the inhibitor does interact with and bind to MSR1 in a manner that inhibits MSR1 function.","In one embodiment of this invention, the inhibitor is an antibody to MSR1 or a Fab fragment thereof. Such antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, or functional equivalent of such antibodies and\/or fragments.","The mammals can be a human or a domesticated or zoo animal. Examples of mammals in which disease can be inhibited or treated include rabbits, rats, mice, horses, cows, goats, primates or humans. In some embodiments, the mammal is a human.","Macrophage Scavenger Receptor Class 1 (MSR1)","MSR1 is a multi-ligand receptor expressed on macrophages (Usui et al, 56: 363 (2007); Husemann et al, 40: 195 (2002); Platt et al, 108: 649 (2001)). MSR1 is also known as SR-A I\/II, CD204, scavenger receptor class A, member 1. It is a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of macrophages, and some mast and dendritic cells. The extracellular collagenous region contains the ligand binding domain.","MSR1 recognizes a variety of endogenous ligands, some of which have been associated with diseases and conditions including antigens, acetylated LDL, \u03b2-amyloid, advanced glycation end products, extracellular matrix, and apoptotic cells.","Examples of amino acid sequences for different types and species of MSR1 polypeptides can be found in the art, for example, in the NCBI database. See website at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Thus, for example, the NCBI database provides a human Macrophage scavenger receptor class 1 (MSR1) amino acid sequence as accession number P21757.1 (gi:127357).

Thus, at least three isoforms of MSR1 exist. These three different isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of this gene. These receptors or isoforms are macrophage-specific trimeric integral membrane glycoproteins. The type 1 and type 2 isoforms are functional receptors and are able to mediate the endocytosis of modified low density lipoproteins (LDLs). The type 3 isoform does not internalize modified LDL (acetyl-LDL) despite having the domain shown to mediate this function in the type 1 and 2 isoforms. It has an altered intracellular processing and is trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, making it unable to perform endocytosis. The type 3 isoform can inhibit the function of isoform types 1 and 2 when co-expressed, indicating a dominant negative effect and suggesting a mechanism for regulation of scavenger receptor activity in macrophages.","For example, MSR1 types I and II isoform type 1 has an amino acid sequence that is present in the NCBI database as accession number NP_619729.1 (gi: 20357512).

The modified antibody can be deimmunized, i.e. rendered less immunogenic compared to an unmodified counterpart to a given species, e.g. human. Human antibodies can be made by many methods known in the art including immunizing transgenic mice that have been transformed with human immunoglobulin genes (Hudson P and Souriau C, 9: 129 (2003)). Recombinant human antibodies can be engineered from phage display or mRNA (ribosome) display libraries by molecular cloning, generation of diversity and increased affinity, and protein expression in in vitro systems (MacCafferty J et al, 348:552 (1990); reviewed in Benhar I, 7:763 (2007) and Li J and Zhu Z, 31:1198 (2010)).","The antibodies or functional equivalents of antibodies interact with, e.g. bind to, MSR1 with affinity and\/or specificity. In some embodiments, the anti-MSR1 antibodies and\/or functional equivalents of such antibodies bind to MSR1 with high affinity and\/or high selectivity. For example, the antibody or functional equivalent can bind to human MSR1 with an affinity constant of at least 10M. In some embodiments, the antibody or functional equivalent can bind to human MSR1 with an affinity constant between 10Mand 10Mor about 10M.","In some embodiments, the antibodies or functional equivalents thereof can also interact with, or bind to, the extracellular domain of MSR1 and most preferably the extracellular domain of human MSR1.","In some embodiments, the antibodies or fragments thereof are recombinant or modified anti-MSR1 antibodies chosen from, for example, a chimeric, a humanized, a deimmunized or an in vitro generated antibody or fragment thereof.","For the purposes of this application, suitable variable and hypervariable regions of non-human antibodies may be derived from antibodies produced by any non-human mammal in which monoclonal antibodies are made. Suitable examples of mammals other than humans include, for example, rabbits, rats, mice, horses, goats, llamas or primates. Mice are preferred. The antibodies can be humanized or deimmunized by any of the methods known in the art.","Functional equivalents further include fragments of antibodies that have binding characteristics that are the same as, or are comparable to, those of the whole antibody. Such fragments may, for example, contain one or both Fab fragments of the F(ab\u2032)fragment. Preferably, the antibody fragments contain all six complementarity determining regions of the whole antibody, although functional fragments containing fewer than all of such regions, such as three, four or five CDRs, are also included.","The preferred fragments are single chain antibodies, or Fv fragments. Single chain antibodies are polypeptides that comprise at least the variable region of the heavy chain of the antibody linked to the variable region of the light chain, with or without an interconnecting linker. Thus, Fv fragment comprises the entire antibody combining site. These chains may be produced in bacteria or in eukaryotic cells.","The antibodies and functional equivalents may be members of any class of immunoglobulins, such as: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE, and the subclasses thereof. The Fab fragments may also be derived from any such class of immunoglobulin, and the functional equivalents may also be equivalents of, or combinations of, any of the above immunoglobulin classes and subclasses.","Antibodies of the present invention are capable of binding to MSR1 and may function to inhibit the activity of such. Such antibodies may have therapeutic potential, particularly in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by inhibiting the function of macrophages.","Antibodies of the present invention may be either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies or functional equivalents thereof. Antibodies of the present invention are capable of binding MSR1 and may function to inhibit the activity of such. Such antibodies may have therapeutic potential, particularly in the treatment of autoimmune demyelinating neuropathies or other autoimmune diseases involving macrophage infiltration by inhibiting the function of MSR1.","Monoclonal antibodies can be produced by techniques available in the art. This process involves obtaining immune cells (lymphocytes) from the spleen of a mammal (e.g., mouse) which has been previously immunized with the antigen of interest either in vivo or in vitro. The antibody-secreting lymphocytes are then fused with (mouse) myeloma cells or transformed cells, which are capable of replicating indefinitely in cell culture, thereby producing an immortal, immunoglobulin-secreting cell line. The resulting fused cells, or hybridomas, are cultured, and the resulting colonies screened for the production of the desired monoclonal antibodies. Colonies producing such antibodies are cloned, and grown either in vivo or in vitro to produce large quantities of antibody. A description of the theoretical basis and practical methodology of fusing such cells is set forth in Kohler et al., 256: 495 (1975), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Mammalian lymphocytes are immunized by in vivo immunization of the animal (e.g., a mouse) with a full length native antigen or a peptide representing one or more epitopes of the full antigen. Such immunizations are repeated as necessary at intervals of up to several weeks to obtain a sufficient titer of antibodies. Following the last antigen boost, the animals are sacrificed and spleen cells removed.","Fusion with mammalian myeloma cells or other fusion partners capable of replicating indefinitely in cell culture is effected by standard and well-known techniques, for example, by using polyethylene glycol (\u201cPEG\u201d) or other fusing agents (Kohler G and Milstein C., 6: 511 (1976), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). This immortal cell line, which is preferably murine, but may also be derived from cells of other mammalian species, including but not limited to rats and humans, is selected to be deficient in enzymes necessary for the utilization of certain nutrients, to be capable of rapid growth, and to have good fusion capability. Many such cell lines are known to those skilled in the art, and others are regularly described.","Monoclonal antibodies can also be obtained by screening a recombinant combinatorial library such as an antibody phage display library. See, for example, PD\u2014A LM, Barbas, et al., eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001; and Kontermann & D\u00fcbel, AE, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag. Berlin, 2001.","Nucleic acids encoding anti-MSR1 antibodies can be derived from an animal immunized with an MSR1 polypeptide, epitope or antigenic peptide by generating an expression library using the RNA of the animal's B cells or plasma cells and then screening for antibody-coding sequences. See, for example, in by Harlow and Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988, and in by Sambrook, et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Briefly, immune cells sensitized to the specified antigen (such as mononuclear cells) or spleen cells from animal immunized with an MSR1 polypeptide, epitope or antigenic peptide can be used. The cells are processed according to the phage display technology described by Barbas et al., 88: 7978-7982 (1991); and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,717; 5,972,656; 6,113,898; and 6,140,470. The disclosures of these documents are incorporated herein by reference. Total RNA is isolated from cells and the RNA can be processed to obtain the poly-A RNA. After hybridization of an oligo-d(T) primer, the RNA (mRNA) is reverse transcribed to yield the corresponding cDNA. This cDNA is used to isolate nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention. The cDNA can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to obtain nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention. Selected primers can be used in PCR to isolate nucleic acids encoding polypeptide fragments such as V, V, as well as the constant regions.","The cDNA or PCR products can be inserted into a vector, such as a bacteriophage, a phagemid or a plasmid through use of recombinant DNA techniques well-known in the art. See, Sambrook et al. (1989). The vectors containing the cDNA or PCR products can be introduced into bacteria to produce an expression library, the members of which express a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA or PCR product such as a full-length light or heavy chain polypeptide, a single variable chain polypeptide, or a single chain Fab or Fab\u2032.","The procedure also allows for the production of a polypeptide that is fused to a phage coat protein. The library of recombinant phage can be panned as described in the foregoing references and patents to select members of the library that express an antibody that binds specifically to the E2 glycoprotein or the E1E2 complex. The panning may be accomplished by combining the library with an immobilized antigen, removing the phage not bound, and then removing the bound phage.","Host bacterial cells such as or other suitable bacteria can be transfected with members of the phage library that express an antibody that binds to the selected MSR1 polypeptide, epitope or antigen. The resulting bacterial cells can be separated into colonies by serial dilution and plating so that each colony isolated expresses a unique antibody. The phage can also carry a selection marker such as an antibiotic resistance gene so that host bacterial cells expressing an antibody of the invention can be identified by cultivating the host cell library in culture medium containing the antibiotic. Cultures from single colonies can be examined by a binding assay using an MSR1 polypeptide, epitope or antigenic peptide to identify those expressing an antibody having particular immunoreactivity.","Following selection of bacterial colonies that express an antibody having specific immunoreactivities, the nucleic acid sequences coding for the CDR's, framework regions, or variable or constant regions in the selected cultures can be determined using known nucleotide sequencing procedures. Thus, nucleic acids encoding CDR sequences, framework sequences and\/or constant regions of an antibody of the invention can be obtained from a phage library.","PCR amplification of Fd and \u03ba regions from the mRNA of the source mononuclear cells may be performed as described by Sastry et al., 86: 5728 (1989) and Barbas et al., PD: A LM. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2001). The PCR amplification can be performed with cDNA obtained by the reverse transcription of the mRNA with primers specific for amplification of heavy chain sequences or light chain sequences.","The PCR amplification of messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from the mononuclear cells with oligonucleotides that incorporate restriction sites into the ends of the amplified product may be used to clone and express heavy chain sequences (e.g., the amplification of the Fd fragment) and x light chain sequences from B cells. The oligonucleotide primers, which are analogous to those that have been successfully used for amplification of Vand Vsequences (see Sastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 86, 5728 (1989) and Barbas et al., PD: A LM. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2001)), may be used for these amplifications. Restriction endonuclease recognition sequences are typically incorporated into these primers to allow for the cloning of the amplified fragment into a suitable vector (i.e. a phagemid or a \u03bb phage) in a predetermined reading frame for expression.","Phage assembly proceeds via an extrusion-like process through the bacterial membrane. For example filamentous phage M13 may be used for this process. This phage has a 406-residue minor phage coat protein (cpIII) which is expressed before extrusion and which accumulates on the inner membrane facing into the periplasm of . The two functional properties of cpIII, infectivity and normal (nonpolyphage) morphogenesis have been assigned to roughly the first and second half of the gene. The N-terminal domain of cpIII binds to the F pili, allowing for infection of , whereas the membrane-bound C-terminal domain, P198-S406, serves the morphogenic role of capping the trailing end of the filament according to the vectorial polymerization model.","A phagemid vector may be constructed to fuse the antibody fragment chain such as an Fab, Fab\u2032 or an Fd chain with the C-terminal domain of cpIII (see Barbas et al., 88: 7978 (1991)). A flexible five-amino acid tether (GGGGS; SEQ ID NO:13), which lacks an ordered secondary structure, may be juxtaposed between the expressed fragment chain and cpIII domains to minimize interaction. The phagemid vector may also be constructed to include a nucleotide coding for the light chain of a Fab fragment. The cpIII\/Fd fragment fusion protein and the light chain protein may be placed under control of separate lac promoter\/operator sequences and directed to the periplasmic space by pelB leader sequences for functional assembly on the membrane. Inclusion of the phage F1 intergenic region in the vector allows for packaging of single-stranded phagemid with the aid of helper phage. The use of helper phage superinfection may result in expression of two forms of cpIII. Consequently, normal phage morphogenesis may be perturbed by competition between the cpIII\/Fd fragment fusion protein and the native cpIII of the helper phage for incorporation into the virion. The resulting packaged phagemid may carry native cpIII, which is necessary for infection, and the fusion protein including the Fab fragment, which may be displayed for interaction with an antigen and used for selection. Fusion at the C-terminal domain of cpIII is necessitated by the phagemid approach because fusion with the infective N-terminal domain would render the host cell resistant to infection. The result is a phage displaying antibody combining sites (\u201cPhabs\u201d). The antibody combining sites, such as Fab fragments, are displayed on the phage coat. This technique may be used to produce Phabs which display recombinantly produced Fab fragments, such as recombinantly produced Fab fragments that immunoreact with an antigen, on the phage coat of a filamentous phage such as M13.","A phagemid vector (i.e. pComb 3 or pComb3H) which allows the display of antibody Fab fragments on the surface of filamentous phage, has been described (see Barbas et al., 88: 7978 (1991). Xho I and Spe I sites for cloning PCR-amplified heavy-chain Fd sequences are included in pComb 3 and pComb3H. Sac I and Xba I sites are also provided for cloning PCR-amplified antibody light chains. These cloning sites are compatible with known mouse and human PCR primers (see, e.g., Huse et al., 246: 1275-1281 (1989)). The nucleotide sequences of the pelB leader sequences are recruited from the \u03bb HC2 and \u03bb LC2 constructs described in Huse et al, ibid, with reading frames maintained. Digestion of pComb 3 and pComb3H, encoding a selected Fab, with Spe I and Nhe I permit the removal of the gene III fragment, which includes the nucleotide sequences coding for the antibody Fab fragments. Because Spe I and Nhe I produce compatible cohesive ends, the digested vector may also be religated to yield a phagemid that produces soluble Fab.","Phabs may be produced by overnight infection of phagemid containing cells (e.g., infected XL-1 Blue) yielding typical titers of 10cfu\/ml. By using phagemids encoding different antibiotic resistances, ratios of clonally distinct phage may easily be determined by titering on selective plates. In single-pass enrichment experiments, clonally mixed phage may be incubated with an antigen-coated plate. Nonspecific phage will be removed by washing, and bound phage may then be eluted with acid and isolated.","The antibodies or antibody fragments used in the methods of the invention can also be polyclonal antibodies or fragments thereof.","Procedures for raising polyclonal antibodies are also available. Typically, such antibodies can be raised by administering native antigen or a peptide thereof (e.g., a synthetic peptide coupled to a hapten) subcutaneously to an animal. Animals that can be used to generate polyclonal antibodies include, mice, rats, goats, New Zealand white rabbits, horses, monkeys and other animals. In some embodiments, the animal is first bled to obtain pre-immune serum. The antigens can be injected at a convenient volume for the selected animal species. For example, a rabbit can be injected with total volume of about 100 \u03bcl per site and several sites (e.g., at six different sites). One example of the injected material would be an emulsion of the antigens with an effective adjuvant such as Freund's complete adjuvant. The animals are bled at about two weeks after the first injection and periodically boosted with the same antigen, for example, for about three times at six week intervals. A sample of serum is then collected about 10 days after each boost. Polyclonal antibodies are then recovered from the serum. Recovery of polyclonal antibodies can be by affinity chromatography using the corresponding antigen to capture the antibody. Ultimately, the animals can be euthanized. For example, rabbits can be euthanized with pentobarbital 150 mg\/Kg IV. This and other procedures for raising polyclonal antibodies, including in other species such as goats, are disclosed in Harlow et. al., editors, (1988), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Antibodies that are essentially human may be produced in transgenic mammals, especially transgenic mice that are genetically modified to express human antibodies. Methods for making chimeric and humanized antibodies are also known in the art. For example, methods for making chimeric antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,397 and 4,816,567, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Methods for making humanized antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","One method for humanization of antibodies is called CDR-grafting. In CDR-grafting, the regions of the mouse antibody that are directly involved in binding to antigen, the complementarity determining region of CDRs, are grafted into human variable regions to create \u201creshaped human\u201d variable regions. These fully humanized variable regions are then joined to human constant regions to create complete \u201cfully humanized\u201d antibodies.","In order to create fully humanized antibodies that bind well to an antigen, it is advantageous to design the reshaped human variable regions carefully. The human variable regions into which the CDRs will be grafted are carefully selected. A few amino acid changes can be made to various positions within the framework regions (FRs) of the human variable regions.","For example, the reshaped human variable regions may include up to ten amino acid changes in the FRs of the selected human light chain variable region, and as many as twelve amino acid changes in the FRs of the selected human heavy chain variable region. The DNA sequences coding for these reshaped human heavy and light chain variable region genes are joined to DNA sequences coding for the human heavy and light chain constant region genes, preferably \u03b31 and \u03ba, respectively. The reshaped humanized antibody is then expressed in mammalian cells and its affinity for its target compared with that of the corresponding murine antibody and chimeric antibody.","Methods for selecting the residues of the humanized antibody to be substituted and for making the substitutions are well known in the art. See, for example, Co et al., 351:501-502 (1991); Queen et al., 86:10029-1003 (1989) and Rodrigues et al., , Supplement 7:45-50 (1992), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. A method for humanizing and reshaping the 225 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, as an example, is described by WO 96\/40210, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This method can be adapted to humanizing and reshaping antibodies against other proteins.","Methods for making single chain antibodies are also known in the art. Some examples include those described by European Patent Application No. 502 812 and Wels et al., 60:137-144 (1995), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Single chain antibodies may also be prepared by screening phage display libraries.","Other methods for producing the functional equivalents of antibodies are disclosed in WO 93\/21319, European Patent Application No. 239 400, WO 89\/09622, European Patent Application No. 338 745, U.S. Pat.

A single inhibitor or a combination of inhibitors can be administered. Thus, for example, the inhibitor(s) can be administered orally, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally (ip), intravenously, subcutaneously, or intranasally.","The inhibitor(s) of the present invention may be administered alone or with suitable pharmaceutical carriers, and can be in solid or liquid form, such as by use of tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Thus, in some embodiments the inhibitors are provided in a composition, for example, a pharmaceutical composition.","The inhibitors are administered under conditions effective to inhibit an autoimmune or inflammatory disease, which in the context of the therapeutic methods described herein, refers to conditions, such as time, inhibitor amount, inhibitor concentration, and the like, that are within ordinary skill for practitioner to ascertain and vary as needed to optimize treatment and\/or inhibition of the onset of the disease.","The inhibitors are typically administered, for example, in an effective amount (e.g., a therapeutically effective amount). Such an effective amount of the inhibitor(s) can, for example, be sufficient to reduce inflammation, to reduce demyelination, or reduce axonal and\/or neuronal loss in a mammal. In some embodiments, the effective amount of the inhibitor(s) deactivates previously activated macrophages, inhibits macrophage activation, inhibits antigen presentation and\/or inhibits extracellular adhesion in the mammal.","Examples of effective amounts of the inhibitor(s) include inhibitor doses ranging from about 0.005 \u03bcg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg, or ranging from about 0.01 \u03bcg\/kg to about 60 mg\/kg. Another example of a desirable effective amount of the inhibitor(s) described herein about 0.5 \u03bcg to about 750 mg.","The inhibitors can also be administered at intervals effective for the treatment and\/or inhibition of disease. In some embodiments, the inhibitor is administered several times a day (e.g., twice or three times per day). In other embodiments, the inhibitor is administered once per day, once every other day, twice per week or once per week. In still other embodiments, the inhibitor is administered twice per month or once per month. The intervals at which the inhibitors are administered can vary depending upon the half-life of the inhibitor. Thus, for example, the half-life of antibody-based inhibitors can range from several minutes for single domain antibodies and scFvs to several weeks for many IgG molecules. However, the half-life of a therapeutic inhibitor, including a therapeutic antibody or antibody fragment, can be modulated to facilitate or optimize treatment and\/or inhibition of disease. For example, in some embodiments the half-life of the inhibitor (including an antibody or antibody fragment inhibitor) is modulated by attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG), IgG or serum albumin. Such attachment is readily performed using methods available in the art.","The autoimmune diseases that are treated or inhibited include demyelinating neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS); autoimmune diseases affecting the brain such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM); autoimmune diseases of the muscle such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis; autoimmune diseases of the gastro-intestinal tract such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary cholangitis, and chronic active hepatitis, autoimmune diseases of the vascular system, such as vasculitis, temporal arteritis, Churg Strauss syndrome, granulomatous angiitis and Takayasu arteritis; autoimmune diseases of the renal system such as IgA nephropathy, autoimmune nephritis and Goodpasture's syndrome; autoimmune diseases of the joints such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune diseases of the skin such as bullous pemphigoid, atopic dermatitis, alopecia greata, psoriasis and pemphigus; autoimmune diseases of the pulmonary system, such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, alveolitis, and sarcoid; autoimmune diseases of the endocrine system such as juvenile diabetes, Addison's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and autoimmune diseases of the hematopoietic system such as aplastic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia; and autoimmune diseases affecting several systems such as: lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome and Behcet's disease.","Other degenerative\/inflammatory diseases for which this method would be effective include diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy resulting from microvasculitis, as well as stroke; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); HIV-1 neuropathy or encephalopathy, and Huntington's chorea, in which macrophages have been demonstrated to play a contributory role.","In addition, the following diseases can be associated with increased MSR1 antibodies, indicating that they are amenable to the therapy using the methods of the invention: Scleroderma, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Acute coronary syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and Porphyromonas gingivalis.","The inventor has previously reported elevated expression of MSR1, as well as AIF-1 (allograft inflammatory factor 1), in sural nerves and skin of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (Renaud et al, 159: 203 (2005); Lee et al., 290: 115 (2010)). CIDP is an autoimmune disease that targets myelin sheaths, specifically in the peripheral nerves, and causes progressive weakness and sensory loss.","In CIDP, sural nerve biopsies show macrophage mediated demyelination (Vital et al., 24: 363 (2000)), increased numbers of activated macrophages or macrophage clusters (Griffin et al, 27: Suppl. S64 (1990); Sommer et al, 65: 1924 (2005)), and increased expression of Macrophage Scav-enger Receptor 1 (MSR1, SRA I\/II, CD204) mRNA (Renaud et al, 159: 203 (2005)). Macrophages have also been shown to cause demyelinating neuropathy in experimental animals via Fas-ligand-dependent mechanisms (Dace et al, 22:4e7121 (2009)).","The following non-limiting Examples illustrate aspects of the invention, including some methods used in the development of the invention.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying figures that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments which may be practiced. These embodiments are described in detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural and logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following description of example embodiments is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.","The present description is further illustrated by the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting in any way. The contents of all cited references (including literature references, issued patents, published patent applications as cited throughout this application) are hereby expressly and specifically incorporated by reference. These examples are directed to inhibiting MSR1 with Fab fragments of anti-MSR1 antibodies but can readily be adapted to other inhibitors of MSR1.","Antibodies to peptide sequences for rat MSR1 (amino acids 328-345: RSGFPGPKGQKGEKGRAG; SEQ ID NO:6) and AIF-1 (amino acids 127-140; KNKEHQKPTGPPAK; SEQ ID NO:10) (GenScript, NJ) were produced by immunization of goats with 0.5 mg of peptide conjugated to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) hapten in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (primary injection) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant (3 boosts) (Sigma, Mo.). Both the MSR1 and AIF-1 peptides are rat homologues of human sequences previously used to generate anti-human MSR1 and AIF-1 antibodies. For use as in vivo treatment, antigen-column affinity purified IgG antibodies were digested with papain to obtain Fab fragments and remove Fc. Specific activity of immune serum, purified IgG and Fab was monitored by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in peptide coated wells. Protein G-column affinity purified and Fab fragmented naive goat IgG was isolated from normal goat serum as an isotype control.","Experimental Autoimmune Neuritis (EAN) was induced in female Lewis rats by subcutaneous tail base immunization with 200 ug of peripheral myelin P2 peptide (amino acids 53-78: TESPFKNTEISFKLGQEFEETTADNR; SEQ ID NO:11) (Genemed Synthesis, TX) in CFA containing 37RA (Sigma, Mo.) (Lonigro et al, 2009). On day 7, prior to first appearance of clinical disease, and day 12 post-immunization, EAN rats received 1 mg ip of the IgG Fab fragments of goat anti-MSR1, anti-AIF-1, or naive goat antibodies, or an equal volume of PBS. Other control groups received complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) only or were untreated, normal rats. Animals were assessed daily for weight and severity of disease until recovery by day 21. Disease severity was assessed by two observers in a blinded fashion on the following scale with half point increments given when clinical signs fall in between categories: 0=normal, 1=reduced tone of tail, hanging tail tip, 2=limp tail, 3=tail paralysis, 4=gait ataxia, 5=mild paraparesis of the hind limbs, 6=moderate paraparesis of hind limbs, 7=severe paraparesis or paraplegia of hind limbs, 8=moderate tetraparesis, 9=moribund, 10=death. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections of sciatic nerves from 3 representative animals of each group were stained with hemotoxylin & eosin to assess inflammatory cell infiltration on day 17, near the peak of disease in untreated EAN rats. The total number of cells in longitudinal sections in 8 fields were counted at 100\u00d7 magnification in each animal.","Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between treatments were determined by the Mann-Whitney for pair-wise and Kruskal-Wallis for multi-group comparisons, Fisher's exact test, and one-way ANOVA for the clinical scores, incidence of disease, and histological finding, respectively (GraphPad Software, USA).","Results","Eight of nine rats immunized with the P2 peptide (amino acids 53-78: TESPFKNTEISFKLGQEFEETTADNR; SEQ ID NO:12) developed signs of neuropathy at day 11, lasting 4 to 9 days, with an average maximal clinical score of 5.0\u00b13.0. The maximum severity of disease ranged from hind limb weakness to severe tetraparesis.","However, administration of anti-MSR1 Fab reduced the average clinical score to 0.2\u00b10.4 (p<0.05). Treatment with Fab fragments of anti-MSR1 antibody prevented the onset of EAN in all but 1 of 6 rats. The one animal in which the EAN developed displayed only a minimal clinical sign of neuropathy (a limp tail tip) lasting just 2 days (Table 1). The incidence of disease in the anti-MSR1 group was therefore significantly reduced (p<0.05) from that of the untreated EAN group. The maximum severity of clinical disease (, Table 1) was significantly reduced to 0.2\u00b10.4 in the anti-MSR1 antibody treated group in comparison to the untreated EAN rats where it was 5.0\u00b13.0 (p<0.05).","The degree of mononuclear cell infiltration in sciatic nerves (, Table 2) was also significantly reduced between the two groups during the period of peak symptoms, with 382\u00b134 cells\/mmobserved in the untreated EAN group in comparison to 6\u00b15 cells\/mmin the anti-MSR1 treated group (p<0.001).","The clinical scores in the anti-AIF-1 or normal IgG Fab treated groups were 3.2\u00b12.6 and 2.4\u00b13.1, respectively, not significantly different from the untreated EAN rats (). Cellular infiltrates in the anti-AIF-1 or native IgG Fab treated groups were similar to that in untreated EAN. However, disease severity was also somewhat reduced by Fab anti-AIF-1 antibody and normal IgG Fab, but the differences did not reach statistically significance in comparison to untreated EAN animals

reduce the severity of Experimental Autoimmune Neuritis. The marked suppression of EAN by Fab fragments of anti-MSR1 antibody indicates that this represents a novel therapeutic agent in autoimmune demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, as well as in other autoimmune diseases in which macrophages have a pathogenic role.","Anti-MSR1 antibodies (or Fab) therefore inhibits macrophage activity and prevents inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy in experimental rats. Furthermore, these anti-MSR1 antibodies (or Fab) bind to human MSR1 as well as to rat MSR1 (see Example 3). Thus, these data indicate that anti-MSR1 antibodies (or Fab fragments thereof) can be used to treat human inflammatory diseases that involve macrophages, including CIDP or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).","The anti-MSR1 antibodies described in Example 1 were generated against rat MSR1 for in vivo treatment of the rat model of EAN as described in Example 2. These anti-rat MSR1 antibodies were generated by immunization with the rat MSR1 peptide 325-342 (SEQ ID NO:6), which is homologous to the human MSR1 peptides with SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8,","To determine if these anti-rat MSR1 antibodies (or Fab fragments thereof) also bind to MSR1 on human macrophages, paraffin embedded sections of human skin biopsy were incubated with anti-rat MSR1 Fab antibody used in the EAN study. Binding was detected by incubation with biotinylated rabbit secondary antibody against goat IgG F(ab)2, followed by Vector avidin:biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) and the peroxidase color substrate, Nova Red. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Human skin sections were similarly immunohistochemically stained with normal goat IgG Fab antibody fragments as a negative control.","As shown in , the anti-MSR1 antibody (or Fab fragments thereof), which was generated by immunization with the rat MSR1 peptide 325-342 (SEQ ID NO:6), also binds to MSR1 on human macrophages. Positive binding was observed when paraffin sections of human skin biopsy were immunohistochemically stained with this anti-rat MSR1 Fab antibody (, B, D).
