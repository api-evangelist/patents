{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number N00019-02-C-3002 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates generally to voltage measurement systems and more particularly, a fail-safe system to measure unsafe voltages remotely by locally conditioning the measured voltages.","Often complex electronic systems require the measurement of unsafe voltages. These voltages are typically those above 12-15 volts. Prior solutions have attempted to protect equipment and personnel from inadvertent encounters with unsafe voltages. Such encounters can result in electrical shock hazards to personnel, or damage or destruction of electrical circuits or surrounding equipment.","A typical solution reduces unsafe voltage with a voltage divider or resistor network. Such a circuit is shown in FIG. . Here an unsafe voltage input  is applied to conditioning circuit . For illustration purposes, resistor  and resistor  divide or reduce the unsafe input voltage and provide a reduced output voltage  as described by Equation 1: \n\n\nEquation 1 shows the ratio by which the unsafe voltage is reduced. Here the unsafe voltage is reduced by the ratio of resistor  to the sum of resistor  and resistor . When resistor  has a much bigger value than resistor , output voltage  is significantly less than the unsafe input voltage . However, this simply solution has serious drawbacks. If resister  fails in a short circuit condition, output voltage  fails to equal voltage of unsafe input voltage . This situation can result in high voltages being unexpectedly applied to circuits and creating a shock hazard to personnel. Similarly, when resister  fails open, the output voltage  is again equal to the unsafe input voltage . Thus, one needs to condition the sampled input voltages with a circuit to provide safe conditioned voltages for measurement purposes. Additionally, these lower voltages are more safely routed through wires or other circuit paths to test the equipment . Any damage to these insulators containing voltages  may pose a shock hazard to personnel or surrounding equipment if this voltage is at an unsafe level.\n","The present invention provides a high voltage interface system and method that substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages and problems associated with previously developed voltage sampling methods used to measure unsafe voltages. More specifically, the present invention provides a voltage conditioning interface module to condition an electrical signal locally. This module receives the unsafe electrical signal at an input port. This input port is electrically coupled to an external sampling point on an electrical circuit or system under test.","A conditioning circuit having both a voltage reducing circuit and a voltage limiting circuit provides a reduced voltage. The voltage limiting circuit is in parallel with the output terminals that output the reduced voltage. This arrangement ensures that when a circuit element within the voltage reducing circuit fails, an unsafe condition does not exist across these terminals.","A first electrical pathway couples the received electrical signal to the conditioning circuit. This pathway typically employs high voltage carriers or leads. A second circuit pathway couples the modules output to a data acquisition or display.","In one embodiment, the voltage reducing circuit drops the unsafe voltage across a first resistance and a second resistance arranged in series. Typically the output terminals measure the voltage drop across the second resistance.","The voltage limiting circuit typically uses a transorb arranged in parallel to the second resistance. In one embodiment, the voltage limiting circuit uses a first diode aligned such that if a voltage across the output terminals exceeds the diodes breakdown voltage, the output terminals are shunted to a reference point. A second diode in the circuit is arranged in parallel to the first diode, but aligned such that forward current flow in the second diode is opposite that of the first diode. This arrangement ensures that should the second resistance fail as an open circuit, the output terminals are shunted to ground. The voltage limiting circuit guarantees that a single point failure in either the first resistance or the second resistance does not result in the reduced voltage output exceeding a predetermined safe voltage. To enhance safety, the voltage conditioning circuit may be encapsulated within an epoxy package.","Another embodiment provides method to locally condition a sample voltage signal. Here, sampling point(s) within a circuit under test couple via a first circuit pathway to provide the sampled unsafe-voltage signal to a voltage divider circuit. This sampling point may be located within a complex system having a plurality of sampling points coupled to a remote data acquisition system. Next, the sampled voltage drops across the voltage divider circuit. A reduced voltage measured across a portion of the voltage divider provides the reduced voltage output. The reduced voltage at the reduced voltage output is prevented from exceeding a predetermined voltage level by a voltage limiting circuit.","To facilitate the measurement process, the ratio of reduced voltage to the sampled voltage may be a constant ratio calculated according to Kirchhoff's law. Foe example, the ratio of the second resistance to the sum of the first resistance and the second resistance in one embodiment is about 1\/101.01. Additionally, in most applications, the measured electrical signal does not exceed about 600 volts and the reduced voltage does not exceed about 40 volts. The reduced voltage output may then be provided to a data acquisition system or display (meter) through a second circuit pathway.","Yet another embodiment provides a voltage interface module to locally condition a potentially unsafe electrical signal sampled from within a complex system. An input port electrically couples to receive the unsafe electrical signal from an external sampling point within the complex system. A conditioning circuit encapsulated within epoxy, contains a voltage divider circuit having a first resistance and a second resistance. The voltage output is taken across the second resistance to provide a reduced voltage output. This voltage is protected from an over voltage condition by a voltage limiting circuit arranged in parallel with the second resistance. The limiting circuit bounds the reduced voltage across the output terminals when either the first resistance or the second resistance fails. A second set of electrical leads may couple the output terminals to a data acquisition system or display.","The voltage limiting circuit may contain a transorb or other like device known to those skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the voltage limiting circuit has two diodes. The first diode is aligned such that if the reduced voltage across the output terminals exceeds the diode's breakdown voltage, the output terminals are shunted to a reference point or ground.","The second diode is arranged in parallel to the first diode but is aligned such that forward current flow in the second diode is opposite that of the first diode. The second diode prevents an unsafe voltage from being applied to the output terminals when the second resistance fails in any open circuit condition.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the FIGUREs, like numerals being used to refer to like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.","In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a high voltage interface module used to reduce unsafe voltage to safe levels. As illustrated by the circuit contained in , a high or unsafe voltage input  is applied to circuit . Input voltage , drops across the voltage divider circuit having resistor  and resistor . The output voltage equals the portion of input voltage dropped across the terminals of resistor . The valve equals input voltage  reduced by the ratio of resistor  to the value of resistor  summed with resistor .","Transorb  prevents a failure in either resistor  or resistor  from resulting in the presence of a shock or other electrical hazard. This hazard would be carried within leads  and , used to carry the output voltage to test equipments . Transorb  may comprise a pair of oppositely aligned diodes  and . When diode  breaks down, for example, at 40 volts. Such a condition may occur if resistor  were to short-circuit. Similarly, if resistor  were to open circuit, the resulting the output voltage across the terminals of resistor  would be shunted to the reference point or ground by diode . In this condition, terminals  and  are connected to the reference points where diode  shunts input voltage .","This circuit, designed to be installed at or near a high-voltage sampling point, reduces the need to run dangerous high-voltage leads from the sampling point to testing equipment . In one example, input voltage  is reduced by a ratio of 1\/101.01. The output voltage, as previously stated, may be limited by a 40-volt transorb in the event of any signal element failure. The reduced-voltage output, measured across the terminals of resistor , runs to a data acquisition system or to a meter (display). As described, this system employs passive components and requires no adjustments or calibration. Additionally, the described results eliminate the need for high-voltage leads in favor of low-voltage leads  and . The low-voltage leads carry voltages that do not pose a shock hazard to personnel or an electrical hazard to equipment. This reduces risk associated with testing complex equipment containing high or unsafe voltages and has many industrial applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["60","62","2","64","66","2","68","70","72","74"]},"The passive nature of the circuit ensures that once the circuit is constructed, its functional characteristics may be easily determined by samples a known voltage.  illustrates that a known voltage input  is applied to the circuit . Resistor  allows a low-voltage output measurement to be taken across terminals  of resistor . The known input voltage and measured output voltage provide a constant ratio by which all future measurements using this high-voltage interface module may be ratioed as defined by Equation 2: \n\n\nEquation 2 shows the ratio of the low voltage output (V) to the Known Voltage Input (V) equals to the ratio of the value of resistor  to the sum of resistors  and .\n","The empirically determined ratio remains constant over the life of the interface module and may typically be quickly determined by the relationship continued in Equation 2. Equation 3 uses the empirically determined ratio of Equation 2 to determine the value of V. \n\n\nFor example, the ratio in Equation 2 may be recorded in data associated with the individual interface module for later use when sampling input voltages of an unknown value(s). The measured voltage is in Equation 3 shows that an unknown high-voltage input may be easily calculated as the product of a measured low voltage output (V) and the inverse ratio described in Equation 2. The ratio of a known high-voltage input (V) to its measured low-voltage output (V) equals the ratio of the resistor values.\n","The disclosed voltage interface module provides the ability to safely sample high-voltage signals and condition those signals locally at the point of measurement. Then these signals are routed via low-voltage leads to data collection equipment. This arrangement avoids potential shock hazards to which previous high-voltage measurement systems were susceptible. Thus, the present invention provides a safe and simple means to measure unsafe voltages in a complex system while protecting equipment and personnel from inadvertent and unexpected encounters with high-voltages. This system has numerous industrial applications, and ensures that should a signal element failure occur, the output of the interface module remains at a safe voltage level.","Although the present invention is described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present invention and the advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals indicate like features and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
