An authorization request message may comply with ISO 8583, which is a standard for systems that exchange electronic transactions made by consumers using payment devices. An authorization request message according to other embodiments may comply with other suitable standards. In embodiments of the invention, an authorization request message may include, among other data, a Primary Account Number (PAN) and expiration date associated with a payment device (e.g. credit\/debit card) of the consumer, amount of the transaction (which may be any type and form of a medium of exchange such a money or points), and identification of a merchant (e.g. merchant ID). Typically, an authorization request message is generated by a server computer (if the transaction is an e-commerce transaction) or a Point of Sale (POS) device (if the transaction is a brick and mortar type transaction) and is sent to an issuer via a payment processing network and an acquirer.","The term \u201cnon-payment transaction data\u201d may include any suitable type of data that is not typically present in an authorization request message. In some embodiments, non-payment transaction data may include data that is related to a particular transaction conducted using an authorization request message, but does not include data which is provided in the authorization request message itself. For example, SKU (stock keeping unit) data may be associated with a transaction and an authorization request message, but it is not present in the authorization request message. In other embodiments, non-payment transaction data may include data that is not specifically related to a transaction conducted using an authorization request message. For example, non-payment transaction data may comprise a general coupon that can be sent from the merchant to a central server computer. That general coupon may not be specifically associated with a transaction conducted with an authorization request message. Some examples of non-payment transaction data that may be sent in a non-payment transaction data message includes, but is not limited to, chargeback data, shopping cart data, coupon redemption codes, and enrollment information. Also, in some embodiments, non-payment transaction data could include image and video files that cannot be embedded in standard ISO messaging.","The term \u201caccess device\u201d as used can refer to a device that can initiate a payment transaction. In some embodiments, an access device can be a device that can interact with a portable consumer device (e.g., a payment card) during a transaction. In embodiments of the invention, the access device can transmit both ISO and XML transaction-related messages to a payment processing network. According to embodiments of the invention, the access device can be in any suitable form. Examples of access devices include point of sale (POS) devices, cellular phones, PDAs, personal computers (PCs), tablet PCs, handheld specialized readers, set-top boxes, electronic cash registers, automated teller machines (ATMs), virtual cash registers, kiosks, security systems, access systems, and the like. If the access device is a point of sale terminal, any suitable point of sale terminal may be used including card or phone readers. The card or phone readers may include any suitable contact or contactless mode of operation. For example, exemplary readers can include RF (radio frequency) antennas, magnetic stripe readers, etc. to interact with the portable consumer devices.","Embodiments of the present invention are described using Extensible Markup Language (XML). XML is a widely used markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Using a markup language, such as XML, may be advantageously used between the merchant and the payment processing network, since XML is a widely used and standardized means of annotating and passing information using current network technologies. However, embodiments of the invention are not restricted to use of XML and may also be implemented using any other markup language, such as YAML, JSON, etc., that allows annotating a document in a way syntactically distinguishable from the text. In some implementations of embodiments of the invention, other means of organizing and sharing data, such as passing information using well defined data structures and employing known network and programming protocols in the art may also be used.","A \u201cmerchant computer\u201d may include any suitable computational apparatus operated by a merchant. Examples of merchant computers may include an access device or an internet merchant computer.","The term \u201cpayment processing network\u201d may include a network of suitable processing entities (e.g., computers) that can have the ability to route transactions. have information related to an account associated with a portable consumer device such as a debit or credit card.","The payment processing network may have or operate at least a server computer and may include a database. The database may include any hardware, software, firmware, or combination of the preceding for storing and facilitating retrieval of information. Also, the database may use any of a variety of data structures, arrangements, and compilations to store and facilitate retrieval of information. The server computer may be coupled to the database and may include any hardware, software, other logic, or combination of the preceding for servicing the requests from one or more client computers. The server computer may comprise one or more computational apparatuses and may use any of a variety of computing structures, arrangements, and compilations for servicing the requests from one or more client computers.","The payment processing network may include data processing subsystems, networks, and operations used to support and deliver authorization services, exception file services, and clearing and settlement services. An exemplary payment processing network may include VisaNet\u2122. Networks that include VisaNet\u2122 are able to process credit card transactions, debit card transactions, and other types of commercial transactions. VisaNet\u2122, in particular, includes an integrated payments system (Integrated Payments system) which processes authorization requests and a Base II system which performs clearing and settlement services. Payment processing network may use any suitable wired or wireless network, including the Internet.","The term \u201cserver computer\u201d may include a powerful computer or cluster of computers. For example, the server computer can be a large mainframe, a minicomputer cluster, or a group of servers functioning as a unit. In one example, the server computer may be a database server coupled to a Web server.","The term \u201cformatting\u201d may refer to the conversion of data files and data messages (e.g. authorization request messages, non-payment transaction data messages, capture files, etc.) from one file format to a suitable format for transmission to payment processing networks or acquirer computers. It may also refer to the creation of a data file or the like according to a specific format. In some embodiments of the invention, a suitable file format is an XML format.","The term \u201ctransaction identifier\u201d may include a specific identifier associated with a financial transaction used to uniquely identify the financial transaction during processing of the financial transaction. The transaction identifier can be used to correlate or associate the non-payment transaction data message from a financial transaction with the authorization request message for the same financial transaction, as the two messages may be sent at different times. Suitable transaction identifiers may comprise numbers, letters, and combinations thereof. They may also be of any suitable length.","The term \u201ccommon data format\u201d may include a suitable file format for the capture files that are transmitted from a merchant access device or computer to a payment processing network. In embodiments of the invention, the common data format is an XML format.","The term \u201cinitial capture files\u201d may include a file that is generated and sent by the merchant access device or other computer apparatus to the payment processing network. The initial capture files may contain data, at least for clearing and settlement processing. In embodiments of the invention, the initial capture files are transmitted in a common data format (e.g. XML format).","The term \u201cacquirer capture files\u201d may include files generated by a payment processing network or other computer apparatus from initial capture files received from a merchant access device or computer. The payment processing network generates acquirer capture files for a plurality of different acquirers based on preferences or rules for format and reception of capture files established by each acquirer. In embodiments of the invention, the acquirer capture files may be in the same format or may be in different formats.","The term \u201cdatabase of acquirer information\u201d can include a database containing acquirer preferences and rules for formatting for and receiving capture files from the payment processing network.","The term \u201cclearing and settlement process\u201d may include a process of reconciling a transaction. A clearing process is a process of exchanging financial details between an acquirer and an issuer to facilitate posting to a party's account and reconciliation of the party's settlement position. Settlement involves the delivery of securities from one party to another. Clearing and settlement can occur simultaneously. In embodiments of the invention, as part of the clearing and settlement process, a payment processing network receives a plurality of initial capture files from a merchant computer or merchant access device, and generates a plurality of acquirer capture files for a plurality of acquirer computers.","I. Multi-Communications Systems and Methods","Embodiments of the invention can be directed to a method comprising receiving a first communication comprising an authorization request message and a second communication comprising non-payment transaction data from a merchant at a server computer in a payment processing network. The first and second communications can pass from the merchant to the payment processing network, without passing through an acquirer computer. The authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data are associated with the same transaction identifier. The method also comprises processing the authorization request message by the server computer. The method also comprises processing the non-payment transaction data by the server computer.","Since the first communication comprising the authorization request and the second communication comprising the non-payment transaction data pass directly from a merchant computer or merchant access device to a payment processing computer, it eliminates the need for the merchant computer to directly connect to each individual acquirer computer of a plurality of acquirer computers. This can increase processing speed, can allow merchants to manage fewer connections, and can also allow for the ability to provide additional types of data to the payment processing network. The payment processing network or a server computer residing therein, can perform processing that was not previously possible.","Illustratively, when a consumer engages in a transaction with a merchant, a merchant access device or computer transmits an authorization request message through a direct connection to a payment processing network. This authorization request message may include payment information such as an account number, a transaction amount, a service code, an expiration date, etc. The purpose of the authorization request message may be to simply obtain authorization for the transaction from an issuer of an account of the consumer. At the same time or at some other time, the merchant access device or merchant computer may also transmit a non-payment transaction data message comprising additional non-payment transaction data such as SKU (stock keeping unit) data to the payment processing network. Both of the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message may include the same transaction identifier indicating that they are related (e.g., an alphanumeric data string such as \u201cA1382LM\u201d).","The server computer in the payment processing network receives the authorization request message and performs additional processing. For example, the server computer can parse the authorization request message to determine whether to route the message to an issuer or to another payment network or debit gateway. The appropriate issuer, payment network or debit gateway receives the authorization request message and transmits an authorization response message back to the payment processing network. This authorization response message is then sent back to the merchant access device or merchant computer so that the merchant knows whether or not the transaction is approved.","The server computer in the payment processing network can receive the non-payment transaction data message. This message could contain, for example, the SKU numbers of the products that the consumer purchased in the transaction. For example, the consumer may have purchased toothpaste and a facial cream, and the SKU numbers for those items may be sent to the payment processing network in the non-payment transaction data message. The server computer could then analyze the information in the non-payment transaction data message and may provide a discount to the transaction, in real time, by comparing the SKU numbers for the purchased products against a list of discounts that may have been pre-stored at the payment processing network for that consumer. In some cases, the above-described authorization request message linked to the received SKU numbers by using the transaction identifier. The authorization request message could be modified to reduce the purchase price by the discounted amount, before it is forward to the issuer computer for approval. For instance, the purchased toothpaste may cost $4, and the consumer's existing discount from a pre-existing loyalty program run by the payment processing network may be $1. Instead of sending an authorization request message to the issuer for $4, the authorization request message for $3 could be sent to the issuer for approval. Such discounting by the payment processing network is not possible in the case of messages between the merchant computer and the payment processing network server passing through an acquirer computer because if the acquirer does not have knowledge of the discount it cannot apply the discount to the value amount in the authorization request message passed to the payment processing network, and also because acquirer computers are not configured to handle authorization response messages that indicate a different amount to the corresponding authorization request. An effect of this is that discount offers can be provided and discounts effected by the payment network without requiring the handling of coupons etc. by cardholders or merchants. Further, the traditional communication path between the payment processing network and the merchant is not designed to carry large amounts of data between the merchant, the payment processing network, and the issuer.","Note that the additional data provided by the merchant access device and\/or the merchant computer is not limited to the type of information that is provided in this specific example, and that other variations and embodiments are described in further detail below.","Note also that the \u201cfirst communication\u201d and the \u201csecond communication\u201d can be sent to a server computer at different points in time (e.g., one day apart), and at the same time (e.g., simultaneously). They can be sent over the same communication channel or different communication channels. They may be part of the same message or they may be different messages. For example, in one embodiment, the first communication and the second communication may be two portions of the same XML file, or they may be different XML files. In the former case, the payment processing network may receive the first and second communications in one file, but then may separate out the first and second communications so that they can be processed differently. For example, only the first communication may be converted to an ISO message that is sent to an issuer in some embodiments, while the second communication stays in an XML format for further processing by the payment processing network.","A. Systems","Example embodiments are typically implemented in the context of a payment transaction. Therefore, prior to further discussing the use of a payment processing network to handle transaction processing with an acquirer, a brief description of standard transaction processing prior to the invention will be presented.","An exemplary system  for standard transaction processing can be seen in .

In other embodiments, the high capacity direct exchange network (A) is capable of authorization processing and file transfer capabilities.","Using an Internet-based protocol (IP) connection from the merchant computer  to the payment processing network  (e.g. VisaNet), MDEX accepts and routes authorizations for all card and transaction types. This results in merchants only needing to support one message format (e.g. Visa ISO 8583). The payment processing network  would provide any necessary translations or conversions of data to different formats for downstream recipients of the data.","The medium capacity merchant flow  includes an access device , a payment gateway , and a first communication path . The medium capacity merchant flow  utilizes a medium capacity direct exchange network (A) that connects the access device  through an Internet and VPN  to the payment processing network . A virtual private network (VPN) is a network configured within a public network (e.g. the Internet) to provide remote users an access to a central organizational network.","The first communication path  can carry two separate communications including a first authorization request communication (A), and a first non-payment transaction data communication (B). In some embodiments, the first communication and the second communication occur over the same communication channel. In other words, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message can be routed on a single channel. In yet other embodiments, the first communication and the second communication occur over different communication channels.","In some embodiments, the payment gateway  can be a value-added reseller (VAR) gateway. A VAR is an entity that adds features or services to an existing product, and may resell it as an integrated product. Typically, a VAR is used to integrate systems and\/or software. This allows the payment processing network  to more easily provide merchant information and value-added services to a merchant computer . In some embodiments, the payment gateway  is not present and the access device  connects directly to the payment processing network  through the Internet and VPN .","The internet merchant flow  includes an internet merchant computer  and the first communication path . The internet merchant flow  utilizes an electronic commerce exchange network (A) that connects through the Internet  using the first communication path  to transmit messages to the payment processing network . As described above, the first communication path  can comprise two separate communications including a first authorization request communication (A), and a first non-payment transaction data communication (B), which can be used to carry additional data associated with a transaction.","In some embodiments of the invention, the high capacity direct exchange network (A) can be merged with the medium capacity direct exchange network (A). Linking the two exchange networks would enable a merchant computer to transmit some transactions over one network, and others over the other network, dependent on transaction volume and traffic. In embodiments such as these, the high capacity direct exchange network (A) and the medium capacity direct exchange network (A) are linked through a VAR.","In embodiments of the invention, the first communication and the second communication pass over a direct exchange network to the server computer (H) at approximately the same time. In these embodiments, for example, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message are transmitted to the payment processing network  at the same time. Both messages contain the same transaction identifier allowing them to be identified and associated with each other. That is, since the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message can be received at the payment processing network at different times, it can link the two messages by use of the transaction identifier so that appropriate processing can take place.","In other embodiments of the invention, the first communication and the second communication pass over a direct exchange network to the server computer (H) at different times. In these embodiments, for example, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message are transmitted to the payment processing network  at different times. Both messages contain the same transaction identifier allowing them to be identified and associated with each other.","In some cases, a protocol translation may need to occur between different platforms. The payment gateway  can perform this function for any of the network access platforms. For example, if the internet merchant flow  is used, the transaction information can be sent from an internet merchant computer  or an access device through the payment gateway  for translation and then to the appropriate platform via the Internet. Once this information is properly translated and forwarded to the appropriate platform associated with the payment processing network , the payment processing network  can perform the functions of the acquirer computer  and issuer computer .","The data transmitted along the first communication path  and the second communication path  is communicated between a merchant access device  and  or an internet merchant computer , and a payment processing network . The data transmitted along the first communication path  and the second communication path  can be in any data format. In embodiments of the present invention, the data format is an XML format.","In a transaction utilizing embodiments of the invention, the consumer  purchases a good or service at a merchant access device \/. If the high capacity direct exchange network (A) is used, the merchant access device \/ can send an authorization request message and a non-payment transaction data message directly to the payment processing network . For example, the messages will be sent by the merchant's host system  along the second communication path .","If the medium capacity direct exchange network (A) or the electronic commerce exchange network (A) is used, the merchant access device \/ sends an authorization request message and a non-payment transaction data message over the Internet  or , along the first communication path . The messages may be sent through the payment gateway  before being received by the payment processing network .","The authorization request messages and non-payment transaction data messages sent using any of the previously described flows , , or , are received at a payment processing network . The payment processing network  communicates with an issuer computer , associated with the portable consumer device used in the particular transaction. As noted above, although only one issuer computer  is shown, in other embodiments there may be a plurality of issuer computers.","The issuer computer  receives the authorization request message and transmits an authorization response message approving or declining the transaction. The authorization response message is received by the payment processing network , which matches the authorization response message to the associated authorization request message, and forwards the authorization response message back to the merchant access device  or , or to the internet merchant computer .","At the end of the day, a clearing and settlement process can be conducted by the payment processing network . In some embodiments, clearing and settlement can occur simultaneously.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","112","142","144","600","130","132","132","138","112","142","144","130","132","134","112","112","112","130","132","134","142","144","132","112","132","112","134","138","112","130","132","134"]},"Comparing the diagrams in  and , it is clear that the system shown in  is much less complex for a merchant to use and maintain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["200","108","200","501","200","502","504","502","502","506","508","510","512","200","200"]},"The high capacity direct exchange network (A) can support both authorization request message processing and file transfer capabilities and can route both the payment processing network brand and non-payment processing network brand transactions. The high capacity direct exchange network (A) provides a direct link between a merchant and the payment processing network using second communication channel  for authorization processing and file delivery.","The open file delivery module  can manage clearing and settling file exchanges and data that is received in batch files that are used for a capture file and other value-added services. The open file delivery module  can transform or reformat a file from one file format to another as well aggregate, disaggregate, and merge file data from a single endpoint or multiple endpoints. Transforming, or reformatting, is managed by the open file delivery module  without the need for changes to the file at either the source of the destination endpoint, saving endpoints from having to develop reformatting capabilities in their own systems. In some embodiments, the format can be an XML format. The point-to-point file services provided by the open file delivery module  allows merchants to securely transfer proprietary, payment-related data to a plurality of high capacity direct exchange network (A) endpoints, eliminating the need for multiple connections. Also, for example, a merchant can send its end-of-day clearing files to its acquirer or can sends rewards data to its clearinghouses through the high capacity direct exchange network (A).","The message gateway module  can facilitate the authorization processing. The message gateway module  supports all payment processing network  message types. For example, message gateway module  can support authorization only (dual message), where the message contains just enough information necessary to authorize transactions and the clearing can be accomplished through either a completion or a clearing and settlement message. Another example includes full service messaging (full financial\/single message), which contains all information necessary to authorize and clear simultaneously. The data fields used can vary depending on the message type. The message gateway module  can manage the real-time authorization flow between the merchant computer  and the payment processing network . The message gateway module  can also operate as a switch for all payment transactions, controlling traffic between all payment processing network participants. The message gateway module  can perform message translation for non-payment processing network brands. Additionally, the message gateway module  provides flexible content message format. For example, the content message format can be based on, e.g., Visa ISO 8583, the bit map can serve as a table of contents, the format can contain only fields that are relevant to the specific transaction, and the format can contain both packed and character data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","b":["200","601","602","603","601","606","606","608","610","610","602","602","612"]},"In embodiments, data is transmitted by one or more host computer (A) and (B) through firewalls (A) and (C) to open file delivery (OFD) and message gateway (MG) modules (A) and (B), which provide value-added services that are transmitted through additional firewalls (B) and (D) to Carrier A MPLS (A) and Carrier B MPLS (B).

If there are rewards or rebates, the payment processing network  can send that information to the merchant computer  via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A) and process those rewards or rebates on behalf of the merchant. The non-payment transaction information that may be in a communication to the payment processing network may comprise, for example, a rebate identifier (e.g., a rebate number or form), or rewards account number of balance.","Loyalty and Coupon Processing","In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can receive product SKU data from the merchant computer  through one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A) during a transaction, and the payment processing network  can then find a coupon associated with the SKU and apply it to the transaction (e.g., in the form of a statement credit on a card account). The payment processing network  can subsequently request the payment for the discount from the product manufacturer on behalf of the merchant so that the merchant can more efficiently receive the payment.","In some embodiments, processing the non-payment transaction data comprises generating and transmitting a coupon to a communication device operated by a consumer. For example, if the non-payment transaction data indicates that the consumer purchased an item from a particular merchant, the payment processing network can identify a coupon associated with that merchant and send it to a consumer's communication device (e.g. smart phone, PDA, etc.).","Alert Services","In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can receive the transaction information directed through one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A) and can then directly provide the merchant computer  with any alerts that may be triggered by the transaction information. In some embodiments, the non-payment transaction information may comprise information regarding an alert status (e.g., is the consumer registered to receive alerts) or alert preferences (e.g., how the alert is to be sent to the consumer). In such embodiments, the alert preferences or alert data may be stored by the merchant or in the consumer's portable consumer device.","Shipping Services","In some embodiments, for internet merchant computers , the payment processing network  can receive the non-payment transaction information through one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A). If a product needs to be shipped, the payment processing network  can forward the transaction information to a shipper via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A) who can subsequently ship the product purchased online, thereby eliminating the need for the merchant to send the shipping information to the shipper.","Data Security Services","In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can push data security upgrades for POS terminals directly to the merchant through one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A). For example, the payment processing network  can receive the transaction information through one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A) and can determine whether there is any risk associated with the transaction. If there is any risk, the payment processing network  can inform the merchant computer  via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A).","Data Analytics","In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can receive and store transaction information for the transactions during a period of time (e.g. one month) via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A). Using this information and information about the account holders, the payment processing network  can integrate this information into reports regarding any relevant statistics (e.g. which product are sold more often, which consumers purchase certain items, etc.).","Clearing and Settlement Services","In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can receive the transaction information for the transactions that occurred for that day via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A). The payment processing network  can then compile that information and send it to the acquirer computer  on behalf of the merchant computer  for clearing and settling.","Payment Token Processing","In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can receive transaction information associated with a payment account via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A). The payment processing network  can then authenticate the consumer  directly via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A), without having to go through the acquirer. Once the consumer  is authenticated, the payment processing network  can alert the merchant computer  of the authentication via one of the exchange networks (A), (A), and (A).","B. Methods","Methods according to embodiments of the invention can be described with respect to .  is a flowchart of a method  for processing authorization request messages and authorization response messages through the system .","In step , the consumer engages in a transaction with a merchant. In a typical transaction, the consumer  purchases a good or service at a merchant access device \/ associated with a merchant using a portable consumer device such as a credit card or mobile phone. The consumer's portable consumer device can interact with the merchant access device \/ such as a POS (point of sale) terminal communicatively coupled to the merchant computer . For example, the consumer  may swipe the credit card through a POS terminal or, in another embodiment, may take a wireless phone and may pass it near a contactless reader in a POS terminal. In other embodiments, the consumer  may conduct a transaction over the Internet via a personal computer or internet-enabled portable consumer device.","In step , the merchant access device \/ transmits an authorization request message and a non-payment transaction data message to the payment processing network . In embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message and non-payment transaction data are transmitted to a server computer (H) in the payment processing network  where an acquirer computer is not present between the server computer and the merchant computer. The authorization request message may be transmitted in any suitable format. In embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message are in an XML format, or other human and machine readable data format. In some embodiments, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message are sent by a merchant's host system  over a high capacity direct exchange network (A), or in other embodiments, by a payment gateway over a medium capacity direct exchange network (A), or by an electronic commerce exchange network (A). In some embodiments of the invention, the authorization request messages do not pass through an acquirer, but are transmitted from a merchant through one of the direct exchange networks (A), (A), or (A), directly to the payment processing network . In embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message can be sent either simultaneously or at different points of time from the merchant computer  to the payment processing network . Whether they are sent simultaneously or at different times, both the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message include a transaction identifier. The transaction identifier allows for the two messages to be identified as being related to the same transaction.","In step , the payment processing network  receives a first communication comprising an authorization request message and a second communication comprising non-payment transaction data at a server computer. In embodiments of the invention, the first communication and the second communication are received at approximately the same time. In other embodiments of the invention, the first communication and the second communication are received at different times. The payment processing network  receives the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message over the Internet \/. In embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message can be received either simultaneously or at different points of time by the payment processing network . In some embodiments, the authorization request message and the non-payment transaction data message are transmitted to the payment processing network  via a second communication path  that is part of a high capacity direct exchange network (A). As described previously, in some embodiments, the second authorization communication (A) and the first non-payment transaction data communication (B) can pass through the first communication path .","In step , a server computer (H) in the payment processing network  receives and processes the authorization request message. Processing the authorization request message can include determining whether the authorization request message is to be formatted into a different file format prior to transmission out to an issuer computer  or gateway computer . A data conversion module (J) in the payment processing network  formats the authorization request message from its original file format (e.g. XML) into an ISO format (e.g. ISO 8583) and passes the authorization request message to the authorization module (D) which is also in the payment processing network . In some embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message may be converted to an ISO format prior to being received by the payment processing network .","In step , the server computer (H) in the payment processing network  receives and processes the non-payment transaction data message. For example, the non-payment transaction data message may include information about the transaction that is not related to the payment (e.g. item purchased was a blue shirt, etc.). In some embodiments, the payment processing network  can use the data contained in the non-payment transaction data message to modify the authorization request message. For example, if the payment processing network  is offering a $10 discount for the purchase of a blue shirt and it receives the exemplary non-payment transaction data message described above, the payment processing network  can adjust the total in the authorization request message by $10 before transmitting it to an issuer computer .","In step , the authorization module (D) processes the authorization request message and determines the appropriate destination for the authorization request message. For example, the authorization request message may need to be routed to either an issuer computer  associated with the payment processing network , or to a gateway computer  to other payment networks  or debit gateways  for processing.","In step , the payment processing network  transmits the formatted authorization request message to the appropriate destination. In embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message can be sent to an issuer computer  or if the message is for a different payment network  or debit gateway , the authorization request message is routed through a gateway computer  to the appropriate payment network  or debit gateway .","In step , the payment processing network  receives an authorization response message from the issuer computer . The authorization response message can provide an approval or denial of the authorization request sent in the authorization request message.","In step , the payment processing network  matches the authorization response message to the associated authorization request message by matching the transaction identifier for the two messages.","In step , the payment processing network  transmits the authorization response message to the merchant access device  or  from which it received the authorization request message and non-payment transaction data message. Prior to being transmitted, the data conversion module (J) in the payment processing network  formats the authorization request message from an ISO format into an XML format. The authorization response message is transmitted back along the first communication path . In embodiments where the high capacity direct exchange network (A) was used to transmit the authorization request message, the payment processing network  transmits the authorization response message back along the second communication path .","In step , the merchant computer  receives the authorization response for the transaction. If the authorization response message states that the transaction is approved, the merchant computer  continues with the transaction. If the authorization response message states that the transaction is declined, the transaction ends.","In step , clearing and settlement is conducted for transactions. In some embodiments of the invention, the clearing and settlement process is conducted at the end-of-day. In other embodiments, the clearing and settlement process can occur multiple times throughout the day. For a more detailed explanation of the clearing and settlement process, see below.","In other embodiments of the invention, a merchant computer  transmits, by an access device associated with the merchant computer, an authorization request message and a merchant data message through a merchant processor computer, and receives at the access device, an authorization response messages from the merchant processor computer.","In other embodiments of the invention, encryption is used to protect sensitive data.

Reversing an Authorization","In embodiments of the invention, the full authorization reversal service releases the hold that the authorization placed on the customer's credit card funds. This service is used to reverse an unnecessary or undesired authorization. Full authorization reversal can be used only for an authorization that has not been captured and settled. A full authorization reversal is a follow-on transaction that uses the request ID returned from a previous authorization. The system uses the request ID to look up the customer's billing and account information from the original authorization, which means you are not required to include those fields in your full authorization reversal request. As an example, the following fields can be presented in an authorization reversal request message:\n\n","3. Capturing an Authorization","In embodiments of the invention, when the merchant is ready to fulfill a customer's order and transfer funds from the customer's bank to merchant bank, the authorization for the order must be captured. If the merchant fulfills only part of a customer's order, the full amount of the authorization is not captured; only the cost of the items that are being fulfilled. When the remaining items are shipped, a new authorization is requested and a new authorization is captured.","A capture is a follow-on transaction that uses the request ID returned from a previous authorization. The request ID links the capture to the authorization. The system uses the request ID to look up the customer's billing and account information from the original authorization, which means you are not required to include those fields in your capture request. As an example, the following fields can be presented in a capture request message:\n\n","4. Crediting a Payment","In embodiments, when a request for a credit is successful, the issuing bank for the credit card takes money out of the merchant bank account and returns it to the customer. As an example, the following fields can be presented in a credit request message:\n\n","billTo_postalCode\u2014This field contains the postal code of the billing address. This field is required only for transactions in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n","5. Voiding a Capture or Credit","In embodiments, a void cancels a capture or credit request that was submitted to the system. A transaction can be voided only if the system has not already submitted the capture or credit request. The system usually submits capture and credit requests once a day. The system will decline a void request if the capture or credit request has already been sent. As an example, the following fields can be presented in a void request message:\n\n","6. Partial Authorizations","For debit cards and prepaid cards, the issuer can approve a partial amount if the balance on the card is less than the requested authorization amount. Partial authorizations are supported for a plurality of payment networks (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club, American Express, Discover, and JCB). As an example, the following fields can be presented in authorization reply message where there is a partial authorization:\n\n","7.

Redemptions","In embodiments of the invention, a redemption platform will enable merchants to offer a scalable redemption platform to power offers, coupons and loyalty. The redemption occurs during authorizations when a payment processing network receives the request making the needed adjustments to the authorization amount prior to sending out the issuer. The payment processing network sends messaging in the response back to the merchants for reconciliation and consumer messaging.","This solution can be utilized by payment processing networks and third parties to conduct real-time redemption of offers and loyalty. It will create a standard process for consumers to redeem offers and assist merchants in simplifying the business processes and reconciliation. Finally it can drive value to all participants; consumers an easier to use enroll in programs and redeem, for retailers\/advertisers by providing new channels to reach consumers with a simple redemption process, and lastly payment processing network participants through the ability to offer next generation programs driving value to their clients.","For example, a consumer purchases $100 of goods from a merchant. The merchant computer transmits the authorization request to a payment processing network. The payment processing network matches the transaction with an offer qualification (e.g. $10 off a $100 or more purchase), and adjusts the amount in the authorization request to $90. The adjusted authorization request is transmitted to an issuer for approval. An authorization response is sent back to the payment processing network and through to the merchant computer. The receipt created by the merchant computer for the transaction reflects the real-time redemption and the shopper is notified (e.g. by, for example, SMS) of the offer redemption.","13.

Technical Benefits","Embodiments of the invention provide the technical benefits of efficiency and conserving resources. As merchant systems are connected directly to a payment processing network, which facilitates communications in the authorization process between the merchant and a plurality of issuers, payment networks, and debit gateways, merchants do not have to establish multiple connections to multiple payment networks. This creates greater efficiency as the payment processing network can conduct file translation to a plurality of destinations, where in the past, the merchant systems would have to be able to do so. Further, as data conversion can be conducted by the payment processing network on behalf of the merchant, the merchant requires less data storage for acquirer rules and requirement for data files and saves resources by not having to do file conversions to meet different requirements. Furthermore, computing and network resources of acquirer systems are not utilized at all prior to clearing and settlement, with no or relatively little increase in the use of computing and network resources of merchants and payment networks. In some cases, fewer network resources are used since acquirer computers are not used in many areas (e.g. authorization), where they have been traditionally used.","II. Flexible File Format","Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein include systems and methods for utilizing the capabilities of a payment processing network to customize the format of capture files for different acquirers on behalf of merchant computers in communication with the payment processing network.","Payment processing networks can provide their customers (merchants) with value-added services, such as, e.g., connecting the merchants to their acquirer and performing authorization message processing and clearing and settlement services on behalf of the merchant by creating and sending clearing and settlement files to the merchant's acquirer. In order to do this, the payment processing network must connect to the merchant's acquires. This can require the payment processing network to connect to several acquirers.","In embodiments of the invention, the merchant can connect to the payment processing network (e.g. VisaNet) via an application programming interface (API) in order to receive merchant services. The payment processing network (e.g. VisaNet) is used as a gateway to the appropriate acquirer when sending data such as authorization request messages or capture files for clearing and settlement. This process flow is beneficial because it eliminates the need for the merchant access device or merchant computer to connect to each individual acquirer. Since the data transfer paths to different acquirers are already set up for the payment processing network, using it as a gateway allows the merchant computer to manage fewer connections.","In addition, a flexible file format can be used for clearing and settlement files, in which the file format can be more easily configured depending on the acquirer's needs. The flexible file format is formatted in a manner that allows certain data to be added or omitted before sending to an acquirer based on that acquirer's needs. For example, an acquirer may decide which data the acquirer wishes to receive. The flexible file format allows for easy reconfiguration of the data file based on those needs.","A. Systems","An exemplary system  for processing a transaction and transmitting capture file data utilizing the present invention can be seen in . For simplicity of discussion, only one of each component is shown. It is understood, however, that embodiments of the invention may include more than one of each component.

Additional components are depicted in .","The authorization log database (B) contains records of authorization. The data contained in the authorization log database (B) can be transmitted to participating acquirers by subscription. The data contained in the authorization log database (B) can be in a plurality of file formats (e.g. TC33 POS Data, Raw Data, and POSA files).","The capture file processing module (C) generates capture files from the data sent from the merchant computer  to the payment processing network  in the authorization request message. In embodiments of the invention, the capture files are in a flexible file format (e.g. XML). The capture file processing module (C) accumulates the capture files in the capture file database (I) until a batch cut-off is met. In other embodiments, the capture file processing module (C) accumulates the capture files in the capture file database (I) until a pre-determined scheduled time, or at the end of the day.","The authorization module (D) processes the authorization request message and determines the appropriate destination for the authorization request message.","The clearing and settlement module (E) handles the clearing and settlement of transaction made on payment processing network cards. An example of the clearing and settlement module is Base II, which provides clearing, settlement, and other interchange-related services to members.","The capture file database (I) is a database that accumulates and stores capture files prior to clearing and settlement.","The data conversion module (J) converts the authorization request message from one format to another format. In embodiments of the invention, the authorization request message is generated and processed in XML and the data conversion module (J) converts the message into an ISO format (e.g. ISO 8583).","B. Methods",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0222","num":"0292"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 18"]},"In step , in a typical transaction, a consumer engages in a transaction with a merchant using a portable consumer device. A merchant access device  and , or an internet merchant computer  can transmits authorization request messages and non-payment transaction data to a payment processing network  to conduct authorization processing.

In embodiments of the invention, the payment processing network  captures the data contained in the authorization request message for clearing and settlement processing. The payment processing network  receives an authorization response, either approving or denying the transaction, and transmits this message back to the merchant access device  or , or the internet merchant computer .","In step , the payment processing network  then processes the initial capture files and determines the acquirer computer (A-D) for each capture file. The capture files are generated from the authorization request messages that pass through the payment processing network .","In step , the payment processing network  accesses a master log database (G), which is a database of acquirer information. The acquirer information can include rules and requirements for capture files. For example, the payment processing network  can support file customization by allowing pre-selection of data elements for each participating acquirer computer (A-D).","In step , the payment processing network  stores capture files in a capture file database (I). In embodiments of the invention, the capture files in the database can be in an XML format. In other embodiments of the invention, the capture files in the database can be in an ISO format. In yet other embodiments, the capture files in the database can be in a text file format (e.g. a payment processing network-defined flat text file format). An example of a text file format is the TC33 format. In embodiments of the invention, the capture files in the database can be either initial capture files or formatted acquirer capture files.","In step , based on rules and requirements established by acquirer computers (A-D) for the reception of capture files contained in the master log database (G), the payment processing network  generates a plurality of acquirer capture files for a plurality of different acquirer computers (A-D). In some embodiments of the invention, the acquirer capture files can be in a payment processing network-defined flat text file format (e.g. TC33, as described below). In other embodiments, the acquirer capture files can be in a plurality of data formats based on acquirer computer (A-D) specifications.","In step , the payment processing network  then transmits the acquirer capture files to the appropriate acquirer computers (A-D). The acquirer capture files can be transmitted by the payment processing network  to the acquirer computers (A-D) multiple times a day or based on pre-determined criteria for delivery (e.g. end-of-day delivery, delivery based upon threshold volume being reached, etc.).","In step , the appropriate acquirer computers (A-D) receive the acquirer capture files from the payment processing network .","In step , the acquirer computers (A-D) process the capture files that is received and conducts clearing and settlement processing. In embodiments of the invention, this process involves sending the capture files to the payment networks  or debit gateways  associated with each of the acquirer computers (A-D). Clearing involves the process of collecting a transaction from an acquirer in the merchant's currency and delivering it to the issuer in the consumer's currency. Settlement involves the actual transfer of funds from the issuer computer to the acquirer computer through, for example, a wire transfer.","In step , the merchant is then paid by the acquirer computer (A-D) following the clearing and settlement of each transaction.","In some embodiments of the invention, the plurality of initial capture files are generated by the merchant access device  or , or the internet merchant computer , prior to being transmitted to the payment processing network .

Technical Benefits","Embodiments of the invention provide the technical benefits of efficiency and conserving resources. As merchant systems are connected directly to a payment processing network, which facilitates communications in the capture file and clearing and settlement process between the merchant and a plurality of acquirers, merchants do not have to establish multiple connections to multiple acquirer computers. This creates greater efficiency as the payment processing network can conduct file translation to a plurality of destinations, where in the past, the merchant systems would have to be able to do so. Further, as data conversion can be conducted by the payment processing network on behalf of the merchant, the merchant requires less data storage for acquirer rules and requirement for data files and saves resources by not having to do file conversions to meet different requirements.","F. Additional Embodiments","In other embodiments, an electronic wallet may be used to conduct a transaction. An electronic wallet may be used in a variety of transactions, including but not limited to eCommerce, social networks, money transfer\/personal payments, mobile commerce, proximity payments, gaming, and\/or the like. For example, users may engage in eCommerce via the electronic wallet for retail purchases, digital goods purchases, and utility payments. Users may also, for example, use the electronic wallet to purchase games or gaming credits from gaming websites, and transfer funds to friends via social networks. Further, for example, users may also use the electronic wallet on a smart phone for retail purchases, buying digital goods, NFC\/RF payments at point of sale (POS) terminals.","In an exemplary transaction involving an electronic wallet, a consumer may submit an indication to purchase or transfer funds. For example, the consumer may visit a merchant website (e.g., Facebook.com, Amazon.com, etc.), and request to purchase an item from the website, transfer funds to a friend, and\/or the like. The merchant website may determine whether the electronic wallet is authorized on its website, and may provide a list of payment options. If the merchant is registered with a electronic wallet server, the electronic wallet server may authorize the merchant to collect consumer credentials for login to the electronic wallet, and the merchant website may prompt the consumer to login to the electronic wallet. Otherwise, the merchant website may request the consumer to provide payment details for alternative payment options (e.g., credit card, debit card, PayPal account).","The consumer may authorize submission of their wallet consumer credentials, such as, but not limited to a Wallet\/User ID, a password, and\/or the like. For example, the consumer may enter the Wallet\/User ID and password into a pop-up window provided from the merchant website and\/or electronic wallet server. In another example, the consumer may authorize the merchant website to provide the consumer credentials (e.g., previously stored in HTML5, cookies, etc.), to the electronic wallet server. In yet another example, the consumer may authorize the electronic wallet server, via a remote component running on the merchant website (e.g., a Java applet, etc.) to provide consumer credentials to the electronic wallet server for verification.","When the consumer submits consumer credentials to log into the electronic wallet, the merchant website may forward the consumer credentials and transaction details to the electronic wallet server, which may determine the validity of the consumer credentials. If the consumer's credentials are not valid, the electronic wallet server may deny the payment request and send a notification of denial to the merchant website. In other embodiments, if the consumer provided credentials are valid, the electronic wallet server may process payment from the electronic wallet. For example, the electronic wallet server communicates with the consumer's bank account associated with the electronic wallet and requests a fund transfer of an indicated amount. The electronic wallet server may then store a transaction record.","In some embodiments, after processing the payment, the electronic wallet server sends a payment confirmation notice to the merchant website, which in turn completes the order and stores the transaction record in the database. The merchant website may provide a confirmation page comprising transaction confirmation to the consumer.","Other embodiments of the invention include a method comprising, generating, at a merchant computer, an authorization request message and a non-payment transaction data message, and transmitting, by the merchant computer, the authorization request message and non-payment transaction data message.","Other embodiments of the invention further include a computer comprising: a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, comprising code executable by the processor for implementing a method comprising: generating an authorization request message and a non-payment transaction data message, and transmitting the authorization request message and non-payment transaction data message.","Other embodiments of the invention include a method comprising: sending a communication comprising non-payment transaction data to a server computer, wherein non-payment transaction data is sent through a communication channel that is present between a merchant computer and the server computer, wherein the communication channel does not pass through an acquirer, and wherein the server computer performs further processing.","The various participants and elements of the embodiments may operate one or more computer apparatuses to facilitate the functions described herein. Any of the elements in  and - may use any suitable number of subsystems to facilitate the functions described herein. Examples of such subsystems or components are shown in . The subsystems shown in  are interconnected via a system bus .
