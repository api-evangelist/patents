{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/552,516, filed Jul. 18, 2012, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61\/528,585, filed Aug. 29, 2011, 61\/547,343, filed Oct. 14, 2011, 61\/562,278, filed Nov. 21, 2011, 61\/595,947, filed Feb. 7, 2012, and 61\/645,982, filed May 11, 2012, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. (2007) 14:2214-2234).","Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and\/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine\/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and\/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and\/or threonine residues.","Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (e.g., PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases.","The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.","PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3\u2032-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation. The class I PI3Ks (p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, p110\u03b4, and p110\u03b3) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt\/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The PI3Ks are protein kinases that control cell growth (mTORC1) or monitor genomic integrity (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and hSmg-1).","The delta (\u03b4) isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated, in particular, in a number of diseases and biological processes. PI3K-\u03b4 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T-cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B-cells, and macrophages. PI3K-\u03b4 is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T-cell function, B-cell activation, mast cell activation, dendritic cell function, and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function, PI3K-\u03b4 is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and auto-immune diseases such as lupus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PI3K involved in immune system function includes PI3K-\u03b3, which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus.","Unlike PI3K-\u03b4, the beta (\u03b2) isoform of class I PI3K appears to be ubiquitously expressed. PI3K-\u03b2 has been implicated primarily in various types of cancer including PTEN-negative cancer (Edgar et al. (2010) 70(3):1164-1172), and HER2-overexpressing cancer such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer.","Described herein are compounds capable of selectively inhibiting certain isoform(s) of class I PI3K without substantially affecting the activity of the remaining isoforms of the same class. For example, non-limiting examples of inhibitors capable of selectively inhibiting PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or PI3K-\u03b3, but without substantially affecting the activity of PI3K-\u03b2 are disclosed. Such inhibitors can be effective in ameliorating disease conditions associated with PI3K-\u03b4\/\u03b3 activity.","In one aspect, provided herein are compounds of Formula

As used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of subjects without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, Berge et al. describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in (1977) 66:1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, besylate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.

Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a \u201csolvate\u201d (e.g., a hydrate). As used herein, the term \u201csolvate\u201d refers to compounds that further include a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The solvate can be of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Where the solvent is water, the solvate is a \u201chydrate\u201d. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes that, for example, can include 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, about 3 or about 4, solvent or water molecules. It will be understood that the term \u201ccompound\u201d as used herein encompasses the compound and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a prodrug. As used herein, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis (e.g., hydrolysis in blood). In certain cases, a prodrug has improved physical and\/or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmaceutically and\/or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d , Vol. 14, and in , ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. Exemplary advantages of a prodrug can include, but are not limited to, its physical properties, such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound, or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract, or it can enhance drug stability for long-term storage.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.

The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R-S system. When a compound is an enantiomer, the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (\u2212) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry at each asymmetric atom, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically substantially pure forms and intermediate mixtures.

As used herein, the term \u201ctautomer\u201d is a type of isomer that includes two or more interconvertable compounds resulting from at least one formal migration of a hydrogen atom and at least one change in valency (e.g., a single bond to a double bond, a triple bond to a single bond, or vice versa). \u201cTautomerization\u201d includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. \u201cPrototropic tautomerization\u201d or \u201cproton-shift tautomerization\u201d involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g., in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. Tautomerizations (i.e., the reaction providing a tautomeric pair) can be catalyzed by acid or base, or can occur without the action or presence of an external agent. Exemplary tautomerizations include, but are not limited to, keto-to-enol; amide-to-imide; lactam-to-lactim; enamine-to-imine; and enamine-to-(a different) enamine tautomerizations. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers.","Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms.

In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition described herein includes a second active agent such as an additional therapeutic agent, (e.g., a chemotherapeutic).","1. Formulations","Pharmaceutical compositions can be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets (e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption), capsules, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue, and intraduodenal routes; parenteral administration, including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray applied to the skin; intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream, stent or foam; sublingually; ocularly; pulmonarily; local delivery by catheter or stent; intrathecally, or nasally.","Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which can be employed in pharmaceutical compositions include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.","These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, lubricants, and\/or antioxidants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the compounds described herein can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound described herein and\/or the chemotherapeutic with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound as provided herein with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art.

Formulations for Oral Administration","In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing a compound as provided herein, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a disclosed compound; optionally (ii) an effective amount of one or more second agents; and (iii) one or more pharmaceutical excipients suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and\/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., about 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the pharmaceutical compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. In some embodiments, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.","Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.","Disintegrants can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds provided herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.","Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.","When aqueous suspensions and\/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, for example, emulsifying and\/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.","The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.","Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.","A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least about 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (\u201cHLB\u201d value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.","Hydrophilic surfactants can be either ionic or non-ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium salts; fusidic acid salts; fatty acid derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; glyceride derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins; lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins; phospholipids and derivatives thereof; lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.","Within the aforementioned group, ionic surfactants include, by way of example: lecithins, lysolecithin, phospholipids, lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.","Ionic surfactants can be the ionized forms of lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylserine, PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine, PVP-phosphatidylethanolamine, lactylic esters of fatty acids, stearoyl-2-lactylate, stearoyl lactylate, succinylated monoglycerides, mono\/diacetylated tartaric acid esters of mono\/diglycerides, citric acid esters of mono\/diglycerides, cholylsarcosine, caproate, caprylate, caprate, laurate, myristate, palmitate, oleate, ricinoleate, linoleate, linolenate, stearate, lauryl sulfate, teracecyl sulfate, docusate, lauroyl carnitines, palmitoyl carnitines, myristoyl carnitines, and salts and mixtures thereof.","Hydrophilic non-ionic surfactants can include, but are not limited to, alkylglucosides; alkylmaltosides; alkylthioglucosides; lauryl macrogolglycerides; polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers such as polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers; polyoxyalkylene alkylphenols such as polyethylene glycol alkyl phenols; polyoxyalkylene alkyl phenol fatty acid esters such as polyethylene glycol fatty acids monoesters and polyethylene glycol fatty acids diesters; polyethylene glycol glycerol fatty acid esters; polyglycerol fatty acid esters; polyoxyalkylene sorbitan fatty acid esters such as polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters; hydrophilic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of glycerides, vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, fatty acids, and sterols; polyoxyethylene sterols, derivatives, and analogues thereof; polyoxyethylated vitamins and derivatives thereof; polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers; and mixtures thereof; polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters and hydrophilic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of triglycerides, vegetable oils, and hydrogenated vegetable oils. The polyol can be glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, pentaerythritol, or a saccharide.","Other hydrophilic-non-ionic surfactants include, without limitation, PEG-10 laurate, PEG-12 laurate, PEG-20 laurate, PEG-32 laurate, PEG-32 dilaurate, PEG-12 oleate, PEG-15 oleate, PEG-20 oleate, PEG-20 dioleate, PEG-32 oleate, PEG-200 oleate, PEG-400 oleate, PEG-15 stearate, PEG-32 distearate, PEG-40 stearate, PEG-100 stearate, PEG-20 dilaurate, PEG-25 glyceryl trioleate, PEG-32 dioleate, PEG-20 glyceryl laurate, PEG-30 glyceryl laurate, PEG-20 glyceryl stearate, PEG-20 glyceryl oleate, PEG-30 glyceryl oleate, PEG-30 glyceryl laurate, PEG-40 glyceryl laurate, PEG-40 palm kernel oil, PEG-50 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-40 castor oil, PEG-35 castor oil, PEG-60 castor oil, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-60 corn oil, PEG-6 caprate\/caprylate glycerides, PEG-8 caprate\/caprylate glycerides, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, PEG-30 cholesterol, PEG-25 phyto sterol, PEG-30 soya sterol, PEG-20 trioleate, PEG-40 sorbitan oleate, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, POE-9 lauryl ether, POE-23 lauryl ether, POE-10 oleyl ether, POE-20 oleyl ether, POE-20 stearyl ether, tocopheryl PEG-100 succinate, PEG-24 cholesterol, polyglyceryl-10oleate, Tween 40, Tween 60, sucrose monostearate, sucrose monolaurate, sucrose monopalmitate, PEG 10-100 nonyl phenol series, PEG 15-100 octyl phenol series, and poloxamers.","Suitable lipophilic surfactants include, by way of example only: fatty alcohols; glycerol fatty acid esters; acetylated glycerol fatty acid esters; lower alcohol fatty acids esters; propylene glycol fatty acid esters; sorbitan fatty acid esters; polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters; sterols and sterol derivatives; polyoxyethylated sterols and sterol derivatives; polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers; sugar esters; sugar ethers; lactic acid derivatives of mono- and di-glycerides; hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of glycerides, vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, fatty acids and sterols; oil-soluble vitamins\/vitamin derivatives; and mixtures thereof.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g., by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.","In some embodiments, the compounds can be administered daily, every other day, three times a week, twice a week, weekly, or bi-weekly. The dosing schedule can include a \u201cdrug holiday,\u201d i.e., the drug can be administered for two weeks on, one week off, or three weeks on, one week off, or four weeks on, one week off, etc., or continuously, without a drug holiday.

In yet another embodiment, the administration continues for more than about 6, about 10, about 14, about 28 days, about two months, about six months, or about one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.","Administration of the pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein can continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent as provided herein is administered for more than about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 14, or about 28 days.

Kits","In some embodiments, provided herein are kits. The kits can include a compound or pharmaceutical composition as described herein, in suitable packaging, and written material that can include instructions for use, discussion of clinical studies, listing of side effects, and the like. Such kits can also include information, such as scientific literature references, package insert materials, clinical trial results, and\/or summaries of these and the like, which indicate or establish the activities and\/or advantages of the pharmaceutical composition, and\/or which describe dosing, administration, side effects, drug interactions, or other information useful to the health care provider. Such information can be based on the results of various studies, for example, studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models and studies based on human clinical trials.","In some embodiments, a memory aid is provided with the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows \u201cFirst Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . etc. . . . Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . \u201d etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A \u201cdaily dose\u201d can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day.","The kit can further contain another agent. In some embodiments, the compound as provided herein and the agent are provided as separate pharmaceutical compositions in separate containers within the kit. In some embodiments, the compound as provided herein and the agent are provided as a single pharmaceutical composition within a container in the kit. Suitable packaging and additional articles for use (e.g., measuring cup for liquid preparations, foil wrapping to minimize exposure to air, and the like) are known in the art and can be included in the kit. In other embodiments, kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active agents. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, syringes, drip bags, patches, and inhalers. Kits described herein can be provided, marketed and\/or promoted to health providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, formulary officials, and the like. Kits can also, in some embodiments, be marketed directly to the consumer.","An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. The strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.","Kits can further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active agents. For example, if an active agent is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration, the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active agent can be dissolved to form a particulate-free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., about 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","Therapeutic Methods","Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are members of a conserved family of lipid kinases that regulate numerous cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, cell survival and metabolism. Several classes of PI3Ks exist in mammalian cells, including Class IA subgroup (e.g., PI3K-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), which are generally activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs); Class IB (e.g., PI3K-\u03b3), which is activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), among others. PI3Ks exert their biological activities via a \u201cPI3K-mediated signaling pathway\u201d that includes several components that directly and\/or indirectly transduce a signal triggered by a PI3K, including the generation of second messenger phophotidylinositol, 3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane, activation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling, and generation of further second messengers such as cAMP, DAG, and IP3, all of which leads to an extensive cascade of protein kinase activation (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck, B. et al. (2001) 70:535-602). For example, PI3K-\u03b4 is activated by cellular receptors through interaction between the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85) SH2 domains, or through direct interaction with RAS. PIP3 produced by PI3K activates effector pathways downstream through interaction with plextrin homology (PH) domain containing enzymes (e.g., PDK-1 and AKT [PKB]). (Fung-Leung W P. (2011) 23(4):603-8). Unlike PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3 is not associated with a regulatory subunit of the p85 family, but rather with a regulatory subunit in the p101 family. PI3K-\u03b3 is associated with GPCRs, and is responsible for the very rapid induction of PIP3. PI3K-\u03b3 can be also activated by RAS.","In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of modulating a PI3K kinase activity (e.g., selectively modulating) by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, isomers, prodrugs, and isotopically labeled derivatives) thereof, or pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein. Modulation can be inhibition (e.g., reduction) or activation (e.g., enhancement) of kinase activity. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound as provided herein in solution. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting the kinase activity by contacting a cell, tissue, organ that express the kinase of interest with a compound provided herein.

In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting PI3 kinase activity in a subject (including mammals such as humans) by contacting said subject with an amount of a compound as provided herein sufficient to inhibit or reduce the activity of the PI3 kinase in said subject.","In some embodiments, the kinase is a lipid kinase or a protein kinase. In some embodiments, the kinase is selected from a PI3 kinase including different isoforms such as PI3 kinase a, PI3 kinase 3, PI3 kinase \u03b3, PI3 kinase \u03b4; DNA-PK; mTor; Abl, VEGFR, Ephrin receptor B4 (EphB4); TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2); FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3); Platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); RET; ATM; ATR; hSmg-1; Hck; Src; Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); KIT; Inulsin Receptor (IR); and IGFR.","As used herein, a \u201cPI3K-mediated disorder\u201d refers to a disease or condition involving aberrant PI3K-mediated signaling pathway. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K mediated disorder in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b3 mediated disorder in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for inhibiting at least one of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3, the method comprising contacting a cell expressing PI3K in vitro or in vivo with an effective amount of the compound or composition provided herein. PI3Ks have been associated with a wide range of conditions, including immunity, cancer and thrombosis (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck, B. et al. (2010) , DOI 10.1007\/82_2010_65). For example, Class I PI3Ks, particularly PI3K-\u03b3 and PI3K-\u03b4 isoforms, are highly expressed in leukocytes and have been associated with adaptive and innate immunity; thus, these PI3Ks are believed to be important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic malignancies (reviewed in Harris, S J et al. (2009) 10(11):1151-62); Rommel C. et al. (2007) 7(3):191-201; Durand C A et al. (2009) 183(9):5673-84; Dil N, Marshall A J. (2009) 46(10):1970-8; Al-Alwan M M et al.

(2009) 139(3):573-86).","Numerous publications support roles of PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2 in the differentiation, maintenance, and activation of immune and malignant cells, as described in more detail below.","The importance of PI3K-\u03b4 in the development and function of B-cells is supported from inhibitor studies and genetic models. PI3K-\u03b4 is an important mediator of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, and is upstream of AKT, calcium flux, PLC\u03b3, MAP kinase, P70S6k, and FOXO3a activation. PI3K-\u03b4 is also important in IL4R, S1P, and CXCR5 signaling, and has been shown to modulate responses to toll-like receptors 4 and 9 Inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4 have shown the importance of PI3K-\u03b4 in B-cell development (Marginal zone and B1 cells), B-cell activation, chemotaxis, migration and homing to lymphoid tissue, and in the control of immunoglobulin class switching leading to the production of IgE.

(2009) 139(3):573-86)","In T-cells, PI3K-\u03b4 has been demonstrated to have a role in T-cell receptor and cytokine signaling, and is upstream of AKT, PLC\u03b3, and GSK3b. In PI3K-\u03b4 deletion or kinase-dead knock-in mice, or in inhibitor studies, T-cell defects including proliferation, activation, and differentiation have been observed, leading to reduced T helper cell 2 (TH2) response, memory T-cell specific defects (DTH reduction), defects in antigen dependent cellular trafficking, and defects in chemotaxis\/migration to chemokines (e.g., S1P, CCR7, CD62L). (Garcon F. et al. (2008) 111(3):1464-71; Okkenhaug K et al. (2006). 177(8):5122-8; Soond D R, et al. (2010) 115(11):2203-13; Reif K, (2004). 2004; 173(4):2236-40; Ji H. et al.

(2008) 118(3):1154-64).","In neutrophils, PI3K-\u03b4 along with PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2, contribute to the responses to immune complexes, FC\u03b3RII signaling, including migration and neutrophil respiratory burst. Human neutrophils undergo rapid induction of PIP3 in response to formyl peptide receptor (FMLP) or complement component C5a (C5a) in a PI3K-\u03b3 dependent manner, followed by a longer PIP3 production period that is PI3K-\u03b4 dependent, and is essential for respiratory burst. The response to immune complexes is contributed by PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2, and is an important mediator of tissue damage in models of autoimmune disease (Randis T M et al. (2008) 38(5):1215-24; Pinho V, (2007) 179(11):7891-8; Sadhu C. et al. (2003) 170(5):2647-54; Condliffe A M et al. (2005) 106(4):1432-40). It has been reported that in certain autoimmune diseases, preferential activation of PI3K\u03b2 may be involved. (Kulkarni et al., (2011) 4(168) ra23: 1-11). It was also reported that PI3K\u03b2-deficient mice were highly protected in an Fc\u03b3R-dependent model of autoantibody-induced skin blistering and partially protected in an Fc\u03b3R-dependent model of inflammatory arthritis, whereas combined deficiency of PI3K\u03b2 and PI3K\u03b4 resulted in near complete protection in inflammatory arthritis. (Id.).","In macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), glucocorticoid responsiveness can be restored by treatment of the cells with inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4. Macrophages also rely on PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 for responses to immune complexes through the arthus reaction (FCgR and C5a signaling) (Randis T M, et al. (2008) 38(5):1215-24; Marwick J A et al. (2009) 179(7):542-8; Konrad S, et al. (2008) 283(48):33296-303).","In mast cells, stem cell factor\u2014(SCF) and IL3-dependent proliferation, differentiation and function are PI3K-\u03b4 dependent, as is chemotaxis. The allergen\/IgE crosslinking of FCgR1 resulting in cytokine release and degranulation of the mast cells is severely inhibited by treatment with PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors, suggesting a role for PI3K-\u03b4 in allergic disease (Ali K et al. (2004) 431(7011):1007-11; Lee K S, et al. (2006) 20(3):455-65; Kim M S, et al. (2008) 29(10):493-501).","Natural killer (NK) cells are dependent on both PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 for efficient migration towards chemokines including CXCL10, CCL3, SIP and CXCL12, or in response to LPS in the peritoneum (Guo H, et al. (2008) 205(10):2419-35; Tassi I, et al. (2007) 27(2):214-27; Saudemont A, (2009) 106(14):5795-800; Kim N, et al. (2007) 110(9):3202-8).","The roles of PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2 in the differentiation, maintenance, and activation of immune cells support a role for these enzymes in inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) to allergic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma, and inflammatory respiratory disease such as COPD. Extensive evidence is available in experimental animal models, or can be evaluated using art-recognized animal models. In an embodiment, described herein is a method of treating inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) to allergic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and COPD using a compound described herein.","For example, inhibitors of PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in several autoimmune animal models for rheumatoid arthritis (Williams, O. et al. (2010) 17(2):123-34; WO 2009\/088986; WO2009\/088880; WO 2011\/008302). PI3K-\u03b4 is expressed in the RA synovial tissue (especially in the synovial lining which contains fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and selective PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in inhibiting synoviocyte growth and survival (Bartok et al. (2010) 62 Suppl 10:362). Several PI3K-\u03b4 and -\u03b3 inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate arthritic symptoms (e.g., swelling of joints, reduction of serum-induced collagen levels, reduction of joint pathology and\/or inflammation), in art-recognized models for RA, such as collagen-induced arthritis and adjuvant induced arthritis (WO 2009\/088986; WO2009\/088880; WO 2011\/008302).","The role of PI3K-\u03b4 has also been shown in models of T-cell dependent response, including the DTH model. In the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the PI3K-\u03b3\/\u03b4-double mutant mice are resistant. PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors have also been shown to block EAE disease induction and development of TH-17 cells both in vitro and in vivo (Haylock-Jacobs, S. et al. (2011) 36(3-4):278-87).","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease that at different stages requires memory T-cells, B-cell polyclonal expansion and differentiation into plasma cells, and the innate immune response to endogenous damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS), and the inflammatory responses to immune complexes through the complement system as well as the Freceptors. The role of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 together in these pathways and cell types suggest that blockade with an inhibitor would be effective in these diseases. A role for PI3K in lupus is also predicted by two genetic models of lupus. The deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) leads to a lupus-like phenotype, as does a transgenic activation of Class1A PI3Ks, which includes PI3K-\u03b4. The deletion of PI3K-\u03b3 in the transgenically activated class 1A lupus model is protective, and treatment with a PI3K-\u03b3 selective inhibitor in the murine MLR\/lpr model of lupus improves symptoms (Barber, D F et al. (2006) 176(1): 589-93).","In allergic disease, PI3K-\u03b4 has been shown by genetic models and by inhibitor treatment to be essential for mast-cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphalaxis assay (Ali K et al. (2008) 180(4):2538-44; Ali K, (2004) 431(7011):1007-11). In a pulmonary measure of response to immune complexes (Arthus reaction) a PI3K-\u03b4 knockout is resistant, showing a defect in macrophage activation and C5a production. Knockout studies and studies with inhibitors for both PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 support a role for both of these enzymes in the ovalbumin induced allergic airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness model (Lee K S et al. (2006) 20(3):455-65). Reductions of infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes as well as TH2 cytokines (IL4, IL5, and IL13) were seen with both PI3K-\u03b4 specific and dual PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitors in the Ova induced asthma model (Lee K S et al. (2006) 118(2):403-9).","PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 inhibition can be used in treating COPD. In the smoked mouse model of COPD, the PI3K-\u03b4 knockout does not develop smoke induced glucocorticoid resistance, while wild-type and PI3K-\u03b3 knockout mice do. An inhaled formulation of dual PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 inhibitor blocked inflammation in a LPS or smoke COPD models as measured by neutrophilia and glucocorticoid resistance (Doukas J, et al. (2009) 328(3):758-65).","Class I PI3Ks, particularly PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 isoforms, are also associated with cancers (reviewed, e.g., in Vogt, P K et al.

(2006) 25(50):6648-59; Billottet C, et al. (2009) 69(3):1027-36; Meadows, S A, 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Ikeda H, et al. (2010) 116(9):1460-8; Herman S E et al. (2010) 116(12):2078-88; Herman S E et al. (2011). 117(16):4323-7. In an embodiment, described herein is a method of treating hematological cancers including, but not limited to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).","A PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor (CAL-101) has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with haematological malignancies, and showed activity in CLL in patients with poor prognostic characteristics. In CLL, inhibition of PI3K-\u03b4 not only affects tumor cells directly, but it also affects the ability of the tumor cells to interact with their microenvironment. This microenvironment includes contact with and factors from stromal cells, T-cells, nurse like cells, as well as other tumor cells. CAL-101 suppresses the expression of stromal and T-cell derived factors including CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13, as well as the CLL tumor cells' ability to respond to these factors. CAL-101 treatment in CLL patients induces rapid lymph node reduction and redistribution of lymphocytes into the circulation, and affects tonic survival signals through the BCR, leading to reduced cell viability, and an increase in apoptosis. Single agent CAL-101 treatment was also active in mantle cell lymphoma and refractory non Hodgkin's lymphoma (Furman, R R, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Hoellenriegel, J, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Webb, H K, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Meadows, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Kahl, B, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Lannutti B J, et al. (2011) 117(2):591-4).","PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors have shown activity against PI3K-\u03b4 positive gliomas in vitro (Kashishian A, et al. Poster presented at: The American Association of Cancer Research 102Annual Meeting; 2011 Apr. 2-6; Orlando, Fla.). PI3K-\u03b4 is the PI3K isoform that is most commonly activated in tumors where the PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated (Ward S, et al. (2003) 10(3):207-13). In this subset of tumors, treatment with the PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor either alone or in combination with a cytotoxic agent can be effective.","Another mechanism for PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors to have an affect in solid tumors involves the tumor cells' interaction with their micro-environment. PI3K-\u03b4, PI3K-\u03b3, and PI3K-\u03b2 are expressed in the immune cells that infiltrate tumors, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors can modify the function of these tumor-associated immune cells and how they respond to signals from the stroma, the tumor, and each other, and in this way affect tumor cells and metastasis (Hoellenriegel, J, et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.).","PI3K-\u03b4 is also expressed in endothelial cells. It has been shown that tumors in mice treated with PI3K-\u03b4 selective inhibitors are killed more readily by radiation therapy. In this same study, capillary network formation is impaired by the PI3K inhibitor, and it is postulated that this defect contributes to the greater killing with radiation. PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors can affect the way in which tumors interact with their microenviroment, including stromal cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells and be therapeutic either on its own or in conjunction with another therapy (Meadows, S A, et al. Paper presented at: 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Geng L, et al. (2004) 64(14):4893-9).","In other embodiments, inhibition of PI3K (such as PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3) can be used to treat a neuropsychiatric disorder, e.g., an autoimmune brain disorder. Infectious and immune factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to, Sydenham's chorea (SC) (Garvey, M. A. et al. (2005) 20:424-429), Tourette's syndrome (TS), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (Asbahr, F. R. et al. (1998) 155:1122-1124), attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (AD\/HD) (Hirschtritt, M. E. et al. (2008) 1:1-16; Peterson, B. S. et al. (2000) 57:364-372), anorexia nervosa (Sokol, M. S. (2000) 10:133-145; Sokol, M. S. et al. (2002) 159:1430-1432), depression (Leslie, D. L. et al. (2008) 47:1166-1172), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Hollander, E. et al. (1999) 156:317-320; Margutti, P. et al. (2006) 3:149-157). A subset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorders and tic disorders has been grouped as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococci (PANDAS). PANDAS disorders provide an example of disorders where the onset and exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms is preceded by a streptococcal infection (Kurlan, R., Kaplan, E. L. (2004) 113:883-886; Garvey, M. A. et al. (1998) 13:413-423). Many of the PANDAS disorders share a common mechanism of action resulting from antibody responses against streptococcal associated epitopes, such as GlcNAc, which produces neurological effects (Kirvan. C. A. et al. (2006) 179:173-179). Autoantibodies recognizing central nervous system (CNS) epitopes are also found in sera of most PANDAS subjects (Yaddanapudi, K. et al. (2010) 15:712-726). Thus, several neuropsychiatric disorders have been associated with immune and autoimmune components, making them suitable for therapies that include PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 inhibition.","In certain embodiments, a method of treating (e.g., reducing or ameliorating one or more symptoms of) a neuropsychiatric disorder, (e.g., an autoimmune brain disorder), using a PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 inhibitor is described, alone or in combination therapy. For example, one or more PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 inhibitors described herein can be used alone or in combination with any suitable therapeutic agent and\/or modalities, e.g., dietary supplement, for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Exemplary neuropsychiatric disorders that can be treated with the PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 inhibitors described herein include, but are not limited to, PANDAS disorders, Sydenham's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, anorexia nervosa, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is an exemplary class of autism spectrum disorders that includes Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), Rett's Disorder and PDD\u2014Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) Animal models for evaluating the activity of the PI3K-\u03b4 and\/or -\u03b3 inhibitor are known in the art. For example, a mouse model of PANDAS disorders is described in, e.g., Yaddanapudi, K. et al. (2010) supra; and Hoffman, K. I. et al. (2004) 24:1780-1791.","In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of using the compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, isomers, prodrugs, and isotopically labeled derivatives) thereof, or pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein to treat disease conditions, including, but not limited to, diseases associated with malfunctioning of one or more types of PI3 kinase.

Scleroderma is a group of diseases that involve hardening and tightening of the skin and\/or other connective tissues. Scleroderma may be localized (e.g., affecting only the skin) or systemic (e.g., affecting other systems such as, e.g., blood vessels and\/or internal organs). Common symptoms of scleroderma include Raynaud's phenomenon, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and skin changes (e.g., swollen fingers and hands, or thickened patches of skin). In some embodiments, the scleroderma is localized, e.g., morphea or linear scleroderma. In some embodiments, the condition is a systemic sclerosis, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis, diffuse systemic sclerosis, or systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.","Localized scleroderma (localized cutaneous fibrosis) includes morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea is typically characterized by oval-shaped thickened patches of skin that are white in the middle, with a purple border. Linear scleroderma is more common in children. Symptoms of linear scleroderma may appear mostly on one side of the body. In linear scleroderma, bands or streaks of hardened skin may develop on one or both arms or legs or on the forehead. En coup de sabre (frontal linear scleroderma or morphea en coup de sabre) is a type of localized scleroderma typically characterized by linear lesions of the scalp or face.","Systemic scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) includes, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis (also known as limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome), diffuse systemic sclerosis (also known as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis), and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma. CREST stands for the following complications that may accompany limited scleroderma: calcinosis (e.g., of the digits), Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyl), and telangiectasias. Typically, limited scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands, arms, and face. Limited and diffuse subtypes are distinguished based on the extent of skin involvement, with sparing of the proximal limbs and trunk in limited disease. See, e.g., Denton, C. P. et al. (2006), 2(3):134-143. The limited subtype also typically involves a long previous history of Raynaud's phenomenon, whereas in the diffuse subtype, onset of Raynaud's phenomenon can be simultaneous with other manifestations or might occur later. Both limited and diffuse subtypes may involve internal organs. Typical visceral manifestations of limited systemic sclerosis include isolated pulmonary hypertension, severe bowel involvement, and pulmonary fibrosis. Typical visceral manifestations of diffuse systemic sclerosis include renal crisis, lung fibrosis, and cardiac disease. Diffuse systemic sclerosis typically progresses rapidly and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs (e.g., kidneys, esophagus, heart, or lungs). Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a rare disorder in which patients develop vascular and fibrotic damage to internal organs in the absence of cutaneous sclerosis.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating, preventing and\/or managing inflammatory myopathies.

kit (cat No. 33-016) purchased from Millipore Corporation was used to screen compounds provided herein. This assay used specific, high affinity binding of the GRP1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to PIP3, the product of a Class 1A or 1B PI3 Kinase acting on its physiological substrate PIP2. During the detection phase of the assay, a complex was generated between the GST-tagged PH domain and biotinylated short chain PIP3. The biotinylated PIP3 and the GST-tagged PH domain recruited fluorophores (Streptavidin-Allophycocyanin and Europium-labeled anti-GST respectively) to form the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) architecture, generating a stable time-resolved FRET signal. The FRET complex was disrupted in a competitive manner by non-biotinylated PIP3, a product formed in the PI3 Kinase assay.","PI3 Kinase \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 activity was assayed using the PI3 Kinase HTRF\u00ae assay kit (catalogue No. 33-016) purchased from Millipore Corporation. Purified recombinant PI3K\u03b1 (catalogue No. 14-602-K), PI3K\u03b2 (catalogue No. 14-603-K), PI3K\u03b3 (catalogue No. 14-558-K) and PI3K\u03b4 (catalogue No. 14-604-K) were obtained from Millipore Corporation. Purified recombinant PI3K enzyme was used to catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2 at 10 \u03bcM) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the presence of 10 \u03bcM ATP. The assay was carried out in 384-well format and detected using a Perkin Elmer EnVision Xcite Multilabel Reader. Emission ratios were converted into percent inhibitions and imported into GraphPad Prism software. The concentration necessary to achieve inhibition of enzyme activity by 50% (IC) was calculated using concentrations ranging from 20 \u03bcM to 0.1 nM (12-point curve). ICvalues were determined using a nonlinear regression model available in GraphPad Prism 5.","The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 \u03bcM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 \u03bcL, containing 5 \u03bcM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 \u03bcL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C.; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 \u03bcL of the incubation mixture to 100 \u03bcL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis by HPLC-MS\/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 \u03bcM) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS\/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2\u00d720 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS\/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics.","Class I PI3-Ks can be either purchased (p110\u03b1\/p85\u03b1, p110\u03b2\/p85\u03b1, p110\u03b4\/p85\u03b1 from Upstate, and p110\u03b3 from Sigma) or expressed as previously described (Knight et al., 2004). ICvalues are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 \u03bcg\/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 \u03bcCi of \u03b3-32P-ATP to a final concentration of 10 or 100 \u03bcM and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 \u03bcl 1N HCl followed by 160 \u03bcl CHCl:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3-4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1 M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10-12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 \u03bcM). For compounds showing significant activity, ICdeterminations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.","Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are available. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and\/or agonists of PI3-Ks including, but not limited to, PI 3-Kinase \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03b3. An exemplary system is PI 3-Kinase (human) HTRF\u2122 Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtiter plate (e.g., a 384 well microtiter plate). The total reaction volume is approximately 20 \u03bcl per well. In the first step, each well receives 2 \u03bcl of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, approximately 14.5 \u03bcl of a kinase\/PIP2 mixture (diluted in 1\u00d7 reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25-0.3 \u03bcg\/ml kinase and 10 \u03bcM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5 \u03bcl of ATP (diluted in 1\u00d7 reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 \u03bcl of Stop Solution per well and then 5 \u03bcl of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and ICs are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.","The ability of one or more subject compounds to inhibit B cell activation and proliferation is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. For example, an in vitro cellular proliferation assay is established that measures the metabolic activity of live cells.

For example, stability of one or more subject compounds is established by an in vitro assay. For example, an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more subject compounds when reacting with mouse, rat or human microsomes from liver. The microsome reaction with compounds is performed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Each tube contains 0.1 \u03bcL of 10.0 mg\/ml NADPH; 75 mL of 20.0 mg\/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 \u03bcL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 425 mL of ddHO, Negative control (without NADPH) tube contains 75 \u03bcL of 20.0 mg\/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 \u03bcL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 525 \u03bcL of ddHO. The reaction is started by adding 1.0 \u03bcL of 10.0 mM tested compound. The reaction tubes are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. 100 \u03bcL sample is collected into new Eppendorf tube containing 300 mL cold methanol at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes of reaction. Samples are centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography\/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).","The stability of one or more subject compounds in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., 10: 1019-1026. The following procedure is an HPLC-MS\/MS assay using human plasma; other species including monkey, dog, rat, and mouse are also available. Frozen, heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. prior to use. A subject compound is added from a 400 \u03bcM stock solution to an aliquot of pre-warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 mL (or 800 mL for half-life determination), containing 5 \u03bcM test compound and 0.5% DMSO.

(2007) 434:131-54). This method is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent distinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of one or more compounds provided herein, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins Inhibitors provided herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt-S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested.","Similarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g., 0.1% DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab\u20322 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g., with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphorylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells are then analyzed by flow cytometry.","Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR-Abl retrovirus (herein referred to as p190 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope.","Alternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph\u2212) patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse.

About 1 hr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about 1\u00d710leukemic cells (e.g., Ph+ human or murine cells, or p190 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5\u00d710normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post-transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.","Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labeled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry.

Fc\u03b3RIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of Fc\u03b3RIIb (S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 200012:277-285).","The R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RAD001 (available from LC Laboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally.

Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E at the end of the study, or survival can be an endpoint. For example, the proteozome inhibitor Bortezimib is effective at blocking disease in the NZB\/W model in both the profilactic and therapeutic model with reductions in auto-antibody production, kidney damage, and improvements in survival (14, 748-755 (2008)).","Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR\/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months.

Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints.","This established art model can be employed to demonstrate that the kinase inhibitors provided herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.","Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a \u03b3 ray source. About 1 hr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1\u00d7106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures (e.g., as described in 2005 August; 161(1):51-6). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5\u00d710normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and\/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g., imatinib at about 70 mg\/kg twice daily). For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt-T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-1. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, \u201cphosflow\u201d is used to detect p Akt-S473 and pS6-S235\/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively.","Samples of peripheral blood (100-200 \u03bcl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations, and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers (eGFP or hCD4) and signaling biomarkers as described herein.","This general assay known in the art can be used to demonstrate that effective therapeutic doses of the compounds provided herein can be used for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells.","Matrigel containing test compounds are injected subcutaneously or intraocularly, where it solidifies to form a plug. The plug is recovered after 7-21 days in the animal and examined histologically to determine the extent to which blood vessels have entered it. Angiogenesis is measured by quantification of the vessels in histologic sections. Alternatively, fluorescence measurement of plasma volume is performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran 150. The results are expected to indicate one or more compounds provided herein that inhibit angiogenesis and are thus expected to be useful in treating ocular disorders related to aberrant angiogenesis and\/or vascular permeability.","A pocket is made in the cornea, and a plug containing an angiogenesis inducing formulation (e.g., VEGF, FGF, or tumor cells), when introduced into this pocket, elicits the ingrowth of new vessels from the peripheral limbal vasculature. Slow-release materials such as ELVAX (ethylene vinyl copolymer) or Hydron are used to introduce angiogenesis inducing substances into the corneal pocket. Alternatively, a sponge material is used.","The effect of putative inhibitors on the locally induced (e.g., sponge implant) angiogenic reaction in the cornea (e.g., by FGF, VEGF, or tumor cells). The test compound is administered orally, systemically, or directly to the eye. Systemic administration is by bolus injection or, more effectively, by use of a sustained-release method such as implantation of osmotic pumps loaded with the test inhibitor. Administration to the eye is by any of the methods described herein including, but not limited to eye drops, topical administration of a cream, emulsion, or gel, intravitreal injection.","The vascular response is monitored by direct observation throughout the course of the experiment using a stereomicroscope in mice. Definitive visualization of the corneal vasculature is achieved by administration of fluorochrome-labeled high-molecular weight dextran. Quantification is performed by measuring the area of vessel penetration, the progress of vessels toward the angiogenic stimulus over time, or in the case of fluorescence, histogram analysis or pixel counts above a specific (background) threshold.","The results can indicate one or more compounds provided herein inhibit angiogenesis and thus can be useful in treating ocular disorders related to aberrant angiogenesis and\/or vascular permeability.","The assay plate is prepared by placing a collagen plug in the bottom of each well with 5-10 cell spheroids per collagen plug each spheroid containing 400-500 cells. Each collagen plug is covered with 1100 \u03bcl of storage medium per well and stored for future use (1-3 days at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO). The plate is sealed with sealing. Test compounds are dissolved in 200 \u03bcl assay medium with at least one well including a VEGF positive control and at least one well without VEGF or test compound as a negative control. The assay plate is removed from the incubator and storage medium is carefully pipeted away. Assay medium containing the test compounds are pipeted onto the collagen plug. The plug is placed in a humidified incubator for (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO) 24-48 hours. Angiogenesis is quantified by counting the number of sprouts, measuring average sprout length, or determining cumulative sprout length. The assay can be preserved for later analysis by removing the assay medium, adding 1 ml of 10% paraformaldehyde in Hanks BSS per well, and storing at 4\u00b0 C. The results are expected to identify compounds that inhibit angiogenesis in various cell types tested, including cells of ocular origin.","The compounds as provided herein can present synergistic or additive efficacy when administered in combination with agents that inhibit IgE production or activity. Agents that inhibit IgE production include, for example, one or more of TEI-9874, 2-(4-(6-cyclohexyloxy-2-naphtyloxy)phenylacetamide)benzoic acid, rapamycin, rapamycin analogs (i.e., rapalogs), TORC1 inhibitors, TORC2 inhibitors, and any other compounds that inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. Agents that inhibit IgE activity include, for example, anti-IgE antibodies such as Omalizumab and TNX-901.","One or more of the subject compounds capable of inhibiting PI3K-\u03b4 can be efficacious in treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AIID), for example, rheumatoid arthritis. If any of the compounds causes an undesired level of IgE production, one can choose to administer it in combination with an agent that inhibits IgE production or IgE activity. Additionally, the administration of PI3K-\u03b4 or PI3K-\u03b4\/\u03b3 inhibitors as provided herein in combination with inhibitors of mTOR can also exhibit synergy through enhanced inhibition of the PI3K pathway. Various in vivo and in vitro models can be used to establish the effect of such combination treatment on AIID including, but not limited to (a) in vitro B-cell antibody production assay, (b) in vivo TNP assay, and (c) rodent collagen induced arthritis model.","(a) B-cell Assay","Mice are euthanized, and the spleens are removed and dispersed through a nylon mesh to generate a single-cell suspension. The splenocytes are washed (following removal of erythrocytes by osmotic shock) and incubated with anti-CD43 and anti-Mac-1 antibody-conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The bead-bound cells are separated from unbound cells using a magnetic cell sorter. The magnetized column retains the unwanted cells and the resting B cells are collected in the flow-through. Purified B-cells are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or an anti-CD40 antibody and interleukin 4 Stimulated B-cells are treated with vehicle alone or with PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors as provided herein with and without mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, rapalogs, or mTORC1\/C2 inhibitors. The results are expected to show that in the presence of mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin) alone, there is little to no substantial effect on IgG and IgE response. However, in the presence of PI3K-\u03b4 and mTOR inhibitors, the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgG response as compared to the B-cells treated with vehicle alone, and the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgE response as compared to the response from B-cells treated with PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitors alone.","(b) TNP Assay","Mice are immunized with TNP-Ficoll or TNP-KHL and treated with: vehicle, a PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor, an mTOR inhibitor, for example rapamycin, or a PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor such as rapamycin. Antigen-specific serum IgE is measured by ELISA using TNP-BSA coated plates and isotype specific labeled antibodies. It is expected that mice treated with an mTOR inhibitor alone exhibit little or no substantial effect on antigen specific IgG3 response and no statistically significant elevation in IgE response as compared to the vehicle control. It is also expected that mice treated with both PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a reduction in antigen specific IgG3 response as compared to the mice treated with vehicle alone. Additionally, the mice treated with both PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a decrease in IgE response as compared to the mice treated with PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor alone.","(c) Rat Collagen Induced Arthritis Model","Female Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on day 0. On day 6, animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints are performed on day 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurs and rats are randomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is good evidence of bilateral disease.","After an animal is selected for enrollment in the study, treatment is initiated. Animals are given vehicle, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor, or PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor in combination with rapamycin. Dosing is administered on days 1-6. Rats are weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on day 7 and animals are euthanized.","The combination treatment using a compound as provided herein and rapamycin can provide greater efficacy than treatment with PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor alone.","Certain compounds provided herein (e.g., Compounds 5, 49, and 359) were tested in the rat Collagen Induced Arthritis Model using procedures substantially similar to those described above, and all of the tested compounds demonstrated ECvalues of less than 50 mg\/kg.","DTH was induced by sensitizing 60 BALB\/c male mice on day 0 and day 1 with a solution of 0.05% 2,4 dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) in a 4:1 acetone\/olive oil mixture. Mice were gently restrained while 20 \u03bcL of solution was applied to the hind foot pads of each mouse. The hind foot pads of the mice were used as they represent an anatomical site that can be easily isolated and immobilized without anesthesia. On day 5, mice were administered a single dose of vehicle, a compound provided herein at 10, 3, 1, or 0.3 mg\/kg, or dexamethasone at a dose of 5 mg\/kg by oral gavage. Thirty minutes later mice were anaesthetized, and a solution of 0.25% DNFB in a 4:1 acetone\/olive oil solution was applied to the left inner and outer ear surface. This application resulted in the induction of swelling to the left ear and under these conditions, all animals responded to this treatment with ear swelling. A vehicle control solution of 4:1 acetone\/olive oil was applied to the right inner and outer ear. Twenty four hours later, mice were anaesthetized, and measurements of the left and right ear were taken using a digital micrometer. The difference between the two ears was recorded as the amount of swelling induced by the challenge of DNFB. Drug treatment groups were compared to vehicle control to generate the percent reduction in ear swelling. Dexamethasone is routinely used as a positive control as it has broad anti-inflammatory activity.","(a) Systemic Arthritis Model","All injections are performed under anesthesia. 60 female Lewis rats (150-170) are anesthetized by inhalation isoflurane using a small animal anesthesia machine. The animals are placed in the induction chamber until anesthetized by delivery of 4-5% isoflurane in Oand then held in that state using a nose cone on the procedure table. Maintenance level of isoflurane is at 1-2%. Animals are injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single injection of purified PG-PS 10S Group A, D58 strain (concentration 25 \u03bcg\/g of bodyweight) suspended in sterile 0.85% saline. Each animal receives a total volume of 500 microliters administered in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 23 gauge needle. Placement of the needle is critical to avoid injecting the PG-PS 10S into either the stomach or caecum. Animals are under continuous observation until fully recovered from anesthesia and moving about the cage. An acute response of a sharp increase in ankle measurement, typically 20% above baseline measurement can peak in 3-5 days post injection. Treatment with test compounds can be PO, SC, IV or IP. Rats are dosed no more than two times in a 24 hour time span. Treatment can begin on day 0 or any day after that through day 30. The animals are weighed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and beginning again on day 12-30 or until the study is terminated. Paw\/ankle diameter is measured with a digital caliper on the left and right side on day 0 prior to injection and again on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. On day 12, measurements begin again and continue on through day 30. At this time, animals can be anesthetized with isoflurane, as described above, and terminal blood samples can be obtained by tail vein draws for the evaluation of the compound blood levels, clinical chemistry or hematology parameters. Animals are them euthanized with carbon dioxide overdose. A thoracotomy can be conducted as a means of death verification.","(b) Monoarticular Arthritis Model","All injections are performed under anesthesia. 60 female Lewis rats (150-170) are anesthetized by inhalation isoflurane using a small animal anesthesia machine. The animals are placed in the induction chamber until anesthetized by delivery of 4-5% isoflurane in Oand then held in that state using a nose cone on the procedure table. Maintenance level of isoflurane is at 1-2%. Animals are injected intra-articular (i.a.) with a single injection of purified PG-PS 100P Group A, D58 strain (concentration 500 ug\/mL) suspended in sterile 0.85% saline. Each rat receives a total volume of 10 microliters administered into the tibiotalar joint space using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 27 gauge needle. Animals are under continuous observation until fully recovered from anesthesia and moving about the cage. Animals that respond 2-3 days later with a sharp increase in ankle measurement, typically 20% above baseline measurement on the initial i.a. injection, are included in the study. On day 14, all responders are anesthetized again using the procedure previously described. Animals receive an intravenous (I.V.) injection of PG-PS (concentration 250 uL\/mL). Each rat receives a total volume of 400 microliters administered slowly into the lateral tail vein using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 27 gauge needle. Baseline ankle measurements are measured prior to IV injection and continue through the course of inflammation or out to day 10. Treatment with test compounds will be PO, SC, IV or IP. Rats are dosed no more than two times in a 24 hour time span. Treatment can begin on day 0 or any day after that through day 24. The animals are weighed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and beginning again on day 14-24 or until the study is terminated. Paw\/ankle diameter is measured with a digital caliper on the left and right side on day 0 prior to injection and again on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and beginning again on day 14-24 or until the study is terminated. At this time, animals can be anesthetized with isoflurane, as described above, and terminal blood samples can be obtained by tail vein draws for the evaluation of the compound blood levels, clinical chemistry or hematology parameters.

A thoracotomy can be conducted as a means of death verification.","Efficacy of a compound provided herein in treating, preventing and\/or managing asthma can be assessed using an conventional animal models including various mice models described in, for example, Nials et al., 1(4-5): 213-220 (2008).","(a) Acute Allergen Challenge Models","Several models are known in the art and any of such models can be used. Although various allergens can be used to induce asthma-like conditions, the principle is consistent throughout the methods. Briefly, asthma-like conditions are induced through multiple systemic administration of the allergen (e.g., ova, house dust mite extracts and cockroach extracts) in the presence of an adjuvant such as aluminum hydroxide. Alternatively, an adjuvant-free system can be used, but it usually requires a higher number of exposures to achieve suitable sensitization. Once induced, animals exhibit many key features of clinical asthma such as: elevated levels of IgE; airway inflammation; goblet cell hyperplasia; epithelial hypertrophy; AHR ro specific stimuli; and early and late phase bronchoconstriction. Potential efficacy of a compound thus can be assessed by determining whether one or more of these clinical features are reversed or mitigated.","(b) Chronic Allergen Challenge Models","Chronic allergen challenge models aim to reproduce more of the features of the clinical asthma, such as airway remodeling and persistent AHR, than acute challenge models. While allergens similar to those used in acute allergen challenge models can be used, in chronic allergen challenge models, animals are subjected to repeated exposure of the airways to low levels of allergen for a period of up to 12 weeks. Once induced, animals exhibit key features of human asthma such as: allergen-dependent sensitization; a Th2-dependent allergic inflammation characterized by eosinophillic influx into the airway mucosa; AHR; and airway remodeling as evidenced by goblet cell hyperplasia, epithelial hypertrophy, subepithelial or peribronchiolar fibrosis. Potential efficacy of a compound thus can be assessed by determining whether one or more of these clinical features are reversed or mitigated.","Efficacy of a compound provided herein in treating, preventing and\/or managing psoriasis can be assessed using an conventional animal models including various animal models described in, for example, Boehncke et al., 25: 596-605 (2007).","As an example, the mouse model based on adoptive transfer of CD4CD45RBT cells described in Hong et al., 162: 7480-7491 (1999) can be made. Briefly, female BALB\/cBY (donor) and C.B.-17\/Prkdc scid\/scid (recipient) mice are housed in a specific pathogen-free environment and are used between 6 and 8 weeks of age. CD4 T cells are enriched from BALB\/cBy splenocytes using a mouse CD4 enrichment kit. The cells are then labeled with PE-conjugated anti-CD4, FITC-conjugated anti-CD45RB, and APC-conjugated anti-CD25 antibodies. Cells are sorted using a cell sorter. CD4CD45RBCD25 cells are collected. Cells are resuspended in saline and 4\u00d710cells\/mouse are injected i.p. into C.B.-17\/Prkdc scid\/scid mice. Mice may be dosed with LPS, cytokines, or antibodies as necessary. Mice are monitored for external signs of skin lesions twice each week. After the termination, ear, back skin, lymph nodes and spleen may be collected for further ex vivo studies.","A compound's efficacy in treating scleroderma can be tested using animal models. An exemplary animal model is a mouse model for scleroderma induced by repeated local injections of bleomycin (\u201cBLM\u201d) described, for example, in Yamamoto et al., 112: 456-462 (1999), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. This mouse model provides dermal sclerosis that closely resembles systemic sclerosis both histologically and biochemically. The sclerotic changes observed in the model include, but are not limited to: thickened and homogenous collagen bundles and cellular filtrates; gradual increase in number of mast cells; degranulation of mast cells; elevated histamine release; increase in hydroxyproline in skin; presence of anti-nuclear antibody in serum; and strong expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2-2 mRNA. Therefore, efficacy of a compound in treating scleroderma can be assessed by monitoring the lessening of one or more of these changes.","Briefly, the following exemplary procedures can be used to generate the mouse model for scleroderma: Specific pathogen-free, female BALB\/C mice and C3H mice of 6 weeks old, weighing about 20 g, are purchased and maintained with food and water ad libitum. BLM is dissolved in PBS at differing concentrations and sterilized with filtration. Aliquots of each concentration of BLM or PBS are injected subcutaneously into the shaved back of the mice daily for 1-4 weeks with a needle. Alternatively, mice are injected every other day.","Histolopathological and biochemical changes induced can be assessed using any methods commonly practiced in the field. For example, histopathological changes can be assessed using a standard avidine-biotin peroxidase technique with anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody, anti-Lyt2 monoclonal antibody, anti-mouse pan-tissue-fixed macrophage antibody, anti-stem cell factor monoclonal antibody, anti-transforming growth factor-\u03b2 polyclonal antibody, and anti-decorin antibody. Cytokine expression of cellular infiltrates can be assessed by using several anti-cytokine antibodies. Hydroxyproline level can be assessed by hydrolyzing skin pieces with hydrochloric acid, neutralizing with sodium hydroxide, and colorimetrically assessing the hydrolates at 560 nm with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. Pepsin-resistant collagen can be assessed by treating collagen sample extracted from biopsied tissues and analyzing by polyacrylamide stacking gel electrophoresis. Mast cells can be identified by toluidine blue, and cells containing matachromatic granules can be counted under high magnification of a light microscope. Serum levels of various cytokines can be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA levels of the cytokines can be assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autoantibodies in serum can be detected using 3T3 fibroblasts as the substrate for the screening.","A compound's efficacy in treating myositis (e.g., dermatomyositis) can be tested using animal models known in the art. One such example is the familial canine dermatomyositis model described in Hargis et al., 120(2): 323-325 (1985). Another example is the rabbit myosin induced mouse model described in Phyanagi et al., & 60(10): 3118-3127 (2009).","Briefly, 5-week old male SJL\/J mice are used. Purified myosin from rabbit skeletal muscle (6.6 mg\/ml) is emulsified with an equal amount of Freund's complete adjuvant and 3.3 mg\/ml . The mice are immunized repeatedly with emulsified rabbit myosin. Once myositis is induced, inflammatory cell filtration and necrotic muscle fiber should be evident in the model. In the muscles of animals, CD4 T cells are mainly located in the perimysum and CD8 T cells are mainly located in the endomysium and surround non-necrotic muscle fibers. TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and perforin are up-regulated and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 is increased in the muscles.","To assess the efficacy of a compound, following administration of the compound through adequate route at specified dose, the mice are killed and muscle tissues are harvested. The muscle tissue is immediately frozen in chilled isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen, and then cryostat sections are prepared. The sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin for counting of number of infiltrated cells. Three sections from each mouse are prepared and photomicrographs are obtained. For immunohistochemical tests, cryostat sections of muscle are dried and fixed in cold acetone at \u221220\u00b0 C. The slides are rehydrated in PBS, and then endogeneous peroxide activity is blocked by incubation in 1% hydrogen peroxide. The sections are incubated overnight with rat anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody, rat anti-mouse CD8 monoclonal antibody, rat anti-mouse F4\/80 monoclonal antibody or normal rat IgG in antibody diluent. The samples are washed with PBS and incubated with biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG pretreated with 5% normal mouse serum. After washing with PBS, the samples are incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. After washing PBS, diaminobenzidine is used for visualization.","A compound's efficacy in treating Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be tested using animal models known in the art, for example, those described in Chiorini et al., 33: 190-196 (2009). Examples include: mouse model spontaneously developed in first filial generation of NZB mice crossed to NZW mice (see, e.g., Jonsson et al., 42: 93-101 (1987); mouse model induced by i.p. injection of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (id.; Deshmukh et al., 38: 42-27 (2009)); NOD mouse models wherein Sj\u00f6gren's phenotype is developed by specific genotypes (see, e.g., Cha et al., 46: 1390-1398 (2002); Kong et al., 16: 675-681 (1998); Podolin et al., J Exp Med 178: 793-803 (1993); and Rasooly et al., 81: 287-292 (1996)); mouse model developed in spontaneous lpr mutation; mouse model developed in Id3 knock-out mice (see, e.g., Li et al., 21: 551-560 (2004)); mouse model developed in PI3K knock-out mice (see, e.g., Oak et al., 103: 16882-16887 (2006)); mouse model developed in BAFF over-expressing transgenic mice (see, e.g., Groom et al., 109: 59-68 (2002)); mouse model induced by injection of Ro antigen into BALB\/c mice (see, e.g., Oh-Hora et al., 9: 432-443 (2008)); mouse model induced by injection of carbonic anhydrase II (see, e.g., Nishimori et al., 154: 4865-4873 (1995); mouse model developed in IL-14 over-expressing transgenic mice (see, e.g., Shen et al., 177: 5676-5686 (2006)); and mouse model developed in IL-12 expressing transgenic mice (see, e.g., McGrath-Morrow et al., 291: L837-846 (2006)).","The Arthus reaction is a type 3 immune response to immune complexes, and thus, can be a mechanistic model supporting therapeutic hypothesis for immune complex mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune diseases. For example, PI3K\u03b3 and \u03b4 deficient mice can be used as experimental models of the Arthus reaction and provide assessment of therapeutic potential of a compound as to the treatment of immune complex mediated diseases. The Arthus reaction can be induced using the following exemplary procedures as described in Konrad et al., (2008 283(48): 33296-33303.","PI3K\u03b3- and PI3K\u03b4-deficient mice are maintained under dry barrier conditions. Mice are anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, and the trachea is cannulated. Appropriate amount of protein G-purified anti-OVA IgG Ab is applied, and appropriate amount of OVA antigen is given intravenously. For PI3K blocking experiments, wortmanin is given intratracheally together with the application of anti-OVA IgG. Mice are killed at 2-4 hours after initiation of inflammation, and desired follow up assessments can be performed using methods known in the art.","(a) PI3K\u03b4 Selective Assay","A compound's ability in selectively inhibiting PI3K\u03b4 can be assessed using RAJI cells, i.e., B lymphocyte cells derived from lymphoma patients. Briefly, serum-starved RAJI cells are stimulated with anti-human IgM, thereby causing signaling through the B-cell receptors, as described in, for example, He et al., Leukemia Research (2009) 33: 798-802. B-cell receptor signaling is important for the activation, differentiation, and survival of B cells and certain B-cell derived cancers. Reduction of phospho-AKT is indicative of compounds that may inhibit B-cell proliferation and function in certain diseases. By monitoring the reduction of phospho-AKT in stimulated RAJI cells (using for example, phospho-AKT antibodies), a compound's potential efficacy in selectively inhibiting PI3K\u03b4 can be assessed.","Certain compounds provided herein (e.g., Compounds 5, 49, 104, 138, 157, 191, 241, 242, 270, 273, 279, 285, 288, 291, 312, 316, 326, 327, 328, 329, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 353, 354, 356, 359, 378, 379, 382, 383, 387, 389, 391, 393, 394, 396, 397, 399, 401, 402, 403, 408, 410, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 422, 424, 425, and 428) were tested in RAJI cell model using procedures as described above. It was found that ICvalues for phospho-AKT are as follows: Compounds 5, 49, 104, 138, 157, 191, 241, 242, 270, 273, 279, 285, 288, 291, 312, 316, 326, 327, 328, 329, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 353, 354, 356, 359, 378, 379, 382, 383, 387, 389, 391, 393, 394, 396, 397, 399, 401, 402, 403, 408, 410, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 422, 424, 425, and 428 in the range of less than 100 nM.","(b) PI3K\u03b3 Selective Assay","A compound's ability in selectively inhibiting PI3K\u03b3 can be assessed using RAW264.7 macrophages. Briefly, serum-starved PAW264.7 cells are stimulated with a known GPCR agonist C5a. (See, e.g., Camps et al., (2005) 11(9): 936-943). Cells can be treated with test compounds prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to the stimulation by C5a. RAW 264.7 cells respond to the complement component fragment C5a through activation of the C5a receptor, and the C5a receptor activates macrophages and induces cell migration. Test compounds' ability to inhibit C5a-mediated AKT phosphorylation is indicative of selective inhibition of PI3Ky. Thus, by monitoring the reduction of phospho-AKT in stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (using for example, phospho-AKT antibodies), a compound's potential efficacy in selectively inhibiting PI3K\u03b3 can be assessed.","Certain compounds provided herein (e.g., Compounds 5, 49, 104, 127, 138, 157, 191, 241, 242, 270, 273, 276, 279, 285, 288, 291, 312, 316, 326, 327, 328, 329, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 353, 354, 356, 359, 378, 379, 382, 383, 387, 389, 391, 393, 394, 396, 397, 399, 401, 402, 403, 408, 410, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 422, 424, 425, and 428) were tested in RAW 264.7 cell model using procedures as described above.
