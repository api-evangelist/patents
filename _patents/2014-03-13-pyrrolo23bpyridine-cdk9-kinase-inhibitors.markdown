serine\/threonine protein kinases whose activity depends on binding and activation by cyclin partners. These heterodimeric complexes can phosphorylate various substrates involved in the control of transcription and cell-cycle progression in response to different stimuli. CDK8 and CDK9 have key roles in the control of transcription by RNA polymerase II. CDK9 responds specifically to several cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, indicating that it might have special roles in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes, especially immune responses, inflammation, cell activation, and differentiation.","Deregulated CDK activity is a hallmark of human cancer, and a variety of genetic and epigenetic events, such as over expression of cyclins, diminished levels of CDK inhibiting proteins or gain-of function mutations in CDK, have been described to cause increased activity of these enzymes and provide a selective growth advantage in tumor cells. CDK9 inhibition causes rapid depletion of short-lived mRNA transcripts and their associated protein products. Many genes encoding proteins involved in cell growth, proliferation, and tumor development (Myc, Cyclin D1, and Mcl-1) are characterized by short-lived mRNAs and proteins and hence the consequences of CDK9 inhibition include anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects through loss of function at many cellular pathways. Tumor types that are dependent on labile pro-survival proteins (e.g., Mcl-1), which includes multiple myeloma, CLL, breast, melanoma and pancreatic cancers as well as the MYC-driven tumors (multiple cancer types) would be susceptible to CDK9 inhibition. CDK9 inhibitors might also be effective in combination with standard of care in tumors in which NF-\u03baB is constitutively active and contributing to chemo resistance. This includes hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors (breast, colorectal, prostate, melanoma and pancreatic). Thus, CDK9 inhibition targets multiple cancer-relevant pathways by inhibition of a single protein and thereby renders CDK9 as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. (Nature Reviews Cancer: 2009, 9, 153-166).","CDK9 inhibitors can also find therapeutic application in cardiology and virology as many viruses depend on the infected host for transcription of their genome.

For example, piperidinyl can be piperidin-1-yl (N-attached) or piperidin-4-yl (C-attached).","The term \u201caryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic hydrocarbon radical. Furthermore, the term \u201caryl\u201d includes polycyclic aryl groups, such as bicyclic, e.g., naphthyl. Typical aryl groups include phenyl, and naphthyl. The term aryl also includes a \u201c9- to 12-membered bicyclic aryl,\u201d which is a ring structure formed by the fusion of a benzene ring to: (1) a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl (e.g., indanyl; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalenyl; 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-benzocycloheptenyl, etc.); (2) another benzene ring (e.g., naphthalenyl); wherein the fusion junctions are at adjacent carbons on the benzene ring; or (3) a heterocycloalkyl or heterocycloalkenyl (e.g., benzo[d][1,3]dioxolyl, isoindolinyl).","The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a monocyclic 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl or a bicyclic heteroaryl.","The term \u201c5-membered heteroaryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a 5-membered, monocyclic, aromatic ring radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of: 1 O; 1 S; 1 N; 2 N; 3 N; 4 N; 1 S and 1 N; 1 S and 2 N; 1 O and 1 N; and 1 O and 2 N.

Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with one or more non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with one or more non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by one, two or three non-hydrogen radicals. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","A prefix attached to a multi-component substituent only applies to the first component. To illustrate, the term \u201calkylcycloalkyl\u201d contains two components: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, the C-C-prefix on C-C-alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the C-C-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further, the prefix \u201chalo\u201d on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as \u201chalogen-substituted alkyloxyalkyl\u201d rather than \u201chaloalkyloxyalkyl.\u201d And finally, if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as \u201calkyloxyhaloalkyl.\u201d","The terms \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a disease and\/or its attendant symptoms.","The terms \u201cprevent,\u201d \u201cpreventing,\u201d and \u201cprevention\u201d refer to a method of preventing the onset of a disease and\/or its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring a disease. As used herein, \u201cprevent,\u201d \u201cpreventing,\u201d and \u201cprevention\u201d also include delaying the onset of a disease and\/or its attendant symptoms and reducing a subject's risk of acquiring a disease.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to that amount of the compound being administered sufficient to prevent development of or alleviate to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated.","The term \u201ccomposition\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.

Compounds of this invention may contain carbon-carbon double bonds or carbon-nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration, wherein the term \u201cE\u201d represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen double bond and the term \u201cZ\u201d represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of \u201cE\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d isomers.

Chem. (1976) 45, 13-10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount, preferably an excess of about 85%-90%, more preferably an excess of about 95%-99%, and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99%. Accordingly, this invention includes racemic mixtures, relative and absolute stereoisomers, and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.","Isotope Enriched or Labeled Compounds","Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope-labeled or -enriched form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non-radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine include, but are not limited to, H, H, C, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and\/or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.","In another embodiment, the isotope-labeled compounds contain deuterium (H), tritium (H) or C isotopes. Isotope-labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope-labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope-labeled reagent for a non-labeled reagent. In some instances, compounds may be treated with isotope-labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope, for example, hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO\/DO. In addition to the above, relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance, in Lizondo, J et al., 21(11), 1116 (1996); Brickner, S J et al., 39(3), 673 (1996); Mallesham, B et al., 5(7), 963 (2003); PCT publications WO1997010223, WO2005099353, WO1995007271, WO2006008754; U.S. Pat.

Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. 64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., J. 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., 77, 79-88 (1999).","In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called \u201cheavy drugs,\u201d can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to CDK9 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic N et al. in \u201cDosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy\u201d, Zamenhof R, Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp. 125-134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).","Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.","Compounds","Suitable groups for R, R, R, and R, in compounds of Formula (I); R, R, R, X, X, X, X, and Xin compounds of Formula (III) and Formula (IIIa); R, R, R, R, and Rin compounds of Formula (IVa); and R, R, R, and Rin compounds of Formula (Va); are independently selected.

M. Berge et al. J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66: 1-19.","Compounds of formula (I) may contain either a basic or an acidic functionality, or both, and can be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, when desired, by using a suitable acid or base. The salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention.","Examples of acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, malate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as, but not limited to, decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which may be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, succinic acid and citric acid.","Basic addition salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a suitable base such as, but not limited to, the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as, but not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine and the like. Other examples of organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine and the like.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable prodrug\u201d or \u201cprodrug\u201d as used herein, represents those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use.","The present invention contemplates compounds of formula (I) formed by synthetic means or formed by in vivo biotransformation of a prodrug.","Compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient therefor. The phrase \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use.","The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula (I), alone or or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent, may be administered to the subjects orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term \u201cparenterally\u201d as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d as used herein, means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as, but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.","Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.","These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.","Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.","The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.","Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In certain embodiments, solid dosage forms may contain from 1% to 95% (w\/w) of a compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula I may be present in the solid dosage form in a range of from 5% to 70% (w\/w). In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and\/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.","The pharmaceutical composition may be a unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, from 1 mg to 100 mg, or from 1% to 95% (w\/w) of a unit dose, according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.","The dose to be administered to a subject may be determined by the efficacy of the particular compound employed and the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular subject. In determining the effective amount of the compound to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of the disorder being treated, the physician can evaluate factors such as the circulating plasma levels of the compound, compound toxicities, and\/or the progression of the disease, etc. In general, the dose equivalent of a compound is from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg for a typical subject.","For administration, compounds of the formula I can be administered at a rate determined by factors that can include, but are not limited to, the LDof the compound, the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, contraindicated drugs, and the side-effects of the compound at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.","The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention can be administered at the initial dosage of about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg daily. In certain embodiments, the daily dose range is from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Treatment may be initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.","Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.","The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.","The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.","Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.","Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.","Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth and mixtures thereof.","Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.","Compounds of formula I may also be administered in the form of liposomes. Liposomes generally may be derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form may contain, in addition to a compound of formula (I), stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. Examples of lipids include, but are not limited to, natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), used separately or together.","Methods to form liposomes have been described, see example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.","Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound described herein include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants which may be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.","Methods of Use","The compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered to a subject suffering from a CDK9-mediated disorder or condition. A \u201cCDK9-mediated disorder or condition\u201d is characterized by the participation of one or more CDK9 kinases in the inception, manifestation of one or more symptoms or disease markers, severity, or progression of a disorder or condition. An example of a CDK9-mediated disorder or condition is cancer, including cancers such as, not limited to, acoustic neuroma, acute leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia (monocytic, myeloblastic, adenocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, astrocytoma, myelomonocytic and promyelocytic), acute t-cell leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer (including estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer), bronchogenic carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, cervical cancer, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, choriocarcinoma, chronic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, craniopharyngioma, cystadenocarcinoma, dysproliferative changes (dysplasias and metaplasias), embryonal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, endotheliosarcoma, ependymoma, epithelial carcinoma, erythroleukemia, esophageal cancer, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, essential thrombocythemia, Ewing's tumor, fibrosarcoma, gastric carcinoma, germ cell testicular cancer, gestational trophobalstic disease, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, heavy chain disease, hemangioblastoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular cancer, hormone insensitive prostate cancer, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, lung cancer (including small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer), lymphangioendothelio-sarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma (lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), malignancies and hyperproliferative disorders of the bladder, breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, skin and uterus, lymphoid malignancies of T-cell or B-cell origin, leukemia, medullary carcinoma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, meningioma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, myeloma, myxosarcoma, neuroblastoma, oligodendroglioma, oral cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, papillary adenocarcinomas, papillary carcinoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, pinealoma, polycythemia vera, prostate cancer (including hormone-insensitive (refractory) prostate cancer), rectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sarcoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, seminoma, skin cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, solid tumors (carcinomas and sarcomas), stomach cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, synovioma, sweat gland carcinoma, testicular cancer (including germ cell testicular cancer), thyroid cancer, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, testicular tumors, uterine cancer, Wilms' tumor and the like.","The term \u201cadministering\u201d or \u201cadministered\u201d refers to the method of contacting a compound with a subject. Thus, the compounds of formula I can be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, parentally, or intraperitoneally. In certain embodiments, a compound of formula I may be administered orally. Also, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of formula I can be administered transdermally, topically, via implantation, transdermally, topically, and via implantation. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the formula I may be delivered orally. The compounds can also be delivered rectally, bucally, intravaginally, ocularly, andially, or by insufflation. CDK9-mediated disorders and conditions can be treated prophylactically, acutely, and chronically using compounds of formula I, depending on the nature of the disorder or condition. Typically, the host or subject in each of these methods is human, although other mammals can also benefit from the administration of a compound of formula I.","The compounds of formula I can be co-administered to a subject. The term \u201cco-administered\u201d means the administration of two or more different pharmaceutical agents or treatments (e.g., radiation treatment) that are administered to a subject by combination in the same pharmaceutical composition or separate pharmaceutical compositions. Thus co-administration involves administration at the same time of a single pharmaceutical composition comprising two or more pharmaceutical agents or administration of two or more different compositions to the same subject at the same or different times.","The compounds of the invention can be co-administered with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more agents to treat a cancer, where examples of the agents include, such as radiation, alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, antibodies, antimetabolites, antimitotics, antiproliferatives, antivirals, aurora kinase inhibitors, apoptosis promoters (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Bfl-1) inhibitors, activators of death receptor pathway, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, BiTE (Bi-Specific T cell Engager) antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, biologic response modifiers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, DVDs (dual variable domain antibodies), leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB2) receptor inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, heat shock protein (HSP)-90 inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, hormonal therapies, immunologicals, inhibitors of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), intercalating antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, kinesin inhibitors, Jak2 inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, microRNA's, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors, multivalent binding proteins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), poly ADP (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum chemotherapeutics, polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (bromodomain) inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etinoids\/deltoids plant alkaloids, small inhibitory ribonucleic acids (siRNAs), topoisomerase inhibitors, ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, and the like, and in combination with one or more of these agents.","BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032-OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand.","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF, or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.","Alkylating agents include altretamine, AMD-473, AP-5280, apaziquone, bendamustine,

NCI-H929 cells obtained from either tumor brei or culture were suspended in cell culture medium (MEM, no calcium, no glutamine, Life Technologies Corporation) and diluted 1:1 with a solution of Matrigel\u2122 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Tumor cells 5 million per site were inoculated subcutaneously into the right hind flank of female nude or SCID-beige mice (Charles River Labs). Randomization into treatment and vehicle control groups (9-10\/group) occurred when the mean tumor volume reached approximately 200 mm. Compounds were formulated in 2.5% DMSO, 2.5% Tween80, 25% PEG400, 70% phosphate-buffered saline or in 2% DMSO, 5% Tween80, 20% PEG400, 73% HPMC. Administration of compound or vehicle was initiated on the day following randomization and continued for the indicated time. Tumors were measured twice a week throughout the treatment period using a pair of calipers and tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula V=L\u00d7W\/2 (V: volume, mm; L: length, mm.
