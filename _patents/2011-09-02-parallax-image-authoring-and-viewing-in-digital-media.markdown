title: Parallax image authoring and viewing in digital media
abstract: An authoring tool assigns a first depth value to a first image layer and a second depth value to a second image layer. The first depth value is a first simulated distance from a user. The second depth value is a second simulated distance from the user. The authoring tool composes an image based on the first image layer and the second image layer such that the image is displayed within a page in a scrollable area on a viewing device. The first depth value is utilized to generate a first offset value from a first static position of the first image layer and the second depth value is utilized to generate a second offset value from a second static position of the second image layer based upon a scroll position of the page with respect to a target location in the scrollable area to create a parallax effect.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to image authoring. More particularly, the disclosure relates to parallax image authoring.","The advent of interactive digital reading experiences has provided for the possibility of bringing the visual richness of print layouts onto touchscreen devices. Although touchscreen devices provide potential for interactivity, many current touchscreen configurations provide a very similar experience to a digital magazine reader as a print publication. Although touchscreen devices provide intuitive scroll gestures for moving through graphically designed reading content, e.g., web pages, magazine pages, etc., interaction cues are currently limited to underlined text, or animations that draw the eye to a control, but distract from the actual reading experience, e.g. typical web page ads.","Further, current traditional tools for authoring digital reading experiences may contain depth-layer information, e.g., simple z-order in three dimensions (\u201c3D\u201d) to structure the static layout of a document, e.g., by utilizing layers in an image authoring tool, but do not leverage this information to provide any additional functionality in the context of a simple two dimensional (\u201c2D\u201d) scroll gesture such as that used in a scrollable area on a touchscreen device or a window on a traditional computer display.","In one aspect of the disclosure, a computer program product is provided. The computer program product includes a computer useable medium having a computer readable program. The computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to assign, with an authoring tool, a first depth value to a first image layer. The first depth value is a first simulated distance from a user. Further, the computer readable program when executed on the computer causes the computer to assign, with the authoring tool, a second depth value to a second image layer. The second depth value is a second simulated distance from the user. In addition, the computer readable program when executed on the computer causes the computer to compose, with the authoring tool, an image based on the first image layer and the second image layer such that the image is displayed within a page in a scrollable area on a viewing device. The first depth value is utilized to generate a first offset value from a first static position of the first image layer, and the second depth value is utilized to generate a second offset value from a second static position of the second image layer based upon a scroll position of the page with respect to a target location in the scrollable area to create a parallax effect. The computer readable program when executed on the computer causes the computer to store the first image layer, the second image layer, the first depth value, and the second depth value on a storage device.","In another aspect of the disclosure, a process is provided. The process assigns, with an authoring tool, a first depth value to a first image layer, the first depth value being a first simulated distance from a user. Further, the process assigns, with the authoring tool, a second depth value to a second image layer, the second depth value being a second simulated distance from the user. In addition, the process composes, with the authoring tool, an image based on the first image layer and the second image layer such that the image is displayed within a page in a scrollable area on a viewing device. The first depth value is utilized to generate a first offset value from a first static position of the first image layer, and the second depth value is utilized to generate a second offset value from a second static position of the second image layer based upon a scroll position of the page with respect to a target location in the scrollable area to create a parallax effect. The process also stores the first image layer, the second image layer, the first depth value, and the second depth value on a storage device.","In yet another aspect of the disclosure, a system is provided. The system includes an authoring tool that (i) assigns a first depth value to a first image layer and a second depth value to a second image layer and (ii) composes an image based on the first image layer and the second image layer such that the image is displayed within a page in a scrollable area on a viewing device. The first depth value is a first simulated distance from a user. The second depth value being a second simulated distance from the user. The first depth value is utilized to generate a first offset value from a first static position of the first image layer, and the second depth value is utilized to generate a second offset value from a second static position of the second image layer based upon a scroll position of the page with respect to a target location in the scrollable area to create a parallax effect. The system also includes a storage device that stores the first image layer, the second image layer, the first depth value, and the second depth value on a storage device.","A parallax image authoring system is provided that allows an author to compose parallax images for digital media. The term parallax refers to the rendering of images that simulate 3D scenes by moving layers of an image at different rates. The parallax image authoring system provides the parallax effect for utilization with a variety of design tools. Layers of an image or scene are given different depths that each correspond to their simulated distance from the viewer. The composed images may then be added to the digital media. An example of digital media is a digital magazine. As the digital magazine content is scrolled across the screen, e.g., a user moving touching a tablet and sliding his or her touching finger, the parallax effect would occur, which creates the illusion of a 3D perspective. When the user releases the scroll, e.g., he or she removes his or her finger, the content may go back its resting position without in which there is no parallax.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106"]},"The authoring tool  may be a program that is utilized to compose, edit, and\/or perform other actions on an image. In one embodiment, the authoring tool  may receive layers of an image for composition. In another embodiment, the authoring tool  may generate the individual layers and then compose those layers into an image. In other words, the authoring tool  supports authoring images composed from multiple layers. The authoring tool  may take a single image and split it into layers or use multiple images that are composited together.","As an example, the authoring tool  may compose an image based on a first image layer and a second image layer by assigning a first depth value to the first image layer and a second depth value to the second image layer. The example utilizes two layers only for ease of explanation as the authoring device may compose an image based on more than two layers. In one embodiment, the first depth value is a first simulated distance of the first image layer from a user and the second depth value is a second simulated distance of the second image layer from the user. The simulated distance is utilized to offset the image layer from its pre-assigned position depending on the scroll position of the page in the scrollable area. A simulated distance may be a predetermined distance. For example, the predetermined distance may be two feet as many computer users may read a digital magazine from a distance of two feet. The term simulated distance is intended to indicate that the user may not be at the distance, but that the user may be in the approximate range of the simulated distance. The 3D scene is built such that the 3D scene unfolds behind the screen. Further, the simulated distance is utilized to offset the image layer from its pre-assigned position depending on the scroll position of the page in the scrollable area. Further, in one embodiment, the simulated distance may be measured along the z-axis. In other words, a viewing screen may be configured according to an x-axis and a y-axis, which would allow for the simulated distance between a user and a layer to be measured along a z-axis. Various other axes may be utilized for the simulated distances.","In one embodiment, each layer may have different depth values. A depth value may enable an indicator to the user. An indicator, e.g., an icon, at a depth value may provide an indication to the user when the image is scrolled. For example, when the image is scrolled, an icon at a particular layer may move at a different rate than other layers. Since human beings perceive motion more easily when the user manipulates, e.g., scrolls, the image, that icon is called out. For example, a depth value may indicate interactive content, non-interactive content, a metatextual visual cue, or the like. In one embodiment, the first image layer has a distinct first depth value from the second image layer that has a second depth value. As a result, a user may be able to be informed that different layers provide different types of functional abilities and\/or information to the user. In configurations with more than two layers, a subset of a plurality of layers may potentially have different or the same depth values. For example, two of five layers may have the same depth value such that those layers both provide interactivity.","Further, in one embodiment, the depth values also allow a user to move different layers over other layers. For example, if the second image layer is deeper than the first image layer, the second image layer may be moved under the first image layer such that the first image layer would at least partially, if not fully, cover the second image layer.","After the depth value for each layer is set, that information, along with the layers, is stored. In one embodiment, the depth values and corresponding layers of the image are stored in an image storage device . The image storage device may be a memory device, flash drive, tape drive, floppy drive, hard disk drive, compact disk (\u201cCD\u201d) drive, or the like. The data may be stored in various image file formats. Alternatively, the data may be stored in a folder that includes the layers and an Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) manifest that stores the depth value for each layer image.","A viewing device  allows a user to display the layer images in a manner that reflects their corresponding depth values. The viewing device  may move the layers at different rates as the image moves across the screen of the viewing device , which generates the parallax effect. If the parallax image is zoomed, the image layers are then also zoomed.","The exact positions and sizes of the layers may be determined by multiplying the position and size of the image layer by a coefficient based on the depth value. Alternatively, the layers may be placed in a 3D Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). In such a configuration, the parallax effect is generated by either moving all layers at the same time or moving the projection center of the scene, i.e., moving a camera across or through a scene.","If the layers are placed in a 3D and API depth values are provided to the corresponding layers, the layers may appear smaller because the 3D API shows them as farther from the camera. Accordingly, the image layers may be scaled up according to a scale factor accordingly so that the image layers appear at their original size despite their depth in the scene.","The viewing device  may be any type of general purpose computing device such as a tablet device, magazine viewer, e-book reader, Internet-connected TV, smart phone, personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d), laptop, notebook, or the like. As an example, with respect to a magazine viewer, the parallax effect is applied proportionally to a parallax image based on the onscreen position of the image. Accordingly, if an image is scrolled left or right, the image layers shift as if the user has stepped to the left or right. If the image is scrolled up and down, the layers shift as if the user has moved up or down. If the image is zoomed, the image layers grow and shrink as if the user has moved closer to or further from the scene.","Accordingly, the parallax image authoring system  may generate 3D images that are more visually impactful than current configurations and provide a more immersive and engaging reading experience than provided for by current configurations. Further, the parallax image authoring system  may provide helpful visual cues for interactivity. For example, if an image is pannable or zoomable beyond what is displayed in a magazine layout, e.g., a background beyond a magazine page, the image may appear to have depth, which suggests that more information is available for exploration if an input, e.g., a tap, to the image is provided. Another example involves visual icons or calls to action that appear on top of interactive elements in a digital magazine. The visual icons or calls to action may appear at different depths than the content itself, which suggests they visual icons or calls to action are not part of the content itself, but rather a metatextual visual cue. An example of a call to action is a text box asking the user to provide an input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2C","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"],"b":["102","202","204","206"]},"FIGS. A,B, and C illustrate examples of display windows relating to the image layers illustrated in . For example,  illustrates a composed image , which may be displayed on the viewing device  illustrated in , that includes the individual layers illustrated in . As an example, the composed image may be an image of a character with background scenery and text. The first image  may have a simulated depth of zero pixels. In other words, the first image  will not move with respect to the edge of a page boundary. A page boundary is the boundary of the authored content. A digital document may include multiple pages in either a horizontal or a vertical scroll. The viewport boundary in this instance is the same width and height as the page boundary. Accordingly, the pages will snap into view. The viewport boundary does not change, but the page boundary may change with respect to the viewport boundary as a scrolling motion is performed. The distance between the left edge of the first image  and the edge of the viewport boundary will remain constant irrespective of how much the user scrolls the page within the scrollable area of a display screen of the viewing device  as illustrated in . Further, the second image  may have a simulated depth of two hundred pixels. Accordingly, the second image  may move with respect to the viewport boundary. The parallax effect results from the different offsets of the different layers and scrolling of the page with those layers to generate those different offsets. The depth information may be automatically utilized to provide the parallax effect, which diminishes as the user reaches a zero scroll position, i.e., a position in which the page is placed fully in view of the viewport. The user scrolls the page with respect to the viewport boundary, and the image layers move relative to the page depending on the simulated depths of the image layers. In one embodiment, an offset may be a function of a scroll position, a simulated depth value, and a constant associated with a size of the page. The constant may be manually modified by an author utilizing the authoring tool to obtain the desired parallax effect. In one embodiment, an author may preview the content in a scrollable view so that the parallax effect may be viewed and modified.","Further,  illustrates the composed image  with measurement annotations. The composed image  is illustrated with no horizontal scroll. Without any scroll, a parallax effect has not yet been generated. As an example, the first image layer  has an authored x position of forty-seven pixels from the edge of the viewport boundary. As the simulated depth value for the first image layer  is zero pixels, the authored x position of forty-seven pixels from the edge of the viewport boundary will not change. Further, as an example, the second image layer  has an authored x position of one hundred ninety-five pixels from the viewport boundary. As the simulated depth value from the viewport boundary is two hundred pixels, the second image layer  may move with toward the viewport boundary. The illustrated z values are depth values.","In addition,  illustrates an image layer depth configuration , which may be displayed on the viewing device  illustrated in , that includes an image layer depth window . The image layer depth window  indicates the different layers and the corresponding depths along the z-axis. In one embodiment, the image layer depth window  simply displays the corresponding simulated depths. In another embodiment, the image layer depth window  allows the user to modify the simulated depth values.","The depth values may be calculated according to standard parallax methodologies. For example, a standard graphics program with parallax functionality may be utilized to calculate the depth values. Alternatively, a constant offset may be determined for each layer. That constant offset value may then be applied to the respective layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4B","FIG. 3","FIG. 4A"],"b":["300","300","202","202","204","202","204","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["202","202","204","202","204","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","500","500","502","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":"500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5A"],"b":"500"},"The parallax effect may be utilized to indicate interactive elements on what would otherwise be a static print design.
