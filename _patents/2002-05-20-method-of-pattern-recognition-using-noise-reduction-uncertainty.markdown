title: Method of pattern recognition using noise reduction uncertainty
abstract: A method and apparatus are provided for using the uncertainty of a noise-removal process during pattern recognition. In particular, noise is removed from a representation of a portion of a noisy signal to produce a representation of a cleaned signal. In the meantime, an uncertainty associated with the noise removal is computed and is used with the representation of the cleaned signal to modify a probability for a phonetic state in the recognition system. In particular embodiments, the uncertainty is used to modify a probability distribution, by increasing the variance in each Gaussian distribution by the amount equal to the estimated variance of the cleaned signal, which is used in decoding the phonetic state sequence in a pattern recognition task.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to pattern recognition. In particular, the present invention relates to performing pattern recognition after noise reduction.","A pattern recognition system, such as a speech recognition system, takes an input signal and attempts to decode the signal to find a pattern represented by the signal. For example, in a speech recognition system, a speech signal (often referred to as a test signal) is received by the recognition system and is decoded to identify a string of words represented by the speech signal.","To decode the incoming test signal, most recognition systems utilize one or more models that describe the likelihood that a portion of the test signal represents a particular pattern. Examples of such models include Neural Nets, Dynamic Time Warping, segment models, and Hidden Markov Models.","Before a model can be used to decode an incoming signal, it must be trained. This is typically done by measuring input training signals generated from a known training pattern. For example, in speech recognition, a collection of speech signals is generated by speakers reading from a known text. These speech signals are then used to train the models.","In order for a model to work optimally, the signals used to train the model should be similar to the eventual test signals that are decoded. In particular, it is desirable that the training signals contain the same amount and type of noise as the test signals that are decoded.","Typically, the training signal is collected under \u201cclean\u201d conditions and is considered to be relatively noise free. To achieve this same low level of noise in the test signal, many prior art systems apply noise reduction techniques to the testing data. These noise reduction techniques result in a cleaned test signal that is then used during pattern recognition. In most systems, the noise reduction technique produces a sequence of multi-dimensional feature vectors, with each feature vector representing a frame of a noise-reduced signal.","Unfortunately, noise reduction techniques do not work perfectly and as a result, there is some inherent uncertainty in the cleaned signal. In the past, there have been two general techniques for dealing with such uncertainty. The first has been to ignore the uncertainty and treat the noise reduction process as being perfect. Since this ignores the true state of the recognition system, it results in recognition errors that could be avoided.","The other prior art technique for dealing with uncertainty in noise reduction is to identify frames of the input signal where the noise reduction technique is likely to have performed poorly. In these frames, dimensions of the feature vectors that are likely in error are marked by the noise reduction system so that they are not used during recognition. Thus, the feature vector components that have more than a predetermined amount of uncertainty are completely ignored during decoding. Although such systems acknowledge uncertainty in noise reduction, the technique of completely ignoring a component treats the component as providing no information that would be helpful during recognition. This is highly unlikely because even with a significant amount of uncertainty, the noise-reduced component still provides some information that would be helpful during recognition.","In light of this, a technique is needed that effectively uses the uncertainty in noise reduction during pattern recognition.","A method and apparatus are provided for using the uncertainty of a noise-removal process during pattern recognition. In particular, noise is removed from a representation of a portion of a noisy signal to produce a representation of a cleaned signal. An uncertainty associated with the noise removal is identified and is used with the representation of the cleaned signal to identify a probability for a phonetic state. In particular embodiments, the uncertainty is used to modify a probability distribution that is used in determining the probability of the phonetic state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Microphone  converts the speech and noise signals into a single electrical signal, which is sampled by an analog-to-digital converter . The sampling characteristics for A\/D converter  are the same as those described above for A\/D converter . The samples provided by A\/D converter  are collected into frames by a frame constructor , which acts in a manner similar to frame constructor .

For example, the analog version of the \u201cclean\u201d channel signal may be stored after it is created by microphone . The original \u201cclean\u201d channel signal is then applied to A\/D converter , frame constructor , and feature extractor . When that process is complete, an analog noise signal is added to the stored \u201cclean\u201d channel signal to form a noisy analog channel signal. This noisy signal is then applied to A\/D converter , frame constructor , and feature extractor  to form the feature vectors for the noisy channel signal.","In other embodiments, digital samples of noise are added to stored digital samples of the \u201cclean\u201d channel signal between A\/D converter  and frame constructor , or frames of digital noise samples are added to stored frames of \u201cclean\u201d channel samples after frame constructor . In still further embodiments, the frames of \u201cclean\u201d channel samples are converted into the frequency domain and the spectral content of additive noise is added to the frequency-domain representation of the \u201cclean\u201d channel signal. This produces a frequency-domain representation of a noisy channel signal that can be used for feature extraction.","The feature vectors for the noisy channel signal and the \u201cclean\u201d channel signal are provided to a noise reduction trainer  in . At step  of , noise reduction trainer  groups the feature vectors for the noisy channel signal into mixture components. This grouping can be done by grouping similar noisy feature vectors together using a maximum likelihood training technique or by grouping feature vectors that represent a temporal section of the speech signal together. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other techniques for grouping the feature vectors may be used and that the two techniques listed above are only provided as examples.","After the feature vectors of the noisy channel signal have been grouped into mixture components, noise reduction trainer  generates a set of distribution values that are indicative of the distribution of the feature vectors within the mixture component. This is shown as step  in . In many embodiments, this involves determining a mean vector and a standard deviation vector for each vector component in the feature vectors of each mixture component. In an embodiment in which maximum likelihood training is used to group the feature vectors, the means and standard deviations are provided as by-products of identifying the groups for the mixture components.","Once the means and standard deviations have been determined for each mixture component, the noise reduction trainer  determines a correction vector, r, for each mixture component, m, at step  of . Under one embodiment, the vector components of the correction vector for each mixture component are determined using a weighted least squares estimation technique. Under this technique, the correction vector components are calculated

The audio signals detected by microphone  are converted into electrical signals that are provided to analog-to-digital converter .","Although additive noise  is shown entering through microphone  in the embodiment of , in other embodiments, additive noise  may be added to the input speech signal as a digital signal after A-to-D converter .","A-to-D converter  converts the analog signal from microphone  into a series of digital values. In several embodiments, A-to-D converter  samples the analog signal at 16 kHz and 16 bits per sample, thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second. These digital values are provided to a frame constructor , which, in one embodiment, groups the values into 25 millisecond frames that start 10 milliseconds apart.","The frames of data created by frame constructor  are provided to feature extractor , which extracts a feature from each frame. The same feature extraction that was used to train the noise reduction parameters (the correction vectors, means, and standard deviations of the mixture components) is used in feature extractor .","The feature extraction module produces a stream of feature vectors that are each associated with a frame of the speech signal. This stream of feature vectors is provided to noise reduction module  of the present invention, which uses the noise reduction parameters stored in noise reduction parameter storage  to reduce the noise in the input speech signal using the techniques discussed above. In addition, noise reduction module  identifies a uncertainty associated with the noise removal for the current frame.","For each frame, the output of noise reduction module  is a \u201ccleaned\u201d feature vector and an uncertainty associated with the cleaned feature vector. If the input signal is a training signal, each of \u201ccleaned\u201d feature vectors is provided to a trainer , which uses the \u201ccleaned\u201d feature vectors and a training text  to train an acoustic model . Techniques for training such models are known in the art and a description of them is not required for an understanding of the present invention.","If the input signal is a test signal, the \u201ccleaned\u201d feature vectors and the respective uncertainties are provided to a decoder , which identifies a most likely sequence of words based on the stream of feature vectors, a lexicon , a language model , the acoustic model , and the uncertainty of the noise removal process as discussed above in connection with EQ. 6.","The most probable sequence of hypothesis words is provided to a confidence measure module . Confidence measure module  identifies which words are most likely to have been improperly identified by the speech recognizer, based in part on a secondary acoustic model (not shown). Confidence measure module  then provides the sequence of hypothesis words to an output module  along with identifiers indicating which words may have been improperly identified. Those skilled in the art will recognize that confidence measure module  is not necessary for the practice of the present invention.","Although  depicts a speech recognition system, the present invention may be used in any pattern recognition system and is not limited to speech.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
