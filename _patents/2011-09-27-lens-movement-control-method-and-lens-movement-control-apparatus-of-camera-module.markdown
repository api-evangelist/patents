Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a lens movement control method and a lens movement control apparatus of a camera module. More particularly, the present invention relates to a lens movement control method and a lens movement control apparatus of a camera module for preventing allophone of a Voice Coil Actuator (VCA).","2. Description of the Related Art","In cases where a camera module photographing a moving image or taking a picture is mounted in a portable terminal, a Voice Coil Actuator (VCA) has been widely used as the means to make a lens perform a linear motion for focusing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , a VCA  engages with a side surface of a lens  to be located at an upper portion of a bobbin support  of a housing . The VCA  includes a permanent magnet  and a bobbin . When a camera module  is switched from a camera operation mode to a camera stop mode, power of the camera module  is turned-off. Accordingly, as shown in , the bobbin  moves the lens  to a bottom surface  by force of a spring . As illustrated above, when the lens  moves to the bottom surface , a VCA allophone is created when a lower end of the bobbin  collides with a bobbin support  of the housing .","A lens movement control operation of a camera module according to the related art will be described below with reference to a control block diagram of , and a lens movement control flowchart of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"Referring to , a controller  determines whether a camera module is in a camera operation mode based on an input from an input unit  in step S. If it is determined in step S that the camera module is not in the camera operation mode, the controller  returns to step S. In contrast, if it is determined in step S that the camera module is in the camera operation mode, the controller  enters a camera stop mode in step S.","The camera operation mode is a mode in which the camera module is performing a photographing operation. The camera operation mode includes a preview (i.e., a state displaying that a camera module is performing a photographing operation before taking a picture) or a photographing of a moving image. Furthermore, the camera stop mode is a mode in which the camera module stops a photographing operation. The camera stop mode includes a quick view (i.e., a state displaying a taken picture on a screen for a moment directly after taking a picture in a preview state), a menu view or a photograph view. Entering the camera stop mode may automatically be performed by a controller  like the quick view and may be performed as a result of an input into an input unit .","In step S, the controller  sets a number (n) (the time it takes for a bobbin to drop, in seconds) of bobbin  drops to an initial value  and controls a lens driving unit  to drop a bobbin  in step S. When the bobbin  starts to drop, the controller  increases the number (n) of bobbin  drops by 1 in step S. Next, the controller  determines whether a lens  moves to a bottom surface  by using a detecting unit  in step S. If it is determined in step S that the detecting unit  detects that the lens  moves to the bottom surface , the controller  controls a lens driving unit  to terminate lens movement. In contrast, if it is determined in step S that the lens  does not move to the bottom surface , the controller determines whether the number (n) of bobbin  drops is equal to 6 (a maximum number of time a bobbin may drop before power off of a camera module) in step S. Although the maximum number of bobbin  drops is equal to 6 in this example, it is possible for it to be more than 7. If it is determined in step S that the bobbin dropping number is less than 6, the controller  returns to step S and repeats the process of dropping the bobbin . Accordingly, it is appreciated in the related art that the lens  slowly moves to the bottom surface . In contrast, if it is determined in step S that the number of bobbin  drops is not less than 6, the controller  turns-off camera power in step S and terminates the lens movement control operation.","As illustrated above, in the lens movement control method of the related art, after the bobbin  has dropped, the lens moves to the bottom surface. The foregoing procedure is repeated by the maximum number of bobbin  drops. This repetition procedure increases the operation time. As a result, it takes more than 6 seconds from when a camera enters a stop mode to a when the lens of the camera module moves to the bottom surface, which results in an error frequently occurring in the determining procedure.","Therefore, a need exists for a lens movement control method of a camera module having a short operation time capable of preventing the occurrence of an error and a VCA allophone, and an apparatus thereof.","Aspects of the present invention are to address the above problems and\/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a lens movement control method of a camera module having a short operation time capable of preventing the occurrence of an error and a Voice Coil Actuator (VCA) allophone, and an apparatus thereof.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a lens movement control method of a camera module is provided. The lens movement control method includes switching the camera module from a camera operation mode to a camera stop mode, generating a control signal for removing the occurrence of VCA allophone in the camera stop mode, moving a lens to a VCA allophone removal location based on the generated control signal, and powering-off the camera module to move the lens moved to the VCA allophone removal location to a bottom surface of the lens.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a lens movement control apparatus of a camera module is provided. The lens movement control apparatus includes a mode switch for switching the camera module from a camera operation mode to a camera stop mode, a VCA allophone removal controller for generating a control signal for removing the occurrence of a VCA allophone, a lens driving unit for moving a lens to a VCA allophone removal location under control of the VCA allophone removal controller, and a camera power controller for controlling a power off of the camera module to move the lens moved to the VCA allophone removal location to a bottom surface of the lens.","Since exemplary embodiment of the present invention forcibly move a lens of a camera module to an allophone removal location of a VCA and then power-off the camera module, it may prevent the occurrence of a VCA allophone. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of the operation algorithm, errors are reduced and the time from when a camera enters a stop mode to when the lens moves to the bottom surface may also be reduced.","Other aspects, advantages, and salient features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Throughout the drawings, it should be noted that like reference numbers are used to depict the same or similar elements, features, and structures.","The following description with reference to the accompanying drawings is provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of the invention as defined by the claims and their equivalents.

Thus,  will be referred to herein for convenience in description when describing exemplary embodiments of the present invention. However, it is to be understood that the present invention is applicable to devices other than those illustrated in .","Referring to , a camera module is illustrated to which an exemplary lens movement control method of a camera module is applied. The camera module  includes a photographing unit , an input unit , a controller , a lens driving unit , and a detecting unit .","The photographing unit  includes a lens , an InfraRed (IR) cut-off filter , and an image sensor . The lens  collects incident light to form an image on the image sensor . The IR filter  is provided at a lower portion of the lens , and the image sensor  is provided at a lower portion of the IR filter .","Although not shown in , the input unit  allows a user to input desired information in the camera module , and may be configured by a touch screen, a touch key, a button key, and the like.","The lens driving unit  includes a VCA , a lens driving power supply (not shown), a spring , and a housing . The VCA  makes the lens  perform a linear motion for focusing along an optical axis. The VCA  includes a bobbin  and a permanent magnet . The bobbin  engages with a side of the lens , in which a coil is wound around the bobbin . The bobbin  adjusts a location of the lens  according to an amount of electric current flowing through the coil. The permanent magnet  is provided at an outer side of the bobbin . When the camera module  performs a photographing operation, a lower end  of the bobbin  is spaced apart from a bobbin support  of the housing  by a predefined distance (h). The distance (h) between the lower end  of the bobbin  and the bobbin support  of the housing  is the same as that of a lower surface of the lens  and a bottom surface . The lens driving power supply functions to supply an electric current to the VCA  to drive the lens .","When camera power is turned-off, the spring  moves the lens  to the bottom surface . The spring  includes an upper spring  provided at an upper portion of the VCA  and a lower spring  provided at a lower portion of the VCA . The housing  surrounds, protects, and supports internal structural elements of the camera module . The housing  includes the bobbin support  and a lens lower end support . When camera power is turned-off, an upper surface of the lens lower end support  forms the bottom surface  contacting with the lens .","Although not shown in , the detecting unit  detects a location of the lens .","Although not shown in , the controller  receives respective signals from the input unit , the photographing unit , and the detecting unit  to control the lens driving unit . The controller  may include a mode switch for switching the camera module  from a camera operation mode to a camera stop mode, a VCA allophone removal controller for generating a control signal for removing the occurrence of a VCA allophone, and a camera power controller for controlling power on\/off of a camera.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Referring to , a controller  determines whether a camera module is in a camera operation mode based on input from an input unit  in step S. If it is determined in step S that the camera module is not in the camera operation mode, the process returns to step S. In contrast, if it is determined in step S that the camera module is in the camera operation mode, the controller  enters a camera stop mode in step S to switch from the camera operation mode to the camera stop mode.","Next, after the controller  generates a lens movement command for moving the lens  to a VCA allophone removal location, a lens driving power supply supplies a VCA allophone removal current to a VCA  of a lens driving unit  in step S. Subsequently, the VCA  moves the lens  to the VCA allophone removal location in step S.","The VCA allophone removal location is a location of the lens  in the vicinity of the bottom surface  in which a VCA allophone may be prevented even when camera power is turned-off. The VCA allophone removal current is an electric current supplied to a VCA  that has a current amount capable of moving the lens  to the VCA allophone removal location. The lens movement command takes precedence over a camera power off command of an Application Programming Interface (API) stored in a memory (not shown) of the controller . For example, it is assumed that a maximum distance between the lens  and the bottom surface  is (hmax), an electric current supplied to the VCA  is 10 mA such that a distance between the lens  and the bottom surface  has a maximum value, and the VCA allophone removal location is a location such that a distance between the lens  and the bottom surface  is less than or equal to 0.1hmax. In this case, an electric current of 1 mA may be supplied to the VCA  to move the lens to the VCA allophone removal location.","Next, as shown in , the controller  turns-off camera power to move the lens  to the bottom surface  in step S.","In this exemplary embodiment of the present invention, camera power is turned-off after the lens is moved to a VCA allophone removal location. Accordingly, although the lens is pressed by force of a spring due to powering-off of the camera module, a VCA allophone and an allophone between a lens and a lens lower end support may be prevented. Since a simple operation algorithm controls lens movement without determining presence of lens movement completion, the time from when a camera stop mode is entered to when the lens is moved to the bottom surface may be reduced in comparison with the related art, and also prevent an adverse effect.","While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other aspects, features, and advantages of certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
