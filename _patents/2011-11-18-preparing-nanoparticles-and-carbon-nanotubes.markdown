As such, these nanotubes show promise as potential building blocks for nanoscale electronic devices, such as field emitting devices, field-effect-transistors, single-electron-transistors, molecular sensors, and the like.","This document describes, among other things, catalyst nanoparticles from which carbon nanotubes can be generated, such as by using methods described herein.","Single-walled carbon nanotube based-devices can be prepared by deposition of a nanotube suspension on substrates, or via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of individual nanotubes directly on substrates. The direct chemical vapor deposition growth method typically provides individual nanotubes with few structural defects, while the preparation of nanotube based-devices via deposition of a nanotube suspension on substrates usually results in nanotubes that exist in bundles or single nanotubes of submicron lengths and that can have defects arising from post-synthetic destructive treatments. As such, the preparation of single-walled carbon nanotubes using the chemical vapor deposition growth method may be selected over the nanotube suspension method and would appear to be a method of choice for large-scale fabrication of single-walled carbon nanotubes. However, the chemical vapor deposition growth method typically provides nanotubes having varying amounts of amorphous carbon impurities. Further, in the absence of external guidance methods, the chemical vapor deposition growth method typically yields short and randomly oriented nanotubes. For the purposes of fundamental study or device fabrication, it can be desirable to develop methods for making high-purity single-walled carbon nanotubes which allow for control over diameter, helicity, orientation and length.","Certain methods for the surface growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes provide a slight degree of control over the diameter and orientation of the nanotubes being produced. A correlation exists between the size of the catalyst nanoparticles used and the diameter of the nanotubes that are produced. As such, some control over the diameter of growing nanotubes can be realized by depositing uniform and monodisperse catalyst nanoparticles on substrates. In addition, some degree of control over the orientation of growing nanotubes can be achieved via the use of an external electric field during a chemical vapor deposition process, and this alignment effect is believed to originate from the high polarizability of the nanotubes. However, neither fabricating a microelectrode array nor introducing a strong electric field during the chemical vapor deposition growth is trivial, especially when the effort is directed toward large-scale fabrication. A fast heating process can allow the growth of long (mm in length) and well-oriented single-walled carbon nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition using carbon monoxide as a carbon feedstock.","The present inventors have recognized a need in the art for methods of making high-purity single-walled carbon nanotubes, for example, that allow a higher degree of control over various physical parameters of the nanotubes as they are made.","Accordingly, in an embodiment of the present subject matter, nanoparticles can be formed on a substrate by depositing a film of a material on at least a portion of a substrate and heating at least the deposited material and forming separated nanoparticles from the deposited material on the substrate.  depicts an example of a substrate  on which a layer  of material has been deposited.

In an embodiment, the thickness of layer  can be equal to or less than about 1.0 nanometer. The thickness of layer  can be equal to or less than about 0.5 nanometers. Layer  can have a linewidth ranging from about 1.0 millimeter to about 5.0 millimeters. The material deposited can include one or more metals or alloys of metals, such as, but not limited to, nickel, iron, cobalt, copper, gold, an alloy of cobalt and molybdenum, an alloy of iron and molybdenum, an alloy of nickel and molybdenum, other alloys, or one or more combinations thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["105","115","105","110","115","115","110","105"]},"An embodiment provides a method for making metal catalyst nanoparticles, which are useful for making carbon nanotubes.

In various embodiments, the effective diameter of the formed carbon nanotube can be determined by the thickness of the film of material deposited to form the nanoparticle from which the carbon nanotube is generated.

Various embodiments allow for the scalable preparation of long, well-defined nanotubes having improved size uniformity. Cheap carbon feedstock sources can be used. The carbon feedstock sources can be diluted with water and result in nanotubes having increased purity by reducing the amount of amorphous carbon present in the nanotubes as they are formed. Embodiments can provide long, ordered nanotubes without the use of an external electrical field or a \u201cfast heating\u201d process.","Various embodiments of the present methods for making single-walled carbon nanotubes use metal catalyst nanoparticles for nanotube growth. In certain examples, the catalyst is first deposited on top of the substrate as a metal film, and then the substrate having the catalyst film on its surface is preheated before beginning a chemical vapor deposition process. The preheating is generally conducted for a time and at a temperature sufficient to cause the metal catalyst film to disperse into individual metal catalyst nanoparticles on top of the substrate. Accordingly, an embodiment includes a method for making metal catalyst nanoparticles, where the method includes depositing a metal catalyst film on top of a substrate, and heating the substrate and catalyst film thereon for a time and at a temperature sufficient to cause the catalyst film to disperse and form catalyst nanoparticles on top of the substrate.","In an embodiment, the heating takes place in a quartz or other furnace.

In an embodiment, the flow rate is from about 200 sccm to about 500 sccm. In an embodiment, the flow rate is about 50 sccm. In an embodiment, the flow rate is about 700 sccm.","In an embodiment, the heating takes place for a period of from about 10 minutes to about one hour before beginning the chemical vapor deposition process. In an embodiment, the heating results in a final temperature of from about 500\u00b0 to about 950\u00b0 C. In an embodiment, the heating results in a final temperature of from about 700\u00b0 C. to about 900\u00b0 C. In an embodiment, the heating results in a final temperature of about 850\u00b0 C.","In an embodiment, the resultant catalyst nanoparticles have a diameter of from about 1 nm to about 20 nm. In an embodiment, the catalyst nanoparticles have a diameter of from about 0.5 nm to about 10 nm. Metals useful as catalysts in embodiments of the present methods include, but are not limited to, one or any alloy or other combination of nickel, iron, cobalt, alloy of cobalt and platinum, alloy of iron and platinum, alloy of cobalt and molybdenum, alloy of iron and molybdenum, alloy of nickel and molybdenum, copper, and gold. In an embodiment, the catalyst is cobalt. In an embodiment, the catalyst is iron.

Other examples of metal deposition methods that can be useful in the present methods include those disclosed in Seshan, K. (Ed.) -(2nd Edition) 2002; William Andrew Publishing\/Noyes. In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film is deposited on top of the substrate using electron beam evaporation. In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film is deposited on top of the substrate using sputtering.","In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film has a thickness of from about 0.1 nm to about 10.0 nm. In various embodiments, the catalyst film has a thickness of about 0.1 nm, about 0.2 nm, about 0.3 nm, about 0.4 nm, about 0.5 nm, about 0.6 nm, about 0.7 nm, about 0.8 nm, about 0.9 nm, about 1.0 nm, about 1.2 nm, about 1.4 nm, about 1.6 nm, about 1.8 nm, about 2.0 nm, about 2.5 nm, about 3.0 nm, about 3.5 nm, about 4.0 nm, about 4.5 nm, about 5.0 nm, about 5.5 nm, about 6.0 nm, about 6.5 nm, about 7.0 nm, about 8.0 nm, about 8.5 nm, about 9.0 nm, about 9.5 nm, and about 10.0 nm. In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film has a thickness of from about 0.5 nm to about 1.0 nm. In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film has a thickness of about 1.0 nm. In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film has a thickness of about 0.5 nm.","In an embodiment, the metal catalyst film is deposited along only one side of the substrate surface at a distance of from about 1 mm to about 5 mm from the nearest edge of the substrate. A mask, such as a glass slide having a straight edge, can be used to pattern the metal catalyst film in a desired location on the substrate. Other masks can be used to pattern a metal catalyst film. In this embodiment, the substrate is placed in the reaction furnace such that during the chemical vapor deposition process the carbon feedstock gas flow passes over the catalyst-carrying edge of the substrate first and the resulting carbon nanotubes grow across the substrate surface away from the catalyst-carrying side of the substrate and in the direction of carbon feedstock gas flow. In a variant of this embodiment, the substrate  can be tilted such that the catalyst-carrying side of the substrate is raised, such as depicted in . In an embodiment, the substrate is tilted at an angle of from about 5 degrees to about 30 degrees with respect to the floor of the furnace. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that by tilting the substrate to lift up the catalyst edge, the growing nanotube is able to stay suspended in the flow longer before being forced into contact with the substrate by gravity, thus allowing the nanotube to grow longer. Thus, it is believed that tilting the substrate in such a way can result in the formation of longer nanotubes than those obtained when the substrate is in a flat orientation during the chemical vapor deposition process.","Various embodiments of a method for making metal catalyst nanoparticles can be combined with a suitable lithographic technique to pattern the metal catalyst film in various patterns or to provide individual \u201cislands\u201d of metal catalyst film, which can be used to grow individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with precise control over location and orientation.

The metal catalyst thin films can also be patterned with a soft polymer template prepared by solution-based self-assembling of diblock copolymer. See, for example, K. W. Guarini, C. T. Black and S. H. I. Yeung, 14, 1290 (2002)].","Various embodiments of the present methods for making single-walled carbon nanotubes use a carbon feedstock that includes a carbon-containing organic compound and water (collectively referred to herein as the \u201ccarbon feedstock\u201d).

A cobalt film (e.g., 0.5 nm thick) was then deposited over the AlOepilayer using an electron beam evaporator (e.g., SEMICORE SC2000 E-beam evaporation system) such as at a deposition rate of 0.1 A\/s. A glass slide was used as a mask such that the cobalt film was only deposited along one side of the substrate, about 0.5 mm from the edge of the substrate.","The substrate was then placed in quartz tube furnace (e.g., 25 mm o.d, 22 mm i.d.) and a flow of argon:hydrogen (e.g., 10:1 v\/v) carrier gas was introduced into the furnace, such as at a flow rate of 400 sccm with gas flow parallel to the nanotube direction. The furnace was gradually heated to 850\u00b0 C. over one hour, then 95% ethanol vapor was delivered to furnace, such as by bubbling the carrier gas into an ethanol-water bubbler (e.g., water level at 5% by volume; water and ethanol were degassed prior to use) such as at a flow rate of 50 sccm for 30 minutes to provide single-walled carbon nanotubes, which were shown to have lengths of up to 5 cm and diameters ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 nm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5C","FIG. 5A"],"sub":"2 ","b":["512","512","514","512","514"]},"Silicon chips (\u02dc4\u00d74 mm) with a slit structure were prepared from a Si wafer with a SiNepilayer. The slits (approximately 100 mm wide\u00d71 mm long) were fabricated by anisotropic KOH etching of Si using the SiNlayer as a mask. The Si chips with the slit structures on elevated stages (\u02dc20 micrometers high) were also fabricated using a standard photolithography and wet etching process. Ultrathin films (\u02dc1 nm in thickness) of Co were deposited on the edge of chips (e.g., <0.5 mm away from the edge) by using an e-beam evaporator (e.g., SEMICORE SC2000 E-beam Evaporation System) with a deposition rate of 0.01 nm\/s. The chips were placed in a CVD reactor (e.g., a 25 mm (o.d.)\/22 mm (i.d.) quartz tube) with the slit perpendicular to the gas flow so that long nanotubes can be carried downstream over the slit. The cobalt catalyst film was gradually heated to 850\u00b0 C. in an argon\/H(e.g., 520 sccm\/65 sccm) flow for 1 h before ethanol was introduced for the nanotube growth. The ethanol and water vapor was delivered by bubbling argon\/Hmixed gas (e.g., 10:1 by volume, 80-700 sccm) into an ethanol pool (0\u00b0 C.), and the ethanol CVD was carried out at 850\u00b0 C. for 20-80 min. The results show that millimeter to centimeter-long, oriented single-walled carbon nanotubes can traverse slits as large as hundreds of microns wide or grow over vertical barriers as high as 20 micrometers. These example results indicate that well oriented nanotube arrays can be grown across slits using embodiments of the present methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6E","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6D","FIG. 6E","FIG. 6C"],"b":["605","610","610","615","605","610","615","610","615","610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"b":["715","720","705","710","715","720","725","710","745","750","735","740","740","745","750","755","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A-8C","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8"],"b":["815","805","825","845","835","855","865","875","865"],"i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"903"},"Various embodiments described herein relate to metal catalyst nanoparticles, methods for making the catalyst nanoparticles, and methods of using the catalyst nanoparticles to make single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes.
