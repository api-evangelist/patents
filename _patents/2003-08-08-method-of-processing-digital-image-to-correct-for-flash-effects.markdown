title: Method of processing digital image to correct for flash effects
abstract: An image captured by a digital camera with a flash is processed by locating distortions of said captured image due to said flash such as “red-eye” effects and removing them. The process includes the steps of determining if the flash is on (step ), if so, determining any faces within the captured image (step ), locating eyes within said faces (step ), determining if “red-eye” removal is required (step ), and if so, correcting for such effects (step ) and storing corrected image (step ) in a memory device of the digital camera.

present invention relates to an image processing method and apparatus and, in particular, discloses a process for correcting for flash induced distortions in a Digital Image Camera.","The present invention further relates to the field of digital image processing and in particular, the field of processing of images taken via a digital camera.","Recently, digital cameras have become increasingly popular. These cameras normally operate by means of imaging a desired image utilising a charge coupled device (CCD) array and storing the imaged scene on an electronic storage medium for later down loading onto a computer system for subsequent manipulation and printing out. Normally, when utilising a computer system to print out an image, sophisticated software may be available to manipulate the image in accordance with requirements.","Unfortunately such systems require significant post processing of a captured image and normally present the image in an orientation in which it was taken, relying on the post processing process to perform any necessary or required modifications of the captured image. Further, much of the environmental information available when the picture was taken is lost.","It is an object of the present invention to utilise flash information in a digital image camera for processing digital images.","In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of processing an image captured utilising a digital camera and a flash said method comprising the steps of:","(a) locating distortions of said captured image due to the utilisation of said flash;","(b) retouching said image so as to locally reduce the effect of said distortions.","In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention there is provided a digital camera having reduced flash distortion effects on captured images comprising;","(a) a digital image capture means for the capture of images;","(b) a distortion location means for locating flash induced colour distortions in the captured image; and","(c) image correction means connected to said distortion location means and said digital image capture means and adapted to process said captured image to reduce the effects of said distortions;","(d) display means connected to said image correction means for displaying said captured image having reduced flash distortion effects.","The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in patent application having applicant's reference (ART01) U.S. Ser. No. 09\/113,060 filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference.","The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an \u201cArtcam\u201d type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit. Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power in an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.","As disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 09\/113,060 (issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,750,901), the Artcards contain, on one surface encoded information and on the other surface. contain an image distorted by the particular effect produced by the Artcard. The Artcard is inserted in an Artcard reader in the side of camera and, upon insertion, results in an output image being distorted in the same manner as the distortion appearing on the surface of Artcard.","One important form of processing is the removal of \u201cred-eye\u201d effects that can result in captured images as result of utilisation of a flash.","Turning now to , in the preferred embodiment, the image  as originally captured by the CCD device is subject to a processing step  when a flash has been utilised so as to produce a processed output image for printing.","Turning now to , there is illustrated in more detail, one particular image processing algorithm  which can be utilised when a flash has been utilised in capturing an image by a CCD device. The algorithm is preferably only utilised when a flash was used  to take the picture captured by the CCD. The purpose of the algorithm is to reduce the image effects due to the utilisation of the flash. Such image effects can include the well known \u201cred-eye\u201d effect of individual eyes appearing red in a photographic image. Other effects such as flash reflections off reflective surfaces can also be separately processed utilising other algorithms. The first step  in eliminating red-eye effects in the images is to determine the faces within the image. The face detection process  can proceed by detecting regions of contiguous colour which map the hue, saturation and value (HSV) of the range of human face colours under the range of normal lighting encountered after any other applied image enhancements or hue corrections. The detected regions can then be passed through various heuristic tests including determining the presence of eyes, mouth, overall shape and overlap. The heuristic tests produce a resulting probability of a face being present in the image and where this is above a threshold, a face is determined to be located in the image.","Once a face has been determined within an image, the eyes are located within the face in step . Each eye in step  is then independently processed to determine its special range of colours so as determine whether a red-eye removal process is required in step .","If the red-eye removal process  is required, a retouching algorithm  is applied to the eye area so as to reduce the red saturation whilst simultaneously not introducing any discontinuities or likely artefacts in the output image. Of course, many different techniques could be utilised including a form of gaussian alteration around a central point of the eye. Finally, the image is written in step  in its updated form, back to the memory device of the ACP.","Preferably, any other retouching algorithms including remapping colours affected by the spectral nature of the flashlight are also utilised at this time.","Alternatively, the Artcard inserted could have a number of manipulations applied to the image which are specific to the flash setting. For example, clip arts containing candles, light globes etc could be inserted in an image utilising a flash and large suns inserted in non-flash images.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which match the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Relation Applications.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below.
