According to these related-art techniques, firstly, the value N of the numerator of the frequency division ratio is cumulatively added at each cycle of the input clock signal. Next, if the addition result becomes larger than the value M of the denominator of the frequency division ratio, the value M is subtracted from the cumulative addition result. By performing these operations, and then appropriately masking (thinning out) clock pulses of the input clock signal by referring to the cumulative addition result, the related-art technique realizes a rational-number frequency division.","A specific example of the problem that occurs in the above-described clock frequency divider circuit in the related art is explained with reference to .  is an example of semiconductor integrated circuit using a clock frequency divider circuit in the related art.  shows the operation of the clock frequency divider circuit in the related art.","As shown in , a clock frequency divider circuit  in the related art generates a clock B by dividing the frequency of a clock S by a rational number based on input frequency division ratio setting. A circuit A (circuit at the other end) and a circuit B (target circuit) communicate with each other through signals Aout and Bout. The signal Aout is output by the circuit A at a timing of a clock A and is received by the circuit B at a timing of a clock B. The signal Bout is output by the circuit B at a timing of the clock B and is received by the circuit A at a timing of the clock A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["3","8","11","0","11"]},"In this example, assume that the frequency of the clock A is one third of that of the clock S. That is, the frequency division ratio of the clock A to the clock S is 1\/3 (=4\/12). Note that the phase relation between the clock A and the clocks B makes a full circle in twelve cycles of the clock S. The timings of the twelve cycles, in which the phase relation makes a full circle, are represented by \u201cT\u201d to \u201cT\u201d.","Assume also that the circuit A and the circuit B communicate with each other at the timings T, T, T and T, which correspond to all the rising edge timings of the clock A. That is, the circuit A outputs the signal Aout and receives the signal Bout at the timings T, T, T and T, which are the rising edge timings of the clock A and are the communication timings.","However, the above-described clock frequency divider circuit in the related art does not give any consideration to the communication with circuits using clocks having different frequencies. Therefore, the clock frequency divider circuit in the related art could generate the clock B by masking clock pulses of the clock S at these communication timings. In the case of example shown in , the clock frequency divider circuit generates some of the clocks B by masking a clock pulse of the clock S at the timing T, T and\/or T among the communication timings.","Specifically, at the timing T, the clock pulse is masked for the frequency division ratios 9\/12 (), 6\/12 (), and 5\/12 (). Similarly, at the timing T, the clock pulse is masked for the frequency division ratio 5\/12 (). Similarly, at the timing T, the clock pulse is masked for the frequency division ratios 7\/12 (), 6\/12 (), and 5\/12 ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-45507","Patent literature 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2006-148807"]}},"If the clock pulse of the clock S is masked at the communication timing to generate the clock B as in the case of the above-described example, the circuit B operating by the clock B cannot receive a signal output to the signal Aout by the circuit A operating by the clock A at an expected timing. Similarly, the circuit B operating by the clock B cannot output a signal to the signal Bout at the timing that is expected by the circuit A operating by the clock A.","Therefore, in the above-described clock frequency divider circuit in the related art, communication with a circuit operating by a clock having a different frequency requires a special clock transfer circuit and\/or special timing design to realize an expected proper communication operation. As a result, there are problems that the communication performance deteriorates, and that the power consumption, circuit size, and design cost increase.","The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problems, and an object thereof is to provide a clock frequency divider circuit that generates a clock signal that makes it possible to perform an expected proper communication operation in communication with a circuit operating by a clock having a different frequency, and a clock frequency division method.","A clock frequency divider circuit in accordance with the present invention is a clock frequency divider circuit that generates an output clock signal obtained by dividing a frequency of an input clock signal into N\/M (N is a positive integer and M is a positive integer greater than N) by masking (M-N) clock pulses among M clock pulses of the input clock signal based on a frequency division ratio defined as N\/M, the clock frequency divider circuit including: a mask control circuit including: a mask timing signal generation circuit that generates a mask timing signal used to preferentially masks a clock pulse at a timing other than a communication timing of data communication performed by a target circuit using the output clock signal among M clock pulses of the input clock signal based on a communication timing signal indicating the communication timing;

An example case where the frequency division ratio denominator M=12; the frequency division ratio numerator N=11 to 4; and the clock B is generated by dividing the frequency of the clock S at 11\/12 to 4\/12 is explained hereinafter.","The clock S, the clock A, and the frequency division ratio setting information  are input to the clock frequency divider circuit . The frequency division ratio setting information  is a signal indicating a frequency division ratio N\/M of the clock B to the clock S, and a frequency division ratio C\/M of the clock A to the clock S.","The clock S is a signal composed of successive clock pulses having a predetermined frequency.
