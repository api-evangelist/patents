The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Photon-phonon coupling through guided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is finding application in numerous technology fields such as tailorable slow light, radio frequency (RF)-photonic signal processing, narrow-line-width laser sources, RF-waveform synthesis, optical frequency comb generation, etc. Realization of this form of travelling-wave photon-phonon coupling in a silicon-based and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor)-compatible platform can enable high-performance signal-processing applications through nanoscale Brillouin interactions. Nanoscale modal confinement can enhance non-linear lightmatter interactions within silicon waveguides and in nanooptomechanics. For instance, tight optical confinement in nanoscale silicon waveguides can be responsible for greatly enhanced Raman and Kerr non-linearities, and for new sensing, actuation and transduction mechanisms based on optical forces within nano-optomechanical systems.","The field of cavity optomechanics has produced a wide variety of systems with enhanced and controllable forms of photon-phonon coupling. Specifically, silicon (Si)-based cavityoptomechanical systems have enabled powerful new forms of quantum state transfer, slow light, phonon lasers and optomechanical ground-state cooling. Such cavity systems exploit resonantly enhanced coupling between discrete photonic and phononic modes. As a fundamental complement to cavity systems, guided-wave Brillouin processes can produce coupling between a continuum of photon and phonon modes for a host of wideband (e.g., 0.1-34 GHz) RF and photonic signal-processing applications. For example, travelling-wave Brillouin processes have enabled unique schemes for optical pulse compression, pulse and waveform synthesis, coherent frequency comb generation, variable bandwidth optical amplifiers, reconfigurable filters and coherent beam-combining schemes. Although there are numerous applications and opportunities for chip-scale Brillouin technologies, the ability for conventional systems to achieve Brillouin processes in silicon nanophotonics has proven difficult; strong Brillouin nonlinearities require large optical forces and tight confinement of both phonons and photons, conditions that are not met in conventional Si waveguides.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Various exemplary embodiments presented herein relate to photon-phonon coupling through a guided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering. In an exemplary embodiment an apparatus is presented, the apparatus comprising a suspended membrane, whereby at least one optical waveguiding member is included in the membrane and at least partially extensive in a longitudinal optical propagation direction. The apparatus further comprising at least one phononic resonator defined in the membrane, extensive in said longitudinal direction, and traversed by the optical waveguiding member.","Another exemplary embodiment is presented comprising a method for forming photon-phonon coupling waveguide device, the method comprising depositing an insulating layer on a substrate whereupon a waveguiding member is subsequently formed on the insulating layer. A membrane layer can be deposited on the insulating layer and on the waveguiding member such that the deposited membrane layer abuts and overlies the waveguiding member. The method further comprising removing such of the membrane layer as overlies the waveguiding member. The membrane layer can be patterned so as to define therein at least one longitudinally extensive phononic resonator traversed by the waveguiding member. The method further comprising removing at least a portion of the insulating layer that underlies the membrane layer, including such portion as underlies the longitudinally extensive phononic resonator or resonators.","A further exemplary embodiment for photon-phonon coupling in a waveguide device can comprise a method which can include injecting a first optical pulse and a second optical pulse into a waveguide core, wherein the waveguide core is supported on a membrane, the first pulse and the second pulse combining to facilitate creation of one or more phonons, the phonon propagating through the membrane in a direction transverse to an optical direction of the waveguide core and the propagating of the phonon causing amplification of the second pulse.","The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein.

It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and\/or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Various technologies are presented herein relating to photon-phonon coupling through a guided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects.

The various structures can simultaneously guide photons and phonons in a suspended membrane. By utilizing a suspended membrane, it is possible to eliminate a substrate pathway for loss of phonons that suppresses SBS in conventional silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. Consequently, forward-SBS nonlinear susceptibilities are achievable with a Brillouin non-linear coefficient that is more than about 3000 times greater than achievable with a conventional waveguide system. Owing to the strong phonon-photon coupling achievable with the various embodiments herein, potential application for the various embodiments presented herein cover a range of radiofrequency (RF) and photonic signal processing applications, including pulse compression, pulse and waveform synthesis, coherent frequency comb generation, optical amplification, optical filtration, coherent beam combining, etc. Further, the various embodiments presented herein are applicable to applications operating over a wide bandwidth, e.g. 100 MHz to 50 GHz or more.","Further presented herein is experimental data related to measuring the Brillouin nonlinearity of a waveguide, whereby pump radiation at 1556 nm was intensity modulated at a variable RF frequency \u03a9\/2 to produce two sidebands respectively upshifted and downshifted by the RF frequency. The modulated pump radiation was mixed with probe radiation at 1536 nm and injected into the waveguide. Interference between the sidebands at the beat frequency \u03a9 produced Stokes and anti-Stokes shifted probe radiation by forward-SBS at values of \u03a9 that correspond to phononic resonances. The waveguide output was filtered to remove the pump radiation, and the frequency-shifted probe radiation was measured in a heterodyne detector that combined the filtered waveguide output with a local oscillator signal produced by imposing a small frequency offset on a tapped-off portion of the 1536-nm probe radiation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-4","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-4"],"b":["100","100","100","130","140","100","100","170","180","100","110","120","160","120","140","140","150","155","170","180","130"]},"Any suitable material can be utilized for the respective structural elements comprising waveguide device .

Slots  and  can be further utilized to effectively operate as a reflector of acoustic waves having wavevectors substantially transverse (e.g., direction P) to an optical propagation direction (e.g., direction O).

Such an effect can be a result of the interference between the co-propagating pump and Stokes waves. In an embodiment, the interference yields modulated energy density and force density distributions that propagate along the waveguide at the group velocity (\u03bd) of light. As this travelling-force distribution drives photon-phonon coupling, only phonons with phase velocities (\u03a9\/K) matching the group velocity (\u03bd) of light can produce efficient coupling (e.g., as presented as circles in ). These ultra-high phase-velocity-guided phonon modes (e.g., of about 10ms) have corresponding guided phonon group velocities (\u2202\u03a9\/\u2202K) that are exceedingly slow (\u02dc1 ms), but are non-zero.","The displacement field associated with each of the phase-matched Brillouin-active guided wave modes, m=1-7, are shown in . Labeling of each mode (e.g., m=1, m=2, . . . m=7) is according to the mode index identified in . Further, the right half membrane region  of each displacement field is shown in each of . The symmetric force distributions, as presented in , permit coupling of photons in the waveguide core  to phonons with symmetric displacement fields about the waveguide core . Hence, it can be considered that the membrane regions  will undergo the same effects as the illustrated modes of . Periodic boundary conditions can be applied to the z-normal faces of the simulations to facilitate computation of the displacement fields of the phase-matched phonon modes presented in  and the corresponding phonon-dispersion curves in . Although these guided elastic modes can exhibit some flexural character, the vast majority of the modal potential energy can be ascribed to in-plane elastic compression (e.g., , directions x-z). The compressive character of these slow group velocity-guided modes can be most clearly seen in the high frequency limit, as demonstrated by the displacement fields of , m=6, and , m=7. For small K-values, the z-component of the phonon displacement field can become much smaller than the x-component. Moreover, in the limiting case where the waveguide possesses vertical symmetry (e.g., , where t=h), then the Brillouin-active modes can converge to symmetric Lamb waves with nearly identical dispersion curves to those presented in . , is a representation of an optical wave vector mismatch, \u0394k, produced by the dispersion of the optical waveguide mode, \u03c9(k), as pump and Stokes waves are detuned. Accordingly, the waves can be classified as symmetric Lamb waves, producing equal frequency spacing of the phase-matched Brillouin modes, as shown in .","Full-vectorial multi-physics simulations based on waveguide device  were performed and conveyed the elastic wave motion for seven characteristic Brillouin-active phonon modes. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the z-normal faces of the simulation domains of  to facilitate capture of the nature of a respective travelling-wave for the guided phonons at the phase-matched K-values identified in . Accordingly,  present seven characteristic Brillouin-active phonon modes, m=1-7 at respective frequencies 1.28, 3.72, 6.18 GHz, etc. As previously mentioned, in an aspect, the phonon modes presented in  can be considered corresponding to symmetric Lamb waves.","Based upon the foregoing, a waveguide device  was formed with a series of 26 reflector pairs (e.g., 26 pairs of slots  and ) along the path traversed by an optical waveguide , to facilitate formation of a Brillouin-active length of 3.3 mm in a total device length of 4.9 mm. In an aspect, a 3.3 mm Brillouin-active device length coincides with a total non-linear phase mismatch, |\u0394K|\u00b7L, of between 0.45 and 5.7 radian for the range of Brillouin-active modes presented in . In an embodiment, each suspended waveguide section (e.g., a length of waveguide core  that has an adjacent slot  and ) is separated by a 25 \u03bcm anchored (or unsuspended) region, as indicated by , region M. In an embodiment, waveguide device  produces a significant non-linear phase mismatch along its length. Hence, the various embodiments relating to waveguide device  can be treated as a phase-matched travelling-wave process to facilitate describing the coherent addition of non-linearities along the entire length of the waveguide  in waveguide device .","A plurality of waveguide devices  have been studied with waveguide widths, w, ranging from 0.8-3.8 mm, which produced a range of Brillouin resonances over a frequency range of 1-18 GHz. As an optical group velocity, \u03bd, changes by only a few percent over a 30-nm wavelength range, the optical phase mismatch (with values, |\u0394K|\u00b7L\u22662\u03c0) can have negligible change over an appreciable wavelength range. Accordingly, the same guided phonon can be excited by continuum of different wavelengths within the waveguide device , even though the waveguide device  can operate as a phase-matched non-linear process. Such operation enables waveguide device  to operate with pump and probe waves of disparate wavelengths to couple to each other through the Brillouin-active modes of a single waveguide device .","To facilitate further understanding,  presents data derived from testing of a waveguide device , wherein, as previously mentioned, the waveguide device  was formed to comprise 26 reflector pairs (e.g., slots  and ) along the path traversed by an optical waveguide , to facilitate formation of a Brillouin-active length of 3.3 mm in a total device length of 4.9 mm. Experimental studies of a Brillouin non-linearity were performed with a heterodyne FWM apparatus, facilitating direct measurement of the third-order non-linear susceptibility. During the FWM experiments, a modulated pump signal (e.g., 1,556 nm) and continuous-wave probe signal (e.g., 1,536 nm) are injected into a waveguide  of waveguide device . The modulated pump signal can drive the excitation of Brillouin-active phonons over a wide range of frequencies as the pump modulation frequency is swept through a range of values. The non-linear response of the waveguide device  can be subsequently analyzed by heterodyne measurement of optical tones imprinted on the disparate probe wavelength as a result of a coherent combination of the Brillouin and third-order electronic non-linear susceptibilities (e.g., through FWM). Any signal sidebands can then be analyzed as distinct RF tones through heterodyne interferometry. Such an approach enables the Stokes and anti-Stokes signatures to be resolved separately.","As presented in , signatures showing a non-linear Brillouin response can be observed by measuring an intensity of non-linearly induced sidebands imprinted on a probe signal, as the frequency of a pump modulation signal was swept from 1 to 18 GHz. The spectra in  were obtained by integrating the RF power produced by heterodyne detection of a probe signal (including both Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands) over a discrete set of high-frequency RF bands using RF filters. To remove the frequency dependence of the detection system and to more clearly exhibit the sharp Brillouin resonances, the spectra in  were normalized to those of an identical optical waveguide without a Brillouin-active region. Each waveguide produces a series of regularly spaced Brillouin resonances analogous to those identified in .","Owing, in part, to a spatial symmetry of the optical force distribution, only phonon modes with even displacement symmetry, with respect to the waveguide core , produce efficient Brillouin coupling. A total of 17 resonances are presented in , where each respective resonance from , , . . . , , . . . , is connected by mode order plots, where: plot  is mode m=1, plot  is mode m=2, plot  is mode m=3, plot  is mode m=4, plot  is mode m=5, plot  is mode m=6, and plot  is mode m=7, to indicate the mode order of each phononic resonance as the Brillouin spectrum shifts with waveguide dimension.","As shown in , four waveguide devices  are presented with respective waveguide dimension width d, where plot  d=0.8 \u03bcm, plot  d=1.8 \u03bcm, plot  d=2.8 \u03bcm, and plot  d=3.8 \u03bcm, where width d is the phononic distance between two opposite slits (e.g., slits  and ), as shown in . The 17 resonances are observed as the frequency is swept between 1 and 18 GHz.","As shown, plots - are also simulated mode frequencies over the range of device dimensions, and good agreement occurs between the observed resonances and the anticipated values (e.g., an anticipated value occurring where a mode plot - intersects a waveguide dimension plot -).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":"2420"},"With further reference to the resonance signatures presented in , a Fano-like line shape can be seen to be produced by each Brillouin resonance, from which the magnitude of the Brillouin non-linear coefficient, \u03b3, can be obtained. The Fano-like line shape can be seen in the high-resolution spectral scans of , which show the line shape of a characteristic Brillouin resonance (f=6.185 GHz, with d=3.8 \u03bcm) decomposed into its Stokes (e.g., ) and anti-Stokes (e.g., ) components. The data presented was obtained by spectrally resolving distinct heterodyne tones of the Stokes and anti-Stokes signals using a high-resolution RF spectrum analyzer as the pump modulation frequency was swept from about 6.16 GHz to about 6.2 GHz. The asymmetric line shapes shown in plots  and  result from the coherent interference between the Brillouin and electronic Kerr non-linearities of the waveguide device . Involvement of electronic Kerr non-linearities at the Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies can occur due to cross-phase modulation between a pump beam and a probe beam propagating in the silicon waveguide core .","To facilitate determination of the magnitude of the Brillouin nonlinear coefficient, \u03b3, relative to the intrinsic Kerr non-linear coefficient \u03b3and the non-linear free-carrier dispersion coefficient \u03b3from the data presented in , , and , non-linear coupled amplitude equations were formulated to derive the functional form of the Stokes and anti-Stokes line shapes. The equations are presented herein as Eqns. 1a-7 below, accompanied with explanatory text.","Owing to SBS being a resonant effect, a SBS non-linear coefficient can form a Lorentzian line shape centred about each Brillouin-active phonon mode. In contrast, the electronic Kerr non-linearities are nonresonant at 1,550 nm wavelengths, yielding a frequency-independent non-linear coefficient. As is known in the art, the frequency-dependent interference between the Kerr and Brillouin effects can produce the asymmetric (e.g., Fano-like) line shape, as shown in plots  and . However, it should be noted that the experimental arrangement utilized to measure the values presented in  is distinct, leading to a different set of coupled amplitude equations. In addition, non-linearly generated free carriers in Si can be responsible for the dissimilar line shapes of the Stokes and anti-Stokes orders, and a larger nonlinear background for frequencies below 2 GHz under the experimental conditions utilized herein. As the free-carrier effects roll off at high frequency, the Kerr responses at 16 GHz are used as a reference to determine the magnitude of the Brillouin non-linear coefficient.","On the basis of the coupled amplitude model described with reference to Eqns. 1a-7, the magnitude of the Brillouin non-linear coefficient, \u03b3, can be extracted from the experimental line shape of both the Stokes and anti-Stokes signatures of each resonance of the waveguide device  having a width d=3.8 \u03bcm.","Seven resonances, spanning frequencies from 1.28 to 16.30 GHz, are shown in . The peak value of |\u03b3|\/|\u03b3| and the phononic Q-factor of each resonance extracted from experiments (including separately resolved Stokes and anti-Stokes signatures) are shown  respectively. The peak value of the Brillouin non-linear coefficient at 1.28 GHz is found to be 6.18 times larger than the Kerr non-linear coefficient of the waveguide (or |\u03b3|\/|\u03b3|=6.18).","From the established non-linearities of Si, |\u03b3| of 188\u00b134 Wmwere determined for a waveguide device  with w=[1.8, 2.8, 3.8] \u03bcm (per Eqns. 1-7 herein). From this relative measurement, the Brillouin non-linear coefficient is found to be |\u03b3|\u22451.164\u00b1244 Wmover the Brillouin-active region of the waveguide device . Moreover, as the Brillouin non-linear coefficient is related to the Brillouin gain as 2 |\u03b3|=G, this nonlinearity corresponds to a forward SBS gain of G\u22452,328\u00b1488 Wm.","It is to be noted that much of the \u00b118% and \u00b121% uncertainty assigned to |\u03b3| and |\u03b3| values, respectively, can arise from the (\u00b115%) uncertainty in the measured value of the Kerr non-linearity for silicon. Despite the fact that this non-linear response is the aggregate of an ensemble of 26 distinct Brillouin-active suspended regions fabricated along the length of the waveguide device  as previously described, high mechanical Q-factors (\u02dc1,000) are produced for phonon frequencies of about 1.28 to about 16.3 GHz.","For comparison with experiments, full vectorial three-dimensional multi-physics simulations were performed through coupled optical force and elastic wave finite element analysis and simulation models. The distinct contributions of ES forces (plot , orange), radiation pressure (plot , blue) and thermoelastic expansion to the total SBS nonlinear coefficient (plot , black) are shown in  for each phonon resonance mode m=1-7. A fixed mechanical Q-factor of Q=1,000 is assumed. Note that negligible contribution to the Brillouin coupling is produced by thermoelastic response at these GHz frequencies due to, at least in part, the slow thermal time constant of this system (for further details, refer to Eqns. 1-7 and accompanying text). The magnitude of the Brillouin coefficient, |\u03b3|, scales quadratically with optical force, yielding a non-linear addition of the radiation pressure and electrostrictively induced couplings to the overall Brillouin gain as shown in . The total Brillouin non-linearity, which is almost exclusively driven by radiation pressure and electrostriction, slowly decreases with increasing resonant frequency as further shown in .","A larger variation in Brillouin non-linearity is seen from the experimental data (e.g., circles of ) than from simulations (e.g., , black bars of ) due to the variation of the measured phononic Q with frequency (per ). However, when the frequency dependence of measured Q-factors is included in simulations (per ), good agreement between simulations and experiments are obtained over the entire frequency range, per the green bars and the circles of .","Both the highly localized electrostriction and radiation pressure force distributions within a waveguide core  yield a frequency dependent Brillouin gain (as shown in ) exhibiting a significant departure from conventional backwards SBS processes involving bulk acoustic waves. In contrast to the rapid 1\/\u03a9 roll off of Brillouin gain with phonon frequency found through backward SBS, the experimental (and simulated) Q-factor normalized Brillouin coefficient varies by less than 40% in magnitude over the entire 1-16 GHz frequency range.","Unlike conventional systems where the overlap between the optical force distribution and the phonon mode profile is largely frequency independent, the complex double-lobed spatial force distributions in the core of the silicon waveguide  can produce a frequency dependent overlap with various phonon modes, reshaping the frequency dependence of Brillouin coupling. The effect of spatial force distribution on the frequency dependence of coupling can be seen by comparing the computed contributions of electrostriction and radiation pressure to the Brillouin gain of . Although the radiation pressure contribution diminishes quite rapidly with frequency, the ES component varies by only a few percent over the 1-16 GHz frequency range. The higher bandwidth of ES coupling can result from the higher spatial frequencies of the ES force distribution. Consequently, the relatively flat Brillouin gain produces efficient photon-phonon coupling over an unprecedented frequency range.","The magnitude and frequency dependence of the measured Brillouin coupling, and the good agreement with simulations, all provide strong evidence of the important role of both electrostriction and radiation pressure within the waveguide devices formed in accord with the various embodiments presented herein.","The series of Brillouin resonances generated by a waveguide device  having d=3.8 \u03bcm can provide insight into the bandwidth and frequency dependence of the Brillouin coupling.","However, a larger overall Brillouin non-linearity can be achieved with a higher degree of phonon confinement, that is, for smaller values of d.  shows the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectral line shapes obtained by through-measurement of the d=0.8 \u03bcm waveguide device . In contrast to the d=3.8 \u03bcm device, several sharp spectral features, consistent with high Q-factor (Q\u02dc1,500) phononic resonances, are observed within the central Brillouin line shape, suggesting significant inhomogeneous broadening which may be due to fabrication non-uniformities.","A fit of the aggregate Brillouin line shape using a single Lorentzian oscillator model yields is seen in , yielding Gand Q-values of G\u22454,150\u00b1872 Wmand Q\u2245280. However, uncertainty in the form of inhomogeneously broadened line shape made it difficult to obtain a high confidence estimate of the Brillouin non-linearity in this case, prompting exploration for Brillouin non-linearities through direct measurement of Brillouin gain.","Experimental studies of Brillouin gain were performed by injecting strong pump and weak signal fields into a Brillouin-active waveguide (w=0.8 \u03bcm). A low spectral-intensity amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) probe signal (centre wavelength: 1,552.94 nm; bandwidth: 50 GHz) was used in conjunction with a high-intensity pump laser (\u03bb=1,552.723 nm or \u03bb=1,553.158 nm) to perform Brillouin gain measurements about the Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies, respectively. The spectral power density of the ASE signal beam was measured by monitoring the heterodyne interference between the pump and signal fields with a receiver and a RF spectrum analyzer (SA) for frequencies about the Brillouin resonance (e.g., v=5.68 GHz).","The transmitted ASE power spectral density for higher pump powers are normalized to the power spectral density at lower pump powers (e.g., about 2.6 mW) to observe the power-dependent form of the Stokes and anti-Stokes line shapes. The normalized Stokes and anti-Stokes transmittances for P=12, 14 and 20 mW are shown in  respectively. The finer structure produced by inhomogeneous broadening is not visible owing to the smaller signal-to-noise ratio obtained by this method.","Lorentzian fits of the Stokes and anti-Stokes line shapes yield a Q-factor of approximately 300, indicating significant inhomogeneous broadening. As the anti-Stokes process involves transfer of energy from the signal to the pump beam, the anti-Stokes signature (as shown, e.g., in ) exhibits depletion instead of gain as shown in .","In , theoretical line fitting curves are indicated in conjunction with experimental data, presented in the form of circles. In the small signal limit, which is explored in the experiments, the SBS gain is proportional to the pump power, and the amplification (and also depletion) at resonant center frequency is linear with the pump power as shown in . A total effective forward SBS gain of G\u22452,750\u00b11,200 Wmwas extracted by fitting the data in . This measurement also shows good agreement with the simulated value of Brillouin gain, G\u22452,750\u00b1540 Wm. It is to be noted that the derived values for Brillouin gain are more than a factor of 10 larger than those obtained by treating the Brillouin non-linearities of Si as a bulk medium property, which accordingly, provides strong evidence of the role of boundaries in shaping non-linearity at sub-wavelength scales.","The previously presented measurements demonstrate a gain coefficient that is over 1,000 times larger than forward SBS obtainable in a conventional system such as waveguide fibers, and several times larger than the Raman gain produced by Si, making Brillouin non-linearities the dominant third-order non-linearity in the waveguide device , in accord with the various embodiments herein.","In accord with the various embodiments presented herein, travelling-wave Brillouin non-linearities and Brillouin gain in waveguide device  through a novel class of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides are further described. Through quantitative measurements, forward SBS non-linear susceptibilities were measured to be more than one thousand times stronger than a conventional waveguide system. Multi-physics simulations reveal that this strong photon-phonon coupling is produced by a constructive combination of ES forces and radiation pressures at the nanoscale. The emergence of large radiation pressure-induced couplings represents a new form of boundary-induced Brillouin non-linearity and a new regime of boundary-mediated Brillouin coupling that arises in subwavelength structures.","The embodiments presented herein enable independent control of phononic modes and optomechanical driving forces to yield tailorable Brillouin coupling over exceptionally wide bandwidths. Simultaneous coupling to numerous transverse phonon modes yields a relatively flat Brillouin gain over this entire 1-18 GHz frequency range. Further, structural tuning of phononic resonances from 1 to 18 GHz with high-quality factor (41,000) yields tailorable non-linear optical susceptibilities due to the coherent interference of Kerr and Brillouin effects.","Further, the various embodiments presented herein indicate a wideband nature of the photon-phonon coupling results from the highly localized optical forces produced within the nanoscale waveguide device . The wideband and high-frequency (1.g., about 18 GHz) characteristics can be achieved without a requirement for ultra-high resolution lithography, significantly extending the frequency range of chip-scale photon-phonon coupling over conventional cavity optomechanical technologies.","Efficient coupling between a continuum of optical and phononic modes through such chip-scale travelling-wave Brillouin processes facilitates application in a range of technologies utilizing wideband signal-processing capabilities with CMOS-compatible silicon photonics, including pulse compression, pulse and waveform synthesis, coherent frequency comb generation, variable bandwidth optical amplifiers and filters, and coherent beam-combining schemes. Travelling-wave Brillouin non-linearities can also produce optical phase conjugation and opto-acoustic isolators for application in reducing signal distortion and eliminating parasitic reflection on silicon chips. In addition, the highly controllable nature of the phonons emitted by the waveguide devices presented herein operating as a hybrid photonic-phononic system can facilitate forms of coherent information transduction through travelling-wave processes that are complementary to conventional cavity optomechanical systems.","As efficient Brillouin-based photon-phonon conversion is possible over wide bandwidths (>20 GHz), and the Brillouin-emitted phonons can be guided and manipulated on chip, hybridization of Brillouin device physics with silicon photonics, CMOS and microelectromechanical systems can provide a host of new coherent signal-processing technologies.","It is to be appreciated that the dimensions and frequency bands presented above are to be understood as merely exemplary and not limiting. For example, the spacing of the air slots  and  may be as small as the width of the optical waveguide , and may be as great as 20 \u03bcm or more, as may be permitted by the mechanical strength of the membrane . In an aspect, degradation in the resonant behavior of the phononic resonators does not appear to be a limiting factor, as the quality factor of the resonator is only weakly dependent, if at all, on the width of the resonator. Hence, device  and similarly formed devices, can be effective over a bandwidth as great as 100 MHz to 50 GHz, or even more. Further, the optical waveguide device  can be fabricated with a width d of 2.0 \u03bcm, or higher.","As previously mentioned, membrane  can act to confine the generated phonons. As shown in the phase matching diagrams of , a forward-SBS process phase-matches to phonons with a vanishing longitudinal wave-vector (i.e. slow group-velocity guided phonon states). Hence, at least for certain applications, it might be necessary to engineer high Q-factor phononic resonances that support modes of large transverse wave-vector (i.e. perpendicular to the waveguide). High Q-factor phononic resonances can be achieved by truncating the membrane  on either side of the waveguide  with etched air-slots  and  (e.g., of dimension 2\u00d7100 \u03bcm), per the structure shown in . The slots  and  can act to reflect acoustic waves, which can further define the extended phonon modes. This geometry, which can be termed, produces efficient photon-phonon coupling over a series of discrete phononic resonances between 1-18 GHz, through a traveling-wave forward-SBS process.","Numerous variations on the layout described above with reference to waveguide device  are possible and are considered to fall within the scope of the various embodiments presented herein. For example, the air slots  and  may be replaced by reflective features of other kinds One such alternate reflective feature is a phononic crystal, defined, e.g., by a two-dimensional array of holes etched through the membrane. Another alternate type of reflective feature is a Bragg grating.  presents a waveguide device , where the slotted reflectors of device  are replaced with an array of holes  and  (e.g., a pair of phononic crystals) located on either side of a waveguide core . Holes  and  can be formed in a membrane layer  which can be formed over a cavity , which has been formed in an insulating layer  on a substrate . As per device , the respective components of device  can be formed from materials such as Si (e.g., substrate  and waveguide core ), SiO(e.g., insulating layer ) and SiN(e.g., membrane ).","In an aspect, compared with a slot reflector (e.g., slots  and ) device, a device formed with phononic crystal mirrors (hole arrays  and ) can facilitate controllable (tailored) leakage (or coupling of energy) from a waveguide core (e.g., waveguide core ). The controllable leakage (e.g., across a resonance frequency range of about 1-20 GHz) can facilitate resonant transfer of information (or phonons) between waveguides in the absence of optical energy transfer. Further, phononic crystal waveguides  can be fabricated with longer phononic resonator regions than can be formed with a slot waveguide device. This can eliminate the problem of anchoring losses for the phonons which occurs with slot waveguide devices (e.g., as can occur at region ).","In other embodiments, the reflective features  and  of device  can have a disposition that is not symmetric about the optical waveguide . For example, as shown in , a pair of optical waveguides  and  can be formed in a waveguide device . Waveguides  and  can be disposed parallel to each other and sufficiently near each other to be optically coupled, whereby the coupling can be by a phononic region  located between waveguides  and . Accordingly, rather than optical-cross talk coupling the waveguides  and , the coupling is phononic.","In a conventional approach, if two signals are transmitted down a single waveguide, undesirable cross-talk can occur between the two signal wavelengths owing to non-linearities that may be present. Such an undesirable interaction can occur in Si waveguides. However, by utilizing two separate waveguides  and , each respective signal in each waveguide can communicate with the other signal via the phonons. Accordingly, a pure communication can occur between the two waveguides  and , with narrow resonances available through which the waveguides  and  can transfer information.","In an embodiment, the dual waveguide device  is amenable to narrow acoustic or phononic resonance which can act as an optical filter as the resonances can be in the order of 1 MHz wide. Such narrow or acoustic resonance can be particularly useful for radio frequency signal processing and filtering.","In an illustrative scenario, a pump signal Pis injected into waveguide  in conjunction with a modulated information signal Mwhich carries the signal information. Accordingly, Pand Mcan beat together, with the information in Mbeing transduced as a function of the beat note. In the second waveguide , a continuous light beam Scan be injected. As light beam Spasses through the waveguide , side bands can be developed, whereby the sidebands can be affected by the transduction, originating in waveguide , and being carried over region . Accordingly, information comprising Mcan be carried over to the Sbeam leading to Sbeing modified to a beam SM, whereby SMincludes information transferred over from M.","In another embodiment, a waveguide device can be formed with confocal resonators. For example, as shown in , a waveguide device  can be formed comprising a pair of confocal resonators  and  formed in membrane . Accordingly, the confocal resonators  and  can act to focus phonons at a central region  located in resonator regions  and  operating adjacent to waveguide core .","In further embodiments, phononic resonators as described above can be traversed by an optical waveguide that is curved and not straight. For example, a Brillouin laser may include an optical resonator that consists of an optical waveguide conformed in a closed curve such as a circle, dimensioned to resonate at a Stokes-shifted or anti-Stokes-shifted pump frequency, and disposed on a path that traverses one or more phononic resonators. When excited by pump radiation introduced, e.g., by optical coupling from an adjacent waveguide, the optical resonator may exhibit gain at the resonant frequency, thus producing amplified Stokes or anti-Stokes radiation. Similar arrangements may serve as optical amplifiers, optical filters, and the like. For example, a Brillouin waveguide can facilitate amplifying a weak signal, when in the presence of a pump signal, to form an amplified output signal.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that depending on the application, any of the various inputs to such a system may be deemed the signal input, and likewise any of the various outputs may be deemed the signal output. Hence, a system similar to the measurement system previously described can operate to produce an output optical signal in response to an input optical signal, an output optical signal in response to an input RF signal, an output RF signal in response to an input optical signal, or an output RF signal in response to an input RF signal.","In the system described above, RF modulation can be utilized to excite the phonons. On the other hand, phononic excitation may occur without RF modulation in systems that exhibit gain at the Stokes or anti-Stokes frequency. One such example is provided above, i.e. the Brillouin laser using a ring resonator, i.e., a circular resonant waveguide. As shown in , a waveguide device  can be utilized in conjunction with a circular resonant waveguide . A pump laser  and a signal laser  can be utilized to generate respective pump signals  and signals  which can be transmitted into a waveguide . Waveguide  can be coupled to the circular resonant waveguide , whereby Brillouin SBS can occur between the circular resonant waveguide  and waveguide . Based upon the combination of coupling and Brillouin SBS, the output signal  can be delayed with respect to the laser pump signal . In a further example that operates on similar principles, the ring resonator is omitted and instead, the resonant cavity can be defined by a pair of Bragg gratings formed in the optical waveguide traversing the phononic resonators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIGS. 39-44","FIG. 39"],"b":["100","3700","3800","3900","4000","110","122","132","122","195","130","100"],"sub":"2"},"As shown in , a process of deep ultraviolet (UV) lithography, a deep silicon etch (DPS) followed by a resist strip, a standard post-etch, and a pre-diffusion clean, can facilitate formation of a waveguide  on the surface of the insulator layer .","Any suitable process can be utilized to form a SiNlayer, as shown in . Such a process can include a low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) operation. The nitride layer  is deposited on the exposed surface of the insulating layer  and also over the waveguide , where in an example embodiment, nitride layer  can be 300 nm thickness.","In , a chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) can be performed to preferentially thin the conformal nitride layer atop the waveguide .

For example,  presents a scanning electron micrograph of a dual photonic crystal waveguide device , wherein the waveguide cores and membranes are formed from the same material, e.g., Si. As shown in , waveguide device  includes two waveguide cores  and  formed in the same layer as membrane  and phononic crystal regions . Waveguide cores  and  are located between a plurality of slots  formed in membrane , whereby the slots  can act to constrain light and\/or acoustic waves in the waveguide cores  and .","However, in contrast to the step-index waveguides (e.g., devices , , , and ) which guide light and\/or acoustic waves by total internal reflection (e.g., in waveguide core ), waveguide  can guide light and\/or acoustic information as a consequence of Bragg reflection through the formation of an optical bandgap.","As shown in , if a pump signal Pp is injected into a first waveguide  at a frequency of less than about 8 GHz a conversion efficiency is minimal, even impaired, as shown in , region , with no interaction occurring with the probe beam Pr (e.g., Pr remains flat). In an embodiment, a transmission of energy in the pump signal Pp can be of an ultra-wideband stimulated Mach-wave emission, e.g., across a frequency range of 2-11 GHz. Further, the pump signal Pp can be constrained in the first waveguide  based upon Bragg reflection occurring at the phononic crystal regions . Effectively, the phononic crystal regions act to confine the Pp signal as a function of electrorestrictive forces generated as a result of an optical mode of the Pp signal interacting with the phononic crystal regions , e.g., a phononic defect mode. Owing to the Mach-wave emission, at a frequency of less than about 8 GHz (e.g., a frequency below a phononic bandgap) any acoustic waves generated at the first waveguide  propagate freely across all of the phononic crystal regions .","However, as shown in , when the pump signal Pp is injected into the first waveguide  at a frequency of the phononic bandgap (e.g., of about 8-9.5 GHz, as shown, e.g., in , region ), any information in the pump signal Pp can be resonantly coupled to the probe beam Pr injected into the second waveguide . Hence, when operating at a phononic bandgap frequency, the waveguide device  can operate as a tunable reflector for sound (i.e. a phonic bandgap reflector) while simultaneously conveying signal Pp along the first waveguide . The waveguide device  can effect efficient transfer (as shown in ) of energy over a narrow bandwidth(s).","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, one possible output of a system such as that described above is a phase-modulated version of the probe beam. The phase modulation may be understood, in one sense, as resulting from changes in the refractive index created by the action of the pump radiation. This behavior can be readily utilized to create, e.g., an optical filter.","Other possible applications utilize an optical frequency comb, created by cascaded Brillouin processes, i.e., by Stokes or anti-Stokes shifts that are repeated one, two, three, or more times. This may occur, for example, in a Brillouin laser in which the free spectral range of the resonant cavity is divisible by the phonon frequency. Because the resulting comb lines are coherent, it might be possible to use such a cascaded process to generate optical pulses.","In other possible applications, the probe beam can be split and simultaneously injected into a plurality of optical waveguides, all of which traverse phononic resonators and all of which are acoustically coupled via the suspended membrane. A pump beam injected into one or more designated driver waveguides generates phonons that propagate through the membrane and locally excite the resonators traversed by the respective optical waveguides at different times determined by the respective phononic propagation delays. The resulting frequency or phase modulation of optical pulses injected via the probe beam can be utilized to operate such an arrangement as an optical pulse delay circuit or an optical pulse shaper.","In Brillouin laser applications, it may be possible to actively mode lock the laser by modulating the pump beam at a desired pulse frequency that is compatible, e.g., with a harmonic of the optical cavity round trip time and of the phononic cavity round trip time.","To facilitate understanding of the various embodiments presented herein, coupled wave equations are developed which describe the nonlinear wave-mixing processes which can occur in a waveguide device , and further, derive functional form of the various asymmetric line-shapes observed through heterodyne pump-probe experiments. By utilizing the analytically derived line-shapes, quantitative analyses of the experimental signatures are performed to determine the magnitude of the Brillouin nonlinear coefficient.","As previously described, a function of the various geometries of waveguide devices  can facilitate mutually incoherent pump and probe beams being coupled into the Brillouin waveguide. A pump beam can be produced by intensity modulation of a monochromatic laser line. Modulation at frequency \u03a9, generates a pump beam comprising two frequencies, \u03c9and \u03c9, with corresponding wave amplitudes Aand A, where \u03c9\u2212\u03c9=\u03a9.

The wave-amplitudes Aand Acan be measured through heterodyne detection to produce the line-shapes previously discussed, e.g., with reference to . For simplicity, it can be assumed that both pump and probe waves are coupled to transverse electric-like (TE-like) waveguide modes.

By utilizing established methods for computing |2\u03b3|, based on well-known values for the Kerr nonlinearities of crystalline Si, an estimate of the Brillouin gain G can be determined according to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"G","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["D","n"]},"mi":"\u03b7","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03b3","FWM"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}}},"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["L","tot"]},{"mi":["L","SBS"]}]}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eqn","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"7"}}]}}}}},"It is to be noted that the propagation losses in Eqns. 1a and 1b do not appear in Eqn. 7, as losses do not alter the final functional form of the derived line-shape in the small signal limit.","The magnitude of \u03b3produced by the Si waveguide  was computed using an accepted Kerr coefficient of n=4.5\u00d710[m\/W] for Si.
