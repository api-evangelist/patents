{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by, or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates in general to the field of munitions. More specifically, this invention relates to safety fuzes for hand emplaced grenades for military and commercial uses.","Safety is a very important design aspect of a hand grenade fuze. Conventional fuze designs account for a time delay period from initiation, for the detonation to occur, in order to ensure that the grenade is cast outside the explosion hazard area.","To this end, numerous conventional hand grenade fuzes have been proposed, some of which are described in the following publications: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,823,669; 3,926,122; 4,063,514; 4,167,905; 4,730,559; 5,196,649; 6,082,267; 6,965,542; 7,197,983; and 7,712,419, and Statutory Invention Registration H251, issued Apr. 7, 1987 to Field.","These and other fuze designs propose the use of delay elements that are either mechanically, chemically, electrically, or electro-magnetically operated. However, these conventional designs could present various inherent problems, particularly when used in the field, under adverse and stressful conditions.","More specifically, many conventional hand grenade fuze designs include an explosive train that is always in-line from production through employment, thus presenting an intrinsic danger of inadvertent initiation.","In addition, other fuzes are designed primarily for right handed users and require different grasp and inverted handling for left-handed users, thus increasing the possibility of slippage, \u201cmilking\u201d and functioning within close proximity.","Conventional fuze designs do not provide a visual indication (e.g., color coded) of the fuze armed and unarmed states, thus increasing the risk of inadvertently confusing the armed state for the unarmed state and creating subjective disposition of unexploded and mishandled grenades.","Certain conventional fuze designs provide for two safety features that are not required to be performed in a specific order, thus increasing the risk of unintentional functioning.","Conventional fuze designs cannot be easily returned to a safe state by the user once the safety pin is removed. As a result, once the safety pin is removed, the grenade must be deployed, regardless of the user's intent.","Many conventional fuze designs use a safety pin as a primary safety, the pin is placed through the fuze body and the ends are either shaped into a diamond, duckbill, spread, etc. Safety pin removal forces of safety pins formed concurrently in the same machinery or means for the same batch or lot may vary up to 20 pounds. As a result, the user requirements vary and are unknown until the user removes the safety and may vary from 10 pounds to 30 pounds of force required or 300% of the minimal force.","Conventional fuze designs do not necessarily provide a fail safe feature on the primary safety. The primary safety of some of these designs can be easily modified or altered by the user, or damaged by impact. Consequently, reducing the effectiveness of the primary safety and creating a risk of unintentional initiation.","The fuze primary safety design is generally tested through destructive testing, and the results are based on the sample size and the statistical analysis of results, thus the results have a high confidence level but are never 100% for the lot.","Conventional fuze designs intend for the user to have a secure grip on the lever when removing the primary safety pin but have no mechanical means to ensure this condition exists. As a result, the primary safety pin may be removed and the grenade initiated without the user having control over the grenade.","The spatial constraints on existing fuze designs pose technical risk for incorporating electronic circuitry to accomplish the detonation delay with an out-of-line explosive train. For this reason, recent fuze designs try to mechanically keep the explosive train out-of-line until the grenade is armed, thus reducing the requirement of the timing device to have a provision for such a feature.","What is therefore needed is a fuze design that addresses the following and other concerns and provides a solution thereto: effectiveness of the primary safety, out-of-line requirement, visual indication of armed state, right handed design, resafe difficulties, potential alteration or damage to the primary safety, and destructive testing. Prior to the advent of the present invention, the need for such a fuze design has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and describes a safety fuze for hand emplaced grenades for military and commercial uses. The fuze is provided with an out-of-line explosive train. As used herein, \u201ccanister\u201d or \u201cgrenade\u201d includes but is not limited to a hand grenade, and may include explosive, smoke, chemical, incendiary, and non-lethal explosive, flash, stun and riot control.","The present safety fuze provides numerous advantages among which are the following:","The safety fuze provides an ambidextrous safety. Anecdotal reports indicate that the incidents of left-hand users dropping and \u201cmilking\u201d hand grenades incorporating the present fuze design, thus allowing the striker to activate the charge unintentionally without releasing the lever, are more prominent for left-handed users. This condition is believed to be caused by the design intended to be held with the hinging axis of the lever at the top near the thumb and not the palm. As used herein \u201cmilking\u201d refers to the user releasing the handle enough to allow the striker to initiate the delay mechanism without the user's knowledge.","The safety fuze also provides a means to test the squeeze pressure of the lever and break away force of the thumb switch 100% during manufacturing. This eliminates the sampling of production parts off the line and nearly eliminates the probability of an escape of a fuze that does not meet the specified forces.","The safety fuze creates a safety that requires two distinct actions to be performed in a specific order to arm.","The safety fuze provides a means to resafe the device after the fuze is armed. The resafe procedure generally includes rotating the thumb switch back to a safe-locked state while maintaining constant control of the lever. As used herein \u201cResafe\u201d or \u201cresafing\u201d refers to returning the fuze to a safe state.","The safety fuze further provides a visual color coded indication of the armed and safe positions of the thumb switch.","The safety fuze provides assurance that the user has control of the lever before arming. The thumb switch will not rotate until the lever is squeezed, which mandates a firm grip on the safety fuze.","The safety fuze provides out-of-line explosive train until the user initiates the arming sequence just prior to deploying the grenade.","The safety fuze reduces the potential for field modification by the user and reduces the subjectivity of the disposition of condition code during turn in.","The safety fuze reduces and simplifies the steps required to deploy the grenade compared to current designs, resulting in faster deployment during training and combat environments.","The safety fuze is shaped and dimensioned such that it may be used with the current grenade body and requires no alteration to adapt.","These and other advantages are implemented by the present safety fuze that is generally comprised of a lever which is held captive by the protruding teeth of a rotating thumb switch.","The lever in turn holds back a striker or hammer under spring tension. The lever is forcibly held away from the body by means of a spring that engages it into the rotating thumb switch teeth and prevents rotation in a safe-locked state.","In this safe-locked state, the lever is not depressed against the body of the fuze, the lever is engaged to the thumb switch. The barrel that joins the thumb switch of the right and left sides contains an initiation and\/or delay device, so that the target of the striker is rotated 90 degrees, away from the striker path, should the striker be released. As used herein, the terms \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d generally refer to the fact that if the fuze is accidentally dropped or handled, it will not be initiated.","To start the arming of the fuze, the lever is depressed against the grenade body, causing the teeth of the rotating thumb switch to be disengaged from the mating teeth of the lever, and freeing the thumb switch to be rotated by the user. In this safe-unlocked state, the target of the striker is still rotated 90 degrees, away from the striker path. The fuze can be resafed at this stage by releasing the lever.","After the lever is depressed it must be held against the grenade body as the user manually rotates the thumb switch in a predetermined direction (e.g., upward, regardless of whether the user is left handed or right handed). The thumb switch has a breakaway from un-arm position force that is created by a ball detent interfering in a cutout under the thumb switch edge.","In this armed state, the fuze lever is no longer restrained by the thumb switch. However, the fuze can be resafed at this stage by rotating the thumb switch in the opposite direction (e.g., downward), and then releasing the lever. In this armed state, the fuze is no longer safe in that if it is accidentally dropped or handled, it will be initiated.","When the thumb switch is fully rotated 90 degrees, the initiating device and\/or delay device will be in-line with the point of contact of the striker, and the lever will no longer be restrained. If released, the lever will allow rotation of the striker to make contact with the initiating device. At this point in the operation, the fuze is in the armed state awaiting to be employed. As used herein, \u201cto be employed,\u201d or \u201cemployment\u201d refers to the user releasing the grip on the lever and allowing the lever to move unrestrained.","When the grenade is deployed, the thumb switch is fully rotated 90 degrees, the initiating device and\/or delay device will be in-line with the point of contact of the striker, the lever is released and striker has rotated and made contact with the initiated device. At this point of operation, the fuze is in the initiated state. In this initiation state, the fuze is initiated and such initiation is irreversible.","Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale, and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.","A safety fuze  of the present invention and its method of operation will now be described with reference to . The safety fuze  generally includes a lever , a body , a striker assembly , and a rotating thumb switch assembly .","The general operation  of the safety fuze  involves four distinct stages. In the first operation stage, the safety fuze  is in a safe-locked state, as shown in step  of . As used herein, the terms \u201cstate,\u201d \u201cposition,\u201d or \u201cstage\u201d are used interchangeably. In this state, the lever  is locked in place by the rotating thumb switch assembly . In turn, the lever  holds back the striker assembly  under spring tension.","The lever  is held at a distance from the body  and prevented from rotation (e.g., ). In this safe-locked state, the rotating switch assembly  contains an initiation and\/or delay device  (shown in dashed line in ), and is rotated 90 degrees away from a point of contact  of the striker assembly , should a striker  of the striker assembly  be released, making the explosive train out-of-line. While specific angles of rotation, i.e., 90 degrees, are stated herein, it should be understood that this exemplary value may be used in one preferred embodiment of the present invention, and that other angular values may be selected in other embodiments, which values are not limited to 90 degrees.","In the second operation stage, the safety fuze  is in a safe-unlocked state, as shown in step  of . The safety fuze  is unlocked by depressing the lever  against a grenade  (e.g., ), which is secured to the body .","The depression of the lever  causes the thumb switch assembly  to become disengaged from the lever . The disengagement of the thumb switch assembly  will free it to be rotated manually by the user.","It is important to note that at this stage, the user has the full option to determine whether or not to resafe the safety fuze , at decision step  of . If the user makes a determination to resafe the safety fuze , the safety fuze  can be readily resafed by having the user release the lever , at step  of . The lever , being under spring tension, returns to its initial position, causing the safety fuze  to return to the safe-locked state of step .","If, at decision step , the user decides to pursue the arming of the safety fuze , he or she proceeds to the third operation stage. At this stage, the safety fuze  is in an armed state, as shown in step  of .","After the lever  is depressed at step , it must be held against the grenade  as the user manually rotates the thumb switch assembly , for example a quarter turn (e.g., 90 degrees), in a predetermined direction. In one preferred embodiment, such predetermined direction is the upward direction, regardless of whether the user is left handed or right handed.","When the thumb switch assembly  is fully rotated 90 degrees, the initiating device and\/or delay device  will be in-line with the point of contact  of the striker assembly , and the lever  will no longer be restrained (e.g., ).","It is also important to note that at this stage, the user still has the full option to determine whether or not to resafe the safety fuze , at decision step  of . If the user makes a determination to resafe the safety fuze , the safety fuze  can be readily resafed by sequentially rotating the thumb switch assembly  in the opposite direction (e.g., downward), as shown in step  of , and then releasing the lever , as shown in step  of . The lever  returns to its initial position, causing the safety fuze  to return to the safe-locked state of step .","If, however, at decision step , the user decides to pursue the arming of the safety fuze , he or she proceeds to the fourth operation stage. At this stage, the safety fuze  is in an initiation state, as shown in step  of .","At this final operation stage, the user releases the lever , allowing the lever  to move unrestrained, which will cause the rotation of the striker assembly  to make contact with the initiating device . At this point, the grenade  is initiated, and the safety fuze  can no longer be resafed. (e.g., )","The method of assembling the safety fuze  will now be described with specific reference to . The assembly method generally includes three steps: Assembling the striker assembly  to the fuze body ; assembling the thumb switch assembly  to the fuze body ; and assembling the lever  to the fuze body . Each of these assembly steps will now be described in greater detail.","The striker assembly  includes the following components: A striker , a striker spring , a rod , and two lever springs , . The striker  is provided with two shoulders A and B that extend from a striker body . Two axially coaligned holes are formed in the shoulders A, B, and are dimensioned to allow the rod  to pass therethrough, so that, upon assembly, the striker  can rotate freely around the axis of rod .","The striker assembly  is assembled to the body  by aligning the following elements and components in the following order: a first hole  formed in the safety fuze body , a first hole that is formed in the striker shoulder B, the lever spring , the striker spring , a second hole that is formed in the striker shoulder A, the lever spring , and the second hole  that is formed in the safety fuze body . This alignment is shown in the exemplary , with the striker spring  and the lever  removed for clarity of illustration.","As further illustrated in  one terminal end  of the lever spring  is fitted in a corresponding cavity  that is formed in the body , for retaining the lever spring  in position. The other terminal end  () of the lever spring  rests on, and is forced against a surface  () of the safety fuze body . The lever spring  is generally similarly shaped and dimensioned as the lever spring , and is also similarly assembled to the safety fuze body .","The lever springs ,  determine the resistance force required to be overcome by the user's grip on the lever . This safety measure ensures that the lever  is not accidentally depressed by a casual force. The lever springs ,  exert sufficient force on the lever , so that the lever teeth  engage the teeth ,  of the thumb switch assembly .","The rod  is fitted in the body holes , , the lever springs , , the holes in the shoulders A, B, and the striker spring . The rod  protrudes on both sides of the striker shoulders A, B and rotates freely along the alignment axis defined by the rod .","The rod  is prevented from sliding out of position by the two flanges  (),  () of the lever , when the lever  is assembled to the safety fuze body .","At this stage, the striker  is held into a retracted position (), and the fuze  is in a safe state.","Prior to describing the assembly of the thumb switch assembly  to the safety fuze body , the components of the thumb switch assembly  will be described with more specific reference to . The thumb switch assembly  is comprised of two similarly shaped and dimensioned thumb switches , , a barrel , a detent device , and two retaining screws , .","With reference to , the thumb switch  is formed of a generally cylindrically shaped body  that integrally extends from a front side of the shaped body  into a raised section . The raised section  terminates in a tooth  that is dimensioned to engage the teeth  of the lever .","The body  also includes another raised section (or flange)  that is centrally located and that extends from the backside of the body . The raised section  has a generally circular cross-section that is similar to that of the barrel , so that when the initiator  of  is assembled, the raised section  is flush with the barrel , in order to permit a smooth rotation of the initiator .","An axial opening  () is formed through the depths of the body  and the circular raised section , in order to accommodate the retaining screw . It should be understood that the retaining screws ,  may be replaced by any suitable or available pinning or another means to attach the assembly. The body  includes a generally semi-circular notch or opening  that extends throughout the depth of the body  to provide the user with a visual indication of the safety state of the fuze .","In this regard, the safety fuze body  includes two similar circular openings ,  in which color indicators are inserted. In the present exemplary embodiment, a green color indicator is inserted in opening  to provide the user with a visual safe (or unarmed) mode indicator (steps - of ). A red color indicator is inserted in opening  to provide the user with a visual armed indicator (step  of  and step  of ).","In a preferred embodiment, the circular openings ,  are distanced by 90 degrees, so that when the initiator  is rotated by 90 degrees, the visual indicator changes from the green color to the red color (or vice versa), to indicate a change in the mode (or state) of the fuze .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["220","392","393","255","255","275","210","256","210"]},"In a preferred embodiment, the circular openings ,  are distanced by 90 degrees, so that when the initiator  is rotated by 90 degrees, the detent device  is disengaged from the opening  and engages the opening  (or vice versa), depending on the safety mode of the fuze .","The ball  of the detent device  selectively engages either one of the two circular openings , , to lock the thumb switch assembly  in position. More specifically, the detent device  engages the opening  at steps  and  of , while it engages the opening  at step  of  and step  of ).","The thumb switch  is generally, but not necessarily similar in design and construction to the thumb switch , and may include similar openings ,  () to engage the detent device  or another detent device.","The thumb switch  is formed of a generally cylindrically shaped body . The front side of the body  that integrally extends into a raised section . The raised section  terminates in a tooth  that is dimensioned to engage the teeth  of the lever .","The backside of the body  includes a raised section  that is centrally located. The raised section  has a generally circular cross-section that is similar to that of the barrel , so that when the initiator  of  is assembled, the raised section  is flush with the barrel , in order to permit a smooth rotation of the initiator .","An axial opening  is formed through the depths of the body  and the circular raised section  of the thumb switch , in order to accommodate the retaining screw . The body  includes a generally semi-circular notch or opening  that extends throughout the depth of the body , to provide the user with a visual indication of the safety state of the fuze .","In this regard, the safety fuze body  may optionally include two similar circular openings ,  in which color indicators are inserted. In the present exemplary embodiment, a green color indicator is inserted in the opening  to provide the user with a visual safe (or unarmed) mode indicator (steps - of ). A red color indicator is inserted in the opening  to provide the user with a visual armed indicator (step  of  and step  of ). In a preferred embodiment, the circular openings ,  are distanced by 90 degrees.","To assemble the initiator  to the safety fuze body , the initiation and\/or delay device  is housed in the barrel . The barrel  is then fitted inside a cylindrical chamber  () of the safety fuze body , through an opening  in the safety fuze body . The barrel  fits rotatably, with restrained clearance, within the chamber .","In this exemplary embodiment, the barrel  is cylindrically shaped. Upon assembly to the safety fuze body , a target  in the barrel , is positioned forward relative to user, so that when the fuze is in a safe state, the target  is positioned orthogonally (out-of-line) relative to the striking path of the striker point of contact .","The two thumb switches ,  are fitted to the barrel  on either side of the fuze body . With reference to , the body  of the thumb switch  fits rotatably, with restrained clearance, within a similarly shaped and dimensioned circular opening  in the safety fuze body , with the tooth  protruding outward relative to the safety fuze body . The thumb switch  is similarly fitted to the safety fuze body .","The thumb switches ,  are then secured to the safety fuze body  and the barrel  by two fastening means, such as screws , , respectively, such that the ball of the detent  fits within a corresponding opening, e.g., , in order to exert a predetermined force on the thumb switch . A similar defent device may be fitted for the thumb switch . The detent device (or devices)  positions the thumb switches  and  in a safe position, so that upon squeezing the lever , there will still remain a resistance on the thumb switch  required to rotate it into the armed state.","At this stage, the assembled two thumb switches ,  and the barrel  are rotatable as an integral unit, referred to herein as the initiator  (), by means of any one of the two thumb levers ,  that are secured to the bodies , , respectively. Upon countering the retention force of the ball detente  by the user, the initiator  is free to rotate, axially, in one direction for exposing the target  to the striker point of contact .","The lever  is then assembled by aligning the lever holes  with an axial hole  in a hinge section  of the safety fuze body . A dowel  is inserted in the holes ,  to rotatably secure the lever  to the lever body , around an axis that is defined by the dowel . Alternative fastening and rotation means may be used instead.","The teeth  of the lever  are interlocked, in a mating relationship, with the teeth ,  of the initiator  (i.e., thumb switches , , respectively), as long as the lever  is not pressed against the grenade .","By depressing the lever , the teeth  of the lever  disengage from the teeth ,  of the initiator , allowing the initiator  to be rotated, and the safety fuze  to be armed as described herein in connection with .","With reference to , the safety fuze body  extends into a downward threaded section , which, in turn, extends downward into a shaft . The grenade  is secured to the safety fuze  by inserting the shaft  into the grenade  and by threading the grenade  to the threaded section .","Upon completion of the assembly of the safety fuze , and securing the grenade  thereto, the safety fuze  is in the safe-locked state, as shown in step  of  and , and is ready for packaging, shipment, and use.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["200","300","205","350","360","361","351","208","205"]},"As further illustrated in , the lever , in turn, holds back the striker  under the tension of the striker spring .
