title: Accurate uplink power control for CoMP and C-RAN
abstract: A user equipment (UE) is arranged to send an uplink power reference signal to an enhanced Node B (eNB) associated with multiple reception points (RPs), to receive identification of an RP set and a downlink reference signal power level, to determine a path loss estimate for each downlink reference signal received from RPs of the RP set, to determine an uplink power level that is a function of the path loss estimates determined for the downlink signals received from the RPs of the RP set, and to use the determined uplink power level during communication with the multiple RPs.

No. 61\/504,054, filed on Jul. 1, 2011, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","CoMP (Coordinated Multiple Point Transmission and Reception) and C-RAN (Centralized, Cooperative, Cloud-Radio Access Network) are becoming increasingly important in wireless communication systems involving Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE Advanced. Both C-RAN and CoMP systems perform joint\/shared processing of uplink signaling received from different remote heads (RRHs). Power management is an important aspect of user equipment (UE) operation. Power management of uplink transmission ordinarily involves obtaining a path loss estimation. In earlier LTE and LTE-Advanced systems, uplink power control typically measured path loss based upon home eNB downlink CRS (Cell Reference Signal). The measured path loss value usually is used to decide uplink transmission power of the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), the physical uplink control channel (PUCCH), and the sounding reference signal (SRS). Thus, the path loss measurement directly determines uplink channel performance. Unfortunately, determining uplink power control based upon the home eNB CRS produces sub-optimal results since multiple uplink reception points (RPs) (e.g., multiple RRHs) are employed by C-RAN and CoMP.","Therefore, there has been a need for a system and method for improved determination of uplink path loss to support uplink transmission in C-RAN and CoMP systems used in wireless communications.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to create and use a system and method to estimate uplink path loss and determine uplink power during communication between a wireless mobile device and one or more base stations that are associated with a plurality of reception points and that is arranged for joint processing of signals received from the mobile device by multiple reception points. Various modifications to the embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications. In the following description, numerous details are set forth for the purpose of explanation. However, well-known structures and processes are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the description with unnecessary detail. In the following description, similar or substantially identical items shown in different drawings are labeled with identical reference numbers.","CoMP encompasses a range of different techniques that enable the dynamic coordination of transmission and reception of cellular communication across multiple geographically separated evolved or enhanced Node Bs (eNBs). CoMP is an enhancement that has been included in LTE-Advanced. An LTE wireless network may include a number of eNBs and other network entities. Each eNB may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In the \u20183Generation Partnership Project\u2019 (3GPP), the term \u201ccell\u201d may refer to a coverage area of an eNB and\/or an eNB subsystem serving this coverage area. By providing connections to several base stations at once, using CoMP, data can be passed through the least loaded base stations for better resource utilization. Using CoMP, joint or shared processing of communication signals received from the same UE by different base station transceivers receivers within a base station may apply signal combining techniques to utilize multi-path interference constructively rather than destructively, thereby reducing interference levels, for example. Moreover, CoMP may be employed to increase overall received power at a UE handset.","C-RAN aims to reduce the load on cell sites by moving communication signal processing back into a common, shared \u201cvirtual\u201d base station, referred to as the BBU pool (baseband unit pool).  is an illustrative drawing showing an example known C-RAN system architecture  in accordance with some embodiments. A C-RAN architecture typically comprises the distributed radio units referred to as remote radio heads (RRHs)  that include associated antennas, which are located at remote sites. Multiple RRHs  and associated antennas provide radio communication coverage within multiple overlapping cells  that collectively provide coverage over a wide coverage region . A centralized base station (the BBU pool)   includes processing systems\/storage devices  configured for baseband and protocol stack processing of signals received by the remote RRHs at the multiple cell sites . A high bandwidth low-latency transport network , often including optical fiber links , connects the RRHs  and a BBU pool . The processing systems\/storage devices  of the BBU  may include high performance programmable processors and real-time virtualization technology.","In contrast to some other prior distributed base station architectures, the C-RAN breaks up the static relationship between RRHs and base stations. A given RRH does not belong to any specific physical base station. Rather, radio signals from and into a particular RRH can be processed by a virtual base station, allocated from the processing capacity of the physical base station pool using real-time virtualization technology, for example. Generally speaking there are two different C-RAN architectures. In a \u2018full centralization\u2019 C-RAN architecture, baseband (i.e. layer 1) and the layer 2, layer 3 BTS functions all are implemented in the centralized processing system . In a \u2018partial centralization\u2019 architecture, the RRHs  integrate not only the radio function but also the baseband function, while other higher layer functions are implemented in the centralized processing system . For the partial centralization C-RAN architecture, although the centralized processing system  does not implement the baseband function, it is still referred to as the centralized processing system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","103","103"],"sub":["0","X"]},"In some orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) embodiments, in which OFDM is used for messages involving voice and\/or data communication, uplink power control involves determining the average power over a Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) symbol in which a physical channel is transmitted. In some OFDM embodiments, the transmitted downlink signal consists of N subcarriers for a duration of N OFDM symbols. In an OFDM embodiment, a single subcarrier for one symbol period is referred to as a resource element. Downlink power control determines the energy per resource element (EPRE). It is noted that the term resource element energy also denotes the average energy taken over all constellation points for the modulation scheme applied.","The UE uplink power reference signal is received by multiple RPs within the home eNB. An indication of the received power of the UE uplink power reference signal at each RP is transmitted to a centralized processing system, which determines a set of RPs that are designated to communicate with the UE. In a LTE or LTE Advance system, the centralized processing system comprises a BBU. In a CoMP system, the centralized processing system comprises a group of BBUs. The home eNB responds to the UE uplink power reference signal by wirelessly transmitting to the UE information indicating a multi-RP set, the downlink reference signal type and downlink reference signal transmission power for each RP of the set. This information is sent back to the UE by a Transmission Point (TP) or TP Set defined in the scope of downlink CoMP, for example. The UE uses the received information to estimate path loss during communication involving the multi-RP set and to select an appropriate uplink transmission power, based upon the estimated path loss, to use in subsequent uplink transmission with the RP set for both data and control channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","102","302"],"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["i","j"]},"where, i is the index of UE j is the index of RP.","Module  determines as a function of the measured RSRP_UE(i)_RP(j) values, the RP set for a given UE to be involved in joint or shared processing of signals transmitted by UE(i).
