No. 12\/475,564 filed May 31, 2009, now issued Pat. No. 7,901,048 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/139,493 filed Jun. 15, 2008, now issued Pat.

No. 09\/113,076 filed Jul. 10, 1998, now issued Pat. No. 6,855,264, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to the field of inkjet printing and, in particular, discloses a method of manufacture of an ink jet printer having a thermal actuator comprising an external coil spring.","Many ink jet printing mechanisms are known. Unfortunately, in mass production techniques, the production of ink jet heads is quite difficult. For example, often, the orifice or nozzle plate is constructed separately from the ink supply and ink ejection mechanism and bonded to the mechanism at a later stage (Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36 no 5, pp33-37 (1985)). These separate material processing steps required in handling such precision devices often add a substantial expense in manufacturing.","Additionally, side shooting ink jet technologies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,181) are often used but again, this limits the amount of mass production throughput given any particular capital investment.","Additionally, more esoteric techniques are also often utilised. These can include electroforming of nickel stage (Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36 no 5, pp33-37 (1985)), electro-discharge machining, laser ablation (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,604), micro-punching, etc.","The utilisation of the above techniques is likely to add substantial expense to the mass production of ink jet print heads and therefore add substantially to their final cost.","It would therefore be desirable if an efficient system for the mass production of ink jet print heads could be developed.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a micro-electromechanical ejection mechanism comprising:","a wafer substrate;","an ink chamber formed on said wafer substrate, the ink chamber having an ink ejection nozzle formed in a roof thereof and an ink inlet port formed in a floor thereof;","a paddle device arranged inside the ink chamber between the inlet port and the ejection nozzle; and","a bi-layer thermal actuator coil with a first end fast with the substrate and a second end connected to the paddle device, wherein heating of the thermal actuator coil displaces the paddle device causing ejection of an ink droplet through the ink ejection nozzle.","Other aspects are also disclosed.","In the preferred embodiment, there is provided an inkjet printer having a series of ink ejection mechanisms wherein each ink ejection mechanism includes a paddle actuated by a coil actuator, the coil spring actuator having a unique cross section so as to provide for efficient actuation as a coiled thermal actuator.","Turning initially to , there is illustrated a single ink ejection mechanism  constructed in accordance with the principles of the preferred embodiment. The ink ejection mechanism  includes a chamber  having a rim . The chamber  is normally filled with ink which bulges out around a surface having a border along the edge of rim , the ink being retained within the chamber  by means of surface tension around the rim . Outside of the chamber  is located a thermal actuator device . The thermal actuator device  is interconnected via a strut  through a hole  to a paddle device within the chamber . The strut  and hole  are treated so as to be hydrophobic. Further, the hole  is provided in a thin elongated form so that surface tension characteristics also assist in stopping any ink from flowing out of the hole .","The thermal actuator device  comprises a first arm portion  which can be constructed from glass or other suitable non-conductive material. A second arm portion  can be constructed from material such as titanium diboride which has a large Young's modulus or bending strength and hence, when a current is passed through the titanium diboride layer , it expands with a predetermined coefficient of thermal expansion. The thin strip  has a high Young's modulus or bending strength and therefore the thin strip  is able to bend the much thicker strip  which has a substantially lower Young's modulus.","Turning to , there is illustrated a cross-section of the arm through the line II-II of  illustrating the structure of the actuator device . As described previously, the actuator device  includes two titanium diboride portions , forming a circuit around the coil in addition to the glass portion  which also provides for electrical isolation of the two arms, the arms being conductively joined at the strut end.","Turning now to , there will now be explaining the operation of the ink ejection mechanism  for the ejection of ink. Initially, before the paddle  has started moving, the situation is as illustrated in  with the nozzle chamber  being filled with ink and having a slightly bulging meniscus . Upon actuation of the actuator mechanism, the paddle  begins to move towards the nozzle rim  resulting in a substantial increase in pressure in the area around the nozzle rim . This in turn results in the situation as illustrated in  wherein the meniscus begins to significantly bulge as a result of the increases in pressure. Subsequently, the actuator is deactivated resulting in a general urge for the paddle  to return to its rest position. This results in the ink being sucked back into the chamber  which in turn results in the meniscus necking and breaking off into a meniscus  and ink drop , the drop  proceeding to a paper or film medium (not shown) for marking. The meniscus  has generally a concave shape and surface tension characteristics result in chamber refilling by means of in flow  from an ink supply channel etched through the wafer. The refilling is as a consequence of surface tension forces on the meniscus . Eventually the meniscus returns to its quiescent state as illustrated in .","Turning now to , there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single ink ejection mechanism  illustrating the various material layers. The ink ejection mechanism  can be formed as part of a large array of mechanisms forming a print head with multiple print heads being simultaneously formed on a silicon wafer . The wafer  is initially processed so as to incorporate a standard CMOS circuitry layer  which provides for the electrical interconnect for the control of the conductive portions of the actuator. The CMOS layer  can be completed with a silicon nitride passivation layer so as to protect it from subsequent processing steps in addition to ink flows through channel . The subsequent layers eg. ,  and  can be deposited utilising standard micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) construction techniques including the deposit of sacrificial aluminum layers in addition to the deposit of the layers  constructed from titanium diboride the layer  constructed from glass material and the nozzle chamber proper  again constructed from titanium diboride. Each of these layers can be built up in a sacrificial material such as aluminum which is subsequently etched away. Further, an ink supply channel eg.  can be etched through the wafer . The etching can be by means of an isotropic crystallographic silicon etch or an isotropic dry etch. A dry etch system capable of high aspect ratio silicon trench etching such as the Surface Technology Systems (STS) Advance Silicon Etch (ASE) system is recommended.","Subsequent to construction of the nozzle arrangement , it can be attached to an ink supply apparatus for supplying ink to the reverse surface of the wafer  so that ink can flow into chamber .","The external surface of nozzle chamber  including rim , in addition to the area surrounding slot , can then be hydrophobically treated so as to reduce the possibility of any ink exiting slot .","One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps:\n\n","The presently disclosed ink jet printing technology is potentially suited to a wide range of printing system including: color and monochrome office printers, short run digital printers, high speed digital printers, offset press supplemental printers, low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers, notebook computers with in-built pagewidth printers, portable color and monochrome printers, color and monochrome copiers, color and monochrome facsimile machines, combined printer, facsimile and copying machines, label printers, large format plotters, photograph copiers, printers for digital photographic \u201cminilabs\u201d, video printers, PHOTO CD (PHOTO CD is a registered trade mark of the Eastman Kodak Company) printers, portable printers for PDAs, wallpaper printers, indoor sign printers, billboard printers, fabric printers, camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table above under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which matches the docket numbers in the in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, a printer may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0095"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thermal","An electrothermal","Large force","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","heater heats the ink to","generated","Ink carrier limited to","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"above boiling point,","Simple","water","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring significant","construction","Low efficiency","Xerox heater-in-"]},{"entry":[{},"heat to the aqueous","No moving parts","High temperatures","pit 1990 Hawkins et"]},{"entry":[{},"ink.
