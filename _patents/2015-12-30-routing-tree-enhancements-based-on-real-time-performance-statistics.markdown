title: Routing tree enhancements based on real time performance statistics
abstract: A call path score that utilizes real time network statistics, sourced from carriers and the public domain that may be provided to LCR and SCPs to determine the net “value” of a route such that, depending on customer choice, a call completion pattern may be created. Calls may be completed optimizing distance, quality or cost based on real time network and carrier database. This function may be further enhanced to provide a customer sourced rating score that enhances call routing. This may be utilized for real time carrier performance statistics to analyze network congestion. Multiple carriers may be assigned based on network performance and carrier congestion.

In addition, the current industry practices do not provide the ability to define a default customer record for a user, in part because it may not be intuitive to build a complex customer record. According to the methods and systems presently disclosed, the TFMP may provide tools that work intelligently with the user, allowing a natural language input, such as English words, to translate and map such language to signifiers that may be less familiar to a user, such as call routing codes. This translation and mapping of natural language to toll-free number management information and data may produce a dynamic, complex customer record, including using existing user records and usage data, to populate information for the user. This may speed the creation of complex routing and other metadata that is associated with a toll-free line, based at least in part on the TFMP enabling the dynamic querying of the real time status of data that is associated with a toll-free number, guide the user in providing the necessary natural language information that allows the TFMP to map such language to toll-free number metadata (e.g., routing codes), and store and implement a complex decision tree describing the actions to take for a given toll-free number.","In an example, the TFMP may provide a user interface in which a user types a command such as \u201cRoute all incoming calls made to toll-free numbers having the extension 571 to the technical support staff.\u201d The TFMP may take this natural language input and map it to routing codes or other data corresponding to the natural language. In another example, the natural language may be selected from a menu that is provided in the user interface of the TFMP, provided via voice command using voice recognition software, via scanned text that is input to the TFMP, or using some other means of conveying natural language. The Customer Record Template Builder (CRTB) of the TFMP may allow building a complex customer record template using a user interface, enabling that record to be designated as the default customer record. Using the TFMP, a toll-free provider may build multiple complex customer record templates for their use and define a record as the default customer record, allowing the user to select the default with a single click, thus reducing their work effort.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the CRTB may lead a user through an initial customer data population (known as the Customer Administrative Data (CAD) portion), and also the call routing logic (Call Processing Record; known as the CPR portion) that is associated with a toll-free number, by utilizing the TFMP user interface to construct a decision tree logic structure with defined data nodes derived from the user's natural language inputs.","Based upon the decisions at the nodes in the decision tree that is constructed by the TFMP, the user interface may drive down a branch to a new decision node ultimately driving the customer record decision logic to the lowest level. In embodiments, decision trees constructed by the TFMP based on a user's input may represent a series of decision points. Each decision point may be called a node and off of each node may be one of more branches. The point at which there are no more decisions to be made may be referred to as a leaf and used as the \u201cend point\u201d of a branching structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0275","num":"0288"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","302","304","308"]},"In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the CAD portion of the CRTB may logically lead a user to populate information including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, complex customer record (CPR) decision nodes that may be supported by the TFMP include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the \u201cleaves\u201d that may be supported by the TFMP data model at the ends of a given branch include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n","With reference to , a simplified depiction of a customer record routing, created using the TFMP, is provided.

Once a default customer record template is built, the TFMP may invoke this template when creating a customer record for a new number, thus reducing the time and effort for a subsequent customer record to be built. Invocation of the default customer record template by the TFMP may also serve to reduce human error associated with the manual creation of such records insofar as the template may already embody necessary data, thereby not requiring a user to remember or retrieve the same.","With reference to , the methods and systems of the present disclosure may provide for pre-populating a call routing template based on natural language inputs including, associating a natural language element  with a telecommunications routing code , the telecommunications routing code associated with decision tree logic associating routing of incoming calls to a toll-free number ; storing the association in a database  that is associated with a toll-free telecommunications system; receiving a natural language input  from a user , the natural language input  may include the natural language element ; selecting the telecommunications routing code  based at least in part on the stored association ; populating the telecommunications routing code  at a node of a call routing decision tree  to generate a populated call routing decision tree ; and storing the populated call routing decision tree as a call routing template  that may be identified and presented to a user interface based at least in part on the natural language input.","In embodiments, a natural language input may be a text or voice element. A text element may be a scanned text element. A voice element may be obtained by voice recognition software.","In embodiments, the decision tree logic may determine the call path taken by an incoming toll-free call to a termination number, the call path taken by an incoming toll-free call based at least in part on the time of day the incoming call is received, the call path taken by an incoming toll-free call based at least in part on the geographic location of the device from which the incoming call is received, the call path taken by an incoming toll-free call within a business entities telecommunications system, or some other call path outcome.","Further provided herein are methods and systems for creating a call routing decision tree, the system comprising a user device of a user configured to receive a natural language input from a user; select a stored call routing template, wherein the selection is based at least in part on a stored association of the call routing template and a natural language element that is included in the natural language input; present the stored call routing template to the user within a graphic user interface; receive a command from the user, through the graphic user interface, to associate the selected call routing template with a toll-free number indicated by the user; and store the association between the call routing template and the toll-free number.","In embodiments, the command from the user may be text-based, such as a text-based item that is presented within the graphic user interface in a menu or other location. In embodiments, the command may be a voice command.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method of pre-populating a call routing template based on natural language inputs comprising:\n\n","A system for creating a call routing decision tree, the system comprising:\n\n","In embodiments, and with reference to , the TFMP may facilitate determining toll-free network congestion in real-time. The TFMP system may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d and in this example embodiment called the Percent (%) Node . This node may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The Percent Node may allow a tree to be built so that a certain percentage of the calls are routed to different branches on the call tree. The Percentage may be whole numbers and can range from 0% to 100%, with the total percentage for all sibling branches not to exceed 100%. This may allow Resp Orgs to use the TFMP as their disaster recovery routing for a toll-free number. In an example, a call routing tree may be built with multiple branches to different locations, such as terminating numbers. In a normal situation, 100% of the calls may go to a main location . In a disaster, which could be a carrier system failure, for example, and which may originate outside of the carrier itself, a call routing table created according to the Percent Node and related rules may allow that all calls are diverted to another branch ,  on the tree that uses a different carrier.","In embodiments, real time network data may be used by the TFMP to create, and allow Resp Orgs to use, a \u201ccongestion threshold\u201d node in the call routing tree. This may allow a Resp Org to determine with an end subscriber the appropriate congestion threshold for each branch in a call routing table. For example, if one call center can only handle 200 calls per minute before calls are placed in queue, and statistics show for this end subscriber that wait times start to creep up to 20 minutes when 1000 calls per minutes are received, and they do not want this to occur, the ability to obtain real time call counts\/congestion will allow the SCP to route the calls using call counts\/congestion in addition to all the other possible call decision nodes. Call counts may be very specific to an end subscriber, and congestion thresholds may differ and depend on congestion on the line as a whole. The congestion measurement and threshold value may allow detecting congestion issues and routing to another branch, including one that may be in a different area, should a congestion threshold be reached. This may occur in real-time without a need to change the routing tree. The TFMP may confirm real-time call count information that is available from SCPs and use such data to confirm real-time network congestion. Call count information may be further organized and analyzed by TSPID to permit tracking, for example, by service provider.","In embodiments, nodes in a call routing table may be mapped to real-time information in the SCPs from the network. With the decision nodes embedded in the call tree and loaded into the SCPs, real-time routing may be provided by the TFMP. In embodiments, a call routing table may be a crowd-sourced translation table associated with the TSS that may enable mapping of service providers to unique identifiers, as described herein. Such a mapping would enable a registry that may be used by third parties to locate the plurality of identifiers that may be associated with a service provider or plurality of service providers.","In embodiments, nodes in a call routing table may be used to facilitate predictive analytic services that may be provided to allow a user, through the customizable user interface, or \u201cdashboard,\u201d to access third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network. Nodes in a call routing table may also be utilized with origination data that may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.","In embodiments, nodes in a call routing table may be used to facilitate reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device, such as a personal computer, mobile phone, tablet computer, or some other computing facility, and receive data, including multimedia to the user's client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include, but are not limited to, Number Administration (NA) and Customer Record (CR) administration.","In embodiments, the TFMP may determine accessibility among VoIP and tandem calls. For example, with VoIP the TFMP may ping an IP address at regular intervals to determine status. Using real-time network information and static call routing information, the TFMP may create a real-time call path score. SCPs may also be a source of real-time call routing data. SCPs are in the call path of every toll-free call. The ability to collect real-time data about every call, and every carrier, based on dates, times, day of week, and locations are available to SCPs. Using this information it is possible to extrapolate and determine uptime, downtime, congestion, geographical movement and economic movement of people communicating via calls. Based on real-time data that can be obtained from the SCPs and from the network, the TFMP may create a score that can be assigned to each call decision node. Similar to a mapping algorithm that uses distance and speed limit, given a starting point and a destination, the quickest or shortest map may be mapped. Changes in the call routing tree may be dependent upon an update to the routing tree that is then validated by the TFMP and then downloaded to the SCPs. With the use of real-time data, and more network decisions nodes added to a call routing tree based on the needs of the end subscriber, the TFMP may provide the ability to allow an end subscriber to have real-time business continuity for their toll-free number instead of having to contact their service provider, or getting a ticket opened to update their routing tree, and then having it download to all the SCPs for the new routing to take place.","In embodiments, a call path score and real-time routing may be based on the best possible availability score. This may also be modified by the TFMP to allow for lowest cost score, based on the per-call and per-minute cost for particular carrier. The call score may be updated during low activity periods with a date\/time stamp associated with it. This may allow real-time, or near real time, detection of a path's status. Upon completion of a call down a particular path, the TFMP may also update the call path score, thereby keeping the score up-to-date.","In embodiments, nodes in a call routing table may be used to facilitate determination of the call path score such that real-time routing may be displayed via a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud-based computing network. In another embodiment, such systems may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method comprising:\n\n","A method comprising:","associating a toll-free telecommunications network congestion threshold criterion with a first rule regarding the usage of a plurality of call routing tables, and a second rule regarding the usage of a plurality of telecommunications carriers, wherein the congestion threshold criterion indicates a level of toll-free call volumes occurring within the toll-free telecommunications network; and","switching toll-free calls across the telecommunications carriers based at least on the congestion threshold criterion, wherein the switched calls are further routing according to at least one of the plurality of call routing tables.","A method comprising:\n\n","In the current industry practice, updates and additions to toll-free providers numbers are not available through conventional platform reporting capabilities for up to 24 hours. This makes it difficult for end users to call up information about work done on the current day. If a toll-free number is reserved and for whatever reason the user does not record the actual number, there is often no way to find it, or a laborious search is required to assemble the necessary data elements for retrieval. One reason for the delay in the ability to report is that reporting is sourced from a Report History Data Base (RHDB) that is only populated with updates once a day. Additionally, most reporting from the RHDB is run in the background, thus in some cases, still further delaying the response.","With reference to , in another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP  provides the user with the ability to report on its number portfolio in real time or near real time via an online customer dashboard . The online customer dashboard  may display simulated gauges and dials, business graphics such as pie charts, bar charts and graphs to provide overview that summarizes all pertinent data in one or two screens or views. The gauges and dials may be based upon real time data that is stored within the TFMP. The TFMP may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs for use with the dashboard. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency.","The online customer dashboard may allow the user to see all its customer data and drill down in the details in near real time. To do so, a data source for the dashboard may maintain the data in real time or near real time. The online customer dashboard may also be associated with a user profile and security administration that grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create, view, update and activate certain functions. The platform or system can implement a role-based access control mechanism.","The online customer dashboard  may provide the user with a view into the user portfolio of toll-free number information. This may allow a user to see basic number information about the toll-free numbers the user has the authority to view. Predictive analytic services may also be provided that allow a user, through the customizable user interface, or dashboard, to access third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described, origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.","A user may also access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device, such as a personal computer, mobile phone, tablet computer, or some other computing facility, and receive data, including multimedia to the user's client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include, but are not limited to, Number Administration (NA) and Customer Record (CR) administration. Such systems may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, such systems may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","The online customer dashboard may utilize real time network statistics, sourced from carriers and the public domain, within an algorithm that provides a call path score. This call path score may be provided to LCR and SCPs to determine the net value of a route for display.","The online customer dashboard may also provide an alert system similar to Internet alerts for toll-free numbers. Numbers, or groups of numbers, may be tagged based on tag groups. The alert system for toll-free numbers may use a subscription prioritization engine and offer premium services for service prioritization.","The online customer dashboard for a toll-free voice registry may share reserved, assigned, and working numbers with the Toll-Free Texting and Smart Services Registry (TSS).","The online customer dashboard may initially provide a main dashboard screen from which the user may drill down within a specific toll-free number to investigate more detailed information thereof. In one example, the main dashboard screen may provide a base set, or minimum list of data elements that are available, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n","The user can then drill down into the particular toll free number by clicking on that particular number to find more detailed information such as, Area of Service, Carrier(s), Call Routing, Reserve numbers, or other information associated with a toll-free number.","A user may also view the history of the number i.e. \u201cthe life of a toll-free number.\u201d By selecting a particular toll free number, the history of use of the toll free number may be readily viewable. Various charts, timelines, and usage data may be included therein. This functionality may allow a user to view and report on the status and activities of an entire RespOrg in real time, rather than parts of a RespOrg's activity and\/or only at predefined time intervals (e.g., once per day).","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the online customer dashboard is not a view only tool, but may provide additional or alternative features to be customized by the user. That is individual users may select their desired types of information available via their dashboard.","Such features may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n","Overall, the online customer dashboard may provide a single starting point for any user working with toll free numbers. Having a single location may allow a user of the system to use a single user interface (the dashboard) to view the entirety of activity that is associated with a plurality of toll-free numbers.","With reference to , the TFMP may include a toll-free number rating registry (TFRR) , that functions as a service to provide customers an indication of how often a toll-free number is abused, such as by fraudulent, frequent calling to increase billing costs. The rating may be calculated based on input from users, automated systems and\/or proprietary algorithms that are collecting, storing and analyzing call data from throughout the toll-free system.","In embodiments, the system may collect toll-free number abuse information  from a plurality of sources including, but not limited to, a telephone service provider , toll-free number operators and Resp Orgs. The abuse information may be collected and processed in real-time to provide timely rating information for entities. In embodiments, the TFMP may publish standard interfaces that reporting parties can invoke to register abuse. Such interfaces may allow clients to connect synchronously and asynchronously. Interfaces may include, but are not limited to:\n\n","In embodiments, the abuse reporting interfaces that are associated with the TFMP may be invoked in a manual or automated manner. In the case of service providers, the reporting of abuse may occur during call setup. This may necessitate that the reporting is automated and introduces the least load on the device reporting the abuse. In an example, an asynchronous API may be made available to service providers for this purpose. In another example, for call centers where toll-free numbers terminate, such as a technical support department of a company, call-center processing software may be enhanced to include a module to detect and report abuse.","Additionally, the TFMP may also provide a mobile or other application that small business and single toll-free number users can use to report abuse. The TFMP may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners to facilitate operation of the service as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. The service may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, such systems may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","In embodiments, to automate the processing of toll-free calls and reduce abuse, the TFMP system may be enhanced to allow customers to provision an abuse route. This route may be distributed to the SCPs along with current information being shared. When a service provider determines that a call being setup is an abuse call, they can use the abuse route specified by the customer.","With reference to , an example abuse reporting interface architecture  that is associated with the TFMP is provided. This abuse reporting interface may permit toll-free customers to report when a toll-free number abuse event occurs. The interface may allow for abuse to be reported manually and\/or programmatically in an automated fashion. In embodiments, the abuse collection system described herein may collect information that includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n","The abuse database  may also collect information about Resp Orgs and other industry details in an offline mode. The abuse information may be captured in the toll-free number abuse database . This information may then be processed using a rating engine  to compute the toll-free number rating. The rating engine  may take into account a plurality of factors including, but not limited to, input provided by Resp Orgs , TSPID's associated with service providers, frequency of abuse , identified source of abuse, and the like, to compute a rating for the toll-free number. In the absence of specific reports of abuse, predictive analytics methods of the TFMP, as described herein, may be used to infer abuse or unusual call activity, the results of which may be used in computing a rating. In an embodiment, the identification of abuse may be an inference of an abuse event produced by a predictive analytics engine that is associated with the TFMP based on at least a call history and metadata relating to calls placed over the toll-free telecommunications number. In an example, 100 calls may be placed over a toll-free number, each of which by itself does not appear to be abusive. For example the calls may be placed from locations that do not appear suspicious. However, an inference of abuse, based at least in part on the totality of calls placed over the toll-free number, may be used by the predictive analytics engine that is associated with the TFMP to infer that abuse is occurring or has occurred. For example, the totality of the calls may indicate a pattern indicative of abuse, or a call frequency that is indicative of abuse or some other criterion that may be used by the predicative analytics engine to infer that an abuse event, or plurality of abuse events is occurring or has occurred. In embodiments, a toll-free number rating may be a number between \u201c0\u201d and \u201c100\u201d that provides an indication of how often the number is abused and\/or how severe the abuse is. A number with \u201c0\u201d rating may indicate a number that is never abused, and a number with a \u201c100\u201d rating may indicate a number for which the majority of activity is abusive in nature. The toll-free number rating may be made available to users of the TFMP, and may be used to make routing and other decisions about the toll-free number.","Based on the rating of a toll-free number, the service provider may take a specific action to ensure legitimacy of a toll-free call. In addition to the number rating, the rating engine may also generate routing rules to be shared with service providers. These rules may be imported by the service provider into their call routing engine to automatically route abusive calls in a manner that is consistent with the routing rules. These rules may also be used in combination with user profiles and security administration may grant permissions to different groups of users to access the toll-free number rating to create, view, update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role-based access control mechanism. Predictive analytic services may be provided that allow a user, through the customizable user interface, or \u201cdashboard,\u201d to access third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network. Origination data may also be combined with social media and other public domain third party data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trend and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method comprising:\n\n","A method comprising:\n\n","A method comprising:\n\n","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A user device for presenting data to a user in real time regarding changes in metadata associated with a toll-free number, the user device configured to:\n\n","A method of toll-free telecommunications data visualization comprising:\n\n","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide a click-to-chat tool. The click-to-chat tool enables users to quickly contact a support representative through the user interface, dashboard, or other interface. The click-to-chat tool may integrate with existing web based access, provides an immediate channel to a support representative, and may facilitate support training.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide a simplified two-factor authentication tool for maintaining identity and access security (e.g. dual factor authentication). This may eliminate the need to use hard tokens and improve VPN accessibility.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide a password self-service tool that provides the ability for self-service passwords and unlock logon IDs. This may be automated via structured email processes.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide a real-time status update tool that provides number counts and tasks within the application. This may facilitate a real-time view of number counts and status (i.e. reserved, assigned, etc.)","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide integrated data stores and a reporting tool that integrates data stores for consolidated reporting. This may facilitate the creation of a single operational data store to eliminate separate software as a service licenses and consolidated reporting for responsible organizations.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide a single sign-on tool for Web Based Access (WBA), mechanized generic interface (API), Website\/Billing, Web-based Reporting System (WRS), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or some other network type.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide an enhanced configurability tool that allows administrators to configure the limit of TFN that can be reserved in a single request, for example, more than 10. This may provide, for example, up to 5000 (would then do 500 batch calls).","The present disclosure includes a toll-free management platform (TFMP) for providing services to toll free subscribers and providers, enabling them to manage a plurality of toll-free numbers and tasks associated with such numbers. Functionalities of the TFMP include, but are not limited to, Number Administration (NA) and Customer Record (CR) administration.","The TFMP enables searching for any number, random number or to search for a plurality of numbers that are consecutive and\/or include an indicated combination of digits. Since certain toll-free number codes (e.g. 800) and combinations of digits (e.g. repeating digits, digits whose corresponding telephone keypad letter values spell a word or phrase) may be considered most desirable, the NA function includes capabilities for searches and reservations to be handled so that a toll-free provider does not gain an advantage to reserve a given toll-free number. The TFMP also enables tracking the overall assignment of numbers for each toll-free provider in order to enforce regulations for toll-free number allocation specified by a tariff. NA may maintain a status for each number that reflects whether it has been reserved and whether a customer record has been created and sent to service control points (SCPs). It is possible to query the TFMP for status and reservation information associated with a number.","The TFMP enables customer record administration, allowing toll-free providers to create a customer record and to specify when the information should be sent to SCPs. A reserved toll-free number may become active when routing information for the number, specified in a customer record, is uploaded into SCPs. Customer records may be updated or deleted and the send time updated prior to sending. Once a customer record has been sent, a new record may be created to update or delete the routing specified by the previous record. The routing information specified in a customer record may include, but is not limited to:\n\n","Carriers who have arrangements to carry calls for a toll-free provider may wish to approve customer records when routing for a toll-free number has been assigned to the carrier. The customer record function may maintain a list of carriers and preferences for whether approval is required when a toll-free provider indicates the carrier in a customer record. A notification may be sent to a carrier when approval of a customer record is required. In embodiments, each customer record may have an associated status. Customer records may be queried to view the status and information contained in the record, based on the permissions of the user.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may include a user interface functionality that allows manual access for human users and mechanized access for systems (such as an application programming interface) to make use of the NA and CR functions provided by the TFMP. Such systems may be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, such systems may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks). The mechanized interface provided by the TFMP may allow external users to establish data dynamic connectivity with the platform and gain access to its available functions. The TFMP may maintain logins, passwords, encryption, authentication, and the like to provide security to limit system access to only authorized users. Permission levels that restrict access to TFMP's functions and to proprietary data may be assigned for each authorized user, and stored locally or remotely to an enterprise utilizing the TFMP, including within a computing storage facility that is remote to, but operatively coupled, with the TFMP. In embodiments, the user interface functionality may provide real time notifications and other information to external users using mechanisms such as email and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the TFMP may provide an interface to send routing information from CRs to SCPs. The SCP Management Function of the TFMP may enable management of interactions with SCPs, including maintaining data connectivity, sending CR information at the specified date and time, and monitoring responses in order to update customer record status.","In another disclosed non-limiting embodiment, the SCP administration functions of the TFMP may allow users to establish and modify SCP-related reference data in the system and send messages to the SCP node and the Call Management Services Data Base (CMSDB) within the SCP to manage data tables at the SCP. Network management functions for toll-free database services may involve the management of various automatic capabilities intended to monitor and control toll-free query traffic and calling volumes at the SCPs, Service Switching Points, terminating switches, terminating subscriber lines, and the like. When various call volume thresholds are exceeded, the SCPs may trigger Automatic Code Gapping (ACG) controls at the originating SSPs. The TFMP's management functions may allow network managers to configure and adjust relevant control parameters. Data collection at the SCPs may be requested through the TFMP to provide network managers with surveillance information that is useful to monitor traffic and analyze problems, such as the detection of SCP overloads and excessive calling or excessive ineffective attempts to dialed codes.","With reference to , in embodiments, the TFMP may provide a Toll-Free Texting and Smart Services Registry (TSS)  to support toll-free telephone numbers and related services, such as SMS, MMS and streaming media. The TSS  may include several components such as, but not limited to, number administration, call control and route provisioning, as well as number status assessment. The number administration function may provide number assignment for toll-free subscribers as well as provide services to manage the toll-free numbering plan. This component may provide for toll-free number portability as well as managing the mapping of toll-free numbers to geographic numbers. The number administration function may also open new number plan administration codes. The number administration function may forecast the exhaustion of codes and demand for codes for use by organizations such as the FCC.","The call control and routing function may be responsible for providing intelligent routing for calls made to toll-free numbers. Toll-free subscribers may have the ability to configure call routing to include multiple carriers, time of day rules, and rules based on the caller's proximity, among others. These rules may be downloaded to real-time network routing databases or Service Control Points (SCPs) . The number status assessment function may determine the availability of certain numbers. Numbers may be reserved and assigned according to activation date and then are deployed. The number status function may assess whether numbers are spare, reserved, assigned, or currently deployed.","Providers of various smart services, such as voice, media, or texting services, may be able to access the TSS that can be text enabled from a list of reserved, assigned, and working numbers. After numbers are identified, an automated online letter of authorization\/agency may be executed. The letter of authorization\/agency may independently demonstrate authorization to a responsible organization that maintains the registration for individual toll-free numbers in a distributed database. The distributed database may be associated with a distributed computing network, as described herein. Upon execution of the letter of authorization\/agency, the information may then be provisioned to industry routing databases for delivering various services, such as SMS (text) messaging, MMS messaging , and content streaming, including but not limited to video content as well as future services .","Letter of authorization\/agency, as used herein, may include but is not limited to communication used by a toll-free end subscriber, such as during the provisioning phase of a toll-free number engagement, to enable that end subscriber to switch providers for a given telephone, messaging service, and the like. In an example, an end subscriber may wish to change its long distance provider so that a local company need not be used. The long distance provider to whom the end subscriber wishes to do business would typically walk the end subscriber through an authorization process to enable the end subscriber to switch long distance carriers from the local company to the new company. This authorization may manifest in the carrier's system as a letter of authorization\/agency that documents the needed approvals from the end subscriber.","In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the TSS may enable a letter of authorization\/agency process for a provider to authorizing texting and other services on a toll-free number or plurality of toll-free numbers that are used by an end subscriber. The letter of authorization\/agency may be electronically stored and presented to the responsible organization or owner of record for a given number or service. The letter of authorization\/agency may further define a time frame during which certain actions, such as the turning on of texting services for a toll-free number, are permitted. Such letters of authorization, as defined herein, may be further associated with stored profiles of an owner of record and\/or end subscriber. A letter of authorization\/agency may allow a toll-free number end-user, or toll-free number subscriber, to authorize service enablement for services not covered by their existing responsible organization. In this way, consumers can have multiple services enabled on a single telephone number, across multiple service providers. In an example, a letter of authorization\/agency may authorize a responsible organization or other entity to take a plurality of actions so that additional communication with, for example, an end subscriber is unnecessary and actions may be taken more quickly and efficiently. This may enable service registrars, and others, to activate new services, such as toll-free texting services or bandwidth increases on a shorter timeline, which may have commercial benefits as speed activation of needed telecommunications services.","With reference to , in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the TSS may facilitate the enablement of a letter of authorization\/agency process  used to enable toll-free texting capability and capture basic data such as customer name, responsible organization, service registrar, toll free number, service enablement date, and letter of authorization\/agency, status of services, or some other type of data associated with toll-free telephone numbers and services. The TSS may facilitate the letter of authorization\/agency process by programmatically sending a notification to the responsible organization of record to memorialize the transaction. A timer may be set that will give the responsible organization a limited period of time to dispute the transaction. If no action is taken, the transaction may proceed and texting service enablement, or some other service type, may be fulfilled in the TSS Registry. Continuing the example, this letter of authorization\/agency process may be provided for each toll-free number that is provisioned  in the TSS registry, or only a subset of numbers depending on the wishes of the end users.","In order to streamline the letter of authorization\/agency process, a \u201cblanket\u201d letter of authorization\/agency may be used whereby the customer of record may authorize a specific service registrar to provision, update, and deactivate records in the TSS as needed . In such cases, a notification may be sent to the responsible organization to memorialize each transaction. In order to further streamline the letter of authorization\/agency process, responsible organization's may choose to put a \u201cblanket\u201d authorization on specific service registrar's which will allow the transaction to take place in real time .","In embodiments, the TSS may allow electronic documentation to be stored and managed, providing a library of legal documentation that may be used by the system in real time to facilitate transactions more efficiently, and to provide more concrete evidence of formal authorization through a physical electronic document proving, for example, the end user's identity and validity.","In embodiments, the TSS may operate in conjunction with current toll-free services, including a toll-free voice registry. In order to establish unambiguous authority for the use of a toll-free number, a controlling organization for a toll-free number may be the responsible organization of record in the toll-free voice registry. Number administration may be the exclusive function residing only in the authoritative toll-free voice registry.","In embodiments, the TSS may be flexible and extensible to support a plurality of toll-free services such as SMS or MMS messaging services, and content provisioning. The TSS may additionally provide toll-free numbers for services such as videos, mobile device applications, games, or any other software, products or services that may be important to an organization to anchor their identity and brand. To support this environment, in embodiments, the TSS may reside on a stand-alone platform using hardware, software, and support systems independent of those used today in the toll-free voice registry. The TSS may be able to connect to a toll-free voice registry to obtain number information, such as availability and reservation status, as well as control responsible organization information, such as the responsible organization contact information, but may remain otherwise separate in its operation.","A responsible organization may maintain a toll-free voice registry that provides number administration, route provisioning, toll-free database services to various service control points, or some other type of toll-free service. The TSS, as described herein, may incorporate the services from a toll-free voice registry to provide smart services enablement, route provisioning, and smart services registry to existing SMS\/MMS routing databases as well as other smart services requiring toll-free numbers, such as mobile device applications or games.","With reference to , in another embodiment, a mobile device  may utilize an unambiguous support identifier along with a toll-free data, message, and voice service. In this embodiment, the mobile device may be assigned a unique Toll-Free ID (TFID)  at the time of manufacturing. That is, the TFID may be agnostic of type of device and may be hard flashed into the mobile device to identify a customer with a toll free provider that is providing the toll free communication. The TFID may be associated with the carrier identifier such as IMEI, MEID if GSM phone, CDMA, a service provider identifier such as a TSPID, as described herein, or to another identifier associated with a mobile device. In another embodiment, the TFID may be associated with other systems, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","A standard support app that is natively installed, such as a \u201csetting\u201d  app distributed as part of the device, or separately though an app store, facilitates a consumer's ability to talk, message, view, browse support related features of merchandise, devices or other issues that the consumer may have. The standard support app may further interact with a user profile and security administration that grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create, view, update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role-based access control mechanism.","When consumers buy a device, the device manufacturers and retailers may \u201cauto register\u201d the device to the support application at the Point of Sale (POS). The TFID may be embedded in the hardware of the device and cannot be changed to provide a definitive way to identify a device when using toll-free services.","With reference to , in another embodiment, the TFID may permit a customer who is purchasing an appliance, a device, or other merchandise to be presented with an opportunity to associate one or more mobile devices to the merchandise purchased . For example, this can be performed at the POS or after the sale as a registration and\/or warranty process . The process of registration is thereby automated to simplify these somewhat otherwise bothersome processes for the customer.","In one example, a TFID Mobile App is operable to permit the mobile device to read QR codes, Barcodes, RFIDs, serial numbers, or other merchandise identifiers and then communicate with the manufacturer via toll free service provided by the manufacturer . For example, a user may need only point a camera of the mobile device toward the merchandise to capture the merchandise identify and thereby complete a registration, warranty, support or other process.","On the backend, a TFID Mobile App registry  may be updated with the added mobile device TFID to merchandise association. Via a separate mechanism, merchandise manufactures  can then update the registry with the contact information associated with the TFID for registration and user association. The TFID Mobile App registry may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, such systems may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","Once the merchandise is associated with the particular mobile device\u2014the TFID Mobile App may present or otherwise store the various information about the merchandise, e.g., product documentation, upgrades, manufacture contact information, etc. This permits the user to readily communicate with the manufacturer via the toll free service provided by the manufacturer and accessed via the TFID. For example, once the merchandise is associated with the mobile device, a support call registry may be made readily available from the manufacturer via a toll free service. Support such as repair and troubleshooting for the merchandise may then be more readily provided as the initial validation of the merchandise to the particular user, e.g., warranty registration and confirmation has already been automatically provided by the registry. That is, the registry facilitates more direct access to support from the manufacturer via a toll free communication provided by the manufacturer as supported by the support application on the device.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A mobile device, comprising:\n\n","A method of communication via a toll-free service, comprising:\n\n","A toll-free voice registry may share reserved, assigned, and working numbers with the TSS.

The TFMP may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners to facilitate operation of the service as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. The TFMP may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, the TFMP may include hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","Telecommunication service providers are required by industry guidelines to have a unique company code assigned to them. This unique company code identifies carriers as they interconnect with each other and allows for rating, guiding, billing and routing functionality. Historically, when service providers provided voice only services, each service provider was identified by a company code termed an Operating Company Number (OCN). With the evolution of the communications industry, service providers started introducing additional voice services, for example number portability. As these services were introduced, the need for uniquely identifying the carriers became of paramount importance. Registries and organizations were set up to facilitate the integration and interactions required to fulfill these services. Such developments prompted service organizations' need for additional context-based metadata to support these interactions (for example number portability). One result was the adding of additional identifiers to each service provider that required integration. These are sometimes referred to as the SPID or Alternate Service Provider Identifier (Alt-SPID).","With the introduction of over-the-top (OTT) providers, for example Skype, and Internet Protocol-based vendors (IP Vendors) selling traditional communication services over a full Internet Protocol (IP) network, the activities between software and the traditional telecommunications industry become more interactive. IP allowed for a new breed of vendors to integrate with traditional communication service provider networks for delivery and exchange of consumer data. This created a new set of challenges for the unique identification of service providers since the IP Vendors were not traditional carriers and did not meet industry guidelines for OCNs. Additional, sometimes proprietary metadata were created to support these new service providers, for example an eSPID, as described herein. The preponderance of different identifiers from eclectic industry organizations lead to lack of a consistent, unique way to identify and interact with service providers, with no centralized industry provider, organization or registry having a complete view of service provider community.","In an example embodiment of a service provider routing text messages though the network, as the text messages are processed the TSS may obtain metadata associated with the messages that includes coding data. By reading these codes, the TSS may confirm that a given message is derived from a service provider such as Skype for delivery to an AT&T subscriber. Such metadata may be obtained, for example, in a header file. Fields in the header file may be associated with a SPID. This may allow the TSS to determine that the text message is coming from Skype en route to ATT. If it were the case that many texts were originating from Skype at a particular time or day, the TSS may utilize this data to assist third parties in providing targeted advertising content. The TSS may also utilize this data to identify the unnecessary usage of intermediaries in processing communications such as text messages and assist users in avoiding the excess charges for intermediaries by routing messages without using intermediaries. The TSS may utilize a context-based unique identifier to distinguish specific services associated with the TSS Registry. The TSPID  may be enabled in TSS and applies to such multimedia services such as but not limited to SMS, MMS, video conferencing, and streaming data. Resp Org IDs may also be associated with any toll free number enabled in TSS. The TSPID may further facilitate the value chain of a multimedia service for toll-free numbers in order for that service to be delivered.","The Toll-Free Service Provider ID \u201cTSPID,\u201d provides an aggregate identifier for Service Registrars, who provide services such as, but not limited to, SMS, MMS, video conferencing, and streaming content that may be registered and distributed by the TSS Registry. That is, the TSPID provides a single unified identifier that may include other identifiers  over a broad distribution of data, to include, but not be limited to, traditional voice services. The TSPID may also be utilized as an authoritative identifier of the service provider of record for toll-free numbers, and\/or ultimately local 10 digit numbers. The TSPID may be enabled by a user profile and security administration that grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create, view, update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role-based access control mechanism.","Telecommunication service providers are required by industry guidelines to have a unique company code assigned to them.

Over time, many companies may map various identifiers such as the SPIDs to a broader table for use with the TSPID to still further aggregate such data. Further, traditional voice services may be mapped as well.","With the introduction of value added mobile services (for example SMS), exchanges and hubs set up by Inter Carrier Vendors (ICV) provide communication between multiple mobile network operators. Route tables are stored in industry proprietary databases that provided a call path service to determine, in real time, the destination service provider for an incoming mobile service. These ICVs further add additional metadata to identify carriers and facilitate integration. This process may have added complexity insofar as countries have their own local and regional authorities and naming conventions.","With the introduction of over-the-top (OTT) providers, for example Skype, and Internet Protocol-based vendors (IP Vendors) selling traditional communication services over a full Internet Protocol (IP) network, the activities between software and the traditional telecommunications industry become more interactive.

During the on-boarding process (e.g., toll-free number reservation and provisioning), service registrars may be required to provide their unique identifiers (UIds) with the various organizations they interact.","In embodiments, the TSS may establish a baseline of UIds by public domain information gathering. Data gathered through the public domain may be further validated through crowd sourcing, where a global, potentially mechanical human process can be used to identify, validate and confirm UIds to create a baseline for the registry. In another embodiment, latent sematic indexing may be used to associate data and metadata associated with communications to the actual owner, provider, or responsible party that is associated with a communication, such as a text message. This crowd-sourced translation table associated with the TSS may enable mapping of service providers to unique identifiers. Such a mapping would enable the a registry that may be used by third parties to locate the plurality of identifiers that may be associated with a service provider or plurality of service providers.","In order to facilitate proper content delivery, service providers may be required by the TSS to periodically update their UIds. A validation, verification and certification process may be used to ensure integrity and validity of data entering the TSS. This may provide the industry with a single resource that may be used to identify and validate the identity of service providers. In an example usage scenario, a communications company that intends to optimize its network and manage traffic, may wish to identify where its end traffic (original source) is located by looking at packet headers and identifying service providers. In another example, a consumer reports-based rating service may use the TSS to provide consumers with message or delivery metrics. Bulk-advertising (pam) management companies may use the TSS look at detailed metadata and associate a name to a code. ICVs may use the TSS to streamline establishment and setup of their recipients without requiring expensive and costly set up. Ad agencies may use data derived from the TSS to customize ads to end users by understanding the source and destination (as opposed to area codes), and personalize content based on the service provider(s), for example if the content originated on an IP network.","In an example embodiment of a service provider routing text messages though the network, as the text messages are processed the TSS may obtain metadata associated with the messages that includes coding data.

Data gathered through the public domain may be validated through crowd sourcing, where a global, potentially mechanical human process can be used to identify, validate and confirm UIds to create a baseline for the registry. Every Service Provider has a set of unique UIds by which its customers are reached by various methods such as, but not limited to, voice, short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), video conferencing, and streaming content. When any of these Service Providers signs up to be a TSS user , it has a unique UId, called a TSPID, which is assigned. This TSPID provides the baseline for which many other UIds can be mapped. Many Data Providers, Messaging Hubs, Aggregators, and others who are in the business of routing and providing services such as voice, SMS, MMS, video conferencing, streaming content, and other multimedia services, to sign on to consume TSS Data. Each of these entities that consume data will have a unique identifier to which the TSPID will be mapped. Data Providers that consume TSS data will be required to provide to TSS a new toll-free specific UId for each established TSPID. The end result is a mapping that extends to any data provider that is consuming TSS data. As distribution widens, a fairly comprehensive routing table  for each Service Provider is created.","Furthermore, each TFN that is enabled in the TSS Registry, has the Resp Org ID and Resp Org Entity associated with it, and thus is also mapped to the TSPID. The result is the most comprehensive routing table specific to toll-free numbers that will map toll-free numbers to their voice provider, messaging provider, as well as the routing information across a plurality of data providers. Once this comprehensive Toll-Free routing table  is established, it can be further extended to layer in other identifiers, such as, but not limited to local ten digit numbers (also known as \u201clong codes\u201d), SPID, LRN, OCN, and LATA.","In another embodiment, latent semantic indexing may be used to associate data and metadata associated with communications to the actual owner, provider, or responsible party that is associated with a communication, such as a text message. This crowd-sourced translation table associated with the TSS may enable mapping of service providers to unique identifiers. Such a mapping would enable a registry that may be used by third parties to locate the plurality of identifiers that may be associated with a service provider or plurality of service providers. In embodiments, toll-free number abuse information, as described herein, from a plurality of sources including, but not limited to, a telephone service provider, toll-free number operators and Resp Orgs may also be used for the purposes of creating translation tables, including but not limited to crowd-sourced translation tables. The TSS routing table, once sufficiently established, may be used for services such as value added predictive analytics, as described herein, that service providers can use to gain valuable insights about their customers. Service Providers and other consumers of the data in the routing table would access the information using either an application programming interface (API) for automated integration into their own analytics engines, or a web-based GUI for simpler one-time lookups. Below are some examples of probable use-cases for the routing table.","In order to facilitate proper content delivery, service providers may be required by the TSS to periodically update their UIds.

The TSS may comprise several components such as, but not limited to, number administration, call control and routing, as well as number status assessment. The number administration function may provide number assignment for toll-free subscribers as well as provide services to manage the toll-free numbering plan. This component may provide for toll-free number portability as well as managing the mapping of toll-free numbers to geographic numbers. The number administration function may also open new number plan administration codes. The number administration function may forecast the exhaustion of codes and demand for codes for use by organizations such as the FCC. The call control and routing function may be responsible for providing intelligent routing for calls made to toll-free numbers.","Toll-free subscribers may have the ability to configure call routing to include multiple carriers, time of day rules, and rules based on the caller's proximity, among others. These rules may be downloaded to real-time network routing databases or Service Control Points (SCPs). The number status assessment function may determine the availability of certain numbers. Numbers may be reserved and assigned according to activation date and then are deployed. The number status function may assess whether numbers are spare, reserved, assigned, or currently deployed. Providers of various smart services, such as voice, media, or texting services, may be able to access the TSS that can be text enabled from a list of reserved, assigned, and working numbers. After numbers are identified, an automated online letter of agency may be executed. The letter of agency may independently demonstrate authorization to a responsible organization that maintains the registration for individual toll-free numbers in a distributed database. The distributed database may be associated with a distributed computing network, as described herein. Upon execution of the letter of agency, the information may then be provisioned to industry routing databases for delivering various services, such as SMS (text) messaging, MMS messaging, and content streaming, including but not limited to video content.","Letter of agency, as used herein, may include but is not limited to communication used by a toll-free end subscriber, such as during the provisioning phase of a toll-free number engagement, to enable that end subscriber to switch providers for a given telephone, messaging service, and the like. In an example, an end subscriber may wish to change its long distance provider so that a local company need not be used. The long distance provider to whom the end subscriber wishes to do business would typically walk the end subscriber through an authorization process to enable the end subscriber to switch long distance carriers from the local company to the new company. This authorization may manifest in the carrier's system as a letter of agency that documents the needed approvals from the end subscriber. In an embodiment, the TSS may enable a letter of agency process for a provider to authorize texting and other services on a toll-free number or plurality of toll-free numbers that are used by an end subscriber. The letter of agency may be electronically stored and presented to the responsible organization or owner of record for a given number or service. The letter of agency may further define a time frame during which certain actions, such as the turning on of texting services for a toll-free number, are permitted. Such letters of agency, as defined herein, may be further associated with stored profiles of an owner of record and\/or end subscriber. A letter of agency may allow a toll-free number end-user, or toll-free number subscriber, to authorize service enablement for services not covered by their existing responsible organization. In this way, consumers can have multiple services enabled on a single telephone number, across multiple service providers. In an example, a letter of agency may authorize a responsible organization or other entity to take a plurality of actions so that additional communication with, for example, an end subscriber is unnecessary and actions may be taken more quickly and efficiently. This may enable service registrars, and others, to activate new services, such as toll-free texting services or bandwidth increases on a shorter timeline, which may have commercial benefits as speed activation of needed telecommunications services.","In an embodiment, the TSS may facilitate the enablement of a letter of agency process used to enable toll-free texting capability and capture basic data such as customer name, responsible organization, service registrar, toll free number, service enablement date, and letter of authorization\/agency, status of services, or some other type of data associated with toll-free telephone numbers and services. The TSS may facilitate the letter of agency process by programmatically sending a notification to the responsible organization of record to memorialize the transaction. A timer may be set that will give the responsible organization a limited period of time to dispute the transaction. If no action is taken, the transaction may proceed and texting service enablement, or some other service type, may be fulfilled in the TSS Registry. Continuing the example, this letter of agency process may be provided for each toll-free number that is provisioned in the TSS Registry, or only a subset of numbers depending on the wishes of the end users. In order to streamline the letter of agency process, a \u201cblanket\u201d letter of agency may be used whereby the customer of record may authorize a specific service registrar to provision, update, and deactivate records in the TSS as needed. In such cases, a notification may be sent to the responsible organization to memorialize each transaction. In order to further streamline the letter of agency process, responsible organization's may choose to put a \u201cblanket\u201d authorization on specific service registrar's which will allow the transaction to take place in real time.","In embodiments, the TSS Registry, as described herein may be an authoritative database of all, or some subset of, text-enabled toll-free numbers in North America. It may also contain the top-level routing information, in the form of a toll-free service provider identifier (TSPID), used by the texting ecosystem to send messages to the proper toll-free subscriber. Since a letter of agency is required for each toll-free number that is enabled in the TSS, the TSPID may become a centralized and authoritative source identifier and may be used in the provisioning of additional services associated with toll-free numbers such as, but not limited to MMS, video conferencing, and streaming data. Furthermore, since part of the enablement process includes Responsible Organization authorization and\/or notification, coupled with the direct connection to a voice telecommunications platform associated with the TFMP, the TSPID may also serve to validate the authority of a call routing table.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method of identifying and storing an identifier associated with a toll-free-communication entity, comprising:\n\n","A method of creating and storing an identifier associated with a toll-free-communication entity, comprising:\n\n","A method of identifying and storing an identifier associated with a toll-free-communication entity, comprising:\n\n","With reference to , a system according to various embodiments, and which may be referred to in some instances herein as an intelligent platform, platform, or an architecture, is operable to support the ever evolving toll-free industry through the use of modern technologies which may include enhanced functionality and deliver improved cost efficiencies and quality of service.","The architecture depicted in  may include aspects such as:\n\n","The architecture depicted in  may include the components in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0400","num":"0552"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Component","Decision","Rationale"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Application","Apply Service-oriented (SOA) and","SOA and EDA create loose"]},{"entry":["Platform","event-driven (EDA) design","coupling and high cohesion,"]},{"entry":[{},"throughout the application.

Data may be real-time grouped, aggregated and reduced based on toll-free numbers and relevant parameters, including but not limited to origination location, originating area of service, originating NPA, ANI, or some other criterion. Call counts may be calculated for high priority numbers. Data may be enriched with call duration information when it is available. This process may assist in reducing the overall data set size and speeding processing. A local NoSQL data store may be used to aggregate local trends and pre-process raw data.","In embodiments, once pre-processing completes, data may be shared in real time, or near real time, to a centralized analytics data store  that is associated with the TFMP for more real time mapping and reduction. The analytics NoSQL datamart may combine data feeds from various service providers from the network and further reduce information to call counts, call completion rates and call duration for high priority numbers. This subsystem of the TFMP may gather historical macroeconomic data from market sources  like Bloomberg\u2122 and Reuters\u2122 and create a reference data store that groups and summarizes economic trends month over month. This subsystem may serve as a reference data source for the analysis, inference and indexing system.","In embodiments, this subsystem may collect historical call completion and call count data from high priority numbers and apply mapping and data reduction techniques to create historical baselines for calls. Calls may be sourced from market data sources, data purchases, data bartering from call sources, or through some other type of data source. Call sampling and aggregation may be iteratively performed until a statistically significant dataset is created (e.g., over a tuning period). Multi-factor models may be created for correlating toll-free call activity with selected macroeconomic trends, backed by high priority numbers tied to businesses. For example, calls to toll-free numbers for employment commissions in the 50 states may be tied to a forward-looking indicator for unemployment and consumer sentiment.","In another example, historical changes in macroeconomic data may be plotted with changes in call metrics like call volume, call duration, or some other data related to toll-free data. This may provide a correlation between telemetry and economic indicators. Financial modeling techniques may be applied, and additional factors may be analyzed, including but not limited to consumer sentiment, including sentiment that is sourced by social media comments and online behaviors related to relevant topics (e.g., questions regarding unemployment benefits or questions regarding food stamps). Interrelationships between indicators may also be analyzed. Credit card spending data may be an additional factor analyzed. These underlying factors may drive stochastic probabilities to determine a prediction model that may be utilized by the TFMP. The TFMP system may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs to facilitate the stochastic probabilities to determine a prediction model. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. The output of the model may be a prediction trend  that can forecast the probability of a relative positivity or negativity of the upcoming indicator. Data from the analytics data store and the historical trends data store may be analyzed through a multi-factor model for deriving a macro economic trend indicator and a relative level of confidence with the trend.","In embodiments, a client device  such as an online and\/or a mobile application may allow users to filter, search and sort trend data, increase or reduce granularity, include or exclude factors and zone in or drill down based on dimensions. For example, a user may choose to include or exclude a state from the model to derive a trend prediction and a prediction confidence indicator. Alternatively or in addition, a customizable user interface, or \u201cdashboard,\u201d may be utilized to provide access for third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described, origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP. Further, the user profile and security administration grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create, view, update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role-based access control mechanism.","In embodiments, this analytic subsystem of the TFMP may provide a flexible mapping interface for a user  to enter their own data as part of an analysis. Once configured, additional data sources may be added in real time, or near real time, through an API or a web interface to further refine the model based on customer specific data sets to make intelligent business decisions. The system may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, such systems may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","The system may also provide a marketplace for data trading where subscribers can choose and buy data sources that are of interest to them to include in their analysis to further refine their predictive model. The system may facilitate the sale of data sources and assist in ensuring that the data uploaded and made available on the data market is scrubbed of personally identifiable or other sensitive data. For facilitating the data sale, the system may charge a percentage of the sale proceeds in addition to an annual or monthly subscription fees. For consumers interested in a monthly subscription, overall sentiment data may be made available through a number trend report. Alerts may be presented to users, such as to a client device. The user may also access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device, such as a personal computer, mobile phone, tablet computer, or some other computing facility, and receive data, including multimedia to the user's client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include, but are not limited to, Number Administration (NA) and Customer Record (CR) administration.","In embodiments, the TFMP may provide macroeconomic data trend over a network to a remote client device, by providing a user interface dashboard to a user for installation on the remote client device; receiving third party social media data; modeling at least one of call duration or call count data with the third party social media data to derive a macroeconomic trend; receiving a request from the remote client device to present the macroeconomic data trend; generating an alert from the macroeconomic data trend that contains a stock name, stock price and a universal resource locator (URL), which specifies the location of the data source; and transmitting the alert over a communication channel to the remote client device associated with the user based upon a destination address and transmission schedule that is associated with the remote client device, wherein the alert activates the user interface dashboard to cause the alert to display on the remote client device and to enable connection with the user interface dashboard when the remote client device is activated.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method comprising:\n\n","A method comprising:\n\n","A method of distributing a macroeconomic data trend over a network to a remote client device, the method comprising:\n\n","With reference to , in another embodiment, a toll-free management platform (TFMP) may refine a recommendation for a toll-free number search via a recommendation engine that utilizes a searcher's profile to improve the search. The toll-free management platform (TFMP) may utilize other assets of a toll-free system generally, such as carrier data, location information regarding call origination, payment data and so forth. The TFMP system may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. In one example, the toll-free number search may be based upon a customer's historical data such as prior search criteria and existing toll-free numbers, and thereby provide the customer suggestions or notification of toll-free numbers that are available for use. This toll-free number search may be based upon previous searches by either that customer and alternatively or in addition, upon other customer searches.","The toll-free number predictive search is operable to utilize multiple sources of data to extrapolate possible toll-free numbers and those included in a Resp Org and\/or user's search history to include, but not be limited to, a current Resp Org inventory, an overall search history, lists of upcoming available numbers, or some other type of data. Predictive analytics is an area of data mining that deals with extracting information from data and using it to predict trends and behavior patterns. The toll-free number predictive search is operable for the user profile and security administration grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create, view, update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role-based access control mechanism.","Predictive analytics utilized for the predictive search may encompass a variety of statistical techniques from predictive modeling, machine learning, and data mining that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future, or otherwise unknown, events. Predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. Predictive analytic services may also be provided that allow a user, through the customizable user interface, or dashboard, to access third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network.

That is, the toll-free number may be automatically reserved if it meets particular search criteria to essentially automate the reservation thereof. Further, the automatic reservation may be a fee-based function in which particular bidders are able to prioritize the choice of toll free numbers via particular fee based arrangements.","In embodiments, initially, a user may be provided the option to opt in to the toll-free number predictive search feature as well as the option to automatically reserve toll-free numbers determined to be available based upon the predictive search. That is, rather than wait for a request, a customer-desired number is predicted, offered, and potentially reserved. The user may also access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device, such as a personal computer, mobile phone, tablet computer, or some other computing facility, and receive data, including multimedia to the user's client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include, but are not limited to, Number Administration (NA) and Customer Record (CR) administration.

In contrast, with toll-free service the subscriber is assigned a toll-free telephone number and is billed for all calls terminated to that number. There is no charge to the originator of the toll-free call.","Toll-free number portability made it possible for any company to provide service for any available toll-free number. FCC Tariff No. 1\u00d7, 800 Service Management system functions specified the functionality of a Service Management system that would be operated by the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs). One embodiment of a tariff is Tariff F.C.C. No. 1\u00d7, 800 Service Management System Functions, Issued Jan. 31, 2013, Effective Feb. 15, 2013. A disclosed embodiment, originally developed and maintained by Bellcore, facilitates a company that wishes to provide toll-free service (referred to as a Responsible organization\/Resp Org\/toll-free service provider) to obtain control of toll-free numbers and provision of the information in the network needed to route calls to a designated terminating number. (This information is sometimes referred to as a Customer Record.) This tariff outlines the requirements for becoming a toll-free service provider, the capabilities required of the disclosed embodiment to allow toll-free service providers to search for and reserve toll-free numbers and provision Customer Record information, and how toll-free service providers may be to be billed for use of the disclosed embodiment and control of toll-free numbers.","With geographic portability made possible through the use of centralized routing databases, it became possible for the same toll-free number to be dialed from anywhere in the country and for the toll-free call to be delivered to different destinations based on routing criteria specified in the Customer Record. Toll-free service quickly grew in popularity, and the supply of available 800 numbers neared exhaustion. The toll-free code 888 was opened in 1996, followed by 877 in 1998, 866 in 2000, and 855 in 2010. Plans may be underway for opening of the 844 code in the near future and the FCC tariff has designated the future use of the 833 and 822 codes. As the value of toll-free service and the advantages to having a meaningful combination of digits in a toll-free number (referred to as a vanity number) became increasingly apparent, numerous companies became toll-free service providers and established businesses selling toll-free service. Today, there may be more than 450 toll-free service providers, including telecommunications network providers, resellers, and independent organizations.","To understand routing of toll-free calls, it may be useful to understand how routing is performed for standard (i.e., not toll-free) calls.","With reference to , the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) , introduced in the 1940s, established the 10-digit telephone number format used in the United States, Canada, and neighboring countries in the Caribbean. The format, shown in  consists of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area (NPA) code, and a seven-digit telephone number that includes three digits that identify an office code or local exchange and four digits that identify the individual number within the office code. The NPA, or area code, uniquely identifies a geographic area, the office code uniquely identifies a central office switching system (historically referred to as an exchange) within an NPA, and the line number points to the service components and dedicated resources in the switching system that provide the service instance identified by the line number.","When toll-free service was introduced in 1967, telephone calls were routed using information provisioned in each Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) local switching system. A routing table specified how the switch should process an originating call based on the digits dialed by the calling party and the arrangement of facilities that connected the switch to other switches. A switch has direct connections to other switches in the same area and connections to intermediate switches called tandems that provide the next hop toward other switches operated by the same company. Additional connections to specialized tandems provide access to long distance networks to transport calls to switches outside the local area. The local area where a company provides services is known as a Local Access and Transport Area (LATA).","The NPA or NPA-NXX of the dialed called party number identifies an entry in the routing table that points to the route needed to transport the call toward the terminating switch that serves the dialed line number. Initially, calls within a local area only required 7-digit dialing (just the NXX and the final 4 digits), but as the demand for telephone numbers grew, additional area codes were opened within a local area, and it became necessary to dial 10 digits for both local and long distance calls. If the digits dialed may be for an NPA-NXX served by the same switch, the routing table can indicate that a call should be offered to the subscriber identified by the telephone number. If the digits dialed indicate a NPA-NXX not served by the switch, the routing table can point to a route to a neighboring local switch, a local tandem, or a long-distance tandem.","Unlike a typical NPA, the 800 code introduced to identify toll-free numbers does not identify a unique area to which a call can be routed. To support toll-free service, additional entries had to be made in each local switch routing table to indicate the route for an 800-NXX code. Calling a particular 800 number was limited to the local switches that had been provisioned with routing information for that number. Additionally, further routing information was required at a terminating switch to map the 800 number to the terminating line.","In the early 1980s, AT&T introduced centralized call routing databases to handle routing of 800 calls. With a centralized database, it was not necessary to provision routing information for toll-free numbers in every local switch. Instead, switches were configured to query the database for routing information when it was recognized that an 800 number had been dialed. The database can be provisioned with routing information to direct a call to a route based on many factors, providing flexibility and removing the association of an 800 number to a specific local switch. This made it possible for a company to own a national 800 number and for calls to that number to be routed to a different local switch depending on where the call originated or the time of day. The flexibility provided by centralized call routing databases also enabled any carrier to provide service for any 800 number. Both geographic and carrier portability for toll-free service had become possible.","Today, in addition to toll-free calling, services like local number portability, operator services, and Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) features, make use of advanced routing capabilities enabled by signaling system 7 (SS7).","With reference to , in the SS7 network , the local switch is known as a Service Switching Point (SSP). A Signal Transfer Point (STP)  provides routing of SS7 messages, and databases with call routing and feature information may be known as Service Control Points (SCP) . To enable advanced routing via a centralized database, local switch routing tables may be configured to trigger a query to a database for additional call processing instructions based on various criteria.","In the case of a toll-free call origination, the switch can recognize the 8XX code in the dialed digits and launch a query to an SCP for routing information using the SS7 Signaling Connection Control Part (SCCP) protocol to transport a Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) query.","As shown in , the query may be routed by an STP to an SCP that has been provisioned with the information that describes how to route the toll-free call. In some cases the initial SCP that is queried by the local switch can return information that can cause the call to be routed to a switch operated by another carrier where a subsequent query to a different SCP can be performed to obtain the routing information needed to direct the call to the destination.","The routing information, consisting of a carrier code and terminating number, is returned in a TCAP response to the originating switch. The switch uses the information to select a route from its routing database and continues processing  of the toll-free call.","Toll-free number administration includes management of number assignment and provisioning of customer records. This section describes the toll-free business, the key stakeholders, roles and responsibilities, and disclosed embodiment capabilities.","Key aspects of the toll-free number business may be described by the FCC tariff. This tariff, describing \u201cregulations, rates and charges applying to the provisioning of functions and support services\u201d was first released in 1993. Updates have occurred since, with the latest released January, 2013, becoming effective in February, 2013. This tariff describes the undertakings of the company responsible for the disclosed embodiment and the capabilities required of embodiments of the system itself. It defines key terminology and specifies the responsibilities of toll-free service providers, who may be the primary users of the disclosed embodiment. It also provides a schedule of rates and charges with regulations for billing toll-free service providers for disclosed embodiment access and usage. System requirements defined by this, or any other, tariff may be provided in \u201cBusiness Rules\u201d Section.","Some key participants in the toll-free business  and the interactions between them may be illustrated in . Note that a primary geographic area for the toll-free business is the United States, Canada, and other areas where the NANP is used.","A toll-free subscriber contacts a toll-free service provider to order toll-free service. The toll-free service provider may be a carrier who operates a network or may have a relationship with a network provider in order to enable service. The toll-free service provider has an interface to the disclosed embodiment to search the pool of unassigned toll-free numbers and reserve one or more for use by the toll-free subscriber. Working with the toll-free subscriber, the Resp. Org determines how calls to the toll-free number should be routed.","On behalf of the toll-free subscriber, the toll-free service provider enters a Customer Record in the disclosed embodiment that specifies routing and carrier information for the toll-free number. The disclosed embodiment sends this information to the SCPs that control real-time routing of calls in the network. When the SCPs have received the routing information in the customer record, toll-free service is enabled for the toll-free number.","The toll-free subscriber has a business relationship with the toll-free service provider  to pay for toll-free service. The toll-free service provider has a relationship with the TFMP to pay for access to the disclosed embodiment and use of the toll-free number assigned to the toll-free subscriber.","There may be a number of stakeholders that play key roles in the toll-free business, which may include those that follow:","FCC \u2014The FCC is the federal agency that has responsibility for the FCC tariff that specifies the need for a toll-free number Service Management system and defines the regulations, rates, and charges applicable for the use of system functions and support services. The FCC may approve changes to rates or other aspects of the FCC tariff.","The TFMP \u2014The TFMP is responsible for the administration and operations of the disclosed embodiment and enforcement of the regulations outlined by a tariff. The TFMP may retain a number of contractors to assist with the activities required to manage the disclosed embodiment and related functions, including maintaining the disclosed embodiment software, running the data centers that house the disclosed embodiment, performing routine and corrective maintenance activities on the disclosed embodiment hardware, handling billing for access and use of the disclosed embodiment, and running the help desk to handle questions and requests from disclosed embodiment users.","Administrators and the TFMP Help Desk personnel can access the disclosed embodiment. Administrators can enter and maintain configuration and reference information needed for operation of the disclosed embodiment. Help Desk personnel can assist with troubleshooting access and Customer Record issues, complete TFMP Requests, and submit trouble reports.","Toll-Free Subscribers\u2014Toll-free subscribers may be the end users of toll-free service. Toll-free service includes a toll-free telephone number and the network capabilities that enable calls to a toll-free number to be delivered to a designated terminating number according to conditions specified by the toll-free subscriber. Toll-free service is obtained from a toll-free service provider.","Toll-free service providers (aka Resp Orgs)\u2014Toll-free service providers may be responsible for the overall coordination required to provision, maintain, and test toll-free service. A toll-free service provider may be a carrier that operates a network or instead could be an independent company or organization that interfaces with a carrier to arrange toll-free service. Toll-free service providers may be the primary users of disclosed embodiment. In embodiments, the system may be used to search for and reserve toll-free numbers for subscribers and provision Customer Records that provide the network with the information needed to route toll-free calls. Toll-free service providers may be billed for access and use of the disclosed embodiment and control of toll-free numbers on a monthly basis as described by a tariff.","Toll-free service providers often maintain sub-organizations based on geography or other organization classifications. The toll-free service provider entity is the top-level organization against which reservation limits may be imposed (represented by the first 2 digits of toll-free service provider ID in the current system). The sub-organization within a toll-free service provider entity (represented by the full 5 digit toll-free service provider ID in the current system) is referred to as a toll-free service provider unit. The toll-free service provider users who access the disclosed embodiment can be associated with a toll-free service provider unit and the corresponding toll-free service provider entity. A toll-free service provider entity may manage many toll-free service provider units, each having a unique toll-free service provider ID.","SCP Owners\/Operators (SCP O\/O)\u2014SCPs may be the databases in the SS7 network that contain the information used to route toll-free calls. SCP Owners\/Operators contract with the TFMP to receive updates from the disclosed embodiment. An interface is established between the disclosed embodiment and the SCPs so Customer Record information can be provisioned to SCPs to enable the real-time routing of toll-free calls. SCP O\/Os may be billed for this service.","At SCP O\/O companies, the SCP administrator is responsible for establishing reference data about the SCPs and their corresponding SS7 networks. The administrator also manages tables at the SCP node and the Call Management Services Database (CMSDB) within the SCP to set controls and limits for SCP operations. They may be permitted to access and change data only for the O\/O's SCPs in the SS7 network.","A network manager is a member of Network Management Center (NMC) or Network Operations Center (NOC) at the SCP O\/O company staff responsible for managing mass calling surveillance and control capabilities in its managed SS7 networks.","SCP O\/O SCP administrators and SCO O\/O Network managers may be users of the disclosed embodiment.","Billing Administrator\u2014This function coordinates the Billing of all customers, using information provided in the disclosed embodiment.","Industry and Regulatory Liaison\u2014This function uses information in the disclosed embodiment to respond to inquiries or to make inquiries to the regulatory bodies.","Carriers\u2014Actual telephone entity that carries the toll-free call. Carriers operate networks that process telephone calls. Local-Exchange Carriers (LECs) operate end office switches that provide access service to subscribers and carry calls within a local area, known as a LATA. Interexchange carriers (IC) carry calls between local areas. A subscriber receives service from a local-exchange carrier and designates the default IC to carry calls between LATAs. Historically, local carriers and ICs were distinct, but today a carrier can be both a LEC and an IC. A carrier may also be an SCP O\/O, or a carrier may obtain SS7 signaling and database services from a separate SCP O\/O.","With reference to , in one disclosed embodiment, the architecture  for a solution for toll-free with key enhancements to support the unique requirements for toll-free number administration and call routing is illustrated.","With reference to , in one disclosed embodiment, the architecture  provides number administration capabilities for toll-free numbers facilitating integration between PSTN and an IP network. This unified platform can serve both PSTN and IP enabled numbers.","Toll-free subscribers work with Resp Orgs to search and reserve toll-free numbers. Responsible organizations continue to populate the disclosed architecture with CICs for PSTN numbers and an NS Records for IP-enabled numbers.","The disclosed embodiments of the architecture can store additional metadata (for example: toll-free CNAM, industry code, description, license status, trade group affiliations, BBB ratings and such) for the toll-free organization. As the transition completes, toll-free calls would provide consumer assurance through a validated neutral third party trust chain to significantly improve consumer confidence and prevent identity fraud.","In addition to the NS Record for the iSCP, Resp Orgs can choose to configure aspects of the routing logic with the disclosed architecture (second dip). They can map a SIP URI to a toll-free record. In this example scenario, a Resp Org would copy over that information with the iSCPs. In addition to the enhanced aspects of the iSCP, the iSCP may also facilitate direct IP interconnects between RespOrgs and their service providers, if desired, through sharing additional metadata about a route.","With reference to , Toll-free numbers  (unlike mobile and landline numbers) have evolved to be a branding and identity vehicle. Companies are increasingly using their toll-free numbers along with their online assets to provide an integrated customer experience. With this growth, availability of vanity numbers has become sparse and demand is increasing. In embodiments, a toll-free tagging service may be provided that includes a subscription-based service that is made available to Responsible Organizations (Resp Orgs), consumers and businesses. The toll-free tagging service may provide the ability to tag a toll-free number (or group of numbers), and once a number is tagged, to track updates to that number (e.g., a change in ownership, change in availability, increase in search statistics) that may then be distributed (\u201cpushed\u201d) to customers through emails\/text messages or other means. Subscribers of the toll-free tagging service may also have the ability to create, view, update and delete tags through a web application, mobile application, or some other user interface.","The toll-free tagging service may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, the toll-free tagging service may be utilized via hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks). The toll-free tagging service may permit the user to access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device, such as a personal computer, mobile phone, tablet computer, or some other computing facility, and receive data, including multimedia to the user's client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include, but are not limited to, Number Administration (NA) and Customer Record (CR) administration.","In embodiments, subscribers may be provided options to create custom toll-free number tags based on keywords, using a website. Subscribers may have the option to choose, for example:\n\n","In embodiments, the system may ingest data from a plurality of sources, including but not limited to the following:\n\n","In embodiments, the TFMP  may allow for differentiated services based on subscriptions through a user interface . For example, service offerings may be tiered:\n\n","In embodiments, the tagging service of the TFMP may provide an unbiased valuation for a number or group of numbers based on several factors including, but not limited to:\n\n","In embodiments, the tagging service of the TFMP may source data from distributed data sniffers that reside in networks to see dip rate and dip volume for popular numbers. This data may be compiled with other data sources including, for example, Google\u2122 and Alexa\u2122 trends (or other web traffic data and analytics) for tags and provide a heat map that shows \u201chot spots\u201d for where the numbers are in demand and who is calling these numbers, nationally and internationally. In another example, a view may be provided that is a near real time valuation trend (e.g., analogous to a stock ticker) for, say, the top 10 tags\/numbers by state\/city. Current methods are limited in that they cannot combine call origination data, with social media and other public domain data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map, however the methods and systems of the TFMP enable such functionality.","The toll-free tagging service may alternatively or additionally utilize the TFMP system and may include a subsystem, referred to as a \u201cnode,\u201d that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. Tagging data associated with toll-free numbers may be used, including with real-time network information and static call routing information, to create a real-time call path score. In an example, a toll-free number that is associated with spoofing or other fraudulent call activity may be tagged as a problematic number and a call route assigned to it to minimize the financial impact of receiving a high volume of fraudulent calls to the toll-free number. SCPs may also be a source of real-time call routing data and data used for tagging purposes. Using this information facilitates extrapolation and determination of uptime, downtime, congestion, geographical movement and economic movement of people communicating via calls. Based on real-time data that can be obtained from the SCPs and from the network, the TFMP may create a score that can be assigned to each call decision node. Such a score may also be used for the purposes of tagging. Similar to a mapping algorithm that uses distance and speed limit, given a starting point and a destination, the quickest or shortest map may be mapped. Changes in the call routing tree may be dependent upon an update to the routing tree that is then validated by the TFMP and then downloaded to the SCPs. With the use of real-time data, and more network decisions nodes added to a call routing tree based on the needs of the end subscriber, the TFMP may provide the ability to allow an end subscriber to have real-time business continuity for their toll-free number instead of having to contact their service provider, or getting a ticket opened to update their routing tree, and then having it download to all the SCPs for the new routing to take place. In embodiments, a call path score and real-time routing may be based on the best possible availability score. This may also be modified by the TFMP to allow for lowest cost score, based on the per-call and per-minute cost for particular carrier. The call score may be updated during low activity periods with a date\/time stamp associated with it. This may allow real-time, or near real time, detection of a path's status. Upon completion of a call down a particular path, the TFMP may also update the call path score and the data used for the purposes of tagging. Further, real time status changes in a telecommunications network, the performance of a given call route, or some other status change, may be used as additional tagging data. In an example, a toll-free number that may experience a season high-demand may begin to operate less efficiently, this metadata  may be tagged to the toll-free number for use in, for example, predictive analytics provided by the TFMP regarding temporal changes in call activities and the optimization of certain call routes. Toll-free numbers tagged as having significant seasonal variation in call volume, or some other criterion, may have additional enhanced routing trees created for the purpose of handling peak seasonal call demands. A plurality of tagged numbers may be further associated with a TSPID so that a common entity associated with the toll-free numbers may be identified.","In embodiments, number trend optimization  may be provided by the TFMP in order to provide recommendations to target the right audience for a number. Recommendations may include marketing a number on a certain media within a certain geography to promote calls to the right customer. Call origination data (in partnership with the call originators and service control points (SCPs)) will be sources to provide effectiveness metrics to users based on, for example, originating numbers and derived call success rates (based on average call duration) and call completion. The toll-free tagging service may alternatively or additionally be utilized with predictive analytic services that allow a user, through the customizable user interface, or \u201cdashboard,\u201d to access third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described, origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trend and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method comprising:\n\n","A method comprising:\n\n","A method comprising:\n\n","With reference to , routing information in NS records  may be downloaded to originating service provider (SP) ENUM or similar directory for call control. PSTN Call originations can continue existing PSTN 8xx call flow.","IP call originations can use an intelligent ENUM-like and SIP enabled intelligent Service Control Point (iSCP). In embodiments, many geographically redundant, highly available iSCP servers can reside in the originating service providers or provided by independent third parties. iSCPs can operate in mixed mode (SIP and PSTN) or be exclusively SIP. iSCPs provide ENUM like functionality enhanced with intelligent routing capabilities required for toll-free routing.","For IP call originations, the originating service provider queries its local naming (ENUM-like capability) server for call routing. The SP ENUM or similar service delegates the 8xx number queries to the iSCPs (similar to level 2 DNS). iSCPs execute intelligent call routing logic, and return a SIP Redirect with a URI for the SIP gateway of the toll-free service provider. The originating service provider can then route the SIP INVITE to the terminating toll-free subscriber's service provider.","For IP calls terminating to the PSTN network, the originating service provider queries its ENUM server similar to IP termination as described above, with the iSCP returning the URI for a PSTN gateway.","Toll-free numbers follow the NANP 10-digit format (NPA-NXX-XXXX) used for all telephone numbers in North America. A toll-free NPA designated by the FCC, such as 800 or 888, identifies a number as a toll-free number. Toll-free numbering may follow the E.164 format for identifying telephone numbers. The disclosed embodiment maintains status and associated information for the complete pool of toll-free numbers.","The Number Administration function provides the ability for a user to perform any of the following capabilities:\n\n","Except when noted otherwise, all number reservations may be taken and processed on a first come\/first served basis. In embodiments, this may be due to a tariff requirement and true regardless of the source of the request.","A status is associated with each toll-free number that changes based on user actions to search for and reserve numbers and to provision and delete Customer Records for a number. Other status changes may be made automatically by embodiments of the system based on rules specified by a tariff.","The business rules around status change in the may include:\n\n","For all statuses except usually SPARE and UNAVAILABLE, a toll-free service provider entity may be associated with the number. This association begins when the toll-free service provider entity takes control of the number by completing a reservation.

A list of appropriate or related toll free numbers and an option to reserve and activate is thereby provided in a one-click or relatively one-click manner.","For a Resp Org\/Toll Free Service Provider, the widget  can be embedded in their portal. The widget  provides a login page such that the widget  provides a text field to reserve toll-free numbers along with a drop down list of numbers that expire in the next month and a popup link to extend. A popup link may also provide historical information such as their last  actions. The widget  may also display a popup link to display status of the toll-free numbers in which a user previously indicated interest.","In the toll-free industry, it currently is a multi-step process to obtain a toll-free number and submit a request to active that number. It requires the user to first search and reserve a number and then in a separate transaction, often on a separate user screen, input the information to create a toll-free number routing record that is sent to the service control points (SCPs), thus activating the number for use. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, users may complete such a request related to activation of a toll-free number in a single user interaction with the system, providing minimal information. This process may provide a one-click-type functionality, hereinafter referred to as one-click activate, to activate the number, and will, in the same single-step user activation search for the toll-free number based upon user criteria. Initiation of the one-click activation may be facilitated by the use of a widget, as described herein, such as a widget operating on a client device. In embodiments, a one-click activate request may be a request from a user to 1) search for a number, or multiple numbers, that fit a provided search criteria, 2) reserve the number(s) matching the criteria, and 3) activate the number(s) using a selected customer record template, as described herein, and producing a pointer record. The final result of this request will be a toll-free number assigned to the user's Resp Org that has a customer pointer record assigned to it.","In embodiments, a user may utilize a new user interface screen, including but not limited to a customizable dashboard, as described herein, that may be accessed from a landing page of the user interface that is associated with the TFMP. The new screen may be referred to as the \u201cSearch\u2014Reserve\u2014Active,\u201d also referred to herein as the S-R-A, from the landing page. A user may be required to have the correct permissions to be able to perform these actions, such as:\n\n","The S-R-A may also provide for predictive analytic services that may be provided to a user, through the customizable user interface, or dashboard, to access third party data services, sponsored data and information derived from toll-free telecommunications networks, including but not limited to telecommunications carriers, service control points, call centers, or other parties affiliated with a toll-free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described, origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data, and near real-time, apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.","In embodiments, the S-R-A screen may be a clone of a number search screen that is associated with the TFMP, and have, but not be limited to, the following screen design elements:\n\n","With reference to , a sample UI design  is provided. The UI may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment, such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment, the UI may be hybrid networks, including usage of a cellular telephone network (and associated mobile communication devices, such as smart phones), a distributed, cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization (and any combination or sub-combination of such networks).","In embodiments, when a user selects the S-R-A function of the landing page, the system may retrieve a list of customer template records that have been defined for a Resp Org. If this Resp Org does not have any customer template records defined, the user may receive a message notifying the user of a lack of required definition, such as \u201cE205: Search, Reserve, & Activate functionality requires the users Resp Org to have at least one customer template record defined. Your Resp Org does not.\u201d The user may then be returned to the Landing page. If the Resp Org does have customer template records defined, the customer template record names may be displayed in a scrolling list on the screen. The user may then select one of the customer template records for use in the request.","In embodiments, a user may select a number search criterion that provides the ability to specify a specific number, a number with wildcard selection, or the NPA, NXX, and line number selections. The user may elect to have a set of default information (template, effective date, and service order number and so forth) associated with their Resp Org and\/or user ID. Rather than select these items, the user may elect to use default values that are provided, thus expediting the process even further. The user may also elect not to use the default values, and may then supply the values. The search process may also include utilizing predictive analytics of the TFMP, as described herein, in order to learn more about the history and metadata that is associated with a number. Toll-free numbers, including those that are reserved and\/or activated using the one-click activation may be tagged, using the methods and systems described herein, according to criteria of interest to a user. In an example, a user may search for toll-free numbers based on a predictive analytic result of toll-free numbers the TFMP has determined are active in the New England area. Predictive analytic results may also relate to specific populations of interest to a user (e.g., New York residents), behavioral data, or some other data parameter.","In embodiments, a number may then be reserved and\/or activated and tagged by the user as a number that is relevant to the New England marketplace. Prior to reserving or activating a number, a user may also check a TFMP registry to determine if there is a history of reports of abuse associated with the number, for example frequent fraudulent calls (i.e., \u201cspoofing\u201d). The user may tag toll-free numbers in order to note this history of abuse, or other factor of interest, for future searches, and reserved or activated numbers may be associated with a toll-free service provider identifier (TSPID). The TSPID may be an existing TSPID that the user has, or as part of the one-click to activate method and system, a new TSPID may be created for the user. The user may select a customer template record from a list to be used when creating a pointer record used to active toll free number(s). The user may select only one customer template record to be used and that template record may be used with every number requested in this particular request. The user may select an effective date and time for the request. The user may further specify a future date and time or select \u201cnow\u201d for immediate processing. Formatting and validation criteria may also be provided. The user may complete additional fields as necessary for a pointer record to be created:\n\n","In embodiments, once all the required fields are populated, the user may select the \u201cActivate New Number\u201d button to start the process. The process may include the search of, and reservation for, the toll-free number(s), and the submission of a request to create a pointer record for the number(s). Errors encountered along the way may result in an error being reported back to the user for that number. In an example, requests of more than ten numbers may be processed in the background, from the perspective of the user. The user's request may be validated and the user provided a request ID. Control of the one-click activate function may be given back to the user with a notice that they will be informed when the request completes. In another example, requests for ten or fewer numbers may be processed in real time and the results are returned to the user when the request completes.","In embodiments, the one-click activate function may perform a search and reserve function for all the requested numbers in blocks of up to ten numbers, depending upon how many numbers are requested. The activation function of the process may require a separate system request for each number being activated. The one-click activate function may control the processing of the individual requests so that, from a user standpoint, it appears as a single user interaction with the system, and a response does not go back to the user until the process has been completed. Once the request has completed processing, the one-click activate function may display back to the user in the search results area of the screen (e.g., ten or fewer numbers) the list of numbers and information about them similar to how it is done with the search and reserve functionality, as described herein. For more than, for example, ten numbers, the results may be made available in the communication area off the landing page.","In embodiments, a parking lot functionality may allow a user to go through a similar one-click activate process, but instead of establishing specific routing for a number via a customer record template, the user may define the routing for this number as \u201cparked.\u201d Parked in this context means that the number may have a default routing to a pre-defined customer announcement so the number can be activated without a final determination of the routing and when called, the user may be presented with this announcement stating the service this number provides is not currently available.","The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein:","A method comprising:\n\n","A user interface, comprising:\n\n","A method to secure user interface, comprising:\n\n","A representative flow operation showing the current system common number status transitions for activation of a toll-free service, starting with a number in SPARE status , is shown in .

The process and tools currently available for building a complex customer record may be single threaded and cumbersome. In addition, a tool may be required that works intelligently with the user to interpret natural language input to produce a complex customer record while using existing user records and usage data to prepopulate information for the user. This tool may be intuitive such that a first time user could build a complex record without hours of training.","The Customer Record Template Builder (CRTB) can allow toll-free providers to easily build a complex customer record template using a simple UI that can then let that record be designated at the default customer record. A toll-free provider can build multiple complex customer record templates for their use and to define a record as the default customer record, allowing the user to select the default with a single click, thus significantly reducing their work effort.","The CRTB can lead the user thru both the initial customer data population (known as the CAD portion) but also the call routing logic (known as the CPR portion) utilizing a simple UI using a decision tree logic structure with defined data nodes. Based upon the decisions at those nodes the UI can drive down a branch to a new decision node ultimately driving the customer record decision logic to the lowest level.","A decision tree can represent a series of decision points. Each decision point is called a node and off each node is one of more branches. The point at which there may be no more decisions to be made is called a leaf and is used as the \u201cend point\u201d of a branching structure. See  for a generic visualization of this structure.","The CAD portion of the CRTB can logically lead the user to populate the example following pieces of information:\n\n","Carrier Identification Codes (CICs) for IntraLATA and InterLATA traffic","The complex customer record (CPR) decision nodes supported by the may be as follows:\n\n","The \u201cleaves\u201d supported by the data model at the ends of a given branch may include:\n\n","A simple example of Customer Record routing would be as in .","In this relatively simple example, starting from the left-most branched path, the 3 decision paths corresponding to the decision trees branched paths can be represented as:\n\n","The CRTB toll can be built in such a manner to allow a customer works his\/her way down the decision tree and anticipate\/pre-populate information based upon the information already provided in this build or also information provided in previous customer record entries. Once a default customer record template is built, the system can build the capability to invoke this template when creating a customer record for a new number, thus reducing the time and effort for a customer record to be built.","The CPR portion of the CR may provide a mechanism for users to specify branching call routing and call treatment logic involving multiple destination numbers and multiple carriers based on one or more decision criteria. The decision criteria include aspects of the toll-free call, such as its originating geographic area (the originating state, CCS network, NPA, LATA, NPANXX etc.) to be mapped by the SCP, based on the calling party number and other attributes of the query), and the date, time-of-day and day-of week of the query, among other variables.","The CPR is linked to the CAD portion of a regular customer record by the referenced TFN and the Effective Date and Time. The CPR portion is also used in Template Records. When used in a Template record, the CPR portion is linked to the Template Record by the referenced Template Name and Effective Date and Time in the equivalent TAD portion of the Template Record.","The logical branch points of the CPR decision tree may be specified within one or more \u201cdecision nodes\u201d along each traversable branched path. The resulting call processing actions, including the translation of the toll-free number to specific destination numbers, call routing via specific carriers, or the announcement treatment for non-routed calls may be specified in \u201caction nodes\u201d at the ends of each path. Each path logically begins at the dialed toll-free number being translated, progresses through one or more decision nodes that define the call criteria, and ends at one or more action nodes. Each possible path through the decision tree from root to the end of each branched path may be conceived of as a \u201crow\u201d in a logical data table or matrix. Each row may contain numerous decision nodes defining the set of criteria to be matched by the call attributes for a call routing case (path) and may end with one or two action nodes.","The CPR decision nodes supported by the data model according to one embodiment can include one or more of the following:\n\n","The action nodes supported by the data model according to one embodiment at the ends of a given branch can include:\n\n","Logically, decision nodes can have more than one argument for their included decision criteria (e.g., a list of more than one originating NPA, or more than 1 day of the week), and there may be multiple decision nodes used in combination to define each branched path (row). Each action node may have, at most, one outcome in the call routing logic. Null (empty) values for a decision node within a row convey its decision criteria is not to be part of the matched criteria defining the decision case for that row (i.e., that any value for that call parameter can suffice).

The audit file is then loaded to the TFMP administration. The reverse audit process then compares the records to the corresponding CRs.

The information provides the relationships between SCP O\/O CCS networks and the LATAs, NPAs and NPA-NXXs each network serves and is used to validate the information in customer records. There may be 8 CCS networks supported by the system.","There are 164 LATAs in the NANP, roughly 380 NPAs in use or planned for use for POTS call routing, and roughly 160,000 NPA-NXXs assigned to central offices for call routing.","The system can provide memory capacity for the reference data needed to capture the relationships between States, LATAs, NPAs, and NPA-NXXs required to represent the POTS network.","The system can provide memory capacity for the reference data required to represent the network relationships supported by each SCP O\/O CCS network.","The system must also allow time and processing for the loading of industry reference data during routine maintenance windows.","In embodiments of the system, functional data is the data required by each function supported by the system. The system maintains functional data for each NPA-NXX within a toll-free NPA and each toll-free number with each NPA-NXX. Currently, the toll-free NPAs 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, and 844 are open and NPA 833 is anticipated to open in 2017, making a total of 7 toll-free NPAs. Note that 822 and 889 are also reserved as a potential future toll-free NPAs.","For each toll-free NPA, NXXs 000-199, 911, and 555 are not used. Additionally, in NXX 250, XXXX numbers 0000-1499 are not used. This results in 7,988,500 toll-free numbers per NPA. Assuming 8 toll-free NPA, the system will need to maintain data for roughly 64 million toll-free numbers.","In embodiments of the system, initial minimum memory capacity for the data required to support 64 million toll-free numbers. Toll-free service is enabled when a toll-free number is reserved by a toll-free service provider, a customer record is provisioned against the number, and information from the record is downloaded to SCPs. Numbers that are not currently controlled by a toll-free service provider (i.e., numbers in SPARE status) and numbers not available for toll-free service (i.e., numbers in UNAVAILABLE status) do not have customer records. Customer records are provisioned in advance of an effective date, and the system maintains current and pending customer records, so it is possible for multiple customer records to be associated with a number.","A percentage of toll-free numbers will be in SPARE status and therefore not have an associated customer record. Additionally, many working numbers have not had changes to the provided toll-free service and therefore have a single active customer record. However, some numbers may have an active and pending customer record, and old records are stored by the system for a period of time. For the purposes of capacity planning and to account for the differences in size between simple and complex customer records, it is assumed that there is an average of 2 customer records per toll-free number. Therefore, the system will need to maintain 128 million customer records.","The system can provide initial minimum memory capacity for the data required to support 128 million customer records.","During peak usage periods, 25% of user logins are logged into the system. The system must provide capacity for 16,250 login IDs and anticipating 30% peak concurrent usage, capacity for 4,875 concurrent HUI sessions. Note that not all users who are logged into the system will be actively and continuously sending requests to the system.","During a time of extreme usage, such as the opening of a new toll-free NPA, there will a significant increase in the number of concurrent sessions. In the event of an extreme system usage situation the system should be able to quickly scale up to handle up to four times (4\u00d7) the normal peak usage period.","Instantaneous response time is the time for a response when performing an action regarding objects on the screen, such as using a mouse to select on an on-screen object or drag a scroll bar.","When a human user takes an action related to an object on a screen, the system can provide an initial acknowledgment response in 0.1-0.2 seconds.","When a human user takes action to request an operation or execute a command requiring system process of the request, the system can provide a response in 0.5-1 second.","A feedback response provides information regarding the progress or completion of a requested action.","For transactions that take longer than 5 seconds\u2014the system will provide the user feedback that the transaction has been accepted and that the response will be available at a later time.","In embodiments, the system can provide an API interface for machine-to-machine transaction processing.
