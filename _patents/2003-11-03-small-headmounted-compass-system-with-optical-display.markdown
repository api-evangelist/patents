{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a system to displaying data to personnel under conditions that impair vision. More particularly, this invention relates to a system externally mounted on a variety of existing headgear (i.e. dive masks, goggles, firefighting masks, helmets, head straps etc.) to allow a wearer to see real-time presentations of compass data.","Successful completion of tasks in visually and physically challenging environments often requires navigation from one point to another. For example, US Navy SEAL and Marine Combat divers are required to take surface compass bearings and swim thousands of yards underwater to reach a target area with a good degree of accuracy. Currently, they use analog floating card compasses with luminous markings that are mounted on hand-held navigation boards. These hand-held navigational aids do not always come up to expectations since they can be very difficult to see in highly turbid, zero visibility conditions. If the compass data can be seen at all, it takes extremely high levels of concentration to maintain a nearly level compass attitude with visual contact with the compass, and stay on course. This fatigues the operator, is a distraction from other potentially important tasks, and can result in inefficient and possibly unsafe operations.","Firefighters or other nighttime operators also may face situations of impaired vision due to conditions of smoke and\/or darkness in their application environment. Often overcoming the distraction of safely getting from one place to another can compromise effectiveness.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system providing continuous, hands-free, access to compass data in all visibility conditions and not constraining an operator's body position to keep a compass sensor at a nearly level attitude to enable effective, safe completion of a mission.","An object of the invention is to provide a module for providing compass information in all conditions of visibility.","Another object of the invention is to provide a module for providing directional information that does not require a wearer to maintain a predetermined physical attitude.","Another objective is to provide a small, self-contained, waterproof and ruggedized module that allows an operator to see directional data in any environment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a compact and rugged module that can be used stand-alone with it's own head mounted bracket, attached to existing head mounted hardware or be hand-held to allow unimpeded observation of directional data in any environment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a compact optical design and mounting methods to place a compass module in various positions in an operator's field of view.","Another object of the invention is to provide a module for viewing compass data that does not require hand manipulations by the operator to visually acquire the compass sensor data after the module has been mounted to the head and the optics have been aligned.","Another object of the invention is to provide a module for viewing compass data that is mechanically gimbaled and damped and has a two-axis compass sensor to provide stable compass data over a large range of pitch and roll by an operator during navigation.","Another object of the invention is to provide a module for viewing compass data that includes the ability to electronically calibrate the compass sensor, correct for local static magnetic disturbances in the operating area, and to correct for magnetic declination angle depending on what part of the world it is being used in.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is for a system and method to indicate the direction faced by an operator. A waterproof housing has a mounting mechanism to engage a part of a headgear worn by an operator to position the housing in a portion of the operator's forward field of view. A two-axis gimbal mechanism is inside the waterproof housing and has a protective housing connected to the waterproof housing. The protective housing contains ring structure coupled to two orthogonal axis structures. A magnetic field sensor module is mounted on one of the axis structures and provides magnetic field data signals representative of the direction faced by the operator. A processor electronics module is connected to the magnetic field sensor module to receive the magnetic field data signals and create representative driving signals. A microdisplay is connected to the processor electronics module for displaying the driving signals, and a display light inside of the waterproof housing radiates light onto or through the microdisplay. An optical element is aligned to receive illumination through the microdisplay and transmit undistorted and focused compass data images representative of the magnetic field data signals to the eyes of the operator.","Referring to , head mounted compass system  of the invention is for displaying compass data images  of compass data and is schematically shown mounted on head mounted hardware . Head mounted hardware  can include diving facemasks (as depicted), goggles, firefighting masks, helmets, etc. that have a view-port lens  and stand-alone head strap and bracket assemblies. Compass system  allows an operator  (i.e. diver, firefighter, etc.) to clearly see alphanumeric compass data as compass data images  through lens  as well as navigate in visually challenging environments (i.e. in darkness, turbid water, smoke, fog, other obscurants or eye irritants) where the hands cannot be used to hold a standard navigation device and in situations where compass system  could not necessarily be kept in a level attitude.","Compass system  is contained in a small waterproof housing  that may be depth rated to about 200 feet in salt water and has a mounting mechanism  that can exert a clamping engaging force on a part  of hardware  to hold or position housing  of compass system  in a portion of (or at a desired location in) the forward field of view of operator . Mounting mechanism  can be a resilient structure that clamps onto part  (that may be flat, protrude, or be rim-like) and\/or can include a screw  or the like that can be tightened to assure that mounting mechanism  securely engages part . Other fasteners for mounting mechanism  for attachment onto or engagement with part  may include mating snaps, multiple screws, Velcro strips, clips, suction devices, adhesives, or elastic\/flexible straps with a bracket or adaptor for engagement. Another mounting scheme would allow compass system  to be manually pivoted out of the field of view of operator  (while still being mounted to the head) in situations where the data was not needed.","Mounting mechanism  allows for attachment and adjustable location of compass system  at a desired position in front of the eyes  of operator  for real-time observation of compass data images . This capability assures that operator  will clearly see a virtual image of compass data focused at a comfortable viewing distance by simply shifting the operator's view to focus on other parts of compass system  to be described.","Compass system  has an optically clear shim  located between view port lens  and other components of system . Optically clear shim  is used as a filler element to prevent obscurants from the environment from blocking the optical path of compass data images  from system  to eyes , and shim  presents compass data images  at the desired position and angle in front of the operator's eyes  for unimpaired vision.","Referring also to , waterproof housing  of compass system  contains a miniature electronic, two-axis, magnetic field sensor module  which provides magnetic field data signals (shown as arrow ) over electrical cable  for compass system . Magnetic field data signals  are indicative or representative of the direction faced by operator . A typical, commercially available off the shelf two-axis magnetic field sensor module that can be used for magnetic field sensor module  is known as the PNI MicroMag 2-axis Magnetic Sensor Module Part Number 11594 manufactured by PNI Corporation of 5464 Skylane Blvd., Suite A, Santa Rosa, Calif. 95403.","Magnetic field sensor module  is mounted on a two-axis gimbal mechanism  in waterproof housing  to allow a wide range of movement by operator  without degrading the accuracy of magnetic field sensor module . Two-axis gimbal mechanism  can be a scaled-down version of many well known mechanically gimbaled and damped self-leveling systems. These leveling systems create damped, substantially level platforms for instrumentations, and typically, they are used as the supports for ships' compasses to dampen motions from them, or they may be for gyros or other applications where such supports are needed. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,522.","Two-axis gimbal mechanism  could be like the gimbal of prior art shown in  of the '522 patent and could provide the requisite leveling and yaw detection capabilities for magnetic field sensor module  by miniaturizing the structure of FIG.  and substituting magnetic field sensing module  for the object that looks like a rolling-pin. Miniaturization of such a self leveling system to meet the size constraints of compass system  is within the scope of one skilled in the art without calling for anything more than the exercise of ordinary skill and does not require undue experimentation.","Referring also to , magnetic field sensor module  is mounted in a protective housing  of gimbal mechanism  via a ring structure  coupled to two orthogonal axis structures  and  of gimbal mechanism . Pivot points  are at opposite ends of axis structure  to allow rolling motions of magnetic field sensor module , and pivot points  are at opposite ends of axis structure  to allow pitching motions of magnetic field sensor module . Thus, magnetic field sensor module  always stays substantially level regardless of the pitch and roll of compass module  during movement of operator . A ballasting counterweight  is connected to the bottom of magnetic field sensor module . Counterweight  hangs on rigid attachment from module  and helps keep module  level and prevent oscillations of module  by the operator's pitching and rolling motions. Protective, sealed housing  can be filled with an oil-like non-reactive fluid  to dampen the movement of magnetic field sensor module  so that it does not oscillate as movements are made by operator . These features allow operator  a wide range of pitch and roll motion without degrading the accuracy of magnetic field sensor module  of compass system .","Protective housing  is connected at points  to waterproof housing  (only two of which are depicted in FIG. ), and housing  is coupled to head mounted hardware  by mounting mechanism . Consequently, any horizontal yawing motions of operator  are transmitted to gimbal mechanism  and magnetic field sensor module  so that the relative directions operator  is facing can be sensed as magnetic field data signals  and indicated as responsive compass data images  at view port lens . This is because yawing motions in the horizontal plane by operator  are not compensated for by gimbal mechanism . Thus, magnetic field sensor module  is able to sense rotational motion and different directional headings or facings of operator  as operator  turns left or right (yawing motion), and magnetic field sensor module  responsively generates directional magnetic field data signals  that can be representative of what direction operator  faces in the horizontal plane during progression from one location to another.","A processor electronics module  is connected to magnetic field sensor module  via electrical cable  to receive magnetic field data signals . Processor electronics module  reads magnetic field data signals , makes calculations using previously stored calibration data to yield the compass heading (azimuth), and outputs this data as representative driving signals (shown as arrow ) in the proper format for microdisplay  where it is displayed and illuminated by a display light  radiating light (shown as arrows ) at a predetermined intensity for viewing by operator .","Many different types of commercially available microdisplays can be used as microdisplay  for presenting the data of compass data images . These include but are not limited to appropriately sized segmental, dot-matrix and active-matrix transmissive, transflective or reflective LCDs, LEDs and organic LEDs (OLEDs). Possible illumination sources for display light  can include electoluminescent (EL) and LED devices of the appropriate size, power and color that can be selected and installed in compass system  by one of ordinary skill.","An optical element  is aligned to receive illumination  through microdisplay . Optical element  can be a small single lens or system of compound lenses with a wide field of view capable of making a substantially right angled transmission of undistorted and focused compass data images  to eyes  of operator . Optical element  can be a free shaped prism or off-axis mirti-mirror optical system that are both well known in the state of the art for application with other commercial off the shelf head mounted display systems such as those made by Olympus (Eye-trek), IO-Display systems, and others. Typical of the many types of lens arrangements that could be used or modified for use as optical element  are in U.S. Pat. Nos. RE37,667, 6,373,645, and 6,317,267. Optically clear shim  can be mounted on an outside surface  of optical element  to block obscurants from the environment and transmit undistorted and focused compass data images  to eyes .","A switch  connected to processor electronics module  has a push-button  that extends through housing  to permit operator  to selectively turn-on or turn-off compass system  as desired. Button  of switch  is coupled to processor electronics module  that is connected to battery  for electrical power when operator  pushes button  to turn-on compass system . Processor module  also connects magnetic field sensing module  to battery  via electrical cable  to activate it when button  is displaced by operator .","In operation, operator  turns on compass system  by pushing push-button  of switch . The horizontal X and Y components of the earth's magnetic field are sensed by magnetic field sensor module  which is kept steady and level by being mounted on two-axis damped, mechanical gimbal mechanism . Magnetic field signals  are coupled to processor electronics module  which reads signals  and generates compass heading driving signals (in azimuth) based on previously stored calibration data. Processor electronics module  couples compass heading driving signals  in a suitable format to microdisplay  where it is displayed and illuminated by radiated light  from display light . The data image displayed by microdisplay passes through the optical element  where it is turns through a right angle and can be magnified for close eye viewing as compass data image  at outside surface . The magnified compass data image  passes thru optically clear shim , if used, through view port  and to eyes  of operator  for viewing.","At any time, the light level of the displayed magnified compass data image  can be adjusted manually to suit an individual operator's requirements by using pushing push button  of switch  in a predetermined sequence of actuation since display light  is coupled to switch  via processor electronics module . Similarly, operator  can optionally elect to calibrate the magnetic field sensor module  to account for local, static, magnetic field variations by inputting the correct switch input sequences to processor electronics module  via push button  of switch . If this selective option is elected, processor electronics module  is programmed, and\/or preset to perform the necessary calibrations while operator  executes the required positioning sequences for magnetic field sensor module . When these calibrations are complete, processor electronics module  can store the calibration data in local memory for use during subsequent operations.","A further option with compass system  of the invention is that operator  can turn off compass system  with push button  of switch  or processor electronics module  can be preset or preprogrammed to put compass system  into a sleep-mode where power consumption is very low. The sleep-mode of operation may be called for when the correct conditions are met (e.g. during a period of non-use where no significant compass movement is determined by magnetic field sensor module ).","Small head-mounted compass system  of the invention has an optical display system that can be externally mounted on a variety of existing head mounted hardware  to allow operator  to see real-time compass data images . These images are presented, via an illuminated magnifying optical element  at a preferred location in the operator's field of view. A damped, gimbaled, two-axis magnetic field sensor module  allows a wide range of operator movement without degrading compass accuracy. When used with dive masks, goggles or helmets that isolate the operator's eyes  from the ambient environment, compass system  of the invention allows operator  to view compass data images  regardless of ambient visual environmental conditions (i.e. darkness, turbid water, smoke, fog, and any other opaque obscurants) without the use of the arms or hands, and without undue obstruction of the field of view of operator . When used stand-alone, (not in conjunction with protective equipment that isolates the operator's eyes from the ambient environment), operator  will be able to view compass data images  on compass system  regardless of ambient lighting conditions provided that any significant obscurants do not get between the operator's eyes and compass data images  emitted from compass system .","Compass system  of the invention is small, self-contained, waterproof and ruggedized to allow its placement in various positions in an operator's field of view depending on viewing requirements to allow operator  to see compass data images  in any environment. Compass system  of the invention can be used stand-alone with its own head mounted bracket or attached to existing head mounted hardware  or can also be used in a hand-held application by holding compass module  up to the eye.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of compass system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design that incorporates structures long proven to operate successfully lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use in hostile and demanding marine environments of impaired visibility both in and on open water and land. Compass system  can be made larger or smaller in different shapes and fabricated from a wide variety of materials to assure resistance to corrosion, sufficient strength, to bear up during routine abuse, and to provide long term reliable operation under a multitude of different operational conditions and requirements.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Compass system  provides a reliable and capable means of keeping personnel on course under conditions of impaired visibility to assure completion of assigned tasks irrespective of ambient conditions and terrain associated with hostile marine and land environments. Therefore, compass system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3","3","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["4","4","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
