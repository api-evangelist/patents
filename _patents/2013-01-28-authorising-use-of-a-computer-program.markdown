No. 10\/240,207, filed 23 Apr. 2003, which is a national stage application of PCT\/AU2001\/00350, filed 28 Mar. 2001, which claims benefit of PQ 6544, filed 28 Mar. 2000 in Australia and which applications are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent appropriate, a claim of priority is made to each of the above disclosed applications.","The present invention relates to authorising use of a computer program, in particular the present invention relates to a method of authorising use of a computer program, a computer configured to authorise the use of a computer program and a computer readable media on which is stored computer software for authorising use of a computer program.","There is an increasing need for securing and protection of computer programs and other digital products. This is reflected in an increasing demand for a \u201cpay as you use\u201d payment arrangement for licensed use of computer software. It is known for a server to provide application software to a plurality of client's machines. Under this model it is possible to provide a \u201cpay as you use\u201d method of software licensing. Current pricing models used for the payment of software applications are based on per user and seat licensing agreements that are complex, restrictive and inefficient, especially for client server and application service provider software delivery. \u201cPay as you use\u201d pricing is demanded by software users for its simplicity, cost effectiveness and flexibility.","There is therefore a need for an alternative method of providing a software licensing system that allows for each user of the software to correspond a payment for that use. The licensed software needs to be able to be prevented from use unless authorised, to allow for inter alia payment for using the software.","An object of the present invention is to provide a method of authorising use of a computer program in a manner suitable for implementing inter alia a \u201cpay as you use\u201d licensing system.","According to the present invention there is provided a method of authorising use of a computer program, said method including the steps of:\n\n","Preferably the method includes the steps of:\n\n","Preferably the authorisation system records whether the user is verified, whether the user is authorised to use the computer program and a time stamp.","Preferably the computer program may be a software application or a sub-component of a software application.","Preferably the charge for use of the computer program is recorded in usage units.","Preferably a rate of charging usage units for the use of the computer program is recorded in the authorisation system. A different rate of charge may be applied to different computer programs.","Preferably the usage units are charged by the authorisation system upon receipt of the request to charge for the use of the computer program.","Preferably the request to the authorisation system for charge of usage units is sent once per use of the computer program. Alternatively the request to the authorisation system to charge usage units is sent once per specified period during the use of the computer program.","Preferably the user purchases usage units in advance of use of the computer program, the usage unit total being reduced by each charge, use being authorised only while there are a positive number of usage units left.","Preferably the authorisation message is encrypted. Preferably, the communication between the interface program and the authorisation system is encrypted. Preferably messages to and from the authorisation system includes a unique component that is only valid for a single use, so that the message can't be duplicated and used again.","Preferably the user identification is obtained from the user by providing the user with a login prompt, the user entering the login identification provided by the authorisation system, the entered user identification being included in the login request.","Preferably an interface program signals the login request to the authorisation system. Preferably the interface program is a separate program called by the computer program being authorised as part of the initialisation of the authorised computer program. In one embodiment the interface program forms part of the computer program and is started when a user attempts to use the computer program. In another alternative embodiment, the interface program is part of an operating system and is started when a user attempts to use the computer program.","Preferably the authorisation system is at a location remote from a computer running the activated computer program. More preferably, the computer running the activated computer program also runs the interface program, the interface program communicates with the authorisation system over a computer network.","Preferably the authorisation system is configured to record and authorise a plurality of computer programs. Typically, the authorisation system is configured to record and authorise a plurality of uses of the same computer program.","In one embodiment the authorisation is provided for each activation of the computer program. Typically, a charge is generated for each use of the computer program. In another embodiment, the authorisation is required periodically, wherein at the end of a period of time specified in the computer program from the last authorisation, a request to charge the usage units is sent to the authorising system for a further authorisation, the authorisation system sends each further authorisation and records the use for each period, whereby a charge is generated for each authorisation message sent.","In yet another embodiment, when the computer program is finished, a terminate message is sent to the authorisation system, the authorisation system records the duration of the use of the computer program between when the authorisation message is sent to the computer program until the terminate message is received, whereby a charge in PUs is generated for use of the computer program corresponding to the recorded duration.","According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a distributed system for authorising use of a computer program, said system comprising at least:\n\n","Preferably the computer is configured to sending a request to the authorisation system to record a charge or the use of the computer program against the identified user for use of the computer program.","Preferably the computer storage means records the rate of charge for the use of the computer program","Preferably the authorisation system records a charge against the user upon receipt of the request to charge for use of the computer program.","Preferably the computer is configured to send a request to the authorisation system to charge the user once per use of the computer program.","Preferably the computer is configured to send a request to the authorisation system to charge the user is sent once per specified period during the use of the computer program.","Preferably the computer is the communication between the computer program and the authorisation system is encrypted.","Preferably the computer and authorisation system are configured to include a unique component in the encrypted messages communicated therebetween.","Preferably the authorisation system is at a location remote from a computer running the activated computer program.","Preferably the computer running the activated computer program also runs the interface program, an interface program that communicates with the authorisation system over a computer network.","Preferably the authorisation system is configured to record and authorise a plurality of computer program.","Referring to , a system  is shown for authorising use of a computer program, such as a software application  on a computer . The computer program may be a sub-component of a larger software application. A user  activates the software application  for execution on the computer . The software application  calls an interface program , known as a Software Application Interface Library program (SAIL). The SAIL  communicates with an on-line server  via a network, such as the Internet . An authorisation system  is running on the server . The authorisation system  is called a Software Application Licence Manager Over Networks (SALMON) system. It is noted that the computer platform need not be the same as the server, likewise operating systems of the computer and the server need not be the same. The SALMON system  is able to handle many software applications on a plurality of computers, each having a SAIL interfacing with the SALMON system  via a communication network, such as the Internet . The SALMON system  communicates with the SAIL  to determine whether the user is authorised to use the software application . There is a one to one relationship between the user and the instance of the software application. This allows for each user to be charged for each use of the software application.","The SAIL  is provided to a software vendor that wishes to use the system  of the present invention. The software vendor incorporates calls to the SAIL  in the vendor's computer program.","The computer program or software application  is written to be disabled from use until the user  is identified to the SALMON system  using a login routine of the SAIL  and receives an authorisation message from the SALMON system . The authorisation message operates as a once off run time licence. The SAIL  sends another authorisation message to the software application  when it receives the authorised message from the SALMON system .","Specifically, when the software application is started, it calls a login sub-routine of the SAIL . The application waits for the SAIL login sub-routine to return a message indicating that the user is logged in. A software vendor wanting to charge for use of the software can decide the price of use. It may be free, parts of the software may be charged for, or all of the software may be charged for. The cost may be charged on each start-up of the application, on a time basis or on a per function basis. Different users may be charged different rates. A user is charged for using a program use run-time licence unit (RTL). The SAIL , once logged in, can send a message to the SALMON system  to record usage of the computer program\/software application according the payment scheme desired.","Referring to , which shows the operation of the present invention in the form of a flow chart. The flow chart starts at  where a user wishes to run a software application. The user activates the software application in the normal manner at . The software application interfaces with the SAIL  to validate the user at  via a login request message which is encrypted with a public key at  by the SAIL . The encrypted login request message is communicated over a network , such as the internet, and is then decrypted with a private key at  in a server running the SALMON system . The SALMON system  validates the user name, password and the status of the application at . If the user is valid and authorised to use the software application, a logged-in confirmation message is encrypted with a public key at  and sent across the network . It is decrypted at  with a private key by the SAIL .","If the validation is successful, as indicated by , the application continues at . If the software vendor wishes the user to pay for the use of the software application, the steps from  take place. The account creditability is validated at . The SAIL  sends a public key encrypted \u201callocate a charge\u201d message at  over the network . The message is then decrypted with a private key at . The account is checked to determine whether sufficient RTLs are available. If so, the required number of RTLs are debited at . A charged confirmation message is encrypted with a public key and sent at  across the network  and decrypted at  with a private key. If the validation is successful the application continues at , otherwise it terminates at .","The method of encryption of transmitted messages involves the inclusion of a unique component so that a message is valid only once. Each message is in the form of a binary number to be sent between the SAIL  and the SALMON system . A random number is added to the message. A digestion routine takes the data from the message and the random number to produce a digestion value. The digestion value is computed in such a way that finding an input that will exactly generate a given digest is computationally infeasible. The message data, the random number and the digestion value are then encrypted using a public key. The message is then transmitted. The received message is then decrypted using a private key. The decrypted message is then separated in to individual components. The message can be validated by using the same digestion formula on the message and random number components to check the digestion result calculated against the digestion value received. If the values are the same the message is considered valid, otherwise it is considered invalid. This process provides a different data sequence for each message even if the same acknowledgment message is sent each time. In this way each message includes a unique value which can only be used once. Thus if the message is duplicated it will no longer by valid and will be rejected.","The SALMON system  may be configured to allow many users to be authorised at the same time for one or more software application. The software vendor may allow up to a predetermined number of users to login for a particular software application. For each authorised user allowed a login a login resource is allocated in the SALMON system . Each available login resource, a login daemon process will be waiting for a user to login.","Referring to , until a login is received each of the login daemon processes remains in a not logged in state . Once a login  is received the SALMON system  enters a logged in state . A routine \u201cCan consume RTL\u201d  checks to see whether RTLs may be consumed, until the user  logs out at , whereupon the login resource of the SALMON system  re-enters the not logged in state .","Thus checking that sufficient funds (in the form of RTLs) are available can be a criterion for authorisation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b ","b":["34","42","22","38"]},"A user of the software application using the on-line pay as you use model must first be registered with the on-line SALMON system . They will be provided with a user name and password so that the SALMON system  can identify them and the login details verified.","The login of the user is to verify that the user is logged with the on-line SALMON system  before being able to proceed with use of the software. The software application logs out from the SALMON system  in order to provide a clean exit. Generally, only one login session per user should be active, a previous session must be logged out before another login session can begin.","Referring to , the passing of messages is now described. A user  activates a software application  thereby creating  an instance of the software application . The software application  then creates  an instance of the SAIL . The software application  requests details from the user  at . The user  enters a user name and password at . The software application calls a \u201cSAIL-login\u201d routine of the SAIL  at . The SAIL  then establishes a connection, via the Internet , to the SALMON system . The SAIL-login routine then passes the user name, password and an identification of the software to the SALMON system . Once confirming that the login details are correct, the SALMON system  sends a login \u201cOK\u201d message at  to the SAIL  which then at  sends an \u201cOK\u201d message to the software application .","Depending on the model that the software vendor wishes to use the charge for use of the software an appropriate scheme of using RTLs will be used. The scheme described in relation to  is for a one-off charge for use of the software application. Other schemes will be described below.","The software application  then sends a one-off request to consume an RTL at . This request is a SAIL-consume RTL call. The SAIL-consume RTL sends a consume RTL message to the SALMON system  at . The SALMON system  records the request to consume RTL and sends an authorisation message at  to the SAIL . The SAIL  then passes the OK message at  to the software application . The software application  then begins to log out of the SAIL  at . The logout message is then passed from the SAIL  to the SALMON system  at . A Logout confirmation message is then passed from the SALMON system  to the SAIL  at . The logout confirmation message is then sent from the SAIL  to software application  at . The software application  may then terminate the SAIL program  at . The user  may proceed with use of the software application  at . Once the user has finished with the software application  it may then be terminated at .","The recording of the consumption of a one-off consumption of an RTL creates a charge for the one-off use of the software application . This charge may be deducted from an amount of RTLs held in credit for the user  or may be billed to the user .","Different software applications may request the consumption of different numbers of RTLs. For example a word processing application may consume five RTLs whereas a spreadsheet may consume . As mentioned above, the software being authorised need only be a sub-component of a large software application. For example, a print function may be regarded as the computer program being authorised. For each use of the print function a charge is accrued. A user  may also be entitled to a discount such as, for example, if they are a high volume user. The number of RTLs may then be multiplied by a user discount to produce a final number of RTLs deducted from the user's account.","Referring to , the periodic consumption of RTLs is described. Periodic consumption of RTLs may be consumed at a different rate to one-off consumption of RTLs. Like numerals depict like actions from . Again the user  starts the software application  which creates the instance of the SAIL  at . Login is requested at  and login details are provided to the SAIL  at . The login details are then passed from the software application to SAIL  at  and then onto the SALMON system  at . The confirmation of login is passed from the SALMON system  to the SAIL  at , and from the SAIL  to the software application at . The user may proceed with the normal use of the application at . In the meantime, the software application  makes periodic requests to the SAIL  for the consumption of an RTL at . The SAIL  passes the request to the SALMON system  at . The confirmation of the recording of the consumption of the RTL occurs in the SALMON system  and the confirmation of this is then passed from the SALMON system  to the SAIL  at  and then from the SAIL  to software application  at .","At the end of each period a further RTL is consumed as indicated by , ,  and . When the user has finished with the application, a command is sent to exit from the application  at . The software application then sends the logout message to the SAIL  at  which is the sent on at  to the SALMON system . Confirmation of the logout is sent from the SALMON system  to the SAIL  at  and then from the SAIL  to the software application  at , whereupon the software application may end the instance of the SAIL  at  and then shut itself down.","As an alternative the software application  may specify the period to the SAIL  and the SAIL  handles the operation of sending consume RTL messages to the SALMON system  for deduction RTLs from the users account.","The number of periodic RTLs consumed is recorded and a corresponding charge generated. The total charge for the session is deducted from an account or billed out. RTLs may use currency units, the consumption of RTLs is in itself payment. The charge for the consumption of each RTL can be arranged by agreement between the software vendor and the system operator.","The SALMON system  may be configured to allow many users to be authorised at the same time for one or more software applications.  shows a flow chart setting out the establishment of a pay-as-you-use registration according to the present invention. The flow chart begins at  where a user wishes to use a software application utilising the system of the present invention. If the user is registered with the administrators of the authorisation SALMON system  they proceed down path  otherwise they need to register with the administrator, in this case \u201cOPTIMISER\u201d at . An on-line registration site is made available over the Internet at , where the user can register to use a single software application  or a range of software applications . A subscription fee is paid at  or  depending on whether the user selects a single software application or general use. A rate of, for example US$10 per annum is paid if a single application is to be used. An annual subscription of, for example US$120 per annum is charged for general use of software. Once this payment is made to the administrator the process continues at  as if the person was previously registered.","If the user wishes to use an application that is not pay-as-you-use enabled as indicated at , the software vendor will need to register the system with the administrators. If the software is registered it will proceed as indicated by . The software vendor may download website software as indicated by . If the software vendor is not registered with the administrator as indicated by  the vendor must register at . Once the vendor is registered the SAIL interface program can be downloaded at  and integrated into the vendor's software at .","Once the user is registered, the user must have credit available with the administrator. This is checked at . If they don't, as indicated by , they must purchase RTLs. If they have paid the vendor for usage as indicated by  the vendor must pass on the usage payment at  to the administrator, which will be credited as RTLs. Once the user has RTLs credited as indicated by  the user may use the software according to the present invention. When the software application is started the SAIL is activated at , as described above, with  being equivalent to  in . The authorisation of the user is indicated by  being the equivalent of the OK message  in . On-line usage reporting, indicated by , is equivalent to the recording of the logging in and consumption of RTLs. The user may then view their access usage and RTL consumption at a later stage. Even if the software is not charged for use, the software can be recorded and tracked.","The SAIL interface  may provide a \u201cheart beat\u201d function that periodically sends the SALMON system  a message to check that a connection between the two still exists. If the connection has dropped out, it may be re-established or the application terminated, depending on the security desired by the software vendor.","A list of SAIL Application Program Interface (API) system calls is listed in appendix 1. A more preferred list of SAIL API system calls is listed in appendix 2. A set of example scenarios showing the use of the SAIL  is included in appendix 3.","The SAIL interface as implemented as an Application Programmable Interface (API) library able to interface with the programming language of the software application. Programming methodologies like ActiveX or CORBA can be used to provide class wrappers around the system API library.","Now that the preferred embodiments have been described it will be clear to the skilled addressee that it has at least the following advantages. A locked software application may be provided to each user that is only able to be unlocked and used where the user purchases run time licences which are consumed on a per use or time basis. This means that software does not need to be downloaded and may be provided on, for example, a floppy disk, CD-ROM or DVD ROM. The user only receives use of the software that they pay for and the user only has to pay for the actual use of the software.","It will be clear that modifications and variations can be made to the present invention, such as the implementation need not be exactly as described in the above mentioned example, the computer language that the underlying software is programmed in may be any suitable language, such as Java, C++ or Visual BASIC. The method of charging and\/or billing for use of the run time licences for the software may vary from those described above. It is also envisages that the present invention may be applicable to authorise specified users to access a program, rather than for payment of RTLs. Such a security measure to only allow certain personnel to access sensitive software applications and is able to track their use.","Such modifications and variations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, the nature of which is to be determined from the foregoing description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0090"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003SAIL - API system calls"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003Login"]},{"entry":[{},{},"int Login (const char * userName,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009const char * userPassword,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009const int majorVersion,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009const int minorVersion,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009const int revisionVersion);"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Description","Establishes a login and connection to the Optimiser Online Server.
