No. 09\/641,460, filed Aug. 15, 2000 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,363,390 which claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60\/209,528, filed Jun. 5, 2000, and provisional application Ser. No. 60\/211,284, filed Jun. 13, 2000, and which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09\/469,207, filed Dec. 21, 1999, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,350. This application is also a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09\/378,686, filed Aug. 20, 1999 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,370,535. The disclosures of all five of the aforementioned applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for structured generation and distribution of news releases, including over networks and particularly the Internet.","The prior art is familiar with applications available over the World Wide Web for providing an individual with news stories that have been automatically selected according to pre-specified criteria. On the other hand, the preparation of news stories and, more particularly, of news releases, is generally an operation that involves human effort of a kind that has not significantly changed in decades. While there are aids, such as word processing programs, that can be invoked to speed the motion of words selected by the writer onto a text-storing medium such as paper, the actual selection of the words in a news release usually involves the same exercise of creative effort and editorial judgment that has been required since the format of a news release was first developed. Indeed, part of the difficulty in writing a news release involves developing a suitable approach to whatever happens to be the subject of the release. In this sense, a typical prior art news release is friendly neither to the creator, owing to the work involved in creating the news release, nor to the reader, owing to the effort involved in gleaning information from it.","It is not surprising, therefore, that the writing of news releases is usually left to specialists in marketing and public relations departments of businesses or to independent public relations consultants.","In a first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for the structured generation and distribution of a news release. The method of this embodiment includes:","separately specifying content of each of a plurality of pre-determined sections of the news release, the predetermined sections and their ordering determining in part a desired format for the news release;","storing, in a digital storage medium, the content specified for each of the sections;","assembling the news release by retrieving from the storage medium each of the stored sections in a manner consistent with the desired format; and","providing, to a source of the news release, feedback information that is responsive to the news release.","In this connection, in further embodiments, the source of the news release may be a promoter of the news release, or an intermediary agent of the promoter.","In a further embodiment, specifying the content includes providing responses via a set of templates. Each template in the set (which has at least one member) is structured to evince the content of the sections. In one implementation the set of templates includes a single template having locations for entering the content for each section. Alternatively, the set of templates includes a separate template for each section, and each template has a location for entering the content of a corresponding section. The predetermined sections may optionally include a headline, a summary, a release date, at least one key message, a section providing an identification of classes of individuals to whom the content provided in the body is expected to be relevant, a section providing access to quotations related to the news release, and\/or a section providing information that enables immediate action on the news release. The section enabling immediate action optionally includes a network address, which may be an address for providing access to products or services of the news release promoter; or an address for providing access to quotations related to the news release; or an address for providing access to an article related to the news release. In a further embodiment, the method also includes the step of archiving the news release according to an index. This archiving may enable searching for the news release via an Internet website. In a further embodiment, the feedback information includes summary feedback.","A related embodiment provides a method of automatically generating and distributing a news release over a network. In this embodiment, the method includes","from a computer at a first location, separately specifying over a network to a host computer, content of each of a plurality of pre-determined sections of the news release, the predetermined sections and their ordering determining in part a desired format for the news release;","storing, in a digital storage medium in communication with the host computer, the content specified for each of the sections;","assembling the news release by retrieving from the storage medium each of the stored sections in a manner consistent with the desired format; and","providing, to a source of the news release, feedback information that is responsive to the news release.","In this connection, in further embodiments, the source of the news release may be a promoter of the news release, or an intermediary agent of the promoter.","The network, in a further embodiment, is the Internet, and the host computer may be implemented as a World Wide Web server. As in the case of the earlier embodiments, the content may be specified via a set of templates in the manner described previously. Moreover, the method of this embodiment may optionally include automatically identifying classes of recipients of the news release based on further recipient content of at least one of the sections. Also optionally, the method may include distributing the news release to recipients in each identified class. Distributing the news release may be performed automatically and may include sending the news release as E-Mail over the Internet. The E-Mail may include an attachment supplying additional information.","In a further embodiment, the predetermined sections include a section providing information enabling immediate action on the news release, the information optionally including a network address, which may be an address for providing access to products or services of the news release promoter. In a further embodiment, the method also includes the step of archiving the news release according to an index. This archiving may enable searching for the news release via an Internet website. In a further embodiment, the feedback information includes summary feedback.","Also provided in a related embodiment is a system for automatically generating and distributing a news release over a network. The system of this embodiment includes\n\n","As described previously, in a further embodiment, the network is the Internet and the host computer is the World Wide Web. Moreover, there may be optionally a fourth process that identifies classes of recipients of the news release based on content of at least of at least one of the sections, and optionally a fifth process that distributes the news release as E-Mail over the Internet to recipients in each identified class. The E-Mail may include an attachment supplying additional information. Also, the feedback information may include summary feedback.","In yet another embodiment of the invention there is provided a digitally encoded E-Mail message, for transmission over a global communications network, carrying a news release. In this embodiment, the message includes:\n\n","In one embodiment, the network address is a URL of a site on the World Wide Web. Furthermore, the network address may be an address for providing access to products or services of a promoter of the news release; or an address for providing providing, to a source of the news release, feedback information that is responsive to the news release. The source may be a promoter of the news release, or an intermediary agent of the promoter.","In a related embodiment, the body of the E-Mail message further includes a plurality of labels, each label corresponding to one of the sections, for labeling the sections. The body of the E-Mail message optionally includes a section providing an identification of classes of individuals to whom the content provided in the body is expected to be relevant. Furthermore, the E-Mail message may also include an attachment providing information supplementing information in the body. Also the body may include a section providing a network address of a source of information that supplements information in the body. In this embodiment, the network address is optionally a URL of a site on the World Wide Web.","In yet another embodiment, there is provided a method for the structured generation and distribution of a news release. The method of this embodiment includes:","separately specifying content of each of a plurality of pre-determined sections of the news release, the predetermined sections and their ordering determining in part a desired format for the news release;","storing, in a digital storage medium, the content specified for each of the sections;","assembling the news release into a data record by retrieving from the storage medium each of the stored sections in a manner consistent with the desired format;\n\n","Optionally, the global communications network is the Internet, and the data record is accessible via a site on the World Wide Web. The website may enable searching for the data record based on its content.","In yet another embodiment, a method for structured generation and distribution of a news release comprises:","a. separately specifying content of each of a plurality of pre-determined sections of the news release, the predetermined sections and their ordering determining in part a desired format for the news release;","b. storing, in a digital storage medium, the content specified for each of the sections;","c. assembling the news release by retrieving from the storage medium each of the stored sections in a manner consistent with the desired format; and","d. distributing the news release to at least one recipient on the basis of a preference analysis which includes the step of utilizing, as an input to the preference analysis, the recipient's preference feedback on prior news releases.","In a further embodiment, a method for structured generation and distribution of a news release comprises:","a. separately specifying content of each of a plurality of pre-determined sections of the news release, the predetermined sections and their ordering determining in part a desired format for the news release;","b. storing, in a digital storage medium, the content specified for each of the sections;","c. assembling the news release by retrieving from the storage medium each of the stored sections in a manner consistent with the desired format; and","d. distributing the news release to at least one recipient.","The distributed news release may optionally include audio data or video data; and may be distributed to a wireless device of a recipient, or in association with a virtual distribution mechanism, and may be accompanied by attachments comprising audio or video data. Additionally, the distributed news release may comprise a meta-news release, for example a collection of headlines corresponding to further individual news releases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["11","12","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"],"b":["31","32","34","34","33","32","34","31","21","11","31","32","34","22","34","33","23"]},"In a further embodiment, there may be included further activities associated with distribution of the news release. In particular, in box , there are automatically identified classes of recipients of the news release based on content of at least one of the sections in the news release. In one embodiment, information in the section KEY WORDS\/TOPICS is used to identify the classes. Alternatively, for example, it is known in the art of intelligent content management to identify key words in text and to use these key words to characterize the content of the text. See for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,799,304 (Miller, \u201cInformation evaluation\u201d); 5,649,186 (Ferguson, \u201cSystem and method for a computer-based dynamic information clipping service\u201d); 5,537,586 (Amram et al., \u201cEnhanced apparatus and methods for retrieving and selecting profiled textural information records form a database of defined category structures\u201d); 5,418,951 (Damashek, \u201cMethod of retrieving documents that concern the same topic\u201d); and 5,384,703 (Withgott et al., \u201cMethod and apparatus for summarizing documents according to theme\u201d), which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Such a characterization may be used to determine classes of recipients of the news release. In particular, it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize a list of recipients, wherein each recipient is placed in one or more classes according to the interests or other characteristics of the recipient. One major group of recipients in many applications for embodiments described herein is reporters. Reporters may be placed in classes according to the types of topics they cover, for example fashion, new technology, business leaders, and so forth. However, other groups are also possible recipients and may also be placed in classes according to interests or other characteristics. For example, business managers may be targeted for news releases depending on the nature of the businesses they manage. Consumers, too, may be interested in receiving information concerning specific kinds of new products. All of these groups may be treated as recipients and placed into appropriate classes. Accordingly, in step , there are automatically identified classes of recipients of the news release based on content of at least one of the sections of the news release. Thereafter, in box , there occurs the activity of distributing the news release to recipients of each identified class. In further embodiments, distribution of the news release is performed automatically and includes sending the news release as e-mail over the Internet. The e-mail may optionally include an attachment supplying additional information. Further information concerning the Internet and E-Mail is provided in the above referenced patents and, for example, in Gralla, (Ziff-Davis Press, 1996), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference; see especially pages 44\u201349.","In a further embodiment, feedback provided by a recipient of the news release is provided to the news release's promoter as shown in box  of . The feedback may include a variety of recipient responses to the news release; for example, questions, comments, reviews, or return opinions about the news release or collateral matters; or about the underlying products or services discussed in the news release; or about information contained in sources cited in the news release, including that contained in websites accessible by cited hyperlinks; or about samples of the underlying products or services. In one preferred embodiment, the feedback includes information as to which news release it responds to (since it may be only one of many news releases distributed), or includes information as to which promoter it responds to (since it may be one of many promoters on whose behalf news releases are distributed). It may also include information enabling further communication with the recipient who is the source of the feedback.","In a particular embodiment, server  of  receives the feedback as e-mail transmitted over network  from a recipient's remote computer . The server then provides the feedback as e-mail to the promoter's remote computer , over network . In an alternative embodiment, a recipient provides feedback directly to a promoter, for example as e-mail from computer  to computer . In an additional alternative embodiment, feedback is not provided directly to a promoter, but instead is provided to an intermediary agent of the promoter\u2014for example, an advertising agency.","In another embodiment, summarized in the block diagram of , identification of recipients of the news release is facilitated through the use of preference analysis techniques, such as collaborative filtering. In this embodiment, the initial steps of the embodiment of  are followed (steps \u2013). As in step  of , classes of recipients (or individual recipients) are initially identified based on the content of the news release, for example by key word techniques (step  of ). Next, however, in step  of the embodiment of , a ratings questionnaire or other preference questionnaire is distributed to each recipient, preferably accompanying the news release. The preference questionnaire elicits the recipient's degree of preference for the news release; for example, it may seek a recipient's rating of the news release on a numerical scale of 1 to 10. Each recipient's response to the preference questionnaire is then received along with other feedback on the news release, in step . The preference questionnaire may be implemented, in one embodiment, as an e-mail message, e-mail attachment, and\/or HTML link that accompanies an e-mail news release. In this embodiment, the preference feedback can then be received by a computer, such as server  of , as an e-mailed (or otherwise digitally transmitted) reply to the preference questionnaire.","Once the preference feedback has been received, the embodiment of  next (in step ) comprises the step of analyzing the recipients' preference feedback using preference analysis techniques, such as collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering techniques are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,980 of Jacobi et al, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,311 of Chislenko et al., the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, a preference vector is maintained for each news release recipient, containing as elements the recipient's numerical rating of each news release. For each given news release recipient who has already rated news releases, a host system, such as server  of , identifies groups of recipients who have the highest correlation of preference vectors with that of the given recipient, and who thus have similar tastes in news releases. This may be performed, for example, by evaluating the dot product of preference vectors of recipients and selecting a group of recipients having the highest results. Then, for each news release that the given recipient has not yet received, the system determines how highly it was rated by the selected group of recipients. Those releases that received high ratings by the selected group (for example, releases that received above a specified average numerical rating, or that received ratings which are relatively high when compared with those of other news releases that the given recipient has not yet received) are then distributed to the given recipient (step ). Thus news releases may also be distributed to recipients in a way that accords with the preferences of other recipients having similar tastes. In this way, the likelihood that recipients enjoy the distributed news releases is increased. (It should be noted that embodiments of the invention are not limited to performing collaborative filtering in the particular fashion just described, but may also perform other methods of collaborative filtering, or other forms of preference analysis.)","Finally, in the embodiment of , further preference feedback may be gained on distributed news releases, as shown by arrow  (back to step ). Steps \u2013 are thus repeated, refining data on recipients' preferences for news releases, and thereby refining news release targeting.","In further embodiments according to the invention, news releases generated in a manner similar to those described herein may be distributed by a wide variety of distribution mechanisms. Referring to , such embodiments according to the invention begin in step  with the structured generation of a news release in a fashion similar to those described in, for example, , A, B, or A\u2013C. Once the content for the news release is specified, stored, and retrieved into a desired format, the next step of the embodiment of  is to distribute the news release to recipients by one or more of a variety of distribution mechanisms (step ).","For instance, the news release may be distributed in video form  or audio form . In these cases, the method of news release generation may itself involve the capture of video or audio data for one or more of the sections of the news release, in which case the video or audio data is then distributed as part of the assembled news release. Alternatively, data in video or audio form may be automatically generated based on a user's news release content, at the user's option, and subsequently distributed. In one embodiment, a user specifying news release content over the Internet may provide an instruction via a web page selection to convert the user's specified news release text to an audio voice signal, for subsequent distribution. Whether generated from text or audio\/video input, the news release (or one or more sections thereof) may then be delivered to recipients in audio and\/or video form. The news release may be delivered by e-mail, in a form that is readable by an audio or video player on a personal computer; but the delivery may also be to a variety of receiving devices. For example, the message may be delivered in audio or video format to a personal computer, Internet appliance, or wireless device.","News releases, whether distributed in text, audio, or video form, may also be distributed to or from wireless devices  in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Thus, for example, news release content, whether received from a wireless device or by other electronic means, may be retrieved into a desired format and distributed to wireless receiving devices.","News releases may also be distributed by virtual delivery mechanisms  in accordance with the embodiment of . Thus, data corresponding to a news release (whether in text, audio, video, or other format) may be embedded in, or attached to, a virtual delivery mechanism for distribution to recipients. Such a mechanism is \u201cvirtual\u201d in that it is created in, and accessible by, software; but it effectively functions like a delivery mechanism. As a particular example, a news release may be embedded in a virtual envelope (or \u201csmart envelope\u201d) for distribution to recipients. These envelopes may then be easily forwarded by users, potentially leading to the development of virtual networks based on users' affinities and shared tastes. At the time of filing, such \u201csmart envelopes\u201d are marketed as Gizmoz\u2122 on the World Wide Web at www.gizmoz.com. Gizmoz\u2122 function like a mobile envelope that adjusts to any platform, and allow widespread replication to users in a (non-harmful) \u201cviral\u201d fashion. Embodiments according to the invention are not limited to this distribution mechanism, however, and may also be used with other virtual distribution mechanisms.","In accordance with the embodiment of , news releases may also be transmitted by other media , which may be any one of a wide variety of electronic media. Additionally, the attachments to news releases may contain content from a variety of media, including, for example, audio media, video media, virtual delivery mechanisms (such as Gizmoz\u2122 \u201csmart envelopes\u201d), or Java applets, in a fashion similar to those described above for the news releases themselves. The news releases may also be equipped with features that facilitate forwarding to other recipients. For example, a news release may contain a software \u201cbutton\u201d enabling a recipient to select the message for forwarding to another recipient by e-mail or by message delivery to a wireless device.","News releases may also be distributed, in accordance with the embodiment of , at a higher level of aggregation than that of the individual news release. Thus, a user may receive a \u201cmeta-news release\u201d that gives only the headlines (or other simple identifier), and possibly the \u201cIn Brief\u201d sections, from each of a collection of different individual news releases. These releases are preferably organized by subject matter. For example, a user may receive a meta-news release on \u201cThis Week in Medicine,\u201d containing a collection of news release headlines related to medicine. Such headlines in a meta-news release preferably enable the reader of the meta-news release to access the corresponding individual releases. For example, each headline may have an HTML link to its associated individual news release.","It should also be noted that, while several references have been made herein to use of the HTML language to implement specific features of embodiments of the invention, embodiments according to the invention are not limited to using HTML, but may instead use any language providing the desired functionality, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art in conjunction with the specification herein.","The structure of an embodiment of the invention is next described by reference to . In this embodiment, a news release aggregator operates a host computer that distributes news releases. In box , a news release recipient \u201copts in\u201d to receiving news releases that target his or her special interests, by filling out a special-interest form and communicating it to the aggregator. The special-interest form includes the subjects that the recipient is interested in, and the recipient's e-mail address. The special-interest form optionally may be communicated via an HTML page on a website, as a message to or from a wireless device, or as e-mail over the Internet.","In box , the aggregator classifies news release recipients according to their special interests, thereby enabling automatic filtering and dissemination of the news releases.","Next, in box , a news release promoter causes a news release format (such as the format illustrated below in connection with Table 1) to be filled out, submits it to the aggregator, and pays the aggregator. The promoter need not fill out and submit the form itself, but may alternatively use the services of an intermediary agency, such as an advertising agency.","The aggregator edits the promoter's submission, and returns it to the promoter (or its intermediary agent) for final approval (box ). Once the promoter approves the news release, the aggregator retrieves the stored news release sections into a format for distribution, and distributes it to recipients who have \u201copted-in\u201d to receiving news releases of that type (box ). When the aggregator distributes the news release, the news release may also be archived by subject or other index (box ), and the archive may be made available to recipients (for example via HTML pages on a website).","When a recipient receives a news release, he or she may be interested in obtaining further information about the release. Using information provided by the promoter in the release, the recipient may research the release further\u2014for example, by activating a link to the promoter's website. Also, the recipient may research the news release by activating links to the aggregator's archive of news releases (box ).","Optionally, the recipient may provide feedback on the news release (box ). As discussed above in connection with , the feedback may include a variety of recipient responses to the news release; for example, questions, comments, reviews, or return opinions about the news release or collateral matters; or about the underlying products or services discussed in the news release; or about information contained in sources cited in the news release, including that contained in websites accessible by cited hyperlinks; or about samples of the underlying products or services. Preferably, the feedback indicates the news release and\/or promoter to which it responds. It may include information enabling further communication with the recipient who is the source of the feedback. In alternative preferred embodiments, the feedback is communicated to the aggregator via HTML pages on a website of the aggregator, or by activating an information link provided with the news release, or via e-mail over the internet.","Upon receiving recipients' feedback messages, the aggregator sorts them (preferably using computer sorting techniques) and provides each feedback message to the promoter for whom it was intended (boxes  and ) or to the promoter's intermediary agent. Feedback is preferably provided to the promoter (or its agent) as E-mail over a network, such as the Internet.","Additionally, the aggregator may provide summary feedback to each promoter (or its agent), along with individual recipients' feedback. Generally, the summary feedback gives useful summary information to each promoter (or promoter's agent) about recipients' behavior, based on information about the recipients that is known to the aggregator. It could include, for example, the percentage of all news release recipients who provided feedback to the promoter; a profile of the special interests of recipients who provided feedback to the promoter; the number of recipients who used the \u201cTake Action\u201d link, or other links; the number of feedback requests to a given promoter that are requests for products; or the percentages of favorable or unfavorable feedback.","Table 1 provides an example of sections of a news release in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen in Table 1, these sections include the headline (called \u201cHEADLINE\u201d), typically up to about 10 words in length; a summary (called \u201cIN BRIEF\u201d), three key points (called \u201cHIGHLIGHTS\u201d), typically no more than about 40 words each; \u201cSHELF LIFE\u201d, information regarding the time period during which the news release will be considered newsworthy; \u201cTAKE ACTION,\u201d information allowing the recipient of the news release to access additional information concerning the release, or to take immediate action, including buying a product, for example by providing links to websites; \u201cQUOTABLES,\u201d information allowing the recipient of the news release to access quotations of principals, or other persons, related to the news release; and \u201cKEY WORDS\u201d, providing words characterizing the content of the news release, for purposes including identifying classes of recipients.","The \u201cQUOTABLES\u201d section may be implemented, in one example, as an HTML link to a web page containing the quotations. The quotations themselves may also be presented in the \u201cQUOTABLES\u201d section; or, instead, the \u201cQUOTABLES\u201d section may be implemented as part of the \u201cTAKE ACTION\u201d section.","In the \u201cTAKE ACTION\u201d section, a user may also be enabled to access full or partial text of an article (via, for example, an HTML link to a web page). The article may be particularly useful for journalists who wish to base their own articles on the news release. By providing access to the article in the \u201cTAKE ACTION\u201d section, the automated news release thus captures a feature of traditional press releases. Alternatively, the full or partial article may be useful to consumers in obtaining further information about a product described in the news release.","In addition there is a section on contact information that includes subsections providing links to relevant websites, information concerning the availability of a full press release, other available materials, and persons who may be contacted (identified as \u201cCONTACT(S)\u201d).","For the contact information, the weblinks may be provided as simply a list of site addresses, or as hyperlinks. The other available materials may include another full news release, samples of a product, or other materials\u2014optionally available as hyperlinks to websites, and optionally displayed in a bulleted list. The \u201cCONTACT(S)\u201d field may include the name of a promoter (or its intermediary agent), the promoter's (or agent's) affiliation, e-mail address, phone number, or other contact information.","The final section, \u201cFEEDBACK NOW,\u201d provides a format for recipients to provide feedback to the promoter, or its intermediary agent, as discussed above.","It should be noted that not all information supplied by the user in connection with a contemplated news release need be utilized in the news release as distributed. For example, information in \u201cKEY WORDS\u201d may be used in determining classes of recipients of the news release but may be omitted from the news release itself. In Table 2 is provided an example of a news release utilizing the sections set forth in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A through 4C","FIG. 2A","FIGS. 5 through 9","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","5","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","21","22","23","24"]},"In box  a copy of the distributed release is archived as a data record in a digital storage medium in communication with the website server.
