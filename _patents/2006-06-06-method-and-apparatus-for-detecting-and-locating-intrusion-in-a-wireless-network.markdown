title: Method and apparatus for detecting and locating intrusion in a wireless network
abstract: Method and apparatus for locating an intruding radio frequency signal in a wireless network. Relative distance measurements are computed between pairs of receivers from a plurality of receivers to the source of the intruding signal based on received signal strength. Loci of possible locations are plotted, points of intersection are determined, and a clustering algorithm is applied, yielding the location of the source of the intruding signal. The invention is distinguished in that its operation does not require knowledge of either the transmitted power or antenna gain of the intruding signal source.

No. 60\/690,540, having been filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jun. 14, 2005 and now incorporated by reference herein.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","1. Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the field of location of radio frequency transmitters. This invention relates more specifically to the algorithms and processing techniques applied thereto for the location of rogue radio frequency transmitters based upon multiple measures of received signal strength.","2. Prior Art","There exist techniques that can provide an accurate fix on a transmitter's location. Generally, however, these techniques require one or more of the following: a priori knowledge about the transmitter, a finite, calibrated geospatial reference frame, a cooperative transmitter, and\/or a large, geographically fixed receiver\/network infrastructure.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,006,838 B2 to Diener et al discloses an apparatus and method for determining the location of an unknown wireless radio signal source. The unknown source's signal is received at a plurality of known receiving locations where one of the plurality is used as a reference. The source's signals received at all other receiving locations are compared to the reference. A reference signal is transmitted by a known location whereupon the difference of time of arrival between the known reference signal and the unknown source's signal is computed and the location of the unknown source computed therefrom. This system has the disadvantage, however, in that it is not passively listening to an intruding source, rather it must actively transmit a reference signal having the effect of making its presence known.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,993,592 B2 to Krumm et al discloses a location measurement apparatus and process for determining the location of radio-frequency badges where the badges transmit a message containing their unique identifier to receivers at known locations. The receivers measure signal strength of the transmitting badge if it exceeds a predefined threshold. The receivers then transmit data to a central computer as to the time, identification and received signal strength indication (RSSI) for each badge, which is entered into a table. Locations are computed for those badges whose signal strength exceeds the predefined threshold. This system is an example of an approach where a calibrated geospatial reference frame tracks and locates signal sources. Since the system is calibrated on signal strength to representative locations, the received signal strength at any one of a plurality of fixed position receivers from a source is readily matched up. The utility of this system would be significantly diminished where intruding sources were outside of a calibrated geospatial reference frame because the necessary vectors would be unavailable.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,920,329 B2 to Kennedy, Jr. et al discloses an apparatus and method to find the location of two-way radios amongst a plurality of base stations at known geographic points. The invention employs a time of arrival determination which may also be combined with an angle of arrival determination. With this system, antenna characteristics of the receiving base stations is critical, as well as is their orientation, meaning the system must be well calibrated. This would further suggest that the system has no utility for other than a permanently fixed deployment.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,861,982 B2 to Forstrom et al discloses a method for determining the location of a non-cooperative radio frequency emitter requiring at least three receivers sharing common time with a time reference. Trilateration is employed on signal detection times from emitter to receivers. Since any or all of the receivers may be mobile, communication with the reference provides an accurate adjustment of propagation time in compensation for the receiver's mobility. Since trilateration is employed, this system will have no utility with fewer than three receivers deployed, operating, and in reception of the signal source.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,475 B2 to Bahl et al discloses a method for a mobile computer user to determine his location within a building. Wireless base stations are employed at known locations throughout a building. Signal strength is measured and looked up in a table of known locations of base stations and their respective signal strengths. The current location of the mobile computer user is determined as the one corresponding to the most likely base station. The method may be used in the opposite sense where the base stations detect the signal strength of the mobile computer user, provided a reference signal strength versus distance of the mobile computer from the base stations is known. This system, however, depends entirely upon charted signal strengths at predetermined locations within a fixed structure. It would have little utility for geolocating a wider ranging intruder signal source of unknown signal strength.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,019,694 B2 to Krumm et al discloses a method for locating radio frequency transmitters. A plurality of receivers measure and forward signal strength to a central computer. Multiple measured signal strengths attributed to the same transmitter form a locating signal strength vector. Exemplary vectors are generated in a calibration procedure to various locations. The locating signal strength vector is compared to the previously obtained exemplary vectors to determine with which exemplary vector the locating signal strength vector corresponds, so as to determine the location of the radio frequency transmitter. The benefits of this system include reception by as few as only one receiver and compatibility with an existing computer network. The drawback of this system, however, is that it is possible to locate a signal source only if receivers are already placed in, and the network to which they are connected is extended to, every conceivable location a signal source of interest might be.","Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) methods are desirable to use, but they require directional antennas that must be precisely sited and\/or complex receiver hardware with additional channel capacity for distributing precise time references. Aside from the time it would take to integrate, calibrate and maintain these components, their addition greatly increases the cost of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS).","What is lacking from the prior art is a system that instead employs upon simple omni-directional detection of rogue transmitters without the need for vast databases of a priori information such as calibrated RSSI look-up tables, that, when simply placed in any geospatial location, will immediately begin to detect and geolocate intruding signal sources in a wireless network.","Physical Challenges to Wireless Intrusion Detection","a. Detection of Received Signal Strength","The present invention performs location solely on the non-directional Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) provided by the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless cards. When the present invention achieves a \u201csighting\u201d of a rogue transmitter, it logs and reports the observation time, RSSI, and other information. The RSSI alone is not a highly useful measurement in that it provides only two facts: an indication of where the measured RSSI falls within the measurement scale relative to the maximum RSSI; and that a stronger intrusion signal has a higher RSSI than a weaker signal.","b. Omnidirectional Radiation Patterns","Most wireless access points utilize omnidirection antennas in their wireless network infrastructure. These will provide the rogue transmitter a source of entry. RSSI in combination with the analytical tools does provide a valid geolocation method for the case of a rogue transmitter. However, it is clearly invalid for the case of a rogue transmitter employing a high directionality, high gain antenna.","c. Two-Dimensional Geometry","If it is assumed that a rogue transmitter and the WIDS receivers are coplanar, i.e., they are all at the same height or altitude, the mathematical analysis can be limited to two dimensions. However, while a two-dimensional analysis is suitable for a drive-by network intruder scenario, for example, it is clearly inadequate for three-dimensional structures such as multi-floor office buildings.","d. Non-Flat Earth","For distances that are less than a few tens of kilometers it is essentially immaterial that the equations used in the analysis of RSSI are based on plane trigonometry rather than spherical trigonometry. Thus, if a grid system is used, it may be assumed only to be based on rectangular coordinates, where the origin, orientation, and scale are arbitrary. For the characteristically small RSSI reception distances it is sufficient to consider latitude\/longitude (lat\/long) coordinates to be rectangular on a plane, assuming that longitude is scaled appropriately for the given latitude.","e. Radio Frequency (RF) Propagation Effects","Little about RF propagation, particularly through unknown numbers and composition of walls, can be assumed. The single greatest variation seems to be the nearly random factor of radio frequency (RF) attenuation due to the environment: walls, floors, ceilings, people, and other obstructions. In particular, the attenuation due to walls is most unpredictable, as their composition and style of construction vary widely within even a small area of a building. Signal paths that may be clear line-of-sight or travel through one, two, three, or more walls must be accounted for. However, experiments have indicated that, in practice, the ceteris paribus principle held and RF attenuation seemed to balance out on the multiple paths.","f. Necessary Conditions","Rogue network intruders must transmit There is no way for a WIDS receiver to detect a purely passive monitor. WIDS sightings must be simultaneous to detect a mobile rogue transmitter. Stationary transmitters, which transmit periodically, can be located by integrating measurements obtained over a period of time.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for detecting the presence of and locating the source of a radio frequency signal.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for locating an intruding radio frequency signal in a wireless network.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for determining the relative distance between the source of an intruding signal and two receivers based on respective received signal strength indications.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for determining the location of an intruding signal source by identifying the intersection of loci of possible locations.","It is yet still a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for detecting and locating the source of an intruding signal without dependence upon directional antennas.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for detecting and locating the source of an intruding signal without dependence upon knowledge of either or both the transmitting power or antenna gain of the intruding signal source.","An additional object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for detecting and locating the source of an intruding signal without dependence upon time synchronization between receivers.","An additional object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for detecting and locating the source of an intruding signal without being limited to locating such sources only within a pre-calibrated geospace.","Briefly stated, the present invention, method and apparatus for detecting and locating intrusion in a wireless network, achieves these and other objects through computing relative distance measurements between pairs from a plurality of receivers to the source of the intruding signal based on received signal strength and through determining the loci of possible locations, by plotting the loci, by finding the points of intersection of these loci and by applying a clustering algorithm thereto from which the actual location of the source of the intruding signal is found. The present invention is distinguished from the prior art in that its operation does not rely upon knowledge of either the transmitted power or antenna gain of the intruding signal source.","In the fundamental embodiment of the present invention, method for detecting and locating a transmitting source of a radio frequency (RF) signal intrusion into a wireless network, an intruding radio frequency signal is first received by a plurality of receivers. The received signal strength Ris then measured on each of the plurality of receivers. For each paired combination of receivers, one relative distance measurement d to the location of the transmitting source is computed, where the one relative distance measurement d is a function of the received signal strength Rof each of the receivers in each of the paired combinations. For each paired combination of the plurality of receivers, the possible locations of the transmitting source lying on the locus of points satisfying d=[R\/R]is computed. The computation further comprises computing the displacement c of the center of the locus from the first receiver in each paired combination according to",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"D","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"d"}},{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"d"}}],"mo":"+"}}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"D","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"d"}},{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"d"}}],"mo":"+"}}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["c","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["c","D"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},{"mi":"x","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"}}}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"y","mn":"1"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["c","D"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"y","mn":"2"},{"mi":"y","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"}},"mi":"is"}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","1","2","2"]},"According to a fundamental embodiment of the present invention, method for detecting and locating a transmitting source of a radio frequency (RF) signal intrusion into a wireless network, the number of possible loci on which an intruding radio frequency signal source may be located is determined as M, where",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mi":"N"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"2"}}]}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"N","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mi":"N"},"mn":"2"}}}}},"br":{}},"Still according to a fundamental embodiment of the present invention, method for detecting and locating a transmitting source of a radio frequency (RF) signal intrusion into a wireless network, the number of possible points at which the loci intersect and at which an intruding radio frequency signal source may be further deemed to be located is determined as I, where",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mi":"M"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"2"}}]}}},{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"M","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mi":"M"},{"mfrac":[{"msup":{"mi":"N","mn":"4"},"mn":"4"},{"msup":{"mi":"N","mn":"3"},"mn":"2"},{"msup":{"mi":"N","mn":"2"},"mn":"4"},{"mi":"N","mn":"2"}],"mo":["-","-","+"]}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"In contrast to and in improvement upon prior art devices, the present invention may be rapidly deployed to an unsurveyed and uncalibrated location and commence locating a radio frequency source.

Today's most notable example of this approach is the Global Positional Service (GPS); see, for instance, the detailed description by Strang and Borre [Stra97] or a recent Scientific American article on GPS [Eng04]. Strang and Borre [Stra97, p. 448] describe the basis of GPS as follows: \u201cIts measurements yield distances and not angles. We are dealing with trilateration and not triangulation. This has been desired for centuries, because angles are definitely awkward.\u201d On a surface (i.e., a 2-D world) three distances define three circles that ideally intersect at a single point: the target. GPS (in the 3-D world) finds the intersection of spheres\u2014there are two solutions with three spheres but one is discarded as being too far from the Earth's surface. While technically. GPS trilaterates, in fact GPS needs at least one or more additional satellites in view to compensate for timing errors that result in distance errors. Time is thus considered to be a fourth dimension. In the present invention the term multilateration is used instead of trilateration, as usually more than three distances are measured.","As for the measured RSSIs of the present invention, it has already been pointed out that both the characteristics of the rogue transmitter and the RF propagation conditions are unknown. Therefore the present invention performs at best a relative distance measurement.","Referring to and depict the results of experiments performed to determine what the RSSI actually measures and to relate that value to an indication of distance. It can be seen that:\n\n","The prior art [Aldu04] has experimented extensively with the relationship between RSSI and distance. One set of experiments found that the best-fitting model for the observed data was a 4degree polynomial, but the coefficients for terms with degree greater than one were small compared to that of the linear term that the simple linear fit to the data in the present invention is satisfactory. There is a discrepancy in [Aldu04] in that their 4degree equation does not match the data from which it is derived, nor does it show an inverse relationship between the RSSI and distance although that observation is made in the text of the paper. Inspection of their data indicates that the linear model is an excellent fit for the present invention.","In the present invention linear regression of RSSI versus distance is performed  using Microsoft Excel for convenience in graphing the results.

The relative distance \u201cd\u201d is then computed as d=d\/d. The location of WIDS receiver # is denoted as (x, y) and the location of WIDS receiver # is denoted as (x, y). The location of the rogue transmitter must lie on the locus of points that satisfy d=d\/d. It can be shown that the locus of points is a circle, or, in the special case where d=1, the locus of points is a line.

The rogue transmitters are denoted as \u201cTx\u201d in .

The WIDS receiver # and # locations are (1, 1) and (4, 4), respectively, with relative distance d=d\/d=2.","Therefore, two RSSIs from a pair of sightings of a rogue transmitter by WIDS receivers, which produces a single relative distance measurement, yields a circle as the locus of points that satisfy that relative distance relationship. However, if a third sighting is made, three pairs of relative distances can be calculated from the three RSSIs, resulting in three circles. Three intersecting circles, however, do not yield one point of intersection because the three circles are not independent and an interesting but frustrating relationship emerges.","Referring to  and  depicts the problem with only three sightings being that there are two possible locations of the rogue transmitter.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention it is necessary to have a minimum of four sightings. Referring to  and , adding a fourth sighting to the examples shown in  and  enables unique solutions. The need for the fourth sighting when relative distances are used instead of absolute distances is analogous to the problem in statistics when a \u201cdegree of freedom\u201d is lost for each linear dependency in a relationship. By analogy, the Global Positioning System (GPS), which measures absolute distances instead of the weaker relative distances in the present invention, requires a minimum of four satellite sightings with additional sightings being even better. Clearly, this limitation of the present invention is not unprecedented among geolocation systems.","Still referring to  and  it is noted that half of the intersections between pairs of circles fall on the desired location of the rogue transmitter.","Referring to , it is shown that notwithstanding four sightings, it is critical to ensure that collinear placement of WIDS receivers is avoided, because if the four WIDS receivers lie on a straight line two solutions are obtained rather than the unambiguous unique solution. Having three collinear WIDS receivers in the present invention is acceptable. The problem arises when there are four collinear receivers. While it was already discussed that it is recommended that more than four sightings be used to reduce errors due to actual RSSI measurements, this may prove to be difficult to achieve with practical densities of deployed WIDS receivers, but, at the very least, non-collinear placement of any four WIDS receivers of the present invention should be avoided so as not to waste any opportunity to geolocate accurately to a single, unambiguous point. The characteristics of the intersecting circles graphically depicted. The numerical solutions of their two intersections must be found.","Given two circles specified by their center points and radii:\n\nCircle 1: Center point =(), radius \n\nCircle 2: Center point =(), radius \n\ntheir two points of intersection is obtained:\n\n=() P=()\n","Referring to and , L is the Euclidean distance between two center points Pand P, where L is computed as \n\n=\u221a{square root over (()+())}{square root over (()+())},\n\nIntermediate Points of Intersection\n","Referring to and , points Pand Pare mapped on to the x-axis of the coordinate system as the two new points P\u2032=(0, 0) and P\u2032=(L, 0) , .
