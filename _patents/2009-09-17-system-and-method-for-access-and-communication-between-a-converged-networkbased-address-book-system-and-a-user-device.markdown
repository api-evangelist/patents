{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61\/097,745, filed Sep. 17, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","The present disclosure relates to a converged address book system, and in particular to access and communication interfaces, methods and operations between the user's device and the address book server for a converged address book system.","In a social context or setting, an address book is a useful tool for establishing social relationships between people. A typical address book contains a list of contact entries, with each contact entry comprising a list of contact information. Such information could include, but is not limited to, a name, physical address, email address, telephone number, personal identification number, instant messaging identifier, among others, which enables one user to contact another user. In addition to the contact entries, the address book system may also include a user's own personal contact information.","Growing innovation across services domain and mobile devices creates a number of ways to organize and manage contact information. With rapid growth in the usage of address books on end-user devices, the mobile industry has produced many different types of address book systems, associated data formats and protocols to manage the same. While this offers more choice to end users, it poses a very bad user experience and causes interoperability issues across differing address book applications. In other words, there is a lack of unified user experience and inconsistent user experience across devices with regard to address book applications, particularly for wireless mobile devices where optimization and efficiency of resources is important.","Several activities are under way within various standards organizations such as the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Converged Address Book (CAB), Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), to provide a converged address book system. However, a gap currently exists in terms of defining an underlying system architecture and associated functionality that would permit users to manage (e.g. add, modify, delete), publish, subscribe, search, and share information as part of a converged address book system across various devices over a network. Interaction with legacy or external address book systems (e.g. importing data from other address book systems) is another key functionality of a standard converged address book system.","In particular a communication and access interface from the client to the server or network-based address book system is not specified. Current solutions are not optimal for a mobile device in terms of over-the-air (OTA) traffic and client complexity including memory footprint and data processing requirements. Existing solutions are also not adequate for dealing with requirements related to a converged address book system such as import data from legacy address books to converged address book system with user's request, searching for data stored in network data sources (e.g. XDM and non-XDM repositories), subscriptions to personal contact information of other users, and sharing contact information transparent to the user knowing the underlying techniques.","The present disclosure provides a method of sharing contacts within a converged address book system that includes a converged address book server, the method comprising: receiving, at the converged address book server, a request for contact information to be shared with a recipient identified in the request, the recipient being different from a requestor that communicated the request; obtaining the contact information from a repository; and delivering the shared contact to the recipient.","The present disclosure further provides a method for initiating sharing of contacts within a converged address book system that includes a converged address book client, the method comprising: sending, from the converged address book client to a converged address book server, a request for contact information to be shared with a recipient identified in the request; and receiving, in response to the sending, a confirmation from the converged address book server.","The present disclosure still further provides a method for interaction with a legacy address book system from a network based converged address book system, the method comprising: receiving a request to import legacy address book data from a legacy address book system; contacting the legacy address book system and supplying access parameters; retrieving legacy address book data from the legacy address book system; and storing the legacy address book data in a storage associated with the network based converged address book system.","The present disclosure still further provides a method for initiating interaction with a legacy address book system from a network based converged address book system, the method comprising: requesting, from an address book client, importation of legacy address book data from a legacy address book system; and receiving, at the address book client, a notification to synchronize the address book client with a network based address book storage, wherein the notification to synchronize indicates that the network based address book system has imported legacy address book data.","The present disclosure therefore provides a method and system to define an interface between a user device and the network-based address book (NAB) system to communicate and access information from the network-based address book to the mobile device. This interface provides a consistent method to access and communicate necessary requests from the mobile device to the network-based address book system.","In addition, in one embodiment this interface will ease deployment of converged network-based address book systems, providing a low barrier to entry for existing legacy mobile devices while providing a seamless path for more advanced devices in the future.","Reference is now made to .  shows an exemplary system architecture for a network-based converged address book system. As is seen in , the system is divided into a network side  and a device side .","Device side  could be part of any device on which a converged address book might be used. Examples include wireless devices such as cell phones, personal digital assistants, two-way pagers or other such devices. Device side  could further include wired devices such as personal computers, laptop computers, set-top boxes, network entities acting on behalf of the user, among others.","Device side  includes a Converged Address Book (CAB) client . Address book client  is a principal functional entity on the device side . Address book client  communicates with the Address book server , as described below. Interface  between the address book client  and address book server  carries requests such as subscribe, search, share, and import, among others, from a user of the converged address book to the network side . One possible method to implement interface  between the address book client and the address book server is via a proxy model, for example storing the client requests in the CAB XDMS , (as shown by the interface ) which are then retrieved by the address book server  (as shown by the interface ).","In one embodiment, the underlying protocol for interface  between address book client  and address book server  is implemented using Internet Protocol (IP) protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). For those skilled in the art may understand that other protocols such as XCAP, SOAP, XML-RPC, or REST may be used as an alternative to or in combination with standard HTTP protocol. Further, in one embodiment the body or the payload of the protocol may contain the necessary syntax or protocol to convey the requests.","A further functional block on device side  includes the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Data Synchronization (DS) Client . The primary responsibility of the OMA DS Client  is to assist address book client  to synchronize a user's personal contact information and address book data between the device side  and the network side . In one embodiment this is accomplished using an OMA Data Synchronization (DS) server  in the network.","In one embodiment the underlying protocol used for synchronization can be HTTP or Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) PUSH. The notification message framework defined by OMA DS may be used as a mechanism for the notification of CAB information to the CAB user. For example, updates to contact information resulting from contact subscriptions, changes in a user's personal contact card information, CAB status of the users in the address book, among others, may be indicated through the notification.","Notifications may also be delivered through other mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), email, instant messaging, SIP Notify, SIP Push, among others.","The interface between address book client  and OMA DS client  is responsible for necessary communication between the CAB client and SyncML client to synchronize the user's personal contact information and address book data between the device and network.","On network side , address book server  is the main component of the converged address book system.","Referring to , an address book server  may include one or more of the following functions.","User account manager and authentication agent : this agent is responsible for managing user authentication and account information including user preferences and custom aspects, such as configuration to synchronize only partial address book data from the server to the client, receive\/not receive notifications, among others.","A notification function : The notification function is used to notify the client of updates in a subscribed contact. This function may use the DS notification framework or other mechanisms such as email, sms, Instant Messaging (IM), SIP NOTIFY, among others.","CAB XML Document Management Client (XDMC) : this client is responsible for the access and manipulation of address book data such as a personal contact card (PCC) and address book information stored in a CAB XDMS  database or a separate address book storage .","Contact Search Function , Contact Subscription Function , Contact Share Function  and Interworking Function  are intrinsic functions at address book server  to perform the network side operations of the interface, as described below with reference to .","Referring again to , a further element on the network side  is the XML Document Management (XDM) Enabler . The XDM Enabler  includes CAB XML Document Management Server (XDMS)  that comprises of a personal contact card (PCC) XML Document Management Server (XDMS), which is a database containing all PCCs of users in the converged address book system; Address Book XML Document Management Server (XDMS), which is a network database representing users address book data; among others.","Alternatively, a further entity on network side  may include a Address Book Storage , which stores an address book for each user on the network. This storage can be synchronized with an address book client  on the device.","A further component on the network side  may be remote CAB servers . It is possible that CAB servers may be hosted in other network domains. The remote CAB server interface is an interface that permits interworking between trusted CAB systems in one or more network domains.","A further entity on network side  includes network based legacy address book systems . Legacy address book systems are address book systems that may already exist. For example, Facebook\u2122, Outlook\u2122, Yahoo!\u2122 contacts, among others, may already exist on the network side. These legacy systems are used to manage personal contact and address book information and are also typically network based.","The above architecture could be utilized to provide a converged address book service among various clients within a network. Functionality for such a converged address book would include subscribing to the contacts in the address book, publishing information and changes in information, synchronizing between a device and network, interaction with legacy systems, contact search, contact share, among other functionality. The above list is not meant to be exhaustive and other functionality for a converged address book architecture or service may be implemented.","Regarding the interface between the address book server  and device side  and also between the address book server  and the XDM databases \/ and address book storage , the following is responsible for achieving a functionality of the converged network based address book system. In the present disclosure, the user device can either be a wireless device, such as a mobile device or it can be a wired device such as a personal computer.","The network based address book system mainly consists of two types of data: namely, a user's personal contact card and address book data which contains contact information regarding entities within a user's address book.","Present Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) client address book architecture documentation specifies four key functionalities. These include contact search, contact subscription, contact share and interaction with legacy address books. The present disclosure relates to implementing the above functions.","While the examples below are illustrated with regard Internet protocol (IP) based protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), in other embodiments a protocol such as SIP or proprietary protocols could instead be used. The present disclosure is not meant to be limited to HTTP and extensible markup language (XML) and the use of proprietary or SIP based protocols with an appropriate payload may be employed. In a further embodiment, the same XML payload from the present disclosure may be used to transport the request data over other protocols such as SIP, among others.","One element of the interface is a definition of a payload for carrying requested data from a device or other user equipment to a network based server. The payload is, in one embodiment, interoperable with other document based systems and can, for example, be XML based. The use of XML allows the payload to be extensible and interoperable with other document based systems.","When XML is used, an associated MIME type and XML schema will also be defined for transporting XML documents or fragments over transport protocols such as HTTP. One such protocol method for requests is HTTP POST. The protocol methods supported may also include such as HTTP PUT, HTTP GET, among others.","The four interfaces\u2014Contact Search; Contact Subscribe; Contact Share; and Interaction with Legacy Address Book systems are described below.","Contact Search","The converged address book enabler aims to provide a mechanism to search for contact information. It allows the converged address book users to search for the contact information from within the host converged address book system, remote converged address book system and\/or external databases made available by a service provider such as, for example, Yellow Pages\u2122. The contact information made available for search operations is subject to a converged address book user's authorization rules and a service provider's policies.","Reference is now made to .  shows an address book client  and address book server .","In order for an address book client  to perform a contact search of address book server , a request needs to be made. Various requests would be known to those in the art, and two examples include a simple keyword search and a complex XQuery search.","A simple keyword search model allows the address book user to query a network address book by utilizing simple keywords.

The SIM\/RUIM card can have approximately 64K of memory and hold many key configuration , and other information  such as identification, and subscriber related information.","When required network registration or activation procedures have been completed, mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the network . As illustrated in , network  can consist of multiple base stations communicating with the mobile device.","Signals received by antenna  through communication network  are input to receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection and the like, and in the example system shown in , analog to digital (A\/D) conversion. ND conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding for example, by DSP  and input to transmitter  for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over the communication network  via antenna . DSP  not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in receiver  and transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in DSP .","Mobile device  preferably includes a microprocessor  which controls the overall operation of the device. Communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through communication subsystem . Microprocessor  also interacts with further device subsystems such as the display , flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , serial port , one or more keyboards or keypads , speaker , microphone , other communication subsystem  such as a short-range communications subsystem and any other device subsystems generally designated as . Serial port  could include a USB port or other port known to those in the art.","Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as keyboard  and display , for example, may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.","Operating system software used by the microprocessor  is preferably stored in a persistent store such as flash memory , which may instead be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile memory such as RAM . Received communication signals may also be stored in RAM .","As shown, flash memory  can be segregated into different areas for both computer programs  and program data storage , ,  and . These different storage types indicate that each program can allocate a portion of flash memory  for their own data storage requirements. Microprocessor , in addition to its operating system functions, preferably enables execution of software applications on the mobile device. A predetermined set of applications that control basic operations, including at least data and voice communication applications for example, will normally be installed on mobile device  during manufacturing. Other applications could be installed subsequently or dynamically.","A preferred software application may be a personal information manager (PIM) application having the ability to organize and manage data items relating to the user of the mobile device such as, but not limited to, e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. Naturally, one or more memory stores would be available on the mobile device to facilitate storage of PIM data items. Such PIM application would preferably have the ability to send and receive data items, via the wireless network . In a preferred embodiment, the PIM data items are seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated, via the wireless network , with the mobile device user's corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. Further applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the network , an auxiliary I\/O subsystem , serial port , short-range communications subsystem  or any other suitable subsystem , and installed by a user in the RAM  or preferably a non-volatile store (not shown) for execution by the microprocessor . Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the device and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","In a data communication mode, a received signal such as a text message or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the microprocessor , which preferably further processes the received signal for element attributes for output to the display , or alternatively to an auxiliary I\/O device .","A user of mobile device  may also compose data items such as email messages for example, using the keyboard , which is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard or telephone-type keypad, in conjunction with the display  and possibly an auxiliary I\/O device . Such composed items may then be transmitted over a communication network through the communication subsystem .","For voice communications, overall operation of mobile device  is similar, except that received signals would preferably be output to a speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is preferably accomplished primarily through the speaker , display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information for example.","Serial port  in  would normally be implemented in a personal digital assistant (PDA)-type mobile device for which synchronization with a user's desktop computer (not shown) may be desirable, but is an optional device component. Such a port  would enable a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and would extend the capabilities of mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to mobile device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the device through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to thereby enable secure device communication. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, serial port  can further be used to connect the mobile device to a computer to act as a modem.","WiFi Communications Subsystem  is used for WiFi Communications and can communication with access point .","Other communications subsystems , such as a short-range communications subsystem, is a further component which may provide for communication between mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a Bluetooth\u2122 communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.","CAB Client  could interact with processor .
