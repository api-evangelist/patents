title: Method and apparatus for dynamically grouping items in applications
abstract: Techniques for dynamically grouping items include determining context associated with each group comprising one or more items; and determining current context at a device. In response to determining that prompted prompt is presented for input to indicate an item, a suggested group is determined based on the current context at the device and relevance of a context associated with the suggested group. The suggested group is presented. In some embodiments, prompted prompt is presented to name a suggested group; and, in response, data indicating the suggested group is stored as a permanent group associated with the name. In some embodiments, relevance is determined for each item of a group. A group avatar is generated based on M images associated with the items that have the most relevance.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","Some Example Embodiments","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["On hand-held information processing devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cellular telephones, a user is often prompted to enter a group of items, such as multiple contacts for an email or text or photo, or a shopping list of items (including groceries) to purchase, or a series of events or dates for a calendar. Usually, the user operates the hand-held device to cause the items on a source list to scroll across a display screen of limited size until one of the items of interest appears on the screen. The user then additionally operates the hand-held device to select the displayed item and add it to the group. These user operations often require that the user's eyes be focused on the display screen until both operations are completed several times and that at least one of the user's hands be continually occupied to operate the hand-held device. This can be dangerous when the user is engaged in other actions, such as walking, exercising, driving or operating equipment. Furthermore, such operations involve a local device consuming memory, processor and display screen resources to present and scroll the long lists. If the long lists are first communicated across a network, excessive network resources are also consumed.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for quick identification of items for a group that does not consume so many device and network resources or require continuous hand and eye involvement. In various embodiments, techniques presented here allow groups for applications on device to be formed dynamically with less consumption of device display resources (and less consumption of supporting memory and processor resources) and fewer inputs by the user.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises determining context associated with each group comprising one or more items for a plurality of groups. The method also comprises determining current context at a device. The method also comprises, in response to determining that prompted prompt is presented for input to indicate an item, determining a suggested group of the plurality of groups based on the current context at the device and relevance of a context associated with the suggested group. The method also comprises causing the suggested group to be presented.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to determine context associated with each group comprising one or more items for a plurality of groups. The apparatus is also caused to determining current context at the apparatus. The apparatus is also caused, in response to determining that prompted prompt is presented for input to indicate an item, to determine a suggested group of the plurality of groups based on the current context at the apparatus and relevance of a context associated with the suggested group. The apparatus is also caused to cause the suggested group to be presented.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to determining context associated with each group comprising one or more items for a plurality of groups. The apparatus is also caused to perform determining current context at the apparatus. The apparatus is also caused to perform, in response to determining that a prompt is presented for input to indicate an item, determining a suggested group of the plurality of groups based on the current context at the apparatus and relevance of a context associated with the suggested group. The apparatus is also caused to perform causing the suggested group to be presented.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for determining context associated with each group comprising one or more items for a plurality of groups. The apparatus also comprises means for determining current context at the apparatus. The apparatus also comprises means for determining a suggested group of the plurality of groups based on the current context at the apparatus and relevance of a context associated with the suggested group in response to determining that a prompt is presented for input to indicate an item. The apparatus also comprises means for causing the suggested group to be presented.","In some embodiments, a method includes, or apparatus or computer readable medium are configured for, presenting a prompt to name a suggested group; and, in response, storing data indicating the suggested group as a permanent group associated with the name.","In some embodiments, a method includes, or apparatus or computer readable medium are configured for, determining relevance for each item of a group. A group avatar is generated based on a number M of images associated with a number M items that have the most relevance.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for dynamically grouping items are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term avatar refers to a graphical image that can be presented on a display device and that represents a physical object or set of physical objects.","Although various embodiments are described with respect to selecting a group of contacts on a cellular telephone from a list of contacts, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other lists of items and devices, such as a list of grocery or shopping items, a list of events to be scheduled, or a list of purchase prices or telephone numbers to be selected, among others, on a variety of devices including cell phones, PDAs, or laptop or desktop computers, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"To address this problem, the system  of  introduces the capability to allow automatically assisted dynamic group definitions or identification or both. The automatic assist comes as permanently storing, at the user's option, any group generated dynamically; or representing groups using an avatar made up of the most relevant members of the group; or dynamically suggesting the next one or more items of a group desired as input to a particular application using measures of relevance; or some combination. The number of pointing device operations, and corresponding user glances are kept near a minimum given the available context information. This approach is called dynamic grouping of items.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  having connectivity to network service or social networking service (collectively referenced hereinafter as service ) or different user equipment  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like. In other embodiments, the UE  is stand alone, such as a PDA without wireless communication capability; and network , services  and different user equipment  are omitted.","The client-server model of computer process interaction is widely known and used. According to the client-server model, a client process sends a message including a request to a server process, and the server process responds by providing a service. The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices, called hosts, and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term \u201cserver\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service, or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly, the term \u201cclient\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request, or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein, the terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d refer to the processes, rather than the host computers, unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition, the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts (sometimes called tiers) for reasons that include reliability, scalability, and redundancy, among others. A well known client process available on most nodes connected to a communications network is a World Wide Web client (called a \u201cweb browser,\u201d or simply \u201cbrowser\u201d) that interacts through messages formatted according to the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) with any of a large number of servers called World Wide Web servers that provide web pages. The service is a server that uses service data in service data structure . Similarly, social networking service is a server that uses member identifiers data in member identifiers data structure ","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.). The UE  includes a display screen and pointing device, as described in more detail below with reference to a computer system depicted in  and mobile terminal in . Local data for UE  applications are stored on local data structure , such as a flash card or internal disk.","An application process  that uses a group of items selected from a list of items in items data structure  is executed on UE . For example, in some embodiments the application  is a personal information management (PIM) system that uses an ordered list of grocery items to buy, or a schedule of events for the coming months. In some embodiments, the application  is a client process communicating with a network service  across network , and the list in data structure  is downloaded, entirely or in part, from the service . For example, the list is downloaded from service data structure of service  or member identifiers data structure of social networking service . In some embodiments, the service provides World Wide Web (WWW) pages in one or more messages sent using a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the application  is a WWW client process called a browser. In some embodiments, the application is a telephone dialing process for connecting to other user equipment, such as different user equipment , and the list is a list of other users, called a contact list, whether ordered numerically by telephone number or alphabetically by contact name or unordered.","In the illustrated embodiment, the application  includes a dynamic grouping module  that provides dynamic grouping of items by suggesting the next item or group of items based on relevance to the current context at the UE  and past contexts associated with prior groups stored in prior groups data structure . The current context at the UE  is stored in one or more data structures represented by current context data structure . The meaning of text received at the UE is determined using a semantics engine  in the illustrated embodiment. The relevance to the current context at UE  of text and other context information associated with items and prior groups is determined by a relevance engine  in the illustrated embodiment. In some embodiments, the list selection module  is included in an operating system of the user equipment, e.g., UE . The application  sends the list to the module  in the operating system using an application programming interface (API) for the module  or a messaging protocol such as HTTP; and the module  controls the interaction with the user. The dynamic grouping module  is a means of achieving the advantages of automatically assisting in the identification and storage of groups of items for one or more applications with fewer display operations, thus saving resources on the device.","In the illustrated embodiments, the components of system  include dynamic grouping module , semantics engine , and relevance engine . It is contemplated that one or more functions of these components may be separated or combined in one or more components or performed by one or more other components of equivalent functionality, e.g., in a network service .","Although data structures ,  and  are depicted as integral structures on UE , in other embodiments, one or more of these data structures, or portions thereof, are arranged in a different way on UE  or one or more other nodes of the network , including nodes of one or more services  or other user equipment .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","144","202","204","206","210","220","200","132","101","110","110"]},"The group ID field  holds data that uniquely identifies the entry  on UE  or on the network. In some embodiments, the group ID field holds data that indicates the type of items in the group, e.g., whether items to be purchased, contacts, content to be rendered for human perception, events, or some other items to be grouped by an application. The number of items field  holds data that indicates the number of items in the prior group.","The group name field  holds data that indicates a user name for the group if any. Some groups are temporary and defined by a user as needed but not named for permanent storage and subsequent retrieval. In the illustrated embodiment, such temporary groups are tracked as a prior group entry  in a prior group data structure, such as prior groups data structure , but have no user assigned group name in field .","The items list field  includes, for each item in the group, an item field  and an item activity field . The item field  holds data that identifies the item, such as a name for the item or a catalog number for the item or a pointer to a separate database of items that provides additional information about the item, such as items data structure . The item activity field  holds data that indicates the activity of the item, such as an amount or date of a most recent price change for an item to be purchased, or the date of the most recent update of contact information for a contact, such as a most recent update to a social networking page of the contact. In some embodiments, item activity field  is included in the items data structure . In some embodiments, item activity field  is omitted.","Context field  holds data that indicates the past context or contexts associated with one or more former uses of the prior group. The past context information recorded here indicates the context at the UE  at each unexpired time that the prior group was used. It is the past context associated with such former use that is compared to the current context at the UE  to determine the relevance of the prior group to the current use of the application  by the user. Any context information that is considered useful for this purpose is included. In some embodiments, the relevance is determined using a few simple rules, such as a weighted sum of multiple factors, built into the module ; and in some embodiments, the relevance is a sophisticated consideration of multiple factors as determined by relevance engine . Some former uses are considered too old to be relevant and are deleted from the context field  or given no weight. Therefore, in the illustrated embodiment, the date or dates of the former use is recorded in the context field .","In the illustrated embodiment, context field  includes a date last used field , and one or more fields indicating the distribution of former uses of the group in different time periods, applications, geolocations, and keywords and topics associated with text associated with a user during the former use of the group. These parameters represent the different components of relevance. A user of the UE  is inherently component of relevance with all these groups as well as the current context. Thus, context field  is an example means for defining context that comprises a set of values for a corresponding set of parameters including at least one of a user identifier for the user, a time period, an application executed on the device operated by the user, a network service communicating with the device operated by the user, a geolocation of the device, a keyword from a sample of text, a topic for the sample of text, or items in a group. In other embodiments more or fewer fields are included. An advantage of context field  is to allow a multi-dimensional assessment of relevance. This make it more likely that a relevant item or group is presented sooner in the process, thus saving display operations, and any supporting display, memory and processor resources on the device.","Time period field  holds data that indicates time period context, e.g. a time of day such as \u201cmorning\u201d \u201cafternoon,\u201d or \u201cevening\u201d on a \u201cworkday,\u201d a \u201cweekend\u201d or \u201choliday\u201d when the group was used in the past. In some embodiments, the time period also indicates a date range, such as 2009 or January 2009, so that older uses of the prior group can be given less weight, ignored or deleted. The count field  holds data that indicates how many times the group was used in the time period identified in field . In some embodiments, in which the time period field  does not include a date range, dates field  is included. Dates field  holds data that indicates the dates associated with the former uses, one date for each count indicated in the count field . Data in the dates field  is used to eliminate counts associated with uses considered too old for an application. Other sets of time period, count and dates fields are indicated by the ellipsis below time period field .","Application field  holds data that indicates an application in which the group was used, such as application  or another application, such as a different email, instant messaging or social network client process or the service, such as service , with which a client process is communicating. For example, the last few times the user included contacts \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cBob\u201d in the same destination, it was in an instant messaging process, and the application field  indicates the instant messaging process. The count field  holds data that indicates how many times the group was used for the application identified in field . In some embodiments, dates field  is included for holding data that indicates the dates associated with the former uses in the application indicated in field , one date for each count indicated in the count field the ellipsis below application field .","Geolocation field  holds data that indicates a geographic location where the UE (e.g., UE ) was located when the group was used. Any method may be used to indicate the geolocation, such as latitude and longitude coordinates, a postal address, a communications network address (e.g., a uniform resource locator, URL, name), a name of a point of interest, or a reference to a database of points of interest where more information about the geolocation is stored. For example, the last few times the user included contacts \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cBob\u201d in the same destination, it was while the user was at a particular coffee house, and the application field  indicates the street address of the particular coffee house. The count field  holds data that indicates how many times the group was used at the location identified in field . In some embodiments, dates field  is included for holding data that indicates the dates associated with the former uses at the geolocation indicated in field , one date for each count indicated in the count field . Other sets of geolocation, count and dates fields for different geolocations are indicated by the ellipsis below geolocation field .","Topic field  holds data that indicates a topic in text associated with the group. A topic is deduced from text using any method known in the art, such as a semantics engine of the APACHE LUCENE open source search engine from The Apache Software Foundation incorporated in Delaware. A topic is often deduced from the most frequently used keywords in a sample of text, where keyword are unusual words that distinguish samples of text from each other. Any method may be used to associate text with the group, such as text in a subject line or body of an email or other message sent to the group, text in an email or other message most recently received before the group was used in an application, or in a document open at the time the group was used in an application different from a process operating on the document. For example, the last few times the user included contacts \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cBob\u201d in the same destination, it was associated with message having a topic of \u201cbirthday.\u201d The count field  holds data that indicates how many times the group was used in association with text having a topic identified in field . In some embodiments, dates field  is included for holding data that indicates the dates associated with the former uses in association with the topic indicated in field , one date for each count indicated in the count field . Other sets of topic, count and dates fields for different topics are indicated by the ellipsis below topic field .","Keyword field  holds data that indicates a keyword from text associated with the group, wherein the keyword was not deemed to indicate a topic of the text. As described above, any method may be used to associate text with the group. The count field  holds data that indicates how many times the group was used in association with text having a keyword identified in field . In some embodiments, dates field  is included for holding data that indicates the dates associated with the former uses in association with the keyword indicated in field , one date for each count indicated in the count field . Other sets of keyword, count and dates fields for different keywords are indicated by the ellipsis below keyword field .","An advantage of including counts and dates is to assess comparative relevance of several groups. For example, it is assumed for purposes of illustration that one prior group of contacts included only Alice and Bob but that group has only been encountered three times in the past year, the most recent ten months earlier. It is further assumed for purposes of illustration that, in contrast, another group that includes Alice and Bob and Charles has been encountered 20 times in the last year with ten of those in the most recent month. Clearly the latter group is more relevant than the former group for the current context. Thus count fields , , ,  and , and dates fields , , ,  and  are example means to achieve the advantage of improved assessment of comparative relevance. This make it more likely that a relevant item or group is presented sooner in the process, thus saving display operations, and any supporting display, memory and processor resources on the device.","In some embodiments, an expiration age is determined for each parameter, e.g., each component of relevance. The expiration age is stored with data that defines the parameters, such as in the source instructions or an associated data structure. In some embodiments, the expiration age is a constant, e.g., one year. In some embodiments, a count beyond the expiration age is considered irrelevant. In some embodiments, the relevance also has a \u201cdecay\u201d factor that reduces the relevance ranking over time so that the influence of an item on relevance is gradually reduced over time until the influence becomes negligible. This relationship is expressed by Equation 1.\n\nrelevance=(1)*\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere t=time period since creation of object or since it was last \u201ctouched\u201d and v=factor value for service (i.e. email messages to me have a higher factor value than email messages where I'm on the carbon copy line).\n","To determine the age of a count, the birth date of each count, e.g., the date the count was entered, is kept in the dates fields , , , , . Counts beyond the expiration age are removed from the count in the count field, and the corresponding data is removed from the dates field. An advantage of this approach is to avoid having determinations of relevance be controlled by very old occurrences. The dates fields and expiration ages are example means for achieving this advantage. This make it more likely that a relevant item or group is presented sooner in the process, thus saving display operations, and any supporting display, memory and processor resources on the device.","While context is associated with a group of items in prior group data structure , context is also associated with individual items in items data structure , in some embodiments.  is a diagram of a data structure  for recording context of items in a list of items, according to one embodiment. Data structure  is an embodiment of items data structure . The items data structure  includes a list identifier (ID) field , a number of items field , and, for each item, an item identifier (ID) field , an item description field , and an item context field . Other sets of item ID, item description and item context fields for different items are indicated by the ellipsis below context field . In some embodiments, non-permanent items are added based on user input with a code or null value in the description field  to indicate a non-permanent item. In some embodiments, item description field includes item avatar field  which holds data that indicates an image for the item that can be used as an avatar for the item or for a group that includes the item.","Item context field  holds data that indicates the context or contexts associated with one or more former uses of the item. The context information recorded here indicates the context at the UE  at each non-expired time that the item was used. It is the context associated with such former use that is compared to the current context at the UE  to determine the relevance of the item to the current use of the application  by the user. Any context information that is considered useful for this purpose is included.","In the illustrated embodiment, similar fields are included in item context field  as in group context field . In this embodiment, the item context field  is an embodiment of the group context field  for a group of one item. In the illustrated embodiment, item context field  includes one or more fields indicating the distribution of uses in different time periods, applications, geolocations, and keywords and topics associated with text for a user during the former use of the item. One or more time periods for prior use of the item are indicated by one or more sets of time period field , count field  and dates field  and ellipsis. The contents of these fields are parallel to the contents described above for fields ,  and , respectively, but appropriate instead for the item and not the group. Context field  is an example means for defining context that comprises a set of values for a corresponding set of parameters including at least one of a user identifier for the user, a time period, an application executed on the device operated by the user, a network service communicating with the device operated by the user, a geolocation of the device, a keyword from a sample of text, a topic for the sample of text.","Similarly, one or more applications of prior use of the item are indicated by one or more sets of application field , count field  and dates field  and ellipsis. Similarly, one or more geolocations of prior use of the item are indicated by one or more sets of geolocation field , count field  and dates field  and ellipsis. Similarly, one or more topics of text associated with prior use of the item are indicated by one or more sets of topic field , count field  and dates field  and ellipsis. Similarly, one or more keywords of text associated with prior use of the item are indicated by one or more sets of keyword field , count field  and dates field  and ellipsis. The contents of these fields are parallel to the contents described above for corresponding fields in context field , but appropriate instead for the item and not the group.","Although fields in  and  are shown as integral portions of particular data structures for purposes of illustration, in other embodiments, one or more of these fields, or portions thereof, are omitted or arranged in a different way on the same or different data structures on UE  or one or more other nodes of the network , including nodes of one or more services  or other user equipment , or one or more additional fields are added.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 7","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C"],"b":["400","140","400","100"]},"In step  the current content is determined, including updating any fields in the data structures  that hold the current context data. The current context information includes, user information, manufacturer and model of UE , operating system on UE , date, time period, geolocation, other sensor data (e.g., from accelerometers, altimeters, gyroscopes, light sensors, microphones, cameras), current visual elements on a display, open applications, network conditions (e.g., connected, bandwidth, noise), current content being rendered, recent text received, recent text typed by the user, keywords of the recent text, topics of the recent text, contacts currently in communication, or contacts recently in communication, alone or in any combination. Any method known in the art may be used to determine the current context, including keystroke tracking, data bus monitoring, operating system interrupt processing, or polling modules installed on the device, alone or in some combination. Thus current context at a device operated by a user is determined.","In some embodiments, step  includes updating the context fields of one or more items or one or more groups. For example, expired counts beyond the expiration age, and corresponding dates, in context field  or item context field  are removed. Context updates are described in more detail below as process  depicted in .","In step , a prompt presented to the user to enter a list of items is detected. In some embodiments, the application  issued the prompt and initiates operation of the dynamic grouping module . In some embodiments, the dynamic grouping module tracks forms presented to the user, e.g., in a web page, for receiving input, and determines when the user has selected, using a pointing device such as a mouse or touchscreen, a field in the form for receiving input that indicates a group of items. This field, usually in a graphical user interface (GUI) is called the group input area. The type of the group of items to list is also determined, e.g., whether a contact, a purchase item or a timed event, using any method known in the art. For example, the field to track a type of item is indicated in source code or provided by a separate process or provided by the application  itself to the dynamic grouping module  using an API for the module . This is an example means for determining that the user is prompted for input to indicate an item. An advantage of this approach is it allows the dynamic grouping of items to be made available to extant applications that use standard forms for receiving user input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5E","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 5A"],"b":["501","101","501","510","512","518","510","512","114","518","114","518","518","522","524","526"]},"The group input area is where a user is to input data indicating multiple items for a group, e.g., a group of groceries to order online, or a group of contacts to whom a message is to be sent. For example, in some embodiments, the group input area  is one or more fields of a hypertext markup language (HTML) forms page sent in one or more HTTP messages to application  from a service  on the network  or from another process on UE . The user inserts items into the group input area  by operating a pointing device to indicate the area, e.g., by moving a mouse over the area or touching the area on a touch screen. When the user indicates the input area , the dynamic grouping module  is invoked to control the use of groups. GUI  and group input area  is an example means for the user being prompted to indicate an item.","The use button is activated by user, again by operating a pointing device, to use the group of items indicated in group input area  as input to the application , e.g., as input to a grocery shopping application or an email application.","The save group button is activated by a user, again by operating a pointing device, to save the group of items indicated in group input area  as a permanent, named group.","In some embodiments, the dynamic grouping module  controls the presentation of the use button  and save group button , when one or more items are indicated in group input area . In some embodiments, the use button  and save group button  are presented by the application  to independently invoke separate modules that perform the functions associated with these buttons.","In step , it is determined whether there is past context data stored for items of the type to be input. If so, then in step , the relevance of the items of that type are determined based on the current context and the past context. In some embodiments, step  includes determining keyword and topics of recent text included in the current context, e.g. using semantics engine . In some embodiments, step  includes updating the context fields of one or more items in items data structure  (e.g. items data structure ). For example, expired counts, and corresponding dates, in item context field  are removed before determining the relevance of the item in light of the current context.","The relevance can be expressed in any method known in the art. For example, in some embodiments, a relevance metric is determined based on a weighted sum of the number of matches between one or more data fields representing the current context and corresponding fields in item context field . One or more of the corresponding fields that do not hold past context information for a particular item do not contribute to the weighted sum for that item. In some embodiments, more recently used items are given more weight. In some embodiments a more sophisticated relevance engine (e.g., relevance engine ) is used. For example, one or more data fields representing the current context are sent to the relevance engine  along with corresponding fields from the item context field , and the relevance engine  returns a relevance metric, such as a percent likelihood that the item would be considered relevant. This is a means for determining a suggested item of the plurality of items based on the current context at the device and relevance of a context associated with the suggested item.","In step  some of the most relevant items, if any, are caused to be presented on a display of the user equipment (e.g., UE ).

Similarly more weight is given to groups that include all the names that a user has entered (by typing or selecting previously presented items or groups). Thus if the user has typed both Bob and Alice as contacts, then more weight is given to groups of contacts that include both Alice and Bob over groups that include only one. This is an example means for determining a suggested group of the plurality of groups based on the current context at the device and relevance of a context associated with the suggested group,","In step , some of the most relevant groups, if any, are caused to be presented on a display of the user equipment (e.g., UE ).

Thus, in response to receiving a name for the suggested group, data indicating the suggested group is stored as a permanent group associated with the name received. The prompt for a name for a group is a means to achieve the advantage of easily defining new permanent groups on the fly as they are generated manually by a user or worth one or more automatically generated suggestions. This make it more likely that important group is saved without requiring additional input to define it again later, after several manual entries.

For example, an email is sent to all contacts in the non-permanent group. An advantage of this approach is not requiring the user to name a group that the user does not expect to employ again. This saves permanent storage resources. The separate use button and save group button is a means to achieve this advantage, because the user can use a dynamically generated group without saving it as a permanent group by pressing the use button and skipping the save group button.","If it is determined, in step , that a name is input by the user for the group, then, in step  the group is saved as a permanent group with a name.","In step  a group avatar is formed.

In some embodiments, a dynamic group avatar is generated based on the M most relevant items in the group, as described in more detail below with reference to . In some embodiments, the dynamic group avatar is generated based on the M most recently active items in the group, as determined by the item activity field  of the prior group entry .

Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) (not shown), one or more controllers (not shown), or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus . The memory  includes both dynamic memory (e.g., RAM, magnetic disk, writable optical disk, etc.) and static memory (e.g., ROM, CD-ROM, etc.) for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to provide dynamic grouping of items. The memory  also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":"800"},"Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit (MCU) , a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) , and a receiver\/transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing dynamic grouping of items. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to providing dynamic grouping of items. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
