{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The disclosure relates to wireless communications, and particularly to a wireless communication device requiring no external amplification.","2. Description of Related Art","Manufacturers often integrate radio and music playing functions into wireless communication devices to satisfy customers' needs. Such devices generally require the inclusion of an audio amplifier to produce audio of a suitable volume. For example, as shown in , a wireless communication device  includes a frequency modulation (FM) integrated circuit (IC) , a main processor , an external audio amplifier  and an earphone .","The FM IC  receives radio frequency signals from the earphone , and outputs demodulated signals to the external audio amplifier . The main processor  processes audio signals from a microphone , and outputs the processed audio signals to the external audio amplifier . The external audio amplifier  amplifies the demodulated signals from the FM IC  or the processed audio signals from the main processor , and outputs the amplified signals to the earphone . The earphone  plays the amplified signals from the external audio amplifier .","However, in order for the external audio amplifier  to amplify audio signals, a physical circuit often needs to occupy requisite space in the wireless communication device . Thus, the wireless communication device  presents increased size and cost.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2","2","20","21","22","23","24","2","2","23","20","2","20"]},"In one embodiment, the earphone  acts as an internal antenna to receive radio frequency (RF) signals from the air when electrically connected to the wireless communication device , when the wireless communication device  is in the radio mode. The FM IC , connected to the earphone , receives and demodulates the RF signals from the earphone  and outputs the demodulated signals. The microphone  receives communication voice signals and outputs the communication voice signals when the wireless communication device  is in the communication mode.","The analog switch  is structured and arranged to receive the demodulated signals from the FM IC  or the communication voice signals from the microphone  and output the demodulated signals or the communication voice signals to the main processor  according to a working mode of the wireless communication device . When the wireless communication device  is in the radio mode, the analog switch  outputs the demodulated signals, and outputs communication voice signals in the communication mode.","The main processor , connected to the FM IC  and the analog switch , includes a software amplifier  that is operable to amplify the demodulated signals or the communication voice signals from the analog switch  and output the amplified demodulated signals or the amplified communication voice signals to the earphone . The main processor  turns the FM IC  on or off via a control interface (not shown). For example, if the wireless communication device  is a mobile phone, when the main processor  detects an incoming call, the wireless communication device  enters the communication mode, and the main processor  prompts a user to turn off the FM IC  via the control interface. At this time, the analog switch  only receives and outputs the communication voice signals from the microphone . When the call ends and the wireless communication device  enters the radio mode, the user can turn on the FM IC  via the control interface, and the analog switch  only receives and outputs the demodulated signals from the FM IC  providing radio play.","In one embodiment, the earphone  further receives and transmits the amplified demodulated signals or the amplified communication voice signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["21","210","211","212","213","214","28","211","212","28","21","211","22","2","214","211","211","210","213","2","214","211","210","213"]},"The encoder\/decoder module  is operable to receive the amplified communication voice signals from the de-multiplexer module , and encode and transmit the amplified communication voice signals, receive external audio signals by a built-in antenna of the wireless communication device  (not shown and different from the earphone ), and decode the external audio signals. In one embodiment, the external audio signals are incoming communication voice signals from another communication device. The multiplexer module  is operable to receive the amplified demodulated signals from the de-multiplexer module  or the decoded external audio signals from the encoder\/decoder module  and output the received signals to the audio receiving module . The audio receiving module  is operable to process and amplify the amplified demodulated signals or the decoded external audio signals from the multiplexer module  and output the amplified signals to the earphone .","In one embodiment, the main processor  includes a testing loop for determining if the wireless communication device  are functioning normally during testing of the wireless communication device , which is not used during normal use of the wireless communication device . The testing loop includes the audio transmission module , the de-multiplexer module , the multiplexer module , and the audio receiving module . In the testing loop, communication voice signals from users are transmitted to the earphone  through the audio transmission module , the de-multiplexer module , the multiplexer module , and the audio receiving module , without being transmitted to the encoder\/decoder module , creating audio loopback. In one embodiment, the audio loopback is used when the wireless communication device  is in the radio mode.","In one embodiment, the audio transmission module  and the audio receiving module  are integrated with the software amplifier  to amplify the demodulated signals to control volume by the audio loopback of the wireless communication device . Because the main processor  has been preset with different audio processing functions by suppliers, which are provided to users by parameter tables or software application programming interface, the audio transmission module  and the audio receiving module  integrated with the software amplifier  can be achieved by editing the parameter tables or the software application programming interface.","The wireless communication device  assumes only one working mode, either the communication mode or the radio mode, at a time. That is, the wireless communication device  provides only one kind of audio signal, either the demodulated signals or the communication voice signals, at a time. Thus, the de-multiplexer module and the multiplexer module  also output only the demodulated signals or the communication voice signals at a time.","For example, when the wireless communication device  is in the radio mode, the FM IC  is turned on via the control interface. The earphone  receives RF signals from the air, and the FM IC  demodulates the RF signals, and outputs demodulated signals to the analog switch . At this time, the analog switch  receives only the demodulated signals, and outputs the demodulated signals to the main processor . The main processor  functions in the audio loopback. That is, the audio transmission module  processes and amplifies the demodulated signals, and outputs the amplified demodulated signals to the de-multiplexer module . Then, the amplified demodulated signals are transmitted to the audio receiving module  for further processing and amplification via the de-multiplexer module  and the multiplexer module . Finally, the audio receiving module  transmits the demodulated signals amplified twice to the earphone . Thus, radio play is enabled.","When the wireless communication device  is in the communication mode, the FM IC  is turned off, and the audio loopback is not used. When wireless communication device  receives voice input, the microphone  transmits the communication voice signals to the analog switch . The analog switch  transmits the communication voice signals to the audio transmission module  for processing and amplification, and then to the de-multiplexer module . The de-multiplexer module  transmits the processed communication voice signals to the encoder\/decoder module  for encoding, and the encoder\/decoder module  sends out the encoded communication voice signals via the built-in antenna of the wireless communication device  for transmission to other devices. The encoder\/decoder module  also receives external audio signals, that is, incoming communication voice signals, by the built-in antenna of the wireless communication device , decodes the external audio signals, and transmits the decoded external audio signals to the multiplexer module  for transmission to the audio receiving module . The audio receiving module  processes and amplifies the decoded external audio signals, and transmits the processed external audio signals to the earphone  to play. Thus, communication with other devices is enabled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["211","212","211","2110","2111","2112","2113","211","2110","22","2111","2112","2113"]},"The audio receiving module  includes a de-multiplexer , a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) , a software amplifier , and a receiving signal processor , controlled by software. The receiving signal processor  is operable to receive the decoded external audio signals or the amplified demodulated signals and filter noise therefrom. The software amplifier  is operable to amplify the filtered signals by software. The DAC  is operable to convert the amplified and filtered signals to analog audio signals. The de-multiplexer  is operable to output the analog audio signals to one of a plurality of transmission devices, such as the earphone .","The wireless communication device  amplifies audio signals by the software amplifier  of the main processor , and uses the audio loopback to provide radio play.
