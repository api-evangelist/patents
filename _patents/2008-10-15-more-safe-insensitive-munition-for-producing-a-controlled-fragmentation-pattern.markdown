title: More safe insensitive munition for producing a controlled fragmentation pattern
abstract: A warhead includes a body, a patterned liner made of plastic, and an explosive charge disposed within the liner. The liner pattern is formed of gaps and liner elements. The explosive charge includes a first set of sections that are disposed adjacent to the liner gaps and a second set of sections that are disposed adjacent to the liner elements. Upon detonation of the explosive charge and because of the temporal delay in transmitting the detonation energy between these two sets of sections, the warhead body is caused to shear and break into fragments with controlled size. The use of plastic as the liner material also provides a welcome safety feature for this warhead. In the event of unwanted heat ignition, the plastic (which is also low melt temperature material), would melt to seal the explosive and would also flow. Because of the plastic, neither sudden pressure nor heat/ignition inside the round, would therefore be as catastrophic.

More specifically, the present invention pertains to the controlled fragmentation of the munition casing or warhead body.","Warhead fragmentation effectiveness is determined by the number, mass, shape, and velocity of the fragments. By using a controlled fragmentation design, warhead fragmentation could generally be achieved quickly and cost effectively. Exemplary controlled fragmentation techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,491,694, 4,312,274, 4,745,864, 5,131,329, and 5,337,673.","In general, conventional designs use \u201ccutter\u201d liners that form fragments by generating a complex pattern of high-velocity \u201cpenetrators\u201d for fragmenting the shell. Although these conventional fragmentation designs have proven to be useful, it would be desirable to present additional functional, cost and safety improvements that minimize the warhead weight, reduce manufacture expenses, and advance current United States Insensitive Munition (IM) requirements.","What is therefore needed is a controlled fragmentation technique through the use of a patterned liner which introduces shear stress into the warhead body and creates the desired fragmentation pattern. Fragment size, fragment numbers, and patterns thereof may be influenced through a novel liner configuration. The need for such a controlled fragmentation technique has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies these needs, and presents a munition or warhead such as a projectile, and an associated method for generating a controlled fragmentation pattern (herein referred to as \u201cthe invention\u201d or \u201cthe present invention\u201d).","According to the present invention, warhead fragmentation is achieved more efficiently and more cost effectively than conventional techniques, through the use of a relatively inexpensive formed plastic liner (or liners) with a predetermined pattern of cutouts. According to the present invention, the \u201cshear\u201d and \u201cstamp\u201d liner cutouts generate contours of localized transitional regions with high-gradients of pressures, velocities, strains, and strain-rates acting as stress and strain concentration factors. Unstable thermoplastic shear (adiabatic shear) eventually transfers the entire burden of localized strain to a finite number of shear planes leading to the shell break-up and formation of fragments.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the warhead includes a liner that is disposed inside the warhead body. The liner includes a predetermined pattern that is created with gaps filled with the warhead's explosive, such allowing the detonation shock wave to directly propagate into the fragmenting case without passing through the liner. As a result, the explosion produces a complex pattern of shear planes in the warhead body, causing the case break-up and formation of fragments with predetermined sizes. This design is distinguishable from existing fragmentation liner technologies that attempt to score or cut the warhead body.","One of the advantages of the present embodiment compared to existing technologies is the cost effectiveness of the manufacturing process of the present design, in that it is faster and more economical to fabricate and to pattern a plastic liner, as opposed to notching or cutting the steel warhead body itself. An advantage of the present invention is that the use of plastic material reduces the overall weight of the warhead compared with use of other materials, as do the gaps which reduce the weight of the liner. But, more important, the use of plastic is a great safety feature. An unwanted ignition of the explosive due to the heat of launch would normally be catastrophic as well as fratricidal. But the plastic of this invention covers the explosive inside the casing body. In the event of unwanted heat\/ignition, the plastic (which is also low melt temperature material), would melt to seal the explosive and would also flow. The melted plastic would push out overflows that are usually provided in these rounds. Because of the plastic, neither sudden pressure nor heat\/ignition inside the round, would therefore be as catastrophic. Therefore, choice of low-melt temperature plastic as the liner material in this invention, adds safety to the round. This benefit is favorable, consistent with current Insensitive Munition (IM) requirements in minimizing accidental ammunition explosion due to fire hazards.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the warhead includes a stepped liner that is disposed inside the warhead body. While, as explained earlier, the liner in the previous embodiment includes a pattern that is created with gaps that allows the explosive to expand therein during detonation, the liner of this alternative embodiment, includes a step liner that includes either a uniform or an alternating pattern of raised material on a matrix. This alternative embodiment includes a thin layer of material that replaces the gaps of the previous embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 8"],"b":["100","100","101","103","102","100","102","101","104","101","102","101"]},"The explosive charge  comprises, for example, LX-14, OCTOL, hand packed C-4, or any other solid explosive, that can be machined, cast, or hand-packed to fit snugly within the inside of liner .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIGS. 7A-7G","FIG. 8"],"b":["100","200","101","104","200","101"]},"As further illustrated in more detail in , the pattern  of the liner  could be formed by any known or conventional method, such as by stamping, or by stereo lithography. The liner  could be made of any suitable low-melt temperature material such as HDPE (High Density Poly Ethylene), or Accura SI 40 stereo lithographic material mimicking Nylon 6:6. The pattern  includes openings, gaps, or cutouts  (collectively referred to herein as gaps ) that are interposed among a plurality of patterned liner elements . The pattern will be described in greater detail in connection with .","With further reference to , upon detonation of the explosive charge  of the warhead , in the areas of liner cutouts , the momentum of the shock wave propagating through the explosive  is transmitted directly to the sections  of the interior of the warhead body , as illustrated by force F (). In the case of the sections , which are disposed adjacent to the liner elements , the detonation wave momentum is transmitted first to the liner elements  and then to the interior of the warhead body , as illustrated by force F ().","The time delay between the moments when the shock waves reach sections  and  is determined by the differences between the detonation velocity of the explosive  and the shock wave propagation speed of the liner material , respectively. Since the motion of the section  should typically start earlier than that of the section , the transitional region between section  and  is subjected to intense \u201cstretching\u201d by the force differential F\u2212F, F>F. This generates a high gradient of pressures, velocities, and strains between sections  and , acting as stress and strain \u201cconcentration factors\u201d.","As shown in , unstable thermoplastic shear (adiabatic shear) eventually transfers the entire burden of localized strain to a finite number of shear planes leading to the shell break-up and formation of fragments. As a result, a predetermined pattern of liner cutouts  \u201cstamps out\u201d a pattern of localized transitional regions -, so as to cause the warhead body  to shear and break into fragments with controlled size.","For given choices of materials of explosive  and liner , the thickness of the liner  helps determine the time delay between forces F and F, and, subsequently, the magnitude of the required gradients of stresses, strains, and strain-rates in transitional regions -. In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the liner  varies between approximately a fraction of a millimeter and several millimeters, in order to cause a time delay that varies between approximately a hundred of nanoseconds and two microseconds.","The selectively controlled pattern  comprises sections of equal size or, alternatively, sections ranging in size from a relatively large size to smaller sections. The larger size of the intact (non-gap) sections is selected for more heavily armored targets, while the smaller size of intact (non-gap) sections is applicable for lightly armored or soft targets. Consequently, the pattern  efficiently enables variable and selective lethality of the warhead  that can range from maximum lethality for more heavily armored targets to a maximum lethality for lightly armored or soft targets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","104","104","700","101","104","101","104","700","102","600","604","704","102","600","604","600","604","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","104","104","700","101","700","104","102"]},"In this embodiment, the gaps  extend throughout the depth of the liner .
