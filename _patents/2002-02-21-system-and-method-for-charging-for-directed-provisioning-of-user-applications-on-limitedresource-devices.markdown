title: System and method for charging for directed provisioning of user applications on limited-resource devices
abstract: A system and a method for charging for directed provisioning and using of dynamic content to limited resource devices, through an integrated platform which handles all aspects of aggregation and management of such dynamic content. The integrated platform features a billing system for performing billing actions. The billing system of the present invention interacts with other components of the integrated platform in order to be able to determine the charge for particular triggering events, such as downloading dynamic content, and/or events which are actually triggered by the application itself. The charge is preferably determined according to one of a plurality of rules, as applied by a rules engine of the billing system. These rules are part of a charging policy, which may optionally be determined by the content provider.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a 371 of International Application No. PCT\/IL02\/00139, filed Feb. 21, 2002, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/270,638, filed Feb. 23, 2001, and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/280,849, filed Apr. 3, 2001, and is a CIP of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/987,514, filed Nov. 15, 2001, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/270,638, filed Feb. 23, 2001.","The present invention relates to a system and a method for charging for directed provisioning and usage of user applications on limited-resource devices, and in particular, to such a system and method in which billing for such applications is flexibly performed according to a plurality of rules. Examples of suitable devices include, but are not limited to, cellular telephones and handheld computers. These devices are \u201climited-resource devices\u201d in that computational resources such as memory, storage space and\/or data processing capabilities are limited, particularly in comparison to other computational devices such as PCs (personal computers), for example.","Cellular telephones have recently become increasingly popular for mobile voice communication, as well as for the exchange of text messages and other types of data. For voice communication, cellular telephone systems provide similar services as the fixed, wire-based telephony system, or PSTN (public switched telephony network), except that cellular telephone systems are based upon signal transmission through radio frequency signals rather than wires. Hence, cellular telephones are also termed \u201cwireless telephones\u201d, and communication over such telephones is termed \u201cwireless communication\u201d.","One advantage of cellular telephones is that they permit mobile communication, such that subscribers are able to communicate while traveling, or otherwise when they are not at a fixed physical location. In addition, cellular telephones permit subscribers to be contacted regardless of the location of the subscribers. These advantages of mobile communication are also useful for the exchange of data, such as for text messages and even Web pages, for example. Cellular telephones are able to receive text messages through message exchange protocols such as SMS (short message service), for example, which permit one-to-one communication between cellular telephones through text messages. In addition, protocols such as the WAP (wireless application protocol) protocol enable cellular telephones, which are suitably enabled to receive Web pages and receive email. Thus, cellular telephones potentially provide a full communication solution for all of the different types of electronic communication for a subscriber.","However, cellular telephones have a number of disadvantages over other types of computational devices which are used to exchange data, such as desktop computers, for example. Cellular telephones have limited resources, and as such can be considered to be limited resource devices. They are limited by at least one of available memory, storage space, size of the display screen, and\/or computational power, as represented by the ability to perform various data processing tasks. These limitations are imposed by the requirements of portability, convenient and simple operation, battery lifetime, weight and size. In addition, the type of limitations and the hardware specifications of each cellular telephone, or other related handheld device, also differ between, cellular telephone service providers and even manufacturers. Thus, designing a single type of application which is suitable for all cellular telephones, for example, is clearly very difficult.","In addition, the heterogeneity of this computational environment extends to the types of communication protocols according to which these different cellular telephones communicate for data transmission. As described above, two of these protocols include SMS, for character-based messages only, and WAP, for more rich data transmissions which may also include graphics. Other protocols include \u201cI-mode\u201d, the packet-based cellular telephone data transmission protocol of the Japanese company, NTT DoCoMo (Japan).","Unlike the static content which is delivered through WAP or I-mode, the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) API provides a platform for the development and implementation of dynamic content on limited-resource mobile devices. J2ME is a special version of the popular Java programming language (originally developed by Sun Microsystems), which was adapted to the limitations of consumer and embedded devices with limited resources. It is being defined as an industry standard by companies which manufacture limited resource devices, such as Motorola, Nokia and Palm. A similar but non-compatible Java API has been developed by NTT DoCoMo (Japan) for use on its own wireless network.","Another emerging standard is the Mobile Station Application Execution Environment (MExE), which is defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). MExE provides a standardized execution environment in a mobile station, as well as the ability of the mobile station to negotiate supported capabilities with a MExE service provider, thereby allowing applications to be developed across different platforms. Thus, the capabilities of different cellular telephones and other limited resource devices can be accommodated by a particular application.","This last attempted solution, MExE, is the closest attempt to the provision of an integrated platform for delivering applications to a wide variety of cellular telephones and other limited resource devices. However, MExE still suffers from the drawbacks of lacking a specification or support for a server architecture or specific management functions, both of which are required in order to actually deliver the applications to different limited resource devices. Furthermore, all of the above solutions focus on either a method for creating a user application for operation by a limited resource device, such as the modified version of Java; or a method for delivering and displaying content on the limited resource device, such as WAP. They do not provide an integrated solution for creating the user application; adapting the application according to the different requirements of different limited resource devices; and delivering the application to the device through a client-server system which is compatible with such devices, particularly for wireless communication. In addition, these systems do not provide a solution to the problem of charging the subscriber for receiving and using such content through the limited resource device.","Therefore, there is an unmet need for, and it would be highly useful to have, a system and a method for charging users of limited resource devices for receiving and using user applications at the limited resource devices, which would also enable such billing to be performed according to a plurality of rules through a rules engine.","The present invention is of a system and a method for charging for directed provisioning and usage of dynamic content on limited resource wireless communication devices, through an integrated platform which handles all aspects of aggregation and management of such dynamic content. The integrated platform features a charging mechanism for performing billing actions. The charging mechanism of the present invention interacts with other components of the integrated platform in order to be able to determine the charge for particular triggering events, such as downloading a unit of dynamic content, and\/or events which are actually triggered by the dynamic content itself. The charge is preferably determined according to one of a plurality of rules, as applied by a rules engine of the billing system. These rules are part of a charging policy, which is typically determined by the service provider and parameterized by the content provider. In addition, content providers can submit their own dynamic content-specific charging policies. Hereinafter, the term \u201climited-resource device\u201d refers to a computational device in which computational resources such as memory, storage space, network bandwidth and\/or data processing capabilities are limited, particularly in comparison to desktop computers such as PCs (personal computers), for example.","According to the present invention, there is provided a method for charging for provisioning and usage of a dynamic content on a limited resource device through an integrated platform, the steps of the method comprising: (a) sending an event regarding the dynamic content to the integrated platform; (b) analyzing the request to determine an amount to be charged by the integrated platform; and (c) charging the user the amount for consuming the dynamic content.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a system for charging for consuming a unit of dynamic content, the system comprising: (a) a limited resource device for receiving the dynamic content; and (b) a billing system for determining an amount to be charged for the dynamic content, wherein the billing system comprises a rules engine for selecting at least one rule for determining the condition and the amount to be charged.","According a still further embodiment of the present invention the charging policy as determined may be stored in an appropriate electronic format on the integrated platform to be easily accessible as required. Optionally and preferably there is provided a policy editor module which may be used by the service provider and\/or the content provider to create and alter charging policies according to requirements.","Hereinafter, the term \u201cnetwork\u201d refers to a connection between any two or more computational devices which permits the transmission of data.","Hereinafter, the term \u201ccomputational device\u201d includes, but is not limited to, personal computers (PC) having an operating system such as DOS, Windows\u2122, OS\/2\u2122 or Linux; Macintosh\u2122 computers; graphical workstations such as the computers of Sun Microsystems\u2122 and Silicon Graphics\u2122, and other computers having some version of the UNIX operating system such as AIX\u2122 or SOLARIS\u2122 of Sun Microsystems\u2122; or any other known and available operating system, or any device, including but not limited to: laptops, hand-held computers (based on operating systems such as EPOC and Windows CE), PDA (personal digital assistant) devices (e.g. Palm Pilot), cellular telephones, two-way pagers, any type of WAP (wireless application protocol) enabled device, wearable computers of any sort, and any device which can be connected to a network as previously defined and which has an operating system. Hereinafter, the term \u201cWindows\u2122\u201d includes any version of this operating system by Microsoft Corp. (USA).","Hereinafter, the term \u201ccellular communication device\u201d refers to any type of wireless handset or device, including but not limited to cellular telephones or other types of computational device as defined above, which is capable of voice and\/or data transfer through a radio frequency signal, optionally through a connection to the PSTN (public switched telephone network).","For the present invention, a software application could be written in substantially any suitable programming language, which could easily be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. The programming language chosen should be compatible with the computational device according to which the software application is executed. Examples of suitable programming languages include, but are not limited to, C, C++ and Java.","In addition, the present invention could be implemented as software, firmware or hardware, or as a combination thereof. For any of these implementations, the functions performed by the method could be described as a plurality of instructions performed by a data processor.","The present invention is of a system and a method for charging for directed provisioning and usage of dynamic content, such as user applications for example, to limited resource devices, through an integrated platform which handles all aspects of aggregation and management of such dynamic content. The integrated platform features a charging mechanism for performing billing actions. The charging mechanism of the present invention interacts with other components of the integrated platform in order to be able to determine the charge for particular triggering events, such as downloading a unit of dynamic content, and\/or events which are actually triggered by the dynamic content itself. The charge is preferably determined according to one of a plurality of rules, as applied by a rules engine of the billing system. These rules are part of a charging policy, which is optionally and preferably determined by the service provider, and parameterized (setting one or more parameters) by the content provider. In addition, content providers can submit their own dynamic content-specific charging policies.","Optionally and preferably the overall charging policy is embodied in the form of a \u201cdynamic content level billing model\u201d. A dynamic content-level billing model provides the means for implementing different business models for different applications. That is, each unit of dynamic content may have its own billing model, as specified by its provider. This flexibility is achieved by collecting information about the activities of the system and applications and applying dynamic billing models. A billing model is preferably defined as a plurality of rules, the application of which is optionally and preferably triggered by runtime events.","As used herein, the term \u201cdynamic content\u201d refers to a unit of content and\/or to a set of instructions for execution by the limited resource (user) device, possibly interacting with a server side application across the network. The content may optionally include any type of media, including but not limited to, any one of audio data, video data, graphic images and text, any type of application which includes any type of media (such as any one or more of audio data, video data, graphic images and text) or a combination thereof. Preferably, the dynamic content includes such a set of instructions for execution by the device, which optionally and more preferably are written in a interpreted language such as Java, for example. However, the dynamic content optionally and most preferably also features one or more components of a user interface, for example in order to select a particular set of instructions and\/or type of content.","The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.","Referring now to the drawings,  is a schematic block diagram of a system according to the present invention for dynamic content creation for, and delivery to, limited resource devices, including a mechanism for billing the user for consuming the content at the limited resource device. The present invention is described with regard to cellular communication devices as the limited resource devices, it being understood that this is for the purposes of illustration only and is not intended to be limiting in any way.","As shown, a system  features a cellular communication device , operated by a user (not shown), who subscribes to a cellular carrier . Cellular carrier  typically provides a number of different services through cellular communication device , including, but not limited to, voice communication and\/or data transmission. Cellular carrier  may also include other types of functions, provided through a variety of different hardware and\/or software components, as is well known in the art.","For the purposes of the present invention, cellular carrier  is also in communication with a provisioning platform  according to the present invention. As described in greater detail below, provisioning platform  features a number of different components, for the creation of dynamic content which is adaptable to a variety of devices such as cellular communication device ; for the delivery of such dynamic content to cellular communication device , and optionally other devices, preferably only as required or \u201con-demand\u201d; and for optionally receiving such dynamic content from third party providers.","With regard to the last feature, provisioning platform  is preferably in communication with a content provider . Content provider  preferably actually submits each such dynamic content to a content repository  of provisioning platform , which is managed by a Service Provider . Each unit of dynamic content, more preferably with any required and\/or preferred modifications or specific implementations, may then be transmitted to cellular communication device  and\/or another limited resource device (not shown). Optionally and most preferably, the user subscribes to any particular dynamic content through cellular carrier , in order to receive such dynamic content through cellular communication device .","According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the procedure for providing such a dynamic content through system  is preferably performed as follows. First, the dynamic content itself is preferably developed, for example by a third party such as content provider . More preferably, the dynamic content is created through an API (application programming interface) and set of tools according to the present invention, as described in greater detail below.","Next, content provider  preferably submits a new unit of dynamic content to Service Provider , which manages such dynamic content. This procedure for submitting a new unit of dynamic content is preferably performed according to a standardized submission protocol. Next, Service Provider  preferably uses a set of tools according to the present invention in order to inspect and certify the submitted units of dynamic content. Optionally and most preferably, the dynamic content is also submitted with any other information which may be required by another component of system , such as a pricing scheme and\/or delivery information, for example.","If the dynamic content is found to be suitable, Service Provider  then preferably approves and publishes the new dynamic content. Publication enables the new dynamic content to be available to user devices such as cellular communication device  for example. Publication is preferably performed by placing the dynamic content in content repository , for delivery to cellular communication device . Content repository  then optionally and more preferably organizes the dynamic content into a dynamic content directory, which contains information about the available units of dynamic content. Optionally, the distribution of the dynamic content may also include features for supporting financial remuneration, for example through subscriptions, as described in greater detail below.","With such a directory, units of dynamic content are optionally and preferably organized into a hierarchical tree of categories and sub-categories, and are also more preferably associated with attributes. Also optionally, different service packages may also be associated with different categories and\/or sub-categories. Different filters and\/or tools according to the present invention are optionally and preferably provided in order to customize the dynamic content according to the requirements and\/or requests of the users, and also to manage the directories themselves.","Optionally and preferably, the user must be eligible to receive a particular unit of dynamic content in order to receive such a dynamic content through cellular communication device . For example, the user could optionally have some type of subscription, to a particular unit of dynamic content but more preferably to a category or type of dynamic content, or even to any such dynamic content available through cellular carrier , as well as variations thereof. Subscription is optionally and preferably performed through cellular carrier .","Billing for these subscriptions is then optionally and preferably performed through a billing module , which is optionally and more preferably located at provisioning platform . Billing module  determines a charge for consuming certain types of dynamic content by cellular communication device , optionally and more preferably according to a plurality of rules, as described in greater detail with regard to  below. In addition, subscriptions are preferably supported by a repository of subscriber information, which is part of provisioning platform . The repository of subscriber information contains information about different users, and more preferably also contains information about their respective user devices such as cellular communication device , and any user preferences. However, for those systems which are based on protocols such as GSM, such information about the respective user devices may not be available. System  is therefore preferably capable of operating without such information.","Delivery of the dynamic content is preferably performed as described with regard to the system of .  shows a schematic block diagram of an exemplary system according to the present invention for content delivery, with additional details concerning a preferred implementation for such delivery according to the present invention.","As shown, cellular communication device  preferably features a discovery application such as a Microbrowser  for discovering various types of content, and an AMS (Application Management Software) module  for downloading, installing and launching applications, and\/or for handling any type of content, whether applications or other types of content, which as previously described, may be collectively termed \u201cdynamic content\u201d. It should be noted that although the system of  is described with regard to Java as the application execution language, this is for the purposes of description only and is without any intention of being limiting in any way. The present invention could also, additionally or alternatively, be operative with other types of execution languages, as could easily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, such that these other types of execution languages are also considered to be within the scope of the present invention.","System  preferably contains a delivery module  for actually delivering each dynamic content to cellular communication device .","If AMS module  determines that the corresponding dynamic content should be downloaded by cellular communication device , then preferably AMS module  sends a request for the dynamic content itself to delivery module . An adapted dynamic content is then preferably dynamically generated and sent by delivery module  to cellular communication device . Adaptation according to the requirements of cellular communication device  is preferably performed through one of the following methods.","For example, the content provider (not shown) could optionally manually prepare different variations of the dynamic content, based on specific device features such as screen size, proprietary API's and so forth. The supporting publication tools and directory structure are preferably also determined in order to support different versions of the same dynamic content. The correct variation of the dynamic content is then preferably selected according to the type of user device which sent the request, for example, according to the type of cellular communication device . Delivery module  optionally and preferably obtains information about the subscriber and\/or particular user device from a subscription preferences repository . The actual content is optionally and preferably obtained from a content repository .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","102","104","104","102","106","104"]},"Accounting block  preferably contains an actions handler , in addition to rules engine . Rules engine  preferably analyzes incoming events which may trigger billing, such as a request for particular content from a particular user through a limited resource device. Rules engine  then determines which rule(s), of a plurality of such rules that are specified in billing policy , should apply to the incoming event, calculates the conditions that are associated with these rules and operates the relevant actions. Actions handler  is responsible for actually executing the action from rules engine , both by interacting with other modules of billing system  and by interacting with other modules of the provisioning platform.","Preferably, the rules used by rules engine  are part of billing policy  which is determined by the service provider and parameterized by the content provider. For example, the policy may optionally define the actual prices for dynamic content, the events which may trigger the charging operation, the conditions under which the event occurred and the actions which must be executed as a result. Each charging rule in the policy is preferably composed of a triplet of events, conditions and actions (ECA). A simple example for a charging rule would be \u201cevery download of the application \u2018Chess\u2019 will cost $1\u201d. Here, the trigger for applying the rule is a download of an application named \u201cChess\u201d, which is a download event, and the outcome is an action for charging the price of $1.","Examples of different types of events include but are not limited to, application-specific events which according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention are defined as events that are preferably generated by applications executed on the device, such as a game being played for example; or as events that are optionally and preferably generated in any computational device communicating with the device over a network as a consequence of the execution of an application, such as a stock trading server, for example, execution which causes a stock transaction to be executed. These events may also be system events which according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention are defined as events other than application specific events, that are preferably and optionally generated by one or more components of the system. These events may optionally include but are not limited to, events optionally and preferably generated by the infrastructure such as an application download for example; or events that are preferably and optionally sent from the client, which may for example be generated by the application on the device, or alternatively generated by the dynamic content manager on the device. Each event is optionally and preferably associated with one or more parameters, for example, subscriber ID (identifier) and application ID. These parameters can optionally and more preferably be used in order to retrieve additional information about the context of the event.","A specific condition may optionally be added to each rule in the policy, which is based upon some predefined parameters so that the price of a specific event is flexible and may have multiple options given different conditions. For example, different prices may be charged at different times of the day. The condition is more preferably expressed as a logical expression which yields a true\/false value. Examples of parameters for the condition include, but are not limited to, subscriber information, such as name, age, gender and other types of demographic information; application data, such as the name of the dynamic content, size of the dynamic content, flavor, or type of limited resource device, and so forth; delivery conditions, such as delivery time, size, and so forth; and dynamic content-specific information. The subscriber and dynamic content data may optionally be retrieved from specific repositories, as described with regard to  above.","When a rule is activated and its condition is met, the action is performed as defined in the rule. Optionally and most preferably the action is Charge which according to preferred embodiments of the present invention is defined as a request for the subscriber to pay a fee for use of the user application. In the case of Charge the subscriber, or user, of the limited resource device is optionally and more preferably charged according to one of the following price specifications: a general price for the dynamic content, as set in the submission process; a price that is specified according to policy parameters; a price that is specified by the event which is sent by the application or a price that is determined by billing system . However, other actions can also be used, such as Send Notification or Set Value.","One example of such a charging policy is a rule that states \u201cdownloading a particular game costs 10 cents for a version for the Palm Pilot\u2122 and 5 cents for a version for a cellular communication device\u201d. The event is an application download, in which the application is a game. The condition determines the price of the game, while the action is charging that price for the game. More formally, if the application version or flavor=\u201cpalm\u201d, then do charge ten cents. Alternatively, if the application version or flavor=\u201cphone\u201d, then do charge five cents.","According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, application-specific charging is performed as follows. Each billing event of this type is triggered by the application itself and is determined in advance by the content provider, as previously described. For example, if the content provider has developed a new game, then optionally the user could be charged each time another stage in the game is completed. The charging policy, or rule(s), would then be based upon events occurring within the application.","These custom application events are preferably created through an events API (application programming interface), which enables the application developer to publish events that are handled by accounting block . More preferably, these application events can be triggered both by backend applications, or applications which exist at the content provider, and device applications, or applications which are operated or otherwise accessed by the limited resource device itself. Rules engine  preferably receives these events from the application, loads the appropriate charging policy rule base (preferably as determined by the content provider) and triggers the execution of the appropriate charging rules.","Optionally and most preferably, a policy editor (not shown) is used to define flexible charging policies by the developer and\/or content provider, based on application custom events. The application developer and\/or content provider can optionally and more preferably define the structure of the custom events, define charging rules based on these events, and create a charging policy rule base. The policy file is optionally and preferably stored for easy access as required, in which case the policy would be referred to as \u201cServer-side policy\u201d. This file is optionally and preferably accessed by the content management mechanism, and optionally and more preferably executed by rules engine  when the application event is received.","Optionally and preferably, a client side policy is defined as a set of compiled rules that are optionally and preferably attached to an application before it is being delivered to a client device. This policy preferably enforces the license agreement by which the application was provided. For example, the application could optionally be provided under a license for a limited period of usage or a limited number of uses. It optionally and preferably completes or otherwise complements the server side policy, by allowing some of the actions to be performed offline. Client-side policy optionally and preferably enables applications to be executed without requiring an event to be sent to the server. Optionally but not exclusively, client side policies can be used in order to limit the number of times an application is allowed to run, to limit the period in which an application is valid or to allowing the license to be renewed online.","Optionally and preferably client side policies are implemented through additional software components known as \u201cwrappers\u201d that are optionally and preferably generated automatically by the system with or without the involvement of the developer. The wrapper optionally and preferably controls the execution of the application by checking the license terms each time the application is started. If the license is valid, the application is invoked, otherwise, the user is notified and offered to renew the license. Without renewing the license, the user is not able to run the application.","Optionally and preferably the overall policy by which a user is charged for consuming a downloadable unit of dynamic content (i.e. an application that is provisioned to a wireless communication device) is referred to as a \u201cdynamic content level billing model\u201d. A dynamic content-level billing model is the preferred method to enable the implementation of different business models for different units of dynamic content. That is, each unit of dynamic content optionally and preferably has an associated billing model, preferably as specified by the provider of that unit of dynamic content. This flexibility is optionally and more preferably achieved by collecting information about the activities of the system and units of dynamic content and applying dynamic billing models.","According to optional and preferred embodiments of the present invention, a billing model is optionally and preferably composed of a server side policy, optionally with a client side policy, and\/or download policy which defines the conditions which must pertain before units of dynamic content may be downloaded. Each of these policies is optionally and preferably associated with one or more parameters optionally and preferably provided with the unit of dynamic content.","According to optional but preferred embodiments of the present invention, billing models that may be considered include download-based billing, where the user is charged on downloading the dynamic content; usage-based billing, where the user is charged for the number of times the dynamic content is used, or for the period in which it is used; subscription-based billing, where the user is charged a periodical fee for a limited or unlimited consumption of services and application-specific billing, where the user is charged for performing various actions within the application (the meaning of these actions is may optionally be known only to, but at least is known by, the application). The above examples should be considered typical and illustrative and by no means exhaustive or exclusive.","One example of such a billing model is the \u201ctry and buy\u201d model. The client-side policy states that free access will be given a certain number of times according to the client side parameter. After this point, if the user wants to continue to use the application, a renewal is requested from the server. The server, in response, charges a price according to its policy parameter, after which all calls to the wrapper are preferably transferred to the original application. Download policy may optionally be to allow a single download for the purposes of trying the particular dynamic content.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201cOne time fee\u201d model. There is no client-side policy and the server side policy determines a single charge priced according to its policy parameter in response to download. Download policy is to allow a download if the user agrees to pay.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201climited usage\u201d model. The server charges a price according to its policy parameter in response to installation of the dynamic content. The client-side policy states that access is given a certain number of times after installation according to the client side parameter. After this point, a renewal is requested from the server, which in response charges a price according to its policy parameter, after which control once again preferably returns to the client-side policy. Download policy is optionally to allow a download if the user agrees to pay.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201ctime-limited usage\u201d model. The server charges a charge a price according to its policy parameter in response to the installation of the application. The client-side policy states that access is given for a certain period of time after installation according to the client side parameter. After this point, if desired by the user, a renewal is requested from the server, which in response charges a price according to its policy parameter. Now control once again preferably returns to the client-side policy. Download policy is to allow a download if the user agrees to pay.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201cpay per usage\u201d model. Each time the application is used and\/or otherwise accessed, the client-side policy preferably requests a renewal from the server, which in response charges a price according to its policy parameter. Download policy is to allow a download if the user agrees to pay.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201cperiodic subscription\u201d model. The server charges a single price according to its policy parameter, in response to the downloading and installation of the dynamic content for the first time, and allows a certain number of downloads, determined by a policy parameter, until renewal. The client-side policy states that access is optionally and preferably granted freely for a certain period of time after installation, according to the client side parameter. After this point, if desired by the user and optionally and more preferably if the download limit has not been exceeded, a renewal is requested from the server. The server, in response, charges a price according to its policy parameter, after which control once again preferably returns to the client-side policy. Download policy is to allow a download if the maximum number of downloads has not been exceeded.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201cPay per download\u201d model. There is no client-side policy and the server side policy determines a charge priced according to its policy parameter in response to each download. Download policy is to allow a download if the user agrees to pay.","A further example of a billing model is the \u201cflat subscription\u201d model. The server charges a single price according to its policy parameter and then allows an unlimited number of downloads. The client-side policy states that access is given a freely for a certain period of time after payment, according to the client side parameter. At the end of this period, a renewal is requested from the server which in response charges a price according to its policy parameter. Control once again then preferably returns to the client-side policy. Download policy is to allow the user to download freely.","An example of a particular application-specific billing model could be where an application supplies stock quotes which in general cost 10 cents per stock quote. Between 7:00 pm and 7:00 am, the stock quotes may optionally cost 5 cents. This is preferably implemented as a server-side policy only, with the different prices as its parameters and the provision of the stock quotes as its events. Download policy is to allow a download if the user agrees to pay.","According to optional but preferred embodiments of the present invention, billing system  also features a mediation block  for receiving charge commands from actions handler  of accounting block . Mediation block  then preferably submits a charge message to the outside billing system in the protocol of that billing system. For example, mediation block  could optionally communicate with the billing system of the cellular carrier of , according to the format or language of that particular billing system.","Optionally, mediation block  features a CDR builder  for receiving the charge command and for producing the CDR (call data record) according to a format which is defined by the carrier (or other outside billing entity). The CDR is then transmitted to the external billing system by a CDR transmitter . The data for the CDR may optionally be stored at billing system  and\/or another module of the system of  or  as static data, or alternatively may be dynamic data which depends on the particular charging event, as received from accounting block . Examples of static data include, but are not limited to, subscriber identification and profile information; dynamic content attributes, such as name, size and so forth; and content provider information. Examples of dynamic data include, but are not limited to, timing data (concerning the time period at which the triggering event occurred); the type of triggering event, such as download or application-specific events; and the amount to be charged or the rate of charging.","Auxiliary data may also optionally be attached to the CDR for validation purposes by the external billing system. Examples of auxiliary data include, but are not limited to, a unique identifier for the CDR; sequence information, such as a sequential number for each CDR, and so forth; the time of creation for the CDR; and metadata which defines the record type and\/or record specific fields.","According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, billing system  optionally and preferably also features an archive  for storing the data which influenced the execution of particular billing actions, as well as the details of these actions. For example, archive  preferably stores information in order to be able to recreate each CDR, as well as those parameters and values which were used by rules engine  in order to determine a particular charge for a particular billing event. Archive  can optionally be used to generate reports for submission to the dynamic content developers and\/or content providers, as well as for generating billing reports for the users, as described in greater detail below. In addition, archive  can also optionally be consulted for the history and details of billing actions in cases of suspected fraud.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"121"},"As shown, a system  features a cellular communication device , operated by a user (not shown), who subscribes to a cellular carrier . Cellular carrier  typically provides a number of different services through cellular communication device , including, but not limited to, voice communication and\/or data transmission. Cellular carrier  may also include other types of functions, provided through a variety of different hardware and\/or software components, as is well known in the art.","For the purposes of the present invention, cellular carrier  is also in communication with a provisioning platform  according to the present invention. As described in greater detail below, provisioning platform  features a number of different components involved in the management of billing models.","According to preferred implementations of the present invention provisioning platform  communicates with the various components of system  by means of a messaging system  which is optionally and preferably responsible for distributing the events that are published by the various sources within system . Messaging system  may optionally be synchronous or asynchronous. Messaging system  should preferably be able to deliver events that are published from cellular communication device  over a wireless network more preferably through cellular carrier .","As shown, cellular communication device  is capable of executing and\/or otherwise accessing and\/or displaying and\/or consuming one or more units of dynamic content . A client side policy  is optionally and preferably attached to each unit of dynamic content  and most preferably is executed and\/or otherwise accessed locally by cellular communication device .","Provisioning platform  is preferably able to serve one or more units of dynamic content to cellular communication device , shown as a unit of dynamic content  for the purposes of explanation only and without any intention of being limiting. A plurality of such units of dynamic content  may optionally be present on, and operated by, cellular communication device .","Provisioning platform  preferably contains a rule engine  which receives events and applies one or both of charging policies , . While operating, rule engine  optionally and preferably accesses various repositories in system  (not shown), in order to retrieve various items of data, including, but not limited to, data about subscribers (not shown), data about dynamic content , data about or from backend application  and data about or from one or more content providers .","Amongst the repositories accessed by the rules engine is a server side policy repository also preferably located on provisioning platform  which more preferably includes server-side charging policies  that are more preferably specified by a service provider (not shown) and optionally and more preferably by one or more content providers .","Upon receiving one or more events, rule engine  preferably identifies dynamic content  and optionally and preferably selects relevant rules. Each rule is preferably activated, by evaluating appropriate conditions and more preferably executing an action if a condition is met. An optional and still more preferable result of an action is generation of a billing record by billing mediator  which then most preferably transmits billing records to external billing system  in a configured protocol, as defined by external billing system .","Provisioning platform  is also optionally and preferably in communication with one or more content providers . Although a plurality of such content providers  may optionally be in communication with provisioning platform , only one such content provider  is shown for the purposes of illustration only and without any intention of being limiting. One or more content providers  may optionally run backend (i.e. server component) application .","According to optional and more preferred embodiments of the present invention the process of defining and applying billing models involves the content provider , service provider (not shown), which may optionally be for example the owner of provisioning platform , and subscriber (also not shown). Optionally and more preferably, a service provider predefines billing models that are optionally and preferably used by content providers . These billing models can most preferably be easily customized by specifying optional parameters optionally and preferably for server-side policy  (typically but not exclusively price) or optionally and preferably client-side policy  (typically but not exclusively number of allowed uses). Optionally and more preferably, a service provider is responsible for reviewing and approving billing models that are submitted by content providers .","More preferably, when dynamic content  is submitted, content provider  preferably selects an applicable billing model and optionally and more preferably provides parameters. Content provider  optionally and still more preferably defines new billing models by more preferably and optionally composing new policies for one or both of client side policy  and backend application . Optionally and most preferably, policies are submitted through files that are generated by a policy editor (not shown). For application-specific billing models, this is the most preferred way in which content provider  can associate rules with events that are generated from within application .","A subscriber (end user) can optionally select from multiple billing models before downloading dynamic content . Alternatively, the end user may optionally be allowed only to select a particular dynamic content , but not the billing model, which is then selected by system . In any case, system  preferably performs a series of actions in order to follow a particular billing model. Optionally and most preferably at least one component of system , such as provisioning platform  for example, generates an event that indicates the delivery mechanism and a preferred billing model.","More preferably, system  determines whether a user is allowed to download dynamic content , according to download policy (not shown). Optionally and still more preferably system  attaches client side policy  to application , most preferably with one or more relevant parameters, such that client side policy  is sent to cellular communication device , most preferably with application .","According to preferred implementations of the present invention, a billing model is preferably processed by system  in several stages. During the provisioning and execution of dynamic content  one or more events are optionally and preferably generated.","A \u201cdynamic content delivery\/installation\u201d event is optionally and preferably generated by provisioning server  when dynamic content  is preferably delivered to cellular communication device  or optionally and more preferably installed on cellular communication device  (optionally and preferably reported by cellular communication device  itself). This event, and those events which are described in greater detail below, may be generalized to any type of dynamic content but are described herein with regard to applications for the purpose of discussion only, and without any intention of being limiting.","An \u201capplication start\u201d event is optionally and preferably generated by application  on cellular communication device  (in this example, as an application) and optionally and more preferably handled locally by client side policy .","Periodic events are optionally and preferably generated by system  at specific defined time intervals (typically but not exclusively once a day, week, month, etc.) and are optionally and preferably are used for triggering subscription charging. Examples of such subscription charging are described above.","License renewal events are optionally and preferably generated by provisioning server  to indicate that a user has renewed a license for an dynamic content . Application-specific events are optionally and preferably generated by application  or optionally and preferably by backend application  on the occurrence of various activities, preferably with regard to actions on, by or with dynamic content .","Events are optionally and more preferably reported to system  through a messaging protocol supported by messaging system .
