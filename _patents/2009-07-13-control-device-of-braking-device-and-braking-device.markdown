According to a brake control device of a vehicle described in, for example, Patent Literature 1 as a control device of the conventional brake control device, a brake control device of a vehicle for controlling a brake force applied to wheels by a predetermined braking device operated based on a brake operation of a driver includes a vehicle speed detection means for detecting a vehicle speed of the vehicle, a brake operation detection means for detecting a brake operation amount of a driver in the predetermined braking device, and a brake force holding means for holding a brake force when a first brake operation amount of the driver in the predetermined braking device is detected by the brake operation detection means at the time it is detected by the vehicle speed detection means that a vehicle speed becomes a predetermined vehicle speed or less and thereafter when a second brake operation amount of the driver in the predetermined braking device larger than the first brake operation amount is detected. That is, the conventional braking device executes a control for holding a brake force when a master cylinder pressure as a brake operation amount generated in a master cylinder in response to a brake operation of the driver exceeds a predetermined value by an additional depression operation of a brake pedal after the vehicle stops. With the operation, the brake control device of the vehicle described in Patent Literature 1 executes a control for holding a brake force of a vehicle without the need of a brake operation by a driver when, for example, the vehicle starts on a slope road, and the like by a simple operation based on an intention of the driver.","Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-213287","However, the brake control device of the vehicle described in the above Patent Literature 1 includes a brake booster for increasing a pedal depression force input to a brake pedal making use of an engine negative pressure, wherein, for example, the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster is varied by that the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster is varied in response to an engine operation state, and as a result, there is a possibility that the master cylinder pressure generated in the master cylinder is also varied in response to the increased pedal depression force.","In the brake control device of the vehicle described in the Patent Literature 1 since, for example, when the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster is varied in response to an operation state of the engine and the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster is varied, there is a possibility that the pedal depression force from the driver to the brake pedal necessary to increase a master cylinder pressure up to a predetermined value and to execute a control for holding a brake force is varied. In other words, in the brake control device of the vehicle described in Patent Literature 1, even if the pedal depression force input from the driver to the brake pedal is the same, since, for example, the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster is varied in response to the operation state of the engine and the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster is varied, there is a possibility that a dispersion is generated in a start of a control for holding the brake force such as a case in which the control for holding a brake force is started and a case in which the control for holding a brake force is not started. Accordingly, in the control device of the conventional braking device, for example, it is desired to appropriately execute holding of a brake force regardless of an operation state such as a state of an engine negative pressure.","Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a control device of a braking device and the braking device capable of appropriately executing holding of a brake force.","In order to achieve the above mentioned object, when a vehicle speed of a vehicle is equal to or less than a predetermined speed, the control device of the braking device according to the present invention executes a brake force holding control that holds a brake force generated by a braking device main body to wheels of the vehicle to a predetermined value or more based on a change amount per unit time of an operation amount of a brake operation member.","Further, the control device of the braking device may calculate the change amount per unit time of the operation amount, calculate a control determination workload based on the change amount, calculate an actual workload in response to an operation of the brake operation member, and execute the brake force holding control when the actual workload has exceeded the control determination workload.","Further, the control device of the braking device may calculate the change amount per unit time of the operation amount when the actual operation amount has reached a first control start determination operation amount obtained by adding a set amount to a stop-time operation amount as the operation amount when the vehicle stops or a maximum change amount per unit time of the operation amount during a period until the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount after the vehicle stops as a control determination value calculating change amount, calculate a control determination integration value in response to an integration value of the operation amount until the operation amount has reached a second control start determination operation amount different from the first control start determination operation amount when the operation amount is changed by the control determination value calculating change amount after the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount, calculates an actual integration value in response to an integration value of the actual operation amount after the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount, and execute the brake force holding control when the actual integration value has exceeded the control determination integration value.","Further, when the control determination value calculating change amount is larger than a preset first predetermined change amount, the control device of the braking device may execute a calculation of the control determination integration value and a calculation of the actual integration value, and when the control determination value calculating change amount is equal to or less than the first predetermined change amount, the control device may not execute the calculation of the control determination integration value and the calculation of the actual integration value.","Further, the control device of the braking device may update the control determination value calculating change amount to a change amount per unit time of the operation amount at the present when a change amount per unit time of the actual operation amount has exceeded the first predetermined change amount from a state that the control determination value calculating change amount is equal to or less than the first predetermined change amount, calculate the control determination integration value in response to an integration value of the operation amount until the operation amount has reached the second control start determination operation amount when the operation amount is changed by the updated control determination value calculating change amount from the operation amount at the time, calculate an actual integration value in response to an integration value of the actual operation amount after a change amount per unit time of the actual operation amount has exceeded the first predetermined change amount, and execute the brake force holding control when the actual integration value has exceeded the control determination integration value.","Further, when an elapsed time after the actual operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount becomes equal to or more than a preset restriction time, the control device of the braking device may stop the calculation of the actual integration value and resets the actual integration value.","Further, when the actual change amount per unit time of the operation amount is equal to or less than a preset second predetermined change amount, the control device of the braking device may stop the calculation of the actual integration value and resets the actual integration value.","Further, the control device of the braking device may update the control determination value calculating change amount to a change amount per unit time of the operation amount at the time when a change amount per unit time of the actual operation amount has exceeded the control determination value calculating change amount in a state that the actual operation amount is larger than the first control start determination operation amount after the actual integration value has been reset, calculate the control determination integration value in response to an integration value of the operation amount until the operation amount has reached the second control start determination operation amount when the operation amount is changed by the control determination value calculating change amount updated from the operation amount at the time, calculate an actual integration value in response to an integration value of the actual operation amount after a change amount per unit time of the actual operation amount has exceeded the control determination value calculating change amount before the update, and execute the brake force holding control when the actual integration value has exceeded the control determination integration value.","Further, when the actual operation amount has exceeded the first control start determination operation amount again from a state that the actual operation amount is equal to or less than the first control start determination operation amount after the actual integration value is reset, the control device of the braking device may update the control determination value calculating change amount to a change amount per unit time of the operation amount when the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount again or to a maximum change amount per unit time of the operation amount during a period in which the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount again after the actual integration value is reset, calculate the control determination integration value in response to an integration value of the operation amount until the operation amount has reached the second control start determination operation amount when the operation amount is changed by the control determination value calculating change amount updated after the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount again, calculate an actual integration value in response to an integration value of the actual operation amount after the operation amount has reached the first control start determination operation amount again, and execute the brake force holding control when the actual integration value has exceeded the control determination integration value.","Further, when the actual operation amount has exceeded the first control start determination operation amount as well as the actual operation amount has exceeded the second control start determination operation amount or the actual operation amount has exceeded the first control start determination operation amount as well as the actual integration value has exceeded the control determination integration value at the time the first control start determination operation amount is smaller than the second control start determination operation amount, the control device of the braking device may execute the brake force holding control.","Further, when the actual operation amount has exceeded the first control start determination operation amount at the time the first control start determination operation amount is equal to or more than the second control start determination operation amount, the control device of the braking device may execute the brake force holding control.","Further, the braking device main body may include a brake booster unit capable of increasing an operation force in response to an operation of the brake operation member using a negative pressure supplied from a suction passage of an internal combustion engine, an operation pressure applying unit that applies an operation pressure to a working fluid in response to the operation force, a brake force generating unit that generates the brake force by causing a brake pressure based on the operation pressure to act, and a hold unit capable of holding the brake pressure, and the control device of the braking device may use the operation pressure as an operation amount of the brake operation member.","In order to achieve the above mentioned object, a control device of a braking device according to the present invention executes a brake force holding control that holds a brake force generated by a braking device main body to wheels of a vehicle to a predetermined value or more based on a change amount per unit time of an operation amount of a brake

brake force holding control for holding a brake force to a predetermined value or more is executed by a braking device main body based on a change amount per unit time of an operation amount of a brake operation member.","According to the braking device according to the present invention, since the control device executes the brake force holding control for holding a brake force to the predetermined value or more by the braking device main body based on the change amount per unit time of the operation amount of the brake operation member, the holding of the brake force can appropriately be executed.","An embodiment of a control device of a braking device and the braking device according to the present invention will be explained below in detail based on the drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited by the embodiment. Further, components in the embodiment include components which can be replaced by a person skilled in the art as well as are easy or substantially the same components.","Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 14","FIG. 15"]},"The control device of the braking device of the embodiment executes a brake force holding control for holding a brake force generated to wheels of a vehicle by a braking device main body to a predetermined value or more using an operation of a brake operation member by a driver as a switch operation. Then, the control device of the braking device appropriately executes holding of a brake force regardless of, for example, a vehicle operation state and the like.","As illustrated in  to , a braking device  according to the embodiment is applied with an ECU  as the control device of the braking device of the present invention. The braking device  is mounted on a vehicle  such as a passenger car, a truck, and the like and a hydraulic braking device  composed of brake pads FL, FR, RL, RR, brake rotors FL, FR, RL, RR, and the like disposed to respective wheels  and  of the vehicle  generates a brake force (brake torque) to respective wheels  and  of the vehicle  in response to a brake operation of a driver. That is, in the braking device , a hydraulic braking device  generates a pressure brake force.","Note that, in the embodiment explained below, as a drive source for generating a drive force transmitted to the wheels  and  of the vehicle  to which the braking device  of the embodiment is applied, although an internal combustion engine (gasoline engine, diesel engine, LPG engine and the like) for generating engine torque is used, the embodiment is not limited thereto and electric machinery such as a motor for generating motor torque may be used as a drive source. Further, an internal combustion engine and electric machinery may be used together as the drive source.","Specifically, the braking device  is configured by including the hydraulic braking device  as a braking device main body and an ECU  as the control device and mounted on the vehicle . The braking device  of the embodiment can execute a brake force holding control for releasing holding of a brake force after the brake force is held when the vehicle  stops, that is, a so-called a hill start assist control by that the hydraulic braking device  generates a brake force to the wheels  and  of the vehicle  in response to an operation of a brake pedal  as a brake operation member as well as the ECU  controls the hydraulic braking device . Since the braking device  executes the hill start assist control, the braking device  can smoothly start the vehicle  by preventing the vehicle  from traveling backward when, for example, the vehicle  starts on a hill.","First, as illustrated in , the vehicle  to which the braking device  is applied includes an engine  as a drive source for generating a drive force to the respective wheels  and  of the vehicle  in response to an operation of an accelerator pedal as a drive operation member, a transmission  for changing the speed of a rotation output of the engine , a drive shaft  for transmitting a drive force to the front side wheel (front wheel)  side, a drive shaft  for transmitting a drive force to the rear side wheels (rear wheels)  side, a transfer (sub-transmission)  for distributing a drive force transmitted from the transmission  to the drive shaft  of the front wheels side and the drive shaft  of the rear wheels side, a front differential , a front wheel drive shaft , the wheels (front wheels) , a rear differential , a rear wheel drive shaft , and the wheels (rear wheels) . The vehicle  is configured such that output torque of the engine  is transmitted to the respective wheels  and  via a power transmission system. Note that although the vehicle  illustrated in the  exemplifies a four-wheel driven vehicle, the embodiment is not limited thereto.","The respective wheels  and  are provided with hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR as brake force generating units of the braking device , respectively. Further, a fluid pressure system of an working fluid which connects a master cylinder  configuring the braking device  to wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR is disposed with a brake actuator  for controlling a brake force applied to the respective wheels  and  by increasing and decreasing a fluid pressure in the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR separately from a brake operation (braking operation) of the brake pedal  as the brake operation member by the driver.","As illustrated in , the braking device  is configured by including the hydraulic braking device  as the braking device main body and the ECU  as the control device.","The hydraulic braking device  configures a so-called inline system and generates a pressure brake force. The hydraulic braking device  includes the brake pedal  as the brake operation member, the master cylinder  as an operation pressure applying unit, a reservoir , a brake booster  as a brake booster unit, the brake actuator  as a pressurizing unit, the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, and the hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR as the brake force generating units.","In the hydraulic braking device , a hydraulic pressure passage from the master cylinder  to the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR via the brake actuator  is filled with a brake oil as a working fluid. In the hydraulic braking device , basically, an operation pressure is applied to the brake oil by the master cylinder  in response to a pedal depression force as an operation force acting on the brake pedal  by that the driver operates the brake pedal , and a master pressure brake force is generated as a pressure brake force by that the pressure brake force, that is, a master cylinder pressure Pmc acts on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR as a wheel cylinder pressure Pwc which is a brake pressure.","Specifically, the brake pedal  is the brake operation member via which the driver executes a brake operation, and when the driver generates a brake force to the vehicle , the brake pedal  is operated in response to a brake request by the driver. The brake pedal  is a section where, for example, the driver on the vehicle  inputs a pedal depression force as a brake operation by foot. The brake pedal  has a depression surface section and is disposed so as to turn about a turn axis when the pedal depression force is input to the depression surface section.","The master cylinder  is an operation pressure applying unit and driven in response to a depression operation of the brake pedal  by the driver. The master cylinder  pressurizes the brake oil as the working fluid when the brake pedal  is input with the pedal depression force and applies the master cylinder pressure Pmc as the operation pressure. The master cylinder  pressurizes the brake oil by a piston not illustrated in figures to which the pedal depression force acting on the brake pedal  is applied as the driver depresses the brake pedal . That is, in the master cylinder , the piston can move a piston by the pedal depression force transmitted via the brake pedal  by an operation of the driver as well as the master cylinder pressure Pmc as a brake hydraulic pressure in response to the pedal depression force can be output as the piston moves. The master cylinder  has two internal hydraulic chambers filled with the brake oil, the pedal depression force input via the brake pedal  is converted to the master cylinder pressure Pmc which is a fluid pressure (hydraulic pressure) of the brake fluid, by the hydraulic chambers and the piston, in response to the brake operation of the brake pedal .","A reservoir  is coupled with the master cylinder  and filled with the brake oil inside.","The brake booster  is, for example, a vacuum booster unit and boosts (increases) the pedal depression force acting on the brake pedal  at a predetermined boost ratio by the negative pressure generated by the engine  (refer to ) by that the driver depresses the brake pedal , and transmits the pedal depression force to the piston of the master cylinder . The brake booster  is attached to the master cylinder  integrally therewith and connected to a suction passage (suction route) of the engine  via a negative pressure piping  and a check valve . The brake booster  amplifies the pedal depression force by a force acting on a not-illustrated diaphragm in response to a difference pressure between a negative pressure generated in the suction passage of the engine  and a pressure due to the outside air.","The brake booster  can increase the pedal depression force input from the brake pedal  and transmitted via an operating rod by the difference pressure between the negative pressure introduced from the suction passage of the engine  via the negative pressure piping  and the atmospheric pressure, and transmit the pedal depression force to the master cylinder . That is, the brake booster  can reduce the pedal depression force to the brake pedal  by the driver by increasing the pedal depression force when the brake pedal  is subjected to a brake operation by the negative pressure and increasing the pedal depression force to the master cylinder  with respect to the pedal depression force to the brake pedal .","Then, the master cylinder  increase (amplifies) the pedal depression force acting on the brake pedal  by the brake booster , pressurizes the brake oil in response to the increased pedal depression force, and applies the master cylinder pressure Pmc as the operation pressure to the brake oil. That is, the master cylinder pressure Pmc as the operation pressure applied by the master cylinder  corresponds to the pedal depression force input to the brake pedal  by the driver and the negative pressure of the engine  (refer to ).","The brake actuator  is the pressurizing unit, controls the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR in response to the master cylinder pressure Pmc applied to the brake oil by the master cylinder  or acts the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR regardless of whether or not the master cylinder pressure Pmc is applied by the master cylinder .","As described above, the master cylinder  is provided with the not-illustrated two hydraulic chambers disposed therein and the master cylinder pressure Pmc is generated inside the respective hydraulic chambers. The master cylinder  is disposed with a hydraulic piping L and a hydraulic piping L connected to the respective hydraulic chambers.","Then, the brake actuator  functions as a working fluid pressure adjusting unit for transmitting the hydraulic pressure (master cylinder pressure Pmc) in the hydraulic piping (first hydraulic piping) L and the hydraulic piping (second hydraulic piping) L to the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR to be described later as it is or after it is adjusted in response to a control command from the ECU .","The brake actuator  of the embodiment has a first hydraulic pressure control circuit A for a right front wheel and a left rear wheel and a second hydraulic pressure control circuit B for a right rear wheel and a left front wheel as circuits for transmitting a hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder  to the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR.

The check valves of the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B permit only a flow of the brake oil from the hydraulic pipings L and L side to the hydraulic pipings L and L side.","Then, the master cut solenoid valves A and B are so-called normal open type linear solenoid valves which are in an open valve state in an ordinary time at which not supplied with a current and are electrically connected to the ECU . Accordingly, a current supplied to the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B are controlled based on a command current value from the ECU , and open degree controls for controlling open degrees are executed, respectively. That is, the master cut solenoid valves A and B adjust a flow rate of the brake oil derived from the master cylinder  by controlling the valve open degrees in response to the command current value, thereby adjusting the pressurized pressure P.","The hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR can hold the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc which is the brake pressure acting on the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR to be described later.","The hold solenoid valve FR is disposed to the first hydraulic pressure control circuit A and connected to the hydraulic piping L connecting to the master cylinder  via the master cut solenoid valve A and the hydraulic piping L and connected to the hydraulic piping L connecting to the wheel cylinder FR. The hold solenoid valve FR causes the hydraulic piping L to communicate with the hydraulic piping L and releases the communication therebetween. That is, the hold solenoid valve FR connects the master cylinder  to the wheel cylinder FR and releases the connection thereof. Note that, as illustrated in , since the hold solenoid valve RL disposed to the first hydraulic pressure control circuit A, and the hold solenoid valve FL and the hold solenoid valve RR disposed to the second hydraulic pressure control circuit B have approximately the same configuration as the hold solenoid valve FR, an explanation thereof is omitted here.","The respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are so-called normal open solenoid valves which are in an open valve state in an ordinary time at which not supplied with a current and are electrically connected to the ECU . Accordingly, when the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are subjected to an ON\/OFF control by the ECU , opening and closing thereof are controlled, respectively. That is, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are placed in an energized state when turned ON by the ECU  and are totally closed when energized. In contrast, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are placed in a non-energized state when turned OFF by the ECU  and totally opened in the non-energized state.","Further, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are provided with check valves respectively so that when a total pressure acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, that is, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc is higher than the pressure of the brake oil in the hydraulic pipings L and L at the time of energization, the check valves return the brake oil to upstream sides (the hydraulic pipings L and L side) of the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR. The check valves of the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR permit only a flow of the brake oil from the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR side to the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B side.","The pressure reduction solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR can reduce the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc held by the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, and the like to be described later.","The pressure reduction solenoid valve FR is disposed to the first hydraulic pressure control circuit A and connected to the hydraulic piping L connecting to the wheel cylinder FR and to the hydraulic piping (hydraulic discharge passage) L connecting to a reservoir A.

Accordingly, the master cylinder pressure Pmc which is the operation pressure applied to the brake oil by the master cylinder  directly acts on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR as the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc. With the operation, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR can be controlled in response to the master cylinder pressure Pmc. Note that when master cylinder pressure Pmc applied to the brake oil by the master cylinder  is reduced, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc is also reduced. At the time, the brake oil in the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR is returned to the master cylinder  via the hydraulic pipings L, L, L and L, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, the hydraulic pipings L and L, the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B, and the hydraulic pipings L and L, and reserved in the reservoir .","The brake actuator  can also apply the pressurized pressure Pto the brake oil in the pressure increase mode. In the brake actuator , when, for example, the open degrees of the master cut solenoid valves A and B are controlled based on the command current value from the ECU  and the open degrees are made smaller than when the valves are totally opened and the drive motor  for driving the pressurizing pumps A and B are driven and controlled based on a drive command value from the ECU , the brake oil is introduced to the respective reservoirs A and B from upstream sides of the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B, that is, from the hydraulic pipings L and L via the hydraulic pipings L and L. The brake oil introduced to the respective reservoirs A, B is sucked and pressurized by the pressurizing pumps A and B, and the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR are filled with the brake oil via the hydraulic pipings L, L, L and L, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, and the hydraulic pipings L, L, L and L. Here, since the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B adjust a difference pressure between the brake oil on a downstream side of the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B, that is, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR and the brake oil on an upstream side of the respective master cut solenoid valves A and B, that is, the master cylinder pressure Pmc generated by the master cylinder  as the pressurized pressure P, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc becomes a total pressure of the master cylinder pressure Pmc and the pressurized pressure P. That is, the total pressure of the master cylinder pressure Pmc and the pressurized pressure Pacts on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR as the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc.","In a hold mode, the brake actuator  is controlled by the ECU  so that the master cut solenoid valves A and B are not energized, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are energized, the respective pressure reduction solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are not energized, and the respective pressurizing pumps A and B are not driven. That is, in the hold mode of the brake actuator , since the brake oil is held between the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR and the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR can be kept constant. Accordingly, when the hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are controlled to the closed valve state, a fluid pressure of the fluid pressure system on the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR side from the hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, that is, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc can be held, as a result, brake forces applied to the respective wheels  and  can be held, respectively.","In a pressure reduction mode, the brake actuator  is controlled by the ECU  so that the master cut solenoid valves A and B are not energized, the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are energized, the respective pressure reduction solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR are energized, and the respective pressurizing pumps A and B are not driven. That is, in the pressure reduction mode of the brake actuator , since the brake oil held between the respective hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR and the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR is collected to and reserved in the reservoirs A and B via hydraulic pipings L and L and hydraulic pipings L and L, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR can be reduced. With the operation, the brake actuator  can execute an antilock brake control for suppressing, for example, that any of the wheels  and  is locked and slips with respect to a road surface.","Note that, the brake actuator  can adjust the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, independently, that is, individually. Further, even when the driver does not operate the brake pedal , the brake actuator  can pressurize the brake oil by the ECU . At the time, when the brake actuator  is controlled by the ECU  so that the hold mode and the pressure reduction mode described above are achieved, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acting on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR can be adjusted. With the operation, the brake actuator  can execute a traction control for preventing a slip to a road surface when any of the front and rear wheels transmits a drive force to the road surface, and a posture stabilization control (VSC: Vehicle Stability Control) for preventing any of the front and rear wheels from slipping laterally while the vehicle  is being turned, and the like.","Next, the hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR are brake force generating units and include the brake pads FL, FR, RL and RR and the brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR together the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, respectively. The hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR generate the brake force by that a total pressure of the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc which is a pressure of the brake oil filled in the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, that is, the master cylinder pressure Pmc and the pressurized pressure P, acts as a brake pressure.","In the vehicle , the right front wheel is disposed with the wheel cylinder FR, the brake pad FR, and the brake rotor FR, the left rear wheel is disposed with the wheel cylinder RL, the brake pad RL, and the brake rotor RL, the left front wheel is disposed with the wheel cylinder FL, the brake pad FL, and the brake rotor FL, and the right rear wheel is disposed with the wheel cylinder RR, the brake pad RR, and the brake rotor RR. That is, the pipings of the hydraulic braking device  are disposed to the respective wheels  and  (refer to ) in cross piping. Since the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc act on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL, RR cause the respective brake pads FL, FR, RL and RR to come into contact with the respective brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR which face the respective brake pads FL, FR and RL, RR and are rotated integrally with the respective wheels  and , respectively, and generates the pressure brake force by a friction force generated between the respective brake pads FL, FR, RL and RR and the respective brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR, respectively. Note that when the same wheel cylinder pressure Pwc acts on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, the respective brake pads FR and FL and the respective brake rotors FR and FL disposed to the right and left front wheels are set to generate a friction force larger than a friction force generated between the respective brake pads RL and RR and the respective brake rotors RL and RR disposed to the left and right rear wheels.","Here, in the braking device  of the embodiment, a brake force in response to the master cylinder pressure Pmc by the master cylinder  is called a master pressure brake force, and a brake force in response to a difference pressure between the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc to be acted on the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL, RR and the master cylinder pressure Pmc, that is, a brake force in response to the pressurized pressure Pby the pressurizing pumps A, B of the brake actuator  is called a difference pressure brake force. That is, the hydraulic braking device  can generate a pressure brake force of the total of a master pressure brake force in response to the master cylinder pressure Pmc and a difference pressure brake force in response to the pressurized pressure P. In still other words, the hydraulic braking device  can generate a predetermined pressure brake force (wheel pressure brake force) of the total of the master pressure brake force and the difference pressure brake force as a brake force in response to the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc as the total pressure of the master cylinder pressure Pmc and the pressurized pressure P.","The ECU  is mainly composed of a microcomputer and controls respective units such as the brake actuator  and the like of the braking device  in response to operation states of the braking device  and the vehicle  with the braking device  mounted thereon. Here, the ECU  controls an operation of the engine  based on various input signals input from sensors attached to respective sections of the vehicle  on which the engine  is mounted and on various maps. For example, the ECU  determines a fuel injection amount, an injection timing, an ignition timing and the like based on an engine operation state such a vehicle speed, an intake air amount, a throttle open degree, a number of revolution of an engine, a cooling water temperature, and the like and also executes an injector control, an ignition plug control, a throttle open degree control of a throttle valve, and the like of the engine .","As illustrated in , the ECU  is electrically connected with various sensors such as wheel speed sensors FL, FR, RL and RR, a shift position sensor , an accelerator pedal sensor , a parking brake switch , a front\/rear acceleration sensor , a tilt angle sensor , a master cylinder pressure sensor , and the like. Then, the ECU  is electrically connected with a fuel injection valve, the throttle valve, and the ignition plug of the engine  and the master cut solenoid valves A and B, the hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, the pressure reduction solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, and the pressurizing pumps A and B of the brake actuator . Since the ECU  executes a brake control program based on operation states of the braking device  and the vehicle  with the braking device  mounted thereon which are detected by the various sensors to thereby execute a brake control and drive the brake actuator , the ECU  adjusts the wheel cylinder pressure (the brake hydraulic pressure) Pwc to the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, causes a predetermined brake force in response to the brake request of the driver to act on the wheels  and , and reduces rotations of the wheels  and .","The wheel speed sensors FL, FR, RL and RR detect revolution speeds of the respective wheels  and , respectively. The wheel speed sensors FL, FR, RL and RR are connected to the ECU . The revolution speeds of the respective wheels  and  detected by the wheel speed sensors FL, FR, RL and RR are output to the ECU . The ECU  can calculate a vehicle speed of the vehicle  based on the revolution speeds of the respective wheels  and  detected by the wheel speed sensors FL, FR, RL and RR.","The shift position sensor  detects a shift position (for example, a parking position, a reverse position, a neutral position, a drive position, and the like) of the vehicle  with the braking device  mounted thereon. The shift position sensor  is connected to the ECU . The shift position detected by the shift position sensor  is output to the ECU .","The accelerator pedal sensor  detects an operation of the accelerator pedal (refer to ) by the driver, that is, an accelerator operation. Here, the accelerator pedal sensor  detects an operation and a non-operation of the accelerator pedal , that is, an accelerator ON\/OFF as well as detects an operation amount of the accelerator pedal by the driver, that is, an accelerator depression amount (an accelerator open degree). The accelerator pedal sensor  is connected to the ECU . The accelerator ON\/OFF and the accelerator depression amount detected by the accelerator pedal sensor  are output to the ECU . Note that the ECU  may be connected with an accelerator switch for detecting the accelerator ON\/OFF, independently from the accelerator pedal sensor .","The parking brake switch  detects an operation, a non-operation of a parking brake of the vehicle  with the braking device  mounted thereon, that is, ON\/OFF. The parking brake switch  is connected to the ECU . A result of detection of the parking brake ON\/OFF detected by the parking brake switch  is output to the ECU .","The front\/rear acceleration sensor  detects accelerations of the vehicle  with the braking device  mounted thereon in front\/rear directions. The front\/rear acceleration sensor  is connected to the ECU . The accelerations of the vehicle  in the front\/rear directions detected by the front\/rear acceleration sensor  are output to the ECU .","The tilt angle sensor  detects a tilt angle of a road surface on which the vehicle  with the braking device  mounted thereon is posited, that is, a road surface gradient. The tilt angle sensor  is connected to the ECU . The road surface gradient detected by the tilt angle sensor  is output to the ECU . Note that the braking device  may obtain road surface gradient information (map information) which is information showing the road surface gradient using, for example, a navigation system and a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver in place of the tilt angle sensor  and may detect the road surface gradient of the road surface on which the vehicle  is positioned based on the road surface gradient information. That is, a means for detecting the road surface gradient may be configured by a means for obtaining road surface gradient information of a road surface gradient when the vehicle  stops.","The master cylinder pressure sensor  detects an operation pressure, that is, the master cylinder pressure Pmc. The master cylinder pressure sensor  is disposed at a midpoint of the hydraulic piping L for connecting the master cylinder  to the master cut solenoid valve A of the brake actuator  (refer to ). That is, the master cylinder pressure sensor  detects a pressure of the brake oil in the hydraulic piping L as the operation pressure, that is, as the master cylinder pressure Pmc. The master cylinder pressure sensor  is connected to the ECU . The master cylinder pressure Pmc detected by the master cylinder pressure sensor  is output to the ECU .","Note that, as described above, the master cylinder  generates the master cylinder pressure Pmc in response to a brake operation of the brake pedal , that is, to a brake operation, that is, the master cylinder pressure Pmc detected by the master cylinder pressure sensor  corresponds to an operation amount of the brake pedal  by the driver. That is, the master cylinder pressure sensor  corresponds to a detection means of an operation amount for detecting the master cylinder pressure Pmc as an operation amount of the brake pedal  in response to the pedal depression force. Further, the master cylinder pressure sensor  can detect also an operation, a non-operation of the brake pedal , that is, a brake ON\/OFF by detecting the master cylinder pressure Pmc.","In the braking device  configured as described above, when the driver operates the brake pedal  and a pedal depression force is input to the brake pedal , the pedal depression force is transmitted to the brake booster  via the operating rod. Then, the pedal depression force transmitted to the brake booster  is boosted by the brake booster  at the predetermined boost ratio and transmitted to the master cylinder . The pedal depression force boosted by the brake booster  and transmitted to the master cylinder  is convert to the master cylinder pressure Pmc in the master cylinder  as well as transmitted to the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR via the brake actuator . At the time, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc, which is the brake hydraulic pressure supplied to the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, is adjusted to a predetermined hydraulic pressure by the brake actuator  and transmitted to the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR. The wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, the brake pads FL, FR, RL and RR, and the brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR, which constitute the respective hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR, are acted with a pressure brake force (pressure brake torque) by a friction force by that the respective wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR are acted with the predetermined wheel cylinder pressure Pwc and the brake pads FL, FR, RL and RR are pressed to the brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR, thereby rotations of the brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR are reduced. As a result, the rotations of the wheels can be reduced by reducing speeds of the brake rotors FL, FR, RL and RR.","During the period, the ECU  controls the master cut solenoid valves A and B, the hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, the pressure reduction solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, and the pressurizing pumps A and B of the brake actuator  to thereby adjust the pressurized pressure Pand adjust the wheel cylinder pressure (the brake hydraulic pressure) Pwc to the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR, and causes a predetermined pressure brake force to act on the wheels  and  so that the rotations of the wheels are reduced.","The ECU  calculates a target brake force which is a target brake force in response to the brake operation (brake request) of the brake pedal  of the driver based on, for example, the master cylinder pressure Pmc of the master cylinder  obtained in response to the brake depression amount (pedal stroke) accompanying with the operation of the brake pedal , and the like, controls the brake actuator  based on the target brake force, operates the hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR to realize the target brake force, and generates a predetermined brake force.","As described above, the ECU  controls the hydraulic braking device  so as to execute the hill start assist control including the brake force holding control by which, after a brake force is held when the vehicle  stops on a slope road and the like, holding of the brake force is released.","When the vehicle  stops on a slope road and the like, the ECU  controls the master cut solenoid valves A and B of the brake actuator  to the closed valve state based on a predetermined brake force holding control command, thereby holding the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc on the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR side from the master cut solenoid valves A and B to hold pressure of a predetermined value or more. Then, since the hydraulic braking device  holds the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc on the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR side from the master cut solenoid valves A and B as the hold pressure, the hydraulic braking device  can hold the brake forces applied to the respective wheels  and , respectively.","Here, the predetermined brake force holding control command is created when, for example, the vehicle  stops, that is, a vehicle speed of the vehicle  detected by the wheel speed sensors FL, FR, RL and RR is a preset predetermined speed or less, for example, 0 km\/h, OFF of the parking brake is detected by the parking brake switch , OFF of the accelerator operation, that is, the accelerator OFF is detected by the accelerator pedal sensor  as well as when a predetermined brake operation of the driver is detected, and the ECU  starts the brake force holding control for holding the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc to a predetermined hold pressure or more based on the brake force holding control command. Here, the predetermined brake operation of the driver corresponds to a predetermined switch operation by the driver to execute the brake force holding control. That is, the predetermined brake operation of the driver becomes the switch operation by the driver to execute the brake force holding control. The predetermined brake operations of the driver are various brake operations which can be discriminated from an ordinary brake operation as a request for starting the brake force holding control by the driver, for example, a brake operation in which the brake pedal  is depressed by the driver in an amount exceeding a predetermined amount, a brake operation in which, after the vehicle  stops by that the driver depresses the brake pedal , the brake pedal  is additionally depressed in an amount exceeding a predetermined set amount from the state, and the like. With the operation, the ECU  can start the brake force holding control (the hill start assist control) in response to the request of the driver. Note that the predetermined brake operation of the driver will be explained later in detail.","Then, the ECU  controls the master cut solenoid valves A and B of the brake actuator  to the open valve state based on a predetermined brake force hold releasing control command, thereby reducing the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc as a hold pressure on the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR side from the master cut solenoid valves A and B. Then, the hydraulic braking device  can release holding of the brake force applied to the respective wheels  and  by reducing the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc on the wheel cylinders FL, FR, RL and RR side from the master cut solenoid valves A and B. Note that when the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc is reduced by the master cut solenoid valves A and B, the brake oil is returned to the reservoir .","The predetermined brake force hold releasing control command is created when, for example, a predetermined time (for example, 2 seconds) has passed after OFF of a brake operation, that is, a brake OFF is detected by the master cylinder pressure sensor , when ON of the parking brake is detected by the parking brake switch , when an accelerator ON is detected by the accelerator pedal sensor , or when it is detected by the master cylinder pressure sensor  that the brake pedal  is additionally depressed by the driver again, and the like, and the ECU  starts a brake force hold releasing control for reducing the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc as the hold pressure based on the brake force hold releasing control command.","Note that, in the brake force holding control (the hill start assist control), the master cut solenoid valves A and B function as a hold unit of the present invention capable of holding the brake pressure as well as function also as a pressure reduction unit capable of reducing the held brake pressure. That is, in the braking device  of the embodiment, the master cut solenoid valves A and B act as the hold unit capable of holding the brake pressure and the pressure reduction unit capable of reducing the held brake pressure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1","25","4"],"sub":"P "},"First, at a time t, when the driver depresses the brake pedal  and a brake force requested by the driver is caused to act on the wheels  and  of the vehicle , the vehicle  stops at a time t by the brake force. At the time, it is assumed that both the parking brake operation and the accelerator operation are turned OFF. Then, when, at a time t, the predetermined brake operation of the driver to be described later is detected by that the driver additionally depresses the brake pedal  from the above state, the ECU  creates the brake force holding control command and starts the brake force holding control as the hill start assist control. That is, the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc is reduced together with the master cylinder pressure Pmc by that the driver releases the brake pedal , and, when the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc becomes a hold pressure corresponding to a brake force of a degree at which the vehicle  does not travel backward on a slope road at a time t, the ECU  starts holding of the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc at a hold pressure equal to or more than a predetermined value by controlling the master cut solenoid valves A and B of the brake actuator  to the closed valve state. At the time, as the brake pedal  is released and the brake operation is turned OFF, the master cylinder pressure Pmc is reduced as it is and becomes approximately 0 at a time t.","Note that when the ECU  detects the predetermined brake operation of the driver at the time t, creates the brake force holding control command, and starts the brake force holding control as the hill start assist control, the ECU  preferably informs the driver that the hill start assist control has been started by blinking ON and OFF, for example, a slip indicator lamp  (refer to ).","Then, when the driver depresses the accelerator pedal at, for example, a time t (refer to ) and the drive force requested by the driver is caused to act on the wheels  and  of the vehicle , the accelerator ON is detected by the accelerator pedal sensor , and the ECU  creates a brake force hold releasing control command and starts a brake force hold releasing control. That is, the ECU  starts a pressure reduction of the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc which has been held to a predetermined pressure or more by controlling the master cut solenoid valves A and B of the brake actuator  to the open valve state, thereby the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc is gradually reduced and becomes approximately 0 at a time t. As a result, since the vehicle  is prevented from traveling backward when, for example, the vehicle  starts on a slope road, the driver can smoothly start the vehicle .","Note that, as illustrated in the drawing, a brake pedal operation period T during which the brake pedal  is actually depressed by the driver and the brake is turned ON is the period from the time t to the time t. In contrast, a hill start assist control period T during which the hill start assist control is executed is the period from the time t to the time t. More specifically, a hold period T during which the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc is actually held at a predetermined hold pressure by the master cut solenoid valves A and B is the period from the time t to the time t, and a pressure reduction period (release period) T during which the wheel cylinder pressure Pwc, which is held at the predetermined hold pressure by the master cut solenoid valves A and B, is reduced, and the holding of the brake force is released is the period from the time t to the time t.","Incidentally, in the braking device , a dead point of the brake booster  is varied and the like by, for example, that a negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is varied in response to an operation state of the engine  and thus the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster  is varied, as a result, there is a possibility that the master cylinder pressure Pmc generated by the master cylinder  is also varied in response to an increased pedal depression force. The dead point of the brake booster  is an operation point of the hydraulic braking device  at which an effect of increasing the pedal depression force making use of the negative pressure in the brake booster  disappears.","Then, when the braking device  is configured such that, for example, the ECU  sets a predetermined control start determination hydraulic pressure to the master cylinder pressure Pmc, and when the master cylinder pressure Pmc exceeds the control start determination hydraulic pressure, the ECU  detects the predetermined brake operation (predetermined switch operation) of the driver, creates a brake force holding control command and starts a brake force holding control as the hill start assist control, there is a possibility that a dispersion is generated in a start of control for holding the brake force by that, for example, the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is varied in response to the operation state of the engine  as described above and the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster  is varied.","That is, in the case, in the braking device , since, for example, the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is varied in response to the operation state of the engine  and the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster  is varied, there is a possibility that the pedal depression force from the driver to the brake pedal , which is necessary to execute the control for increasing the master cylinder pressure Pmc to the control start determination hydraulic pressure and holding the brake force, is varied.","That is, in the braking device , in a state, for example, that the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is relatively large, since the pedal depression force by an increase in the brake booster  becomes relatively large, the pedal depression force to the brake pedal  by the driver which is necessary to increase the master cylinder pressure Pmc to the control start determination hydraulic pressure becomes relatively small. In contrast, in the braking device , in a state, for example, that the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is relatively small, since an increase in the pedal depression force by the brake booster  becomes relatively small, in order to increase the master cylinder pressure Pmc to the control start determination hydraulic pressure, there is a possibility that a relatively large pedal depression force to the brake pedal  by the driver becomes necessary.","In other words, in the braking device , even if the pedal depression force input to the brake pedal  from the driver is the same, since, for example, the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is varied in response to the operation state of the engine  and the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster  is varied, there is a possibility that a dispersion is generated in the start of control for holding the brake force because a case that the master cylinder pressure Pmc has reached the control start determination hydraulic pressure and the control for holding the brake force is started, a case that the master cylinder pressure Pmc does not reach the control start determination hydraulic pressure and the control for holding the brake force is not started, and the like occur.","Thus, the ECU  as the control device of the braking device  of the embodiment executes the brake force holding control for holding the brake force generated to the wheels  and  of the vehicle  by the hydraulic braking device  to a predetermined value or more based on a change amount per unit time of the master cylinder pressure Pmc as the operation amount of the brake pedal , thereby appropriately executing the holding of the brake force regardless of various operation states such as the state of the negative pressure supplied from the engine  to the brake booster  and the like.","Specifically, as illustrated in , in the braking device , function-conceptually, a master cut solenoid valve control unit , a hold solenoid valve control unit , a pressure reduction solenoid valve control unit , a pump drive control unit , a brake force holding control unit  are disposed to the ECU .","Here, the ECU  is mainly composed of the microcomputer and has a processing unit , a storage unit  and an input\/output unit  which are connected to each other so as to deliver signals therebetween.

In contrast, the brake force holding control unit  calculates a value corresponding to an actual workload in response to the operation of the brake pedal  by the driver. Then, after permission conditions other than the detection of the predetermined brake operation of the driver explained above have been satisfied, that is, after the vehicle speed of the vehicle  has become 0 km\/h, the OFF of the parking brake has been detected by the parking brake switch , and the OFF of the accelerator has been detected, when the value corresponding to the actual workload exceeds the value corresponding to the control determination workload, the brake force holding control unit  permits an execution of the brake force holding control and creates the brake force holding control command.","Specifically, as illustrated in , the brake force holding control unit  is function-conceptually configured by including, for example, a setting unit , a change amount calculating unit , a control determination value calculating unit , an actual value calculating unit , and a comparison determining unit ","A permission determination of the brake force holding control in the ECU  according to the embodiment below will be explained below referring to the time charts of  and . In , a horizontal axis shows a time axis (t) and a vertical axis shows the master cylinder pressure (Pmc).","The setting unit is a setting means for setting a stop-time master cylinder pressure (a stop-time hydraulic pressure) P as a stop-time operation amount, a control start determination reference master cylinder pressure (a control start determination reference hydraulic pressure) P as a first control start determination operation amount and a control start determination master cylinder pressure (a control start determination hydraulic pressure) P as a second control start determination operation amount.","The stop-time master cylinder pressure P set by the setting unit is the master cylinder pressure Pmc (a value corresponding to the operation amount of the brake pedal  by the driver) detected by the master cylinder pressure sensor  and is the master cylinder pressure Pmc (for example, in an example of , a master cylinder pressure at the time t) when the vehicle  stops. That is, the setting unit sets the master cylinder pressure Pmc when the depression operation of the brake pedal  has been executed by the driver, the vehicle speed of the vehicle  has become 0 km\/h, and the vehicle  has completely stopped, to the stop-time master cylinder pressure P. The setting unit sets the stop-time master cylinder pressure P based on the master cylinder pressure Pmc detected by the master cylinder pressure sensor . The setting unit preferably sets the master cylinder pressure Pmc when, for example, the state that the vehicle speed of the vehicle  is 0 km\/h continues for a predetermined time (for example, several seconds), to the stop-time master cylinder pressure P.","The control start determination reference master cylinder pressure P set by the setting unit is the master cylinder pressure Pmc which acts as a reference of a permission determination of the hill start assist control including the brake force holding control. The control start determination reference master cylinder pressure P is the master cylinder pressure Pmc obtained by adding a set hydraulic pressure (for example, a hydraulic pressure corresponding to a pedal depression force of about 25 N) as a predetermined set amount to the stop-time master cylinder pressure P.

The setting unit calculates the master cylinder pressure Pmc obtained by adding the set hydraulic pressure to the stop-time master cylinder pressure P and sets the master cylinder pressure Pmc to the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure P.","The control start determination master cylinder pressure P set by the setting unit is the master cylinder pressure Pmc used for the permission determination of the hill start assist control including the brake force holding control and is the master cylinder pressure Pmc different from the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure P. The control start determination master cylinder pressure P is a determination value for detecting the additional depression of the brake pedal  in a predetermined amount from the stop state of the vehicle  and is a determination value set in response to, for example, a gradient and the like of a road surface on which the vehicle  stops. The setting unit sets the control start determination master cylinder pressure P based on, for example, a road surface gradient detected by the tilt angle sensor  and accelerations of the vehicle  in the front\/rear directions detected by the front\/rear acceleration sensor .","The change amount calculating unit calculates a master cylinder pressure change amount (a master cylinder pressure change speed) \u0394P which is the change amount per unit time of the master cylinder pressure Pmc.

calculated when the master cylinder pressure is changed by the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value after the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, the actual integration value S in response to the integration value of the actual master cylinder pressure after the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure is calculated, and the brake force holding control is executed when the actual integration value S has exceeded the control determination integration value S.","Accordingly, since the braking device  and the ECU  use the actual integration value S as the value in response to the actual workload, use the control determination integration value S as the value in response to the control determination workload, and execute the brake force holding control when the actual integration value S has exceeded the control determination integration value S, the braking device  and the ECU  can reliably detect the depression operation of the brake pedal  by the driver as the predetermined switch operation by the driver for executing the brake force holding control and can reliably execute the brake force holding control.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, when the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value is larger than the preset change amount guard value, the calculation of the control determination integration value S and the calculation of the actual integration value S are executed, and when the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value is equal to or less than the change amount guard value, the calculation of the control determination integration value S and the calculation of the actual integration value S are not executed. Accordingly, when, for example, the depression speed of the brake pedal  by the driver is relatively small although the actual master cylinder pressure P has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, that is, when it can be assumed that the driver does not make the start request of the brake force holding control, since the braking device  and the ECU  do not execute the calculation of the control determination integration value S and the calculation of the actual integration value S and do not execute the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S, the unnecessary calculation can be suppressed and the calculation amount in the ECU  can be suppressed.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, when the actual master cylinder pressure change amount has exceeded the change amount guard value from a state in which the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value is equal to or less than the change amount guard value, the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value is updated to the present master cylinder pressure change amount, when the master cylinder pressure is changed from the present master cylinder pressure by the updated master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value, the control determination integration value S is calculated in response to the integration value of the master cylinder pressure until the control start determination master cylinder pressure has been reached and the actual integration value S in response to the integration value of the actual master cylinder pressure after the actual master cylinder pressure change amount has exceeded the change amount guard value is calculated, and when the actual integration value S has exceeded the control determination integration value S, the brake force holding control is executed. Accordingly, even when the driver executes the depression operation of the brake pedal  (additional depression operation) again from a state in which the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S is not performed because the depression speed of the brake pedal  by the driver is relatively small although the actual master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, the braking device  and the ECU  can appropriately execute the brake force holding control.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, when the elapsed time after the actual master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure becomes equal to or more than the preset restriction time, the calculation of the actual integration value S is stopped and the actual integration value S is reset. Accordingly, although the actual master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure and the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S in response to the workload to the brake pedal  is started, when the depression amount of the brake pedal  by the driver does not become larger than the predetermined value thereafter and the elapsed time becomes equal to or more than restriction time, that is, when it can be assumed that the driver does not make the start request of the brake force holding control, since the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S is not executed, the braking device  and the ECU  can suppress the unnecessary calculation and can suppress the calculation amount in the ECU .","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, when the actual master cylinder pressure change amount is equal to or less than the preset change amount lower limit value, the calculation of the actual integration value S is stopped and the actual integration value S is reset. Accordingly, although the actual master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure and the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S in response to the workload to the brake pedal  is started, when the depression amount of the brake pedal  by the driver does not become larger than the predetermined value thereafter and the actual master cylinder pressure change amount becomes equal to or less than the change amount lower limit value, that is, when it can be assumed that the driver does not make the start request of the brake force holding control, since the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S is not executed, the braking device  and the ECU  can suppress the unnecessary calculation and can suppress the calculation amount in the ECU .","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, after the actual integration value S has been reset, when the actual master cylinder pressure change amount has exceeded the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value in a state in which the actual master cylinder pressure is larger than the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value is updated to the present master cylinder pressure change amount, when the master cylinder pressure is changed by the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value updated from the present master cylinder pressure, the control determination integration value S is calculated in response to the integration value of the master cylinder pressure until the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, and the actual integration value S in response to the integration value of the actual master cylinder pressure after the actual master cylinder pressure change amount has exceeded the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value before update is calculated, and when the actual integration value S has exceeded the control determination integration value 1, the brake force holding control is executed.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, after the actual integration value S has been reset, when the actual master cylinder pressure has exceeded the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure again from a state in which the actual master cylinder pressure is equal to or less than the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, the master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value is updated to the maximum master cylinder pressure change amount during the period in which the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure again after the master cylinder pressure change amount or the actual integration value S is reset when the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure again, the control determination integration value S is calculated in response to the integration value of the master cylinder pressure until the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination master cylinder pressure when master cylinder pressure is changed by the updated master cylinder pressure change amount for calculating the control determination value after the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure again, the actual integration value S in response to the integration value of the actual master cylinder pressure after the master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure again is calculated, and when the actual integration value S has exceeded the control determination integration value S, the brake force holding control is executed.","Accordingly, even when the driver executes the depression operation of the brake pedal  (additional depression operation) again from a state in which the calculation of the actual integration value S is stopped and reset and the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the actual integration value S is not executed, although the actual master cylinder pressure has reached the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure and the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S in response to the workload to the brake pedal  has been started, the braking device  and the ECU  can appropriately execute the brake force holding control.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, when the actual master cylinder pressure has exceeded the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure as well as the actual master cylinder pressure has exceeded the control start determination master cylinder pressure, or the actual master cylinder pressure has exceeded the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure as well as the actual integration value S has exceeded the control determination integration value S at the time the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure is smaller than the control start determination master cylinder pressure, the brake force holding control is executed. Accordingly, since the braking device  and the ECU  perform the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control by combining the determination using the magnitude itself of the master cylinder pressure corresponding to the operation amount of the brake pedal  and the determination using the control determination integration value S and the actual integration value S in response to the workload to the brake pedal , the braking device  and the ECU  can reliably detect the predetermined brake operation of the driver, that is, the depression operation of the brake pedal  by the driver can reliably be detected and the brake force holding control can more reliably and appropriately be executed.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, when the actual master cylinder pressure has exceeded the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure at the time the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure is equal to or more than the control start determination master cylinder pressure, the brake force holding control is executed. Accordingly, even when the stop-time master cylinder pressure at the time the vehicle  stops by that the driver strongly depresses the brake pedal  becomes relatively high and the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure is set equal to or more than the control start determination master cylinder pressure, when the actual master cylinder pressure has exceeded the control start determination reference master cylinder pressure, the predetermined brake operation as the start request of the brake force holding control by the driver can be detected and the brake force holding control can appropriately be executed.","Further, according to the braking device  and the ECU  according to the embodiment of the present invention explained above, the hydraulic braking device  includes the brake booster  capable of increasing the pedal depression force as the operation force in response to the operation of the brake pedal  using the negative pressure supplied from the suction passage of the engine , the master cylinder  for applying the master cylinder pressure as the operation pressure to the brake oil in response to the pedal depression force, the hydraulic brake units FL, FR, RL and RR for generating the brake force by being acted with the wheel cylinder pressure which is the brake pressure based on the master cylinder pressure, and the master cut solenoid valves A and B capable of holding the wheel cylinder pressure and uses the master cylinder pressure as the operation amount of the brake pedal . Accordingly, even when the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster  is varied in response to the operation state of the engine  and the pedal depression force increased by the brake booster  is varied, since the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control is performed based on the master cylinder pressure change amount which is the change amount per unit time of the master cylinder pressure corresponding to at least the operation amount of the brake pedal , the holding of the brake force can be appropriately executed by detecting, for example, the negative pressure supplied to the brake booster , and the like, but without detecting the variation of the dead point of the brake booster  and the like, and thus a dispersion generated in feeling of the start operation of the brake force holding control by the driver can be suppressed.","Note that the control device of the braking device and the braking device according to the embodiment of the present invention described above are not limited to the embodiment described above and can be variously modified within the scope described in the claims.","According to the explanation described above, although it is explained that the hold unit of the present invention capable of holding the brake pressure in the brake force holding control is composed of the master cut solenoid valves A and B and the means feasible in executing the control for holding the brake force by the braking device main body based on the operation of the brake operation member is composed of the master cut solenoid valve control unit , the embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, the hold unit of the present invention capable of holding the brake pressure in the brake force holding control may be composed of the hold solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, the pressure reduction unit capable of reducing the brake pressure held by the hold unit may be composed of the pressure reduction solenoid valves FL, FR, RL and RR, the means feasible in executing the control for holding the brake force by the braking device main body based on the operation of the brake operation member may be composed of the hold solenoid valve control unit , and the means feasible in executing the control for releasing the holding of the brake force by the braking device main body may be composed of the pressure reduction solenoid valve control unit .","Further, according to the explanation described above, although it is explained that the operation amount of the brake operation member uses the master cylinder pressure as the operation pressure applied to the working fluid by the master cylinder  as the operation pressure applying unit, the embodiment is not limited thereto, and, for example, the brake depression amount (pedal stroke) of the brake pedal  as the brake operation member may be used. In the case, the change amount per unit time of the brake depression amount (pedal stroke) may be used for the change amount per unit time of the operation amount of the brake operation member. Further in the case, it is sufficient to dispose a brake pedal sensor in the vicinity of, for example, the brake pedal  as a means for detecting the brake depression amount (pedal stroke) of the brake pedal .","Further, according to the explanation described above, although it is explained that, in the braking device main body, the brake booster unit increases the operation force in response to the operation of the brake operation member using the negative pressure supplied from the suction passage of the internal combustion engine, the embodiment is not limited thereto and further a configuration which does not include the brake booster unit may be employed.","Further, according to the explanation described above, although it is explained that the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control is performed by combining the determination using the magnitude itself of the operation amount of the brake operation member and the determination using the change amount per unit time of the operation amount of the brake operation member, the embodiment is not limited thereto, and the permission determination of execution of the brake force holding control may be performed only by the determination using the change amount per unit time of the operation amount of the brake operation member.","As described above, the control device of the braking device and the braking device according to the present invention can appropriately execute the holding of the brake force and is preferably applicable for use in various control devices of braking devices and the various braking devices which generate a brake force to vehicle wheels by that a brake operation member is operated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0253"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Reference
