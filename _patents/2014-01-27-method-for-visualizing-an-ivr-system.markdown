title: Method for visualizing an IVR system
abstract: The invention is a method of creating a dialstring for use with mobile smartphones and other computer-enabled telephones. A software app designed to implement the method recognizes input from the user (such as the initial digits of a phone number) that identifies the organization to be called, and accesses a stored representation of the IVR phone tree for that organization. The app then presents a graphical representation of all or part of the phone tree on the display of the telephone. The user can then respond to the graphical representation by providing selective inputs that cause the app to synthesize all or part of the dialstring needed to navigate the phone tree to the desired destination. Once a dialing option has been synthesized to the user's satisfaction, the user may provide additional input that the system interprets as an instruction to open a phone call and dial the synthesized number.

Limitations"],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/840,190, filed on Jun. 27, 2013, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to making phone calls, and more specifically, provides a method for pre-programming a dialing sequence, or dialstring, to allow more rapid connection to the desired destination at an organization or company employing an interactive voice response (IVR) system. The method, typically implemented in software as a application (or \u201capp\u201d) on a smartphone with a touchscreen display, recognizes the intention of the user to make a call to an organization from user inputs, and responds by presenting a graphical representation of all or part of the destination IVR phone tree on the display of the user's device. The user can then select the desired destination in the IVR tree through interaction with the display. Once selected, the method then creates a dialing sequence that is then dialed upon appropriate user input. In some embodiments, the dialing sequence is created after the user selects a single input from the display. In some embodiments, the dialing sequence is built up through multiple interactions with the system through the display.","Since the 1960s, automated interactive voice response (IVR) systems have been developed and are now widely employed by organizations and companies to direct calls coming in to the organization. The typical IVR system plays a pre-programmed greeting that presents options to the user, such as \u201cWelcome to Conglomorate Industries. Press or say 1 for customer service, 2 for technical support,\u201d . . . etc., and then waits for a response from the user. User input can be provided from entering a number on the phone, which triggers the generation of a touch tone (dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling) signal, or by speaking the response. The IVR system then attempts to recognize the input, and switch the call to the designated destination.","Often, the destination will again have a pre-programmed IVR response, such as \u201cWelcome to Conglomorate customer service. Press or say 1 for computer products, 2 for telephone products, . . . \u201d etc. and the user again must enter or say an option. This third destination may yet again have a pre-recorded IVR response, which may even lead to a fourth destination with a pre-programmed IVR response.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sup":["st ","nd ","nd ","rd ","rd ","th "]},"When a caller wishes to interact with the USCIS, the caller would typically dial 1-800-375-5283, wait for the reply, then press 1 (or 2), then wait for a reply, then press the next response, etc.","When an IVR system works well, it can direct the caller quickly to the destination desired, while saving costs for companies and organizations by allowing them to employ fewer human operators while still \u201chandling\u201d large call volumes. IVR systems are now a business service sector with revenues of almost $2B annually, and several companies provide software and services to run and manage IVR systems, including: Avaya of Santa Clara, Calif.<http:\/\/www.avaya.com\/usa\/>, Cicso Systems of San Jose, Calif. <http:\/\/www.cisco.com\/en\/US\/products\/sw\/custcosw\/ps3651\/>, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories of Daly City, Calif.<http:\/\/www.genesyslab.com\/>, Nuance Communications of Burlington, Mass. <http:\/\/www.nuance.com\/index.htm >, Verint of Melville, N.Y. <http:\/\/www.verint.com\/>, and Voxeo products <http:\/\/voxeo.com\/> offered by Aspect Software Group of Chelmsford, Mass.","Unfortunately, complex IVR systems can often lead to time wasted by the user trying to navigate the tree to find the answer to a simple question. This often leads to frustration on the part of the user. Users may have inadvertently pressed the wrong key on the phone keypad, finding themselves at a destination they did not want or even recognize, with no option to go \u201cback\u201d in the tree to try again. Or, the IVR system may have misunderstand a voice response, due to a noisy phone connection, a user's unexpected accent or use of unusual phrasing (such as saying \u201cSure\u201d or \u201cOK\u201d instead of \u201cYes\u201d) or simply poor voice recognition algorithms. In such a situation, the IVR system has again directed the user to a destination that is unknown or unwanted. The IVR system may also be giving instructions in a language that is not well understood by the caller\u2014the caller may wish to contact a company or agency about a topic that they are able to competently discuss, but must listen to often long descriptions of topics they may not understood and therefore find additionally confusing.","Some IVR systems have grown more sophisticated, becoming more capable of recognizing the wide variation possible in user input. However, problems remain, deterring users who have had bad experiences with an organization's IVR system. Online directories, such as provided by Gethuman.com <http:\/\/gethuman.com\/> or Whatis.com <http:\/\/whatis.techtarget.com\/reference\/Bypass-IVRS-Talk-to-a-real-person-cheatsheet> have appeared to help users bypass IVR systems altogether.","Although some companies may \u201chide\u201d behind confusing IVR phone trees to avoid dealing with dissatisfied customers, many organizations deploying IVR systems, such as government agencies, legitimately want to provide service to as many callers as possible, but have budget limitations on the number of employees or call centers they can pay to answer phones. There is therefore a need for a system that can help guide users through the phone trees of an IVR system quickly and efficiently.","The invention presented here is a system for use with telephones having a visual display, such as mobile smartphones. The system recognizes an input from the user (such as the input of the beginning of a phone number) that identifies the organization to be called, and accesses a stored representation of the phone tree for that organization. This representation of the phone tree may be stored locally, or remotely in an online server. The system then presents a graphical representation of all or part of the phone tree on the display of the telephone. The user can then respond to the graphical representation by providing selective input that triggers the system to synthesize all or part of the dialing sequence needed to navigate the phone tree to the desired destination. Once a dialing option has been completely synthesized to the user's satisfaction, the user may provide additional input that the system then interprets as an instruction to open a phone call and dial the synthesized number.","What follow are detailed descriptions of embodiments of the invention, including the best mode contemplated by the inventors at this time. It will be recognized that these embodiments are generally implemented as software code written in languages such as C, Objective C, C++, Java or C# and executed on \u201csmartphones\u201d using operating systems such as iOS\u00ae and its variations for Apple products, various versions of the Android\u00ae operating system distributed by Google Inc., or Windows\u00ae Phone OS distributed by Microsoft Corp. Other smartphone operating systems, such as Symbian, Blackberry OS, QNX, Blackberry10, etc. will be known to those skilled in the art.","Although embodiments of this invention may be implemented on any electronic data processing system with an interface to a telephone network, typical embodiments will be implemented on a \u201csmartphone\u201d. A block diagram of the components of a typical smartphone  upon which the invention may be implemented is illustrated in . Such a smartphone  will typically include a processor  such as a microprocessor or other central processing unit (CPU), such as a system-on-chip (SoC) manufactured according to the ARM processor architecture designed by ARM Holdings plc of Cambridge, UK, or the Snapdragon S4 architecture from Qualcomm, Inc. of San Diego, Calif. The processor may be single core, or have multiple cores, and may be paired with additional graphics processing units (GPUs), such as a Mali GPU design from ARM Holdings plc, Adreno chips from Qualcomm, Inc. of San Diego, Calif., or Tegra chips provided by Nvidia Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif.","The processor  will coordinate electronic signals to and from a built-in transceiver , which transmits and receives radio frequency (RF) signals to and from remote transceivers via one or more antennas . The transceiver  will typically comprise both one or more RF transmitters  and one or more RF receivers  as well as a modulator\/demodulator (or modem)  that converts analog RF signals into digital signals for use within the phone, as well as converting internal digital signals into RF broadcast signals. The RF signals transmitted between the smartphone  and a remote transceiver may also comprise both traffic and control signals (e.g., paging signals\/messages for incoming calls), which are used to establish and maintain communication with another party or destination.","Within the smartphone , the processor  can coordinate electronic signals from a number of sources, which will typically include internal memory , often comprising transient random access memory (e.g. dynamic random access memory, or DRAM), and may also include various internal data storage devices , which are typically may be read\/write media, or may be non-transient computer readable media, and which may comprise flash memory devices, removable subscriber identity module (SIM) cards, microSIM cards, nanoSIM cards and the like.","The storage devices  may include a general purpose storage that is used to store both program instructions for the processor , such as the smartphone operating system (OS) , as well as the program instructions for one or more program products, or applications (\u201capps\u201d)  that may be executed using the processor . Aside from these programs, data, such as audio data, video data, configuration data, and\/or other data or databases that may be accessed and\/or used by the apps  and processor  may be stored as well. The storage devices  may include a nonvolatile read\/write memory, a read-only memory (ROM) and\/or volatile read\/write memory. Various application programming interfaces (APIs) may be used to specify how various software components should interact with each other and with the data stored in the storage devices .","In some embodiments of the invention, the storage devices  may have stored therein an electronic database representing various IVR phone trees , such as the phone tree illustrated in . In some embodiments of the invention, the storage devices  may have stored therein an electronic representation of a Dialer Field  which stores data related to a dialstring the user synthesizes for the purpose of making a phone call. In some embodiments of the invention, the storage devices  may have stored therein an electronic database representing an address book  with contact information defined by name and address, such as telephone numbers, email addresses and so on. The name used for items in the contact book need not be real names of persons, but may be any combination of identifying characters.","Furthermore, the storage devices  may include \u201ctemporary\u201d data storage for a database of unsaved numbers. This \u201ctemporary\u201d data storage may be used for storing call lists, such as telephone numbers of received or missed calls from remote parties. The storage devices  may be considered \u201ctemporary\u201d in the sense that unsaved numbers are automatically deleted after a predetermined time period counted in days, weeks or months. Alternatively, the temporary data storage may hold only a limited number of positions, working on a first-in\/first-out basis. In this case, the storage devices  is \u201ctemporary\u201d in the sense that an unsaved number is pushed step-by-step through the list by subsequently received calls until it is pushed out of the list.","The processor  will also coordinate electronic signals from a number of input devices, such as: one or more microphones , various input buttons  (e.g. for controlling sound volume), a \u201chome\u201d button , one or more cameras , or other inputs  such as proximity sensors, ambient light sensors, and the like. The processor  may also coordinate electronic signals from built-in devices  such as an accelerometer, magnetometer, GPS sensor, or gyroscopic sensor and the like.","The processor  will also coordinate electronic signals to a number of output devices, such as: one or more speakers , or various other output devices . A variety of other input  and outputs  can be coordinated through a docking connector, audio jacks, or other output connections.","In a typical smartphone , the processor  will also coordinate electronic signals to and from a touchscreen . The touchscreen  is typically a flat device comprising both a display  having an array of either illuminated liquid crystal elements or light emitting diodes (LEDs) to display information, and an array of built-in touch sensors  that may sense electrical conductivity of a finger, or sense pressure on the device through changes in electrical capacitance. When the software operating on the smartphone  displays various images, fields, and graphics on different portion of the display , various corresponding inputs from the sensors  provided by the user can be generated by touching the corresponding portions of the display. The app and operating system software interpret the pressure and\/or temperature and\/or conductivity at different points of the screen differently, which allows, for example, the virtual \u201cpressing of a button\u201d when the user touches the image of a \u201cbutton\u201d on a screen, or the use of a pinching motion by two fingers to virtually \u201czoom-in\u201d (or the opposite motion to \u201czoom-out\u201d) a displayed image.","Software code written for smartphones is often packaged as a dedicated application, or \u201capp\u201d . The smartphone operating system will allow the display of a graphical icon, stored typically as a 57\u00d757 pixel PNG file, on the touchscreen display, and when the position on the screen where the icon is displayed is touched (or, depending on the smartphone and the operating system, pressed and held under pressure for a predetermined time), the signal generated is interpreted as an instruction to launch the software program associated with the icon. Various apps may additionally provide a virtual \u201cbutton\u201d on the display labeled \u201cclose\u201d that the user can press and hold to stop the execution of the app and return to the smartphone's home screen.","The smartphone operating system generally provides the code for instructions that, among other things, interpret the signal strength and duration of a touch on the screen into instructions for executing various portions of stored code. The instruction code for apps must generally conform to the standards for the operating system under which they were written. One standard for the iPhone produced by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., is the \u201ciOS App Programming Guide\u201d (Apple Inc. Oct. 23, 2013) <https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/iPhone\/Conceptual\/iPhoneOSProgranuningGuide\/iPhoneAppProgramrningGuide.pdf>. Others will be available for other smartphone operating systems, such as Android, Microsoft Windows OS, etc. and will be known to those skilled in the art.","Typical embodiments of the method disclosed with this application can be implemented by means of software code designed to run on a smartphone . The smartphone may execute instructions encoded in the software that use the various built-in functions available to smartphones, such as dialing a phone number, or accessing data stored in the Internet through a Wi-Fi or some other data connection, such as those typically provided by the smartphone's data carrier. The software code comprising the instructions for executing the method of the invention may typically be stored on local non-transient memory storage  within the smartphone , such as a flash memory storage device. When descriptions of the method herein are provided, such as \u201cthe user presses a button\u201d, or \u201cthe user presses and holds the key\u201d, they are to be typically understood as the pressing of virtual \u201cbuttons\u201d as displayed on the smartphone touchscreen, as managed through the non-transient stored code of the app and the operating system, and do not represent real physical \u201cbuttons\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","100"]},"The smartphone  may comprise an outer casing , one or more cameras , one or more microphones -A and -B, a speaker , various physical buttons  for controls such as audio volume adjustment, a home button  for controlling the functions of the phone (turning the phone on or off, answering the phone, reverting to the home screen, etc.) one or more cameras , and a touchscreen display . A docking connection  may also be provided to allow external inputs  and outputs , as previously described, to be connected.","For most smartphone operating systems, there is typically a portion  of the touchscreen display  reserved for displaying items dictated by the phone operating system no matter which app is running, and this portion  is used to display items such as the time of day, phone signal strength, remaining battery life, etc. Other portions of the touchscreen display  can be designated to display various icons , each representing a stored software program which can be executed by the phone. The graphical file for the icon, typically a file in a portable network graphics format (also known as a .PNG file) will typically be governed by the smartphone operating system, and will be stored on the storage devices  such as flash memory built into the smartphone . Certain portions  of the display  may be designated to display specific, commonly used icons, while other portions may be more generally used.","In some embodiments of the invention, the software or \u201capp\u201d implementing the methods of the invention will also have an icon . The execution of this software code can be initiated by the user touching the smartphone touchscreen at the position the icon  is displayed, effectively pressing the \u201cbutton\u201d for the app to launch the program it represents.","For the methods of the invention, there are several embodiments that may be designed, depending on the structure and detail present in the phone tree. For a phone tree such as the USCIS phone tree of Table I and , the IVR options can be quite detailed and do not lend themselves to representation as simple single \u201cbuttons\u201d on a phone display. Instead, an embodiment of the method illustrated in  may be used to provide visual navigation through the phone tree.","Table I (presented in 9 parts) presents an example for a phone tree for a government agency, in this case the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). This phone tree has several tiers of responses available to the user, in both English and Spanish.  presents these same tiers of options for the USCIS Phone tree of Table I in a graphical illustration.","In the Top Tier 001, the direct dial phone number is represented. This usually comprises a country code (in the case of the US, the single digit \u201c1\u201d), followed by a 3 digit Area Code (in this case, the toll free indicator \u201c800\u201d), a 3-digit prefix (in this case, \u201c375\u201d) and a 4-digit number (in this case, \u201c5283\u201d).","In the 1Tier 011, the first set of options presented to the caller is presented. In the case of the USCIS, The 1Tier choices for the user allow the selection of language with English or Spanish as options.","In the 2Tier 021, the further options provided when one of the 1Tier options is selected are listed. In this case, seven options are provided: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. The same numerical options are provided for English and Spanish. This Tier is the one generally referred to in this phone tree as the \u201cMain Menu\u201d.","In the 3Tier 031, the further options provided when one of the 2Tier options is selected are listed. The number of choices varies, depending on the 2Tier selection made. If \u201c0\u201d is selected as the 2Tier option, the only 3Tier options are 1 and 9. If \u201c1\u201d is selected as the 2Tier option, the 3rd Tier options are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9. Note that a subset 037 of the 3Tier options will be uniform options no matter what 2Tier option has been selected: \u201c7\u201d will cause the immediate 3Tier message to be repeated, and \u201c9\u201d returns to the Main Menu (in this case, to the 2Tier 021).","In the 4Tier 041, the further options provided when one of the 3Tier options is selected are listed. The number of choices varies, depending on the 3Tier selection made. If \u201c5\u201d is selected as the 3Tier option after selecting \u201c1\u201d as the 2Tier option, the only 4Tier options are 1, 7, 8 and 9. If \u201c2\u201d is selected as the 3Tier option after selecting \u201c2\u201d as the 2nd Tier option, the 4Tier options are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"USCIS Phone Tree"},{"entry":"USCIS Top Tier: 1-800-375-5283"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1Tier","2Tier","3Tier","4Tier"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"1.

This typically involves loading the program steps into active memory , and their execution by the processor  built into the smartphone .","The next step  will typically be a display on the touchscreen  of a confirmation to the user that indicates that the app has launched (often simply the display of a logo, or a larger version of the icon). This step may optionally provide a \u201cbutton\u201d for selecting an option that invokes a list of previously dialed or constructed calls, as well as an option to proceed with the keypad for the IVR dialer.","If the user elects to proceed to the dialer, in the next step , an active input screen is displayed with a keypad and a display field for the user to begin making entries. An example of such a display screen is illustrated in . In this illustration, a portion of the touchscreen display  represents a keypad  consisting of twelve \u201cbuttons\u201d , which correspond to a typical touchtone phone entry device, comprising the digits 0 through 9 and the \u201cStar\u201d * and \u201cPound\u201d # keys. The upper part of the touchscreen display  comprises a portion of the display  designated to display the input from the user, and may additionally comprise a cursor  that may turn off and on, or \u201cblink\u201d, as a prompt to indicate readiness for input.","Below the keypad , the touchscreen display  may additionally comprise an alphanumeric \u201cbutton\u201d  to switch to optional alphanumeric input mode (which would in turn typically have a corresponding numeric indicator \u201cbutton\u201d to switch back to numeric input), a \u201cBack\u201d button  to undo the user's immediate input, and an \u201cOK\u201d button  that may load the input into the Dialer Field once the user is done.","Returning to , The next step  comprises accepting data input  from the user. The screen displayed in this mode is illustrated in . The input will typically be the entry of digits, such as 8 . . . 0 . . . 0 . . . 3 . . . 7 . . . 5 . . . selected by pressing some of the \u201cbuttons\u201d  with a finger . The input portion  of the touchscreen display  may show the data previously entered, with the cursor  underscoring the character being currently entered. Alternatively, if the Text Entry \u201cbutton\u201d  has been pressed, the entry characters may be a text entry, such as \u201cUSCIS\u201d, which may be entered using a virtual keyboard or other text entry method that are often built into the operating system of the smartphone , and may be well known to those skilled in the art.","Returning to , the next step  compares the user input to the phone tree data stored in the IVR database  available to the app. This IVR database  will typically comprise a number of phone tree data entries, such as the tree illustrated in  and Table I, as well as metadata about the tree, such as the name of the agency or company whose tree is being represented. The IVR database may be written with any prior art database storage techniques, such as SQLite, SQL CE, HanDBase, Filemaker Go, Filemaker Bento, DriodDB, Java DB, eSQL etc. and can be accessed using standard database query languages such as SQL.","The comparison step  may execute automatically, with comparisons being made any time data is entered by the user. Alternatively, the software may be designed to make a comparison only once the \u201cOK\u201d \u201cbutton\u201d  has been pressed, or some other user indication of readiness to query the phone tree is entered. The comparison step  may make a comparison of entered numeric digits to the digits of the phone tree (for example, recognizing an entry of 8 0 0 3 7 5 . . . as possibly corresponding to the USCIS phone number 1-800-375-5283, or may recognize a keypad entry of U S C I . . . as corresponding to the USCIS phone number 1-800-375-5283.","If the comparison step  does not find a match with an element in the IVR database  during a predetermined time period, several options are possible. In some embodiments, if the input is not matched, the software can simply wait until further input is provided until a match is found. However, in other embodiments, the system may employ a time evaluation step  set for a predetermined time (for example, for 5 seconds) after which, if there is no match found by the comparison step , the next step  may be a display of a \u201cNo Match\u201d message (optionally implemented as a temporary pop-up screen), and a return to a blank keypad entry screen as in step  (and as was illustrated in ). If, on the other hand, the time evaluation step  detects additional user input  in the predetermined time, the system returns to the input step  to accept the input, and again makes a comparison  with the IVR database , either automatically or as triggered by the user.","In this embodiment, if the comparison step  identifies at least one match for the input data  with one or more entries in the IVR database , the next step  is a display of the matching options to the user. It should be noted that for a given entry, for example, 8 . . . 0 . . . 0, many phone trees may be available and displayed, and only further entry of the next digits 3 7 5 . . . will further narrow the options displayed from the IVR database . In some embodiments, the user may designate a setting within the software so that identified matching entries are only displayed after a certain number of digits (for example, 6 or 7 digits) have been entered.","An example of a screen display corresponding to this step  is illustrated in . In this illustration, the six digits 8 0 0 3 7 5 have been entered by the user, and are displayed in the upper portion  of the touchscreen display , with the cursor  under the most recently entered digit. In this example, it is assumed that the system finds three matching phone trees stored in the IVR database  that correspond to these initial 6 digits. These are displayed as distinct fields  in the display , one for each of the matching IVR database entries. The fields may be simple text and numbers, or may also include various images, thumbnail files or corporate logos in the display. Each field  represents a virtual \u201cbutton\u201d that can be pressed to select the corresponding phone tree. In this illustration, the matching entries are listed in numeric order by the Top Tier entry (the phone number) for the phone tree. If there are too many entries for convenient display within the screen, a standard \u201cscroll bar\u201d for the display may also be used, to allow the user to scroll down a long list of entries. In some embodiments, the matching entries may be listed in alphabetical order according to the metadata associated with the phone tree. The \u201cBack\u201d button  may be used to return to the keypad entry screen to enter more digits if too many matches for convenient selection have been found.","Returning to , the next step  comprises accepting entry data  from the user, in the form or \u201cpressing\u201d the \u201cbutton\u201d for one of the phone tree options displayed. The next step  checks if the \u201cBack\u201d \u201cbutton\u201d was the input, and if so, the program returns the display to the input screen represented by the keypad entry step .","However, if the result of this selection step  is that one of the phone tree options has been selected, the next step  comprises loading the phone number corresponding to the Top Tier of that phone tree option into the Dialer Field . The dialer field  may be a separate memory register designated by the app specifically for this purpose, or in some embodiments may be a designated string variable within the program.","After the phone tree has been selected and the data for the phone tree Top Tier loaded into the Dialer Field, in the next step  the phone screen is changed to now display the contents of the Dialer Field . An example of a screen display corresponding to this step is illustrated in , which shows the contents of the Dialer Field  in a portion  of the touchscreen display  in the upper part of the screen, and also comprising in this embodiment a pop-up screen  containing two \u201cbuttons\u201d  & , with one \u201cbutton\u201d  giving the user the option to \u201cCall\u201d the number as loaded into the dialer field, and the other \u201cbutton\u201d  marked \u201cTree\u201d that allows the user to continue building the number based on the phone tree. Various techniques, such as a change in the size, shape, color, font, graphic selections etc. may be used to allow the user to recognize that the contents of the portion of the display  showing the contents of the Dialer Field  is from the IVR database  and not the same display as the user input display , even though the actual digits may be the same or similar to those displayed in the input screen .","Returning to , the next step  comprises accepting entry data  from the user, in the form or \u201cpressing\u201d one of the two \u201cbuttons\u201d displayed\u2014\u201cCall\u201d or \u201cTree\u201d. If the choice is to \u201cCall\u201d, the program passes control to steps represented by \u201cD\u201d in , which initiate the phone and call the number in the dialer field, and are illustrated in detail in . If the choice is \u201cTree\u201d, the program passes control to steps represented by \u201cB\u201d in , which allow the user to continue to build the number in the dialer field, and are illustrated in detail in .","Turning now to , after the \u201cTree\u201d option has been selected, as mentioned above, program passes control to steps presented here that allow the user to continue to build the number in the Dialer Field . The next step  is to display the dialer field along with the 1Tier options for the phone tree.","A typical screen display corresponding to this step is illustrated in . The upper part  of the touchscreen display  illustrates the contents of the Dialer Field , but now are illustrated with a cursor  which may optionally be blinking or otherwise indicating that the software is now accepting input from the user. The location of the cursor  may be used to illustrate the Tier from which the options are being selected. In some embodiments, a more specific designation of the Tier of the Phone Tree may be provided, such as a heading such as \u201c1Tier\u201d to label the options presented.

If the \u201cClose\u201d option has been selected, in the next step  the program returns to the initial dialer screen , as was illustrated in  or, in some embodiments, may simply shut down the app, returning the phone to the home screen, as was illustrated in ","Turning now to , which represents the steps indicated by the \u201cD\u201d noted in . Once the Dialer Field  has had the number assembled, the next step  is to take the assembled dialstring from the Dialer Field  and pass it to the phone dialer. This will invoke the standard phone dialing commands packaged within the operating system of the smartphone, and will make the phone call through the transceiver built within the smartphone. In some embodiments, once the call is completed, the control of the phone will be returned to the app, which has remained operational in the background. The phone call will then display a closing screen, which may say \u201cThank you for making your call with Visual IVR\u201d, and present the user with options to \u201cMake another call\u201d, or to \u201cClose\u201d the app In other embodiments, the app will close once the dialstring has been constructed and transferred to the phone dialer, and when the call is done, the phone will return to the smartphone's home state.","In the next step , the normal dialing interface is displayed with two \u201cbuttons\u201d provided as options: \u201cConfirm\u201d or \u201cCancel\u201d. The next step  comprises accepting input  from the user, in the form or \u201cpressing\u201d one of the \u201cbuttons\u201d displayed.","In the next step , the program interprets this input. If the \u201cCancel\u201d \u201cbutton\u201d was selected, the program passes control as indicated by the \u201cF\u201d noted in  and reverts to the \u201cCall\u201d or \u201cClose\u201d options indicated the prior step  in  (and, since the user choses not to call, presumably the user would immediately select the \u201cClose\u201d option).","However, if the \u201cConfirm\u201d \u201cbutton\u201d has been selected, in the next step  the phone connection is initiated using standard commands in the smartphone operating system API and the number from the Dialer Field  is dialed. The number will reach the desired phone tree, and the appended suffixes with their suitably attached \u201cpauses\u201d (represented by commas) will reach the selected entry in the phone tree with no need to listen repeatedly to complex options or wait to manually enter digits after listening to a message.","With the initiation of the phone call in this step , the creation of the dialstring by the app is done. In some embodiments, in the final step , the app reverts to a standby state in the background while the phone call proceeds, and once the end of the call is detected, reverts to the initial start screen  as shown in . In other embodiments, the app remains operating in the background, but the smartphone displays the home screen for the smartphone.","In the First Embodiment presented above, the user makes selections through displays on the phone in the order that they would be made if the user were listening to the phone tree\u2014first, a 1Tier selection is made, followed by a 2Tier selection, followed by a 3Tier selection, etc. until the user proceeds to dial, or the options are exhausted.","This type of iterative selection is useful if the options are lengthy or complex and do not lend themselves to simple graphical display on a smartphone screen. However, not all phone trees have entries that are this complex. Table II (in 3 parts) presents an example for a phone tree for GEICO Insurance. As before, there are several tiers to the phone tree. However, most of these entries are considerably shorter than the options in the USCIS phone tree. , B, and C present these same tiers of options for GEICO Insurance in a graphical illustration.","Referring to Table II and , in the Top Tier 002, the direct dial phone number is represented.

For example, after a 1Tier \u201cbutton\u201d is pressed, the program may be designed to display a portion of the graphical phone tree with only the 2or 3Tier sub-options under the selected 1Tier option displayed as active. The user may then select one of these options as appropriate. In some cases, such as in the GEICO phone tree under 1Tier option \u201c2\u201d followed by 2Tier option \u201c4\u201d, the phone tree requires a zip code to be entered, so the program may be designed to display an additional input field to allow the input of a string of digits or letters. In some cases, the program may be designed to display an \u201cAdditional Input?\u201d message, with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d options that allow additional selections to be made.","Two embodiments for the creation of a dialstring have been disclosed in this application, one with step-by-step navigation through complex options for a phone tree, the other with navigation by means of a graphical interface. Other embodiments and implementations of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.","One option that may be particularly useful is that of using the visual IVR interface as a replacement for a translation service, by providing the guidance and direction for a Phone Tree in one language with menu choices or descriptions in the graphical representations presented in a different language. This can be especially practical for users who struggle to hear or understand the spoken options presented the IVR system, but may be able to carry on an appropriate conversation once they have found the right option.","As an example, although the phone tree itself is the same, a graphical representation in another language may allow a speaker of a foreign language to select options more readily. This is illustrated in , in which the options of the GEICO Phone Tree as were shown in  are shown, but with the text presented in Chinese (and with reference characters modified by appending \u201c-C\u201d when compared with the reference characters of ). Although the ensuing call may still need to take place in English, the ability to navigate to the correct option may be more comfortable for a Chinese native speaker with such a display.","In some embodiments, this variation may be achieved through adaptation of various settings for language selection that may be built in to the structure of the app. Such setting commands are generally part of an API for a particular smartphone operating system, and will be known to those skilled in the art. The foreign language that may be used can be any language used by a large enough population that may need access to a particular phone tree, and may be especially useful if the language uses different characters than the Roman letters of English. For a phone tree in English, the foreign language representation may be in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesian, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Urdu, Pashto, Farsi, Arabic, Hebrew, Ethiopian, Afrikaans, Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, Polish, Czech, German, Danish, Swedish, French, Italian, Spanish, Welsh, or Gaelic, among others.","Other embodiments of the invention may combine various elements of the two embodiments presented in other ways. For example, although the first embodiment shows building a Dialer Field by appending strings one at a time as the user goes through the phone tree menus, while the second embodiment shows the appending a single string representing an ensemble of selections, there is an alternative embodiment in which the user goes through the phone tree options one at a time but the final dialstring is created at the end of the process, appending a single string that represents the ensemble of choices.","Also, although the embodiments presented have illustrated the Dialer Field as if it were a separate register in a storage device within the smartphone, as a practical matter, the Dialer Field may in fact simply be the value for a string variable within the program, and the instructions for its assembly comprise lines of code in the software that revise or update the value of the string.","Likewise, the representation of the values to be added to the Dialer Field may simply exist as predetermined entries in the relational database that represents the IVR phone tree. The construction of a \u201cDialer Field\u201d in this embodiment is therefore the assembly of a particular sequence of SQL commands that access the database as needed to assemble the selected options. Execution of the final SQL command assembles the dialstring based on the selections by the user and the database entries in the relational database representing the IVR","Although the embodiments presented in this application illustrate the invention by the creation of a dialstring using digits and commas (representing pauses), it will be known to those skilled in the art that many characters can be used to represent various actions in a dialstring. Dialstring characters may include:","0-9#* (Conventional phone dialer input characters)",", (Pause\u2014typically 2 seconds),","; (Return to beginning after dialing. Must be at the end of a dial string)","W (Wait for a tone),","@ (Wait for a \u2018quiet answer\u201d before continuing)","! (Flash (go on-hook for \u00bd second).\n\n","Furthermore, although the embodiments illustrated in detail in this application used phone trees in which the entries are generally single digits, some phone trees may require the user to enter several characters, such as a zip code, phone number, social security number, frequent flyer number, PIN, etc. In this case, the embodiments of the invention would operate essentially as already presented, except that the code implementing the method would be designed to accept the input of multiple digits or characters, and then appending the multi-digit input to the dialstring, instead of appending only a single digit.","It should also be noted that the embodiments here may be combined with an additional \u201csearch\u201d function, so that the user could simply input a search string (such as \u201cKaplan lawsuit\u201d for the USCIS phone tree), and have the related options (e.g. 1, 3, 1) appear using a suitable user interface, without requiring that the user go through the phone tree step by step.","In the embodiments presented so far, and as illustrated, for example, in , both the software code for the app  and the database  representing the IVR phone trees are present on internal storage  within the smartphone . However, smartphones are often engineered with multiple antennas for cellular phone connection and for local wi-fi Internet connections. It may therefore be practical to store the database representing the IVR phone trees on an external storage system at a remote location, or \u201cin the cloud\u201d. \u201cCloud\u201d data storage services are offered by companies such as Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. and Amazon Web Services of Seattle, Wash. (By \u201cremote\u201d, it should be understood that the data storage site is simply at a physical location other than within the smartphone, and need not be \u201cfar from a center of population\u201d).","An embodiment of the invention using remote data storage is illustrated in . The smartphone  with one or more antennas  can connect wirelessly to local cellular phone transceivers  comprising antennas , or through various well known wi-fi protocols (such as Bluetooth) to local transceivers  comprising antennas . These wireless connections in turn are linked to a remote data storage facility , either through a conventional telephone system , or through the Internet . Note: Although the antennas  are shown in  as an external attachment to the smartphone , in practice, the antennas for most smartphones are built into the body of the phone.","Within the remote data storage facility , storage devices  such as disk drives, flash memory and the like store a database  that represents one or more IVR phone trees. The remote storage devices  may also store backup copies of the app code , a copy of one or more dialer fields  (either dynamically accessed during use, or more often as a reference of previously called numbers), a backup copy of an address book , and other items that may be of use to the user, either for reference or as backup files for the data stored on the smartphone.","Within the remote facility  will also be one or more data processing systems , such as routers or computers, that serve to manage the data from the stored locations within the facility  and coordinate their transmission. Transmission may occur through various telephone connections , which will send data and receive instructions and requests for data through a telephone network  and cellular transceivers , which comprise one or more antennas  providing connections to the smartphone  by means of cellular phone signals. The data processing systems  may also provide a connection to the Internet , which allows the user interact through a local wi-fi connection to a local transceiver  comprising wi-fi antennas , allowing instructions and requests for data from the facility  to be sent and data received through the Internet.","Depending on the reliability of the user's connection, embodiments of the invention may be configured to store everything locally on the smartphone , share databases such as the IVR database between portions  on the smartphone  and portions  in the remote facility , or may store all IVR phone trees in the database  in the remote facility , accessing the data as needed.","Although the embodiments described in the application describe embodiments of the invention as implemented on a smartphone with a touchscreen display, it will be known to those skilled in the art that not all mobile phones (or even all smartphones) have a touchscreen display. In fact, many cellular phone products, such as those traditionally produced by Blackberry Ltd (formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd) of Waterloo, ON, Canada, comprise a display screen and a separate keypad for entry of characters. Most of the original cellular phones prior to the introduction of the iPhone by Apple Inc. in fact are constructed with distinct keypads and displays.","Embodiments of the invention in which the input and display are not combined in a touchscreen but are separate elements, with input achieved by pressing dedicated physical buttons in the keypad, may still function as well as the embodiments described here. The methods as presented are therefore still applicable, but each virtual \u201cpressing\u201d of a button in the disclosed methods will be replaced by the pressing of real buttons on the keypad, with the software code embodiment of the invention engineered to recognize the pressing of suitable keys or key combinations as indicative of the \u201cselection\u201d of an item shown in the display.","It will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that, although this has been described as being implemented by smartphone, any communication device comprising a display and a means for selecting items shown in the display may be used for both constructing dialstrings and, if a suitable telephone connection is also available, using the dialstring to make a phone call.","Although the embodiments disclosed so far comprise the use of a smartphone for exploring and selecting options from a database comprising a representation of one or more IVR phone trees, many computers connected to the Internet may also be used for telephone calls using, for example, Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) services such as Skype\u2122, offered by the Microsoft\u00ae Skype Division located in Luxembourg and Estonia. Using such a VoIP system, a normal desktop or laptop computer can become a telephone terminal for the transmission of both 2-way voice and video. Embodiments of the invention may therefore also be implemented by a computer, using the same steps of the methods previously disclosed, but in which the previously described steps that \u201cdisplay\u201d various items on a smartphone display are replaced by steps \u201cdisplaying\u201d the same items on one or more display devices connected to the computer, and the previously described steps of \u201cinput\u201d by pressing \u201cvirtual buttons\u201d are replaced by steps in which the same input is provided using a keyboard, mouse, or other I\/O device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0183"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"One embodiment of such a computer system  comprises a bus  which interconnects major subsystems of computer system , which typically comprises: a central processing unit (CPU) ; a system memory  (typically random-access memory (RAM), but which may also include read-only memory (ROM), flash RAM, or the like); an input\/output (I\/O) controller ; one or more data storage systems ,  such as an internal hard disk drive or an internal flash drive or the like; a network interface  to an external network , such as the Internet, a fiber channel network, or the like; and one or more drives ,  operative to receive computer-readable media (CRM) such as an optical disk , compact-disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), compact discs (CDs), floppy disks, universal serial bus (USB) thumbdrives , magnetic tapes, etc.","The computer system  may also comprise: a keyboard ; a mouse ; and one or more various other I\/O devices such as a trackball, an input tablet, a touchscreen device, an audio microphone and the like.
