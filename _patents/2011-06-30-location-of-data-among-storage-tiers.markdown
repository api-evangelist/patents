title: Location of data among storage tiers
abstract: Managing data in a storage system having a plurality of classes of storage includes determining an amount of data to be provided on at least one of the classes of storage according to a policy, dynamically setting a threshold according to the amount of data to be provided on the at least one of the classes or an expected performance based on the threshold, and placing data on particular classes of storage based on the threshold. Dynamically setting a threshold may include sorting data portions according to at least one score thereof and may include determining a particular score corresponding to the amount of data to be provided. The data portions may be provided in a histogram having a horizontal scale corresponding to a score value and a vertical scale corresponding to a number of data portions having a particular value.

Such storage devices are provided, for example, by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass. and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,939 to Yanai et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,394 to Galtzur et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,147 to Vishlitzky et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,208 to Ofek, which are incorporated herein by reference. The host systems access the storage device through a plurality of channels provided therewith. Host systems provide data and access control information through the channels of the storage device and the storage device provides data to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems do not address the disk drives of the storage device directly, but rather, access what appears to the host systems as a plurality of logical volumes. Different sections of the logical volumes may or may not correspond to the actual disk drives.","An individual storage system may contain multiple tiers of storage, each of which may have different performance characteristics and operating costs. For example, one tier may be comprised of Flash drives, another of Fibre Channel drives and another of SATA drives. The character of the storage request access loads that these each drive type is best suited for may vary greatly. In order to efficiently exploit the different capabilities provided by these drive types, the drive type to which a each region of logical storage is mapped would be selected so that the resulting host access workload for the drives would effectively exploit that drives capabilities (e.g., SATA drives are effective at handling workloads with low access density and tolerance for higher response times, while Flash drives are effective at handling workloads with high access density and low response time requirements. Fibre Channel drives effective at handling workloads that do not fall into either of these extremes.","The use of a multi-tiered configuration can in principal be optimized to a greater degree when the size of the regions that optimal tier selection decisions are made for is smaller. However, the selection of a small region size for tier selection may result in the need to determine optimal placement for significant numbers (billions) of regions. Thus, it may be impractical to use techniques that completely analyze all of the data before identifying the candidates for promotion and demotion between the tiers. Such techniques do not necessarily scale well as amount of storage (and number of storage portions) increases. Also, such techniques may not react quickly enough to work load change due their sequential mode of operation.","Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to provide continuous data movement between the tiers in parallel (and possibly using multiple CPUs) while having minimal impact to the system as data is analyzed and moved between the tiers.","According to the system described herein, identifying data for placement in a storage system having a plurality of storage classes includes subdividing the data into portions, for each of the portions, independently determining at least one score for a particular portion based on a metric corresponding to access of the particular portion, where the at least one score for the particular portion is independent of scores for other ones of the portions, and identifying sub-portions of data for placement in a particular storage class based on the at least one score of a portion of data corresponding to the sub-portions. The at least one score may be based on short term access statistics and long term access statistics. The access statistics may include read misses, writes, and prefetches. Placement of data may include promotion of sub-portions of data to relatively faster storage classes and demotion of sub-portions of data to relatively slower storage classes, where a first score that emphasizes short term access statistics may be used for promotion and where a second score that emphasizes long term access statistics may be used for demotion. A sub-portion of data marked for promoting based on a score thereof may not be considered for demotion. There may be three storage classes of data, where a sub-portion of data marked for promoting to a fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion and where a sub-portion of data marked for promoting to a second fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion to a slowest class of storage. Placement of sub-portions of data may include promotion of sub-portions of data to relatively faster storage classes and demotion of sub-portions of data to relatively slower storage classes. The portions of data may be extents having five thousand seven hundred and sixty tracks of data. The sub-portions of data may be one or more data chunks of a corresponding portion and each of the data chunks may have one hundred and twenty tracks of data.","According further to the system described herein, computer software, provided in a non-transitory computer-readable medium, identifies data for placement in a storage system having a plurality of storage classes. The software includes executable code that independently determines at least one score for a particular portion of the data based on a metric corresponding to access of the particular portion, where the at least one score for the particular portion of the data is independent of scores for other portions of the data and executable code that identifies sub-portions of data for placement in a particular storage class based on the at least one score of a portion of data corresponding to the sub-portions. At least one score may be based on short term access statistics and long term access statistics. The access statistics may include read misses, writes, and prefetches. Executable code that places the data may include executable code that promotes sub-portions of data to relatively faster storage classes and demotes sub-portions of data to relatively slower storage classes and wherein a first score that emphasizes short term access statistics is used for promotion and wherein a second score that emphasizes long term access statistics is used for demotion. A sub-portion of data marked for promoting based on a score thereof may not be considered for demotion. There may be three storage classes of data, where a sub-portion of data marked for promoting to a fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion and where sub-portion of data marked for promoting to a second fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion to a slowest class of storage. Executable code that places sub-portions of data may include executable code that promotes sub-portions of data to relatively faster storage classes and demotes sub-portions of data to relatively slower storage classes. The portions of data may be extents having five thousand seven hundred and sixty tracks of data. The sub-portions of data may be one or more data chunks of a corresponding portion and each of the data chunks may have one hundred and twenty tracks of data.","According further to the system described herein, managing data in a storage system having a plurality of classes of storage includes determining an amount of data to be provided on at least one of the classes of storage according to a policy, dynamically setting a threshold according to the amount of data to be provided on the at least one of the classes or an expected performance based on the threshold, and placing data on particular classes of storage based on the threshold. Dynamically setting a threshold may include sorting data portions according to at least one score thereof and may include determining a particular score corresponding to the amount of data to be provided. The data portions may be provided in a histogram having a horizontal scale corresponding to a score value and a vertical scale corresponding to a number of data portions having a particular value. At least some of the scores may be logarithmic. The data portions may be extents having five thousand seven hundred and sixty tracks of data. Contiguous extents having scores that are the same may be combined into superextents. At least one score may be based on short term access statistics and long term access statistics and the access statistics may include read misses, writes, and prefetches. Placing data may include promotion of some of the data to relatively faster storage classes having a score above a first threshold and demotion of some of the data to relatively slower storage classes having a score below a second threshold. A data portion that is marked for promoting based on a score thereof may not be considered for demotion. There may be three storage classes of data and where data that is marked for promoting to a fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion and where data that is marked for promoting to a second fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion to a slowest class of storage.","According further to the system described herein, computer software, provided in a non-transistor computer-readable medium, manages data in a storage system having a plurality of classes of storage. The software includes executable code that determines an amount of data to be provided on at least one of the classes of storage according to a policy, executable code that dynamically sets a threshold according to the amount of data to be provided on the at least one of the classes or an expected performance based on the threshold, and executable code that places data on particular classes of storage based on the threshold. Executable code that dynamically sets a threshold may include executable code that sorts data portions according to at least one score thereof and may include executable code that determines a particular score corresponding to the amount of data to be provided. The data portions may be provided in a histogram having a horizontal scale corresponding to a score value and a vertical scale corresponding to a number of data portions having a particular value. At least some of the scores may be logarithmic. The data portions may be extents having five thousand seven hundred and sixty tracks of data.

A data portion that is marked for promoting based on a score thereof may not be considered for demotion. There may be three storage classes of data where data that is marked for promoting to a fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion and where data that is marked for promoting to a second fastest class of storage may not be considered for demotion to a slowest class of storage.","Referring now to the figures of the drawings, the figures comprise a part of this specification and illustrate exemplary embodiments of the described system.

However, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the system described herein may work with any appropriate incremental amount, or section, of data, including possibly variable incremental amounts of data and\/or fixed incremental amounts of data and\/or logical representations of data, including (but not limited to) compressed data, encrypted data, or pointers into de-duplicated data dictionaries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","52","52","46","52","52","32","34","36","38","48","49","46"],"i":["a","c ","a","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["54","52","52","52","52","54","52","52","52","52","46","54","52","52","52","52","54","52","52","52","52","52","52","52","52","52","52"],"i":["a","c","a","c ","a","c ","a","c ","a","c ","a","c","a","c ","a","c ","a","c","a","c ","a","c "]},"In some embodiments, one or more of the directors -may have multiple processor systems thereon and thus may be able to perform functions for multiple directors. In some embodiments, at least one of the directors -having multiple processor systems thereon may simultaneously perform the functions of at least two different types of directors (e.g., an HA and a DA). Furthermore, in some embodiments, at least one of the directors -having multiple processor systems thereon may simultaneously perform the functions of different types of director and perform other processing with the other processing system. Generally, the system described herein could work with any appropriate hardware configuration, including configurations where at least some of the memory  is distributed among at least some of the directors -and in configurations where a number of core processors are coupled to a generic interface card.","The storage devices ,  may be provided as stand-alone devices coupled to the host  as shown in  or, alternatively, the storage devices ,  may be part of a storage area network (SAN) that includes a plurality of other storage devices as well as routers, network connections, etc. The storage devices may be coupled to a SAN fabric and\/or be part of a SAN fabric. The system described herein may be implemented using software, hardware, and\/or a combination of software and hardware where software may be stored in a computer readable medium and executed by one or more processors.","The system described herein is suitable for use with the technique of thin provisioning. Thin provisioning allows for the creation of logical volumes of storage space where allocation of physical storage space occurs only when space is actually needed (e.g., when data is written in the first time to the storage space). Logical storage space may be identified to a user as being available even though no physical storage space has been committed, at least initially. When data is written to the logical storage space, physical storage space is drawn for use from a pool of physical storage space, as further described elsewhere herein.

Each of the thin devices - may contain tables that point to some or all of the data devices - (or portions thereof), as further discussed elsewhere herein. In some instances, the thin devices - may be concatenated to form a metavolume of thin devices. In some embodiments, only one thin device may be associated with the same data device while, in other embodiments, multiple thin devices may be associated with the same data device, as illustrated in the figure with arrows having broken lines.","In some embodiments, it may be possible to implement the system described herein using storage areas, instead of storage devices. Thus, for example, the thin devices - may be thin storage areas, the data devices - may be standard logical areas, and so forth. In some instances, such an implementation may allow for hybrid logical devices where a single logical device has portions that behave as a data device and\/or portions that behave as a thin device. Accordingly, it should be understood that, in appropriate instances, references to devices in the discussion herein may also apply to storage areas that may or may not correspond directly with a storage device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["100","102","102","106","108","102"]},"Each of the entries - of the table  may correspond to another table that may contain information for one or more logical volumes, such as thin device logical volumes.

The thin device table  may include a header  that contains overhead information, such as information identifying the corresponding thin device, information concerning the last used data device and\/or other information including counter information, such as a counter that keeps track of used group entries (described below). The header information, or portions thereof, may be available globally to the storage device .","The thin device table  may include one or more chunks - that contain information corresponding to a group of tracks on the data device or some other collection of data. The chunk may include one or more tracks, the number of which may be configured as appropriate, and\/or may include a different increment of data. In an embodiment herein, each chunk corresponds to twelve tracks, although this number may be configurable or dynamically adjustable based on appropriate criteria. Each track may be 64 k bytes.

An extent may in turn be organized into a set of contiguous sub-extents, which are themselves comprised of a contiguous range of chunks. For each sub-extent, the storage system may maintain a smaller amount of access information, that may be combined with information from the extent level to determine access statistics specific to a particular sub-extent.

If so, then processing proceeds to a step  where the data device that includes the logical tracks is identified. After the step , is a step  where the track table  is read from the identified one or more of the data devices - and the corresponding location of the physical data (i.e., cylinder and track) is determined. As further discussed elsewhere herein, physical storage space may be provided in connection with one data device and\/or by a concatenation of multiple data devices or portions thereof. Logical storage space maps to space on the data devices. Following the step  processing proceeds to a step  where the data being written is directed to the appropriate physical storage space. The incoming data overwrites the appropriate portion of the data where directed. After the step , processing is complete.","If it is determined at the step  that there is no physical storage that has been allocated for the logical track(s) being written, then control transfers from the step  to a step , where a next available data device identifier (i.e., the data device ) is determined. This information may be obtained from the header  of the device table . In an embodiment herein, data device identifiers are provided by numbers so that a next available data device identifier is simply one more than a last allocated data device. However, as discussed in more detail elsewhere herein, selection of a data device at the step  may include application of other criteria.","After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where available physical storage space on the disk drives - is determined. In an embodiment herein, available physical storage space is allocated sequentially from one or more of the disk drives -. Following the step  is a step  where a request may be sent to a disk adapter - (or possibly the RA  and\/or the EA ) to allocate the physical storage space for the write. Also at the step , header info is updated to reflect the newly allocated data device and physical tracks. After the step , processing proceeds to the step , discussed above, where the data being written is directed to the one or more data devices. After the step , processing is complete.","After the read and write processes illustrated in , information concerning access of the data, such as access frequency, time of last access or use and\/or other characteristics and statistics, may be updated and stored by the system described herein. The updated data access information or other characteristic information of the data and\/or any portion of the data may, for example, be stored as an entry in a group element of the thin device table  (for example, the entry of the group element \u2032 as shown in ). Alternatively, the data characteristic information may be stored in a memory, such as the global memory  of the storage device , and a pointer to this information stored in the group element \u2032. Other implementations for storing and access of the data characteristic information are possible.","The allocation of the physical storage space for a thin device at the time of writing the data, as well as the policies that govern the allocation, may be transparent to a user. For example, a user's inquiry into how much storage space is available on a particular thin device may indicate a maximum amount of physical storage space that could be allocated for a thin storage device (provisioned storage space) even though the corresponding physical storage space had not yet been allocated. In an alternative embodiment, the policy for the thin device may be to report something less than the total maximum that could be allocated. In some embodiments, used physical storage space may not exceed 30% of the provisioned storage space.","In an embodiment herein, different portions of the physical data may be automatically moved between different physical disk drives or other storage devices (different tiers) with the same or different characteristics according to one or more policies. For example, data may be initially allocated to a particular fast disk drive, (relatively high tier) but a portion of the data that has not been used over a period of time (for example, three weeks) may be automatically moved, according to the system described herein, to a slower (and perhaps less expensive) disk drive (relatively lower tier). The physical data may then be automatically moved back to the higher tier if the data is subsequently used and\/or accessed according to a policy or other criteria (for example, accessed twice in any given week), as further described herein. Thus, the system described herein may operate to automatically move data between tiers within the same machine according to the one or more policies.","A policy may be configured by an administrator on a system-wide level or may be specific to a particular user on a specific logical device. The system described herein allows for the remapping of physical data based on policy criteria or other statistics. For example, the policy may be based on the last time data was used and\/or accessed. Alternatively, the policy may be based on anticipated use of data over specific times and\/or dates. For example, data that is expected to be used at a particular time may be stored on (or relocated to) relatively fast tier and then moved to relatively slow tier when it is expected that the data will not be used again for a lengthy period of time. Moreover, different policies and\/or criteria may be implemented corresponding to different users and\/or different levels of importance or security of data. For example, it may be known that user A accesses particular data more frequently than user B and, accordingly, the policy for moving physical data according to the system described herein may be to leave more data associated with user A on the relatively fast disk drive as compared with the data associated with user B. Alternatively, user A may access data that is generally of a higher level of importance or requires higher security than that of user B and, accordingly, the system described herein may maintain and\/or move more data associated with user A on a disk drive that is relatively more reliable, available and\/or secure as compared with the data associated with user B.","In an embodiment herein, data may be moved between physical disk drives (or other physical storage) having different characteristics, such as speed, cost, reliability, availability, security and\/or other characteristics. As discussed elsewhere herein, logical data devices may be established having different classes corresponding to characteristics of the physical disk drives (or other physical storage) to which the data devices are mapped. Further, it should be noted that any section of the logical device may be moved according to the system described herein based on the characteristics of the data (and governed by default or specific policies).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["400","402","402","404","404","406","406","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["500","502","166"]},"After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where policy information is accessed. The policy information provides the specific criteria used for data storage and management. After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where the policy is applied to the stored data. The policy may include criteria used for managing stored data such as criteria concerning frequency of use of data and\/or criteria with respect to specific users and\/or other criteria, such as file name, file type, file path, requesting application, expected time to re-use of the data, temporary storage only, life expectancy of the data, data type (e.g., compressed, encrypted, de-duped) and\/or protection requirements of the data (e.g., store on an encrypted tier). The policy may be applied to identify data for lifecycle management according to characteristics of entire data volumes or any portions thereof. The policy may also consider the access history, effective performance or other characteristics about the data that might be utilized to optimize the performance, cost, availability or retention requirements of the data.","After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where the data for which characteristics have been determined is managed according to the policy and based on the characteristics of the data. For example, data that is frequently used may be moved to a relatively fast storage device whereas data that has not been used over a certain period of time may be moved to a relatively slow storage device according to the data processing as discussed elsewhere herein. As noted herein, the data that is moved may be entire data volumes or portions thereof. As discussed elsewhere herein, it may be possible to provide fairly sophisticated analysis to determine whether to promote data (move to a relatively faster storage device) or demote data (move to a relatively slower storage device).","After the step , processing proceeds to a test step  where it is determined if another policy with other criteria should be applied to the stored data being managed. If an additional policy is to be applied, then processing proceeds to the step . If no further policies are to be applied, then processing proceeds to a test step  where it is determined whether there is more data to be managed according to the system described herein. If there is further stored data to manage, then processing proceeds back to the step . If no further stored data is to be managed, then after the test step , processing is complete. In some cases, tracking, avoiding and resolving conflicting priorities would be handled to ensure that two policies do not create a \u201cping-pong\u201d effect, moving data blocks up- and down-in a never ending cycle.","As discussed elsewhere herein, the data devices - may be associated with physical storage areas (e.g., disk drives, tape, solid state storage, etc.) having different characteristics. In various embodiments, the physical storage areas may include multiple tiers of storage in which each tier of storage areas and\/or disk drives that may be ordered according to different characteristics and\/or classes, such as speed, technology and\/or cost. The thin devices - may appear to a host coupled to the storage device  as a logical volume (logical device) containing a contiguous block of data storage, as discussed herein. Each thin device - may correspond to a particular data device, a portion thereof and\/or multiple data devices. Accordingly, each thin device - may map to storage areas across multiple storage tiers. As a result, although each thin device - may appear as containing a logically contiguous block of storage, each thin device - may allow for blocks of data to be transparently stored (and\/or retrieved) from discontiguous storage pools made up of the varying classes of data storage devices. In this way, the granularity at which the system for tiered storage described herein operates may be smaller than at the file level, for example potentially as small as a single byte, but more practically at the granularity of a single logical block or collection of sequential data blocks. A data block may be of any size including file system or database logical block size, physical block, track or cylinder and\/or other size. Multiple data blocks may be substantially the same size or different sizes, such as different size data blocks for different storage tiers or different sized data blocks within a single storage tier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["600","630","620","71","74","61","67","610","611","613","614","614","630"]},"The thin device  may map to different storage areas (devices) across multiple tiers. As discussed elsewhere herein, the granularity of the system may be less than at the file level and allow for blocks of data of any size to be stored across multiple storage tiers - of the storage device  in a process that is transparent to the host and\/or host application. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the thin device  may map blocks of data to storage areas (devices) such as a storage area in the pool of storage of the top storage tier , a storage area in the pool of storage of the next storage tier , storage areas , in pool of storage of the next storage tier , and storage areas , , in the pool of storage of the next storage tier . As discussed elsewhere herein, the last storage tier  may include external storage and the system described herein may map to a storage area in the pool of storage in the tier .","Mirroring (backup) of data may also be facilitated by tiered storage across multiple tiers according to the system described herein. For example, data that is accessed frequently may be stored on a fast storage device (tier 0) while a mirrored copy of the data that is not expected to be accessed may be stored on a slower storage device in one or more other tiers (e.g., tiers 1-4). Accordingly, the same data may be stored on storage devices of multiple tiers of storage pools.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["700","730","720","722","710","713","740","744","730","740","744","720","722","720","722","710","713"]},"In an embodiment herein, a write target policy may be applied to data that is being written according to the system described herein. For example, data that is expected to be used frequently, for example database indices, may be initially written directly to fast storage (e.g., tier 0 flash\/SSD storage) whereas data that is not expected to be accessed frequently, for example backup or archived data, may be initially written to slower storage devices (e.g., tier 4 MAID or external storage). In this manner, data is efficiently stored by targeting the write to storage areas and devices according to the estimated or expected access frequency of the data, beginning with the initial write of the data and also applying to subsequent data writes that jump across multiple tiers.","The process for determining the appropriate target storage location of the write of the data may be made based on the logical unit number (LUN) ID of the device from which the data is being written, where the storage device  may have or obtain information about the types of data stored on specific logical units. Alternatively, additional policies and capabilities may be enabled by adding host-resident \u201cextension\u201d software, for example to tag I\/O requests with information about the requesting application or user so that the determination may be made based on other information provided by the host and\/or entity accessing the storage device  (e.g., a target policy indicator provided with each write or class of writes). Other possible criteria include the time of day, the size of the incoming write operation (e.g. very large sequential writes vs. smaller random writes), file name, file type, host OS type, data type, access patterns, inter-dependent accesses to other data, etc. It is also possible that \u201chints\u201d from the host could also be used, particularly relating to performance and availability requirements of the data, etc.","The system described herein may include autonomic promotion and demotion policies to facilitate optimization of performance, storage availability and power. For example, a least recently used (LRU) policy may be used to demote data blocks in order to pro-actively make room for new writes of data blocks and\/or promotions of data blocks within the system. A most frequently used (MRU) policy may be used to promote data blocks that are frequently used to faster storage tiers. Predictive policies may be used to recognize that data blocks that will be needed before they are actually needed and promote the data blocks accordingly (for example, nightly batch jobs, etc.). Alternatively, the system described herein may include an application programming interface (API) that allows a hosts\/users\/applications to inform the storage that certain blocks should be promoted or demoted to different tiers. Note that promotion and demotion may relate to a relative ordering of tiers where promotion refers to moving data to physical storage that is relatively faster and demotion refers to moving data to physical storage that is relatively slower.","Other special purpose policies may also be used. As discussed elsewhere herein, mirroring of data blocks across multiple tiers may be used. For example, for frequently used data blocks, one copy may be written to flash\/SSD memory at a top storage tier and a second copy mirrored to another storage tier (e.g., tier 3 or tier 4). Another policy may include promoting and\/or demoting a data block, but not deleting the data block from its pre-promoted or demoted location until the data block is modified. This policy offers advantages including when subsequently demoting the block (if unmodified), a copy may already exist on a slower storage tier and an additional copy does not need to be made (only the copy on the faster storage tier deleted). When a data block is modified, the previous copy on a different storage tier may be deleted.","Other policies may include manual or automatic pre-promotion and post-demotion policies. For example, blocks may be promoted in the background immediately before batch runs (e.g., billing runs etc.). Additionally, writes for such processes as back-ups may required the fastest possible write, but never (or only infrequently) read. In this case, writes may be written to a top storage tier and immediately scheduled for demotion to a lower storage tier. With MAID storage, data blocks that are rarely or never used may be consolidated onto individual spindles that may then be powered off, providing a reduction in power consumption for storage of data blocks infrequently accessed. Further, sequential\/contiguous blocks may be coalesced and relocated in an optimization process that may include other advanced strategies, including aligning indices near to data being indexed. It is also possible to have a de-duplication policy in which nothing is deleted from storage in a de-dup tier. Data blocks in storage pools of a de-dup storage tier may be promoted to fast storage tiers as needed, but block and index\/metadata in the de-dup storage may be maintained even if a data block is promoted to a faster storage tier and modified or deleted. Maintenance of de-dup storage tiers may involve \u201cuse counters\u201d and\/other mechanisms that may be used with known data cleaning processes such as garbage collection, etc.","In an embodiment herein, one or more policies may be provided to guarantee a particular level of performance and\/or that a particular percentage of data is to be provided on storage having certain characteristics (e.g., speed). The policy may guarantee a minimum number for I\/Os per second (IOPS) and\/or may guarantee greater than a minimum IOPS for any I\/O operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["800","802","802","804","804","806"]},"After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where the determined information associated with the data is processed according to the target policy and the data block is written to a storage location in the storage device according thereto.

However, the use of smaller portions may result in the need to determine optimal placement for a significant number (e.g., billions) of regions. Thus, there are challenges presented in connection with scaling a tiering system for a relatively large storage area. In the system described herein, the overall process of optimizing tier usage is divided into a movement policy determination operation and an operation that applies the movement policy (moves the storage regions to the optimal tier for that region per the movement policy), in such a way that the movement policy determination operation can, if desired, be executed on processing hardware separate from that used by the movement policy application operation. For example, in some embodiments, the movement policy application operation may execute on a storage array containing the data and the movement policy determination operation may execute on a processing complex that is separate from the storage array, so that the movement policy determination operation can take advantage of larger processing and\/or memory capacity than is available on the storage array. The system described herein provides that the movement policy may specify the preferred tier for a region of storage as a (statically defined) function of the host access rate (or other metrics) for the storage region. This allows a given instance of the movement policy to have longer useful life than a movement policy that specifies the preferred tier of a region of storage simply as a function of the logical address of the region since, with the system described herein, the preferred tier for a given region can change as a result of a change in the host access rate (or other metrics) for the region, even without a change to the movement policy. Furthermore, such a movement policy enables embodiments in which the movement policy determination operation can be performed without needing an input indicating which tier a given storage region is currently mapped to. Note that the movement policy determination and movement policy application operations may in turn be implemented in a distributed fashion in a given embodiment and, as will be discussed herein, may be optimized to minimize execution time and to minimize the adverse impacts of storage movement on storage system performance.","As discussed elsewhere herein, policies may be used to determine when to promote data (map the data to a relatively faster tier) and when to demote data (map the data to a relatively slower tier). In an embodiment herein, this may be performed by first determining a score for different portions of a storage space based on relative activity level and then constructing promotion and demotion histograms based on the different scores and the frequency of each. The policy may then be applied to each of the histograms to determine which data is promoted and which data is demoted. This is explained in more detail below.","In an embodiment herein, each of the storage portions may correspond to an extent, where each extent corresponds to forty-eight sub-extents, and each sub-extent corresponds to ten chunks and each chunk corresponds to twelve tracks, so that an extent includes four hundred and eighty chunks (five thousand seven hundred and sixty tracks). Note also that, for the same logical device, different ones of the extents may have different sizes. Note also that the storage space may be one or more of a single logical device, a group of logical devices, all logical devices corresponding to particular physical space, logical devices corresponding to a particular application or set of application, etc.","Referring to , a histogram  illustrates a plurality of activity bins (buckets) and the frequency thereof. Each vertical line of the histogram  represents a bin corresponding to a number of storage portions (e.g., extents) having the corresponding score. Determination of a score for a storage portion is discussed in more detail elsewhere herein. In an embodiment herein, there are five thousand bins. Of course, a different number of bins may be used instead.","The height of each bin represents a number (frequency) of storage portions having a particular score. Thus, the longer a particular vertical line, the more storage portions there are having the corresponding score. Note that the sum of all of the frequencies of the histogram equals the total number of storage portions being considered for promotion in the particular iteration. Note also that the sum of frequencies of a portion between a first score and a second score equals the total number of storage portions having a score between the first and second scores.","The histogram  also shows a first range indicator  and a second range indicator . The first range indicator  corresponds to bins having a score from S1 to SMAX (the maximum score). The second range indicator  corresponds to bins having a score of S2 to S1-1. In an embodiment herein, there are three levels of physical storage and storage portions having a score corresponding to the first range indicator  are promoted (mapped) to a highest (fastest) level of storage and storage portions having a score corresponding to the second range indicator  are promoted (mapped) to a medium level of storage. The remainder of the portions (i.e., that do not correspond to either the first range indicator  or the second range indicator ) are not changed (are not promoted based on the histogram ). Of course, it is possible to have any number of storage levels.","In an embodiment herein, it may be possible to inhibit thrashing by only promoting a certain percentage of data that is above a particular threshold (e.g., promote the top 95% of data above the threshold) while leaving the remaining 5% of the data at its current tier. The remaining 5% may still be processed as if it had been promoted (e.g., not considered for demotion in certain cases, see discussion elsewhere herein).","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates steps performed in connection with promoting (mapping) storage portions to various levels. Processing begins at a first step  where a histogram is constructed like the histogram , discussed above. Scoring the storage portions to construct the histogram is discussed in more detail elsewhere herein. Following the step  is a step  where storage portions are promoted to a highest level of storage using the histogram constructed at the step . The specific processing provided at the step  varies according to the specific policy that is used. However, generally, it is possible to select up to a specific number of storage portions having a highest score where the specific number is based on the policy (e.g., 85% of available space at a particular level). Processing provided at the step  is described in more detail elsewhere herein. Other policies may include a particular percentage of all space used for the storage space, data having a particular score (possibly up to some limit of the amount of data), etc.","Following the step  is a step  where storage portions are promoted to intermediate level(s) of storage in a manner similar to promoting to the highest level of storage (described elsewhere herein). Following the step  is a step  where data is moved (if necessary) to an assigned level of storage in a manner described elsewhere herein. Following the step , processing is complete. Note that any number of different levels of storage is possible. In an embodiment herein, there are three levels of storage: a lowest level using SATA storage technology, an intermediate level using Fibre Channel technology, and a highest level using flash drive technology.","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates in more detail processing performed in connection with the step , described above. Processing begins at a first step  where a variable that keeps track of the amount of storage portions, AMT, is initialized to zero. Following the step  is a step  where an index variable, I, is set equal to the maximum score (highest bin). In an embodiment herein, there are five thousand bins, so I would be set to five thousand at the step . Of course, other numbers of bins are also possible.","Following the step  is a step  where AMT is incremented by FREQ[I], the amount of data mapped to bin I. Following the step  is a test step  where it is determined if AMT exceeds a target value set by a policy. In an embodiment herein, a policy may indicate a certain percentage of data to be assigned to a particular storage level (e.g., 85% of flash drive capacity). As discussed elsewhere herein, in other embodiments, the target value may be set according to different policies and\/or different types of policies. In an embodiment herein, the target value represents an amount of data that can be compared to AMT at the step .","If it is determined at the test step  that AMT does not exceed the target value, then control passes from the test step  to a test step  where it is determined if I is less than a floor threshold (MIN). In some embodiments, a floor threshold may be set to prevent relatively inactive data (data with a relatively low score) from being promoted to a tier that is relatively high. That is, for each tier, a minimum value for I may be set so that data below that minimum is not promoted to that tier. If it is determined at the test step  that I is not less than the floor threshold, MIN, then control passes from the test step  to a step  where the index variable, I, is decremented. Following the step , control passes back to the step  for another iteration. If it is determined at the test step  that AMT does exceed the target value, or if it is determined at the test step  that I is less than the floor value, MIN, then control passes to a step  where a score threshold is set to the value of the index variable, I. Data portions having a score of I or higher are promoted to the highest level of storage. In other embodiments, only data portions having a score greater than I are promoted. Following the step , processing is complete. Note, by the way, that it is possible in some instances for the physical capacity of a storage level to be exceeded, in which case the threshold may be set lower than otherwise indicated by the target. In other words, the test at the step  may be modified to be (AMT>TARGET) OR (CAPACITY EXCEEDED).","Note that the test steps ,  effectively set the threshold according to either the policy for a particular tier (e.g., fill up to fifty percent of capacity) or according to a value for I that will provide that data not promoted to a higher tier will still be serviced properly. For example, if a policy provides that the highest tier may be filled with up to fifty percent of its capacity, but most of the data of a particular storage group is rarely accessed (has relatively low scores), then the test at the step  prevents data that is rarely accessed from being promoted to the highest tier.","Note that the methodology for determining score values used to assign storage portions to one or more intermediate storage levels may be similar to that described above in connection with the flow chart . In the case of intermediate storage levels though, the index variable I would be initialized to a score that is one less than the lowest score of the next highest storage level. For example, if storage portions having a score of 4500 to 5000 are assigned to the highest storage level, then the index variable, I, would be initialized to 4499 in connection with determining scores for an intermediate storage level just below the highest storage level.","Referring to , a histogram  is like the histogram , discussed above, and illustrates a plurality of scores and the frequency thereof. The histogram  may be used to determine which of the storage portions (if any) are to be demoted (mapped to relatively slower physical storage). In some embodiments, the histogram  may be identical to the histogram . In other embodiments, the histogram  may be different than the histogram  because the scores for the histogram  used for promotion may be different than the scores for the histogram  used for demotion. Determination of promotion and demotion scores is discussed in more detail elsewhere herein.","The histogram  also shows a first range indicator  and a second range indicator . The first range indicator  corresponds to bins having a score from SMIN (the minimum score) to S1. The second range indicator  corresponds to bins having a score of S1+1 to S2. In an embodiment herein, there are three levels of storage and storage portions having a score corresponding to the first range indicator  are demoted (mapped) to a lowest (slowest) level of physical storage and storage portions having a score corresponding to the second range indicator  are demoted (mapped) to a medium level of storage. The remainder of the portions (i.e., that do not correspond to either the first range indicator  or the second range indicator ) are not changed (are not demoted based on the histogram ). Of course, it is possible to have any number of storage levels. Note that, as discussed elsewhere herein, in some embodiments storage portions that have been recently marked as promoting to a highest tier are not candidates for demotion and storage portions that have been recently been marked as promoting to a middle tier are not candidates for demotion to a lowest tier.","In an embodiment herein, the mechanism for demoting storage portions (extents) may be analogous to the mechanism for promoting storage portions. Some of the processing may be reversed so that, for example, the storage portions to be demoted to the lowest level of storage would be determined first and the index variable, I (from the flow chart  of ), would be initially set to SMIN and then incremented on each iteration.","In some embodiments, when a storage portion (e.g., an extent) is selected for promotion, only active sub-portions (e.g., sub-extents) are promoted while inactive sub-portions remain at their current storage level. In an embodiment herein, a sub-portion is considered active if it has been accessed in the previous 4\u00bd days and is considered inactive otherwise. Of course, other appropriate criteria may be used to deem sub-portions either active or inactive. In some embodiments, when a storage portion (e.g., an extent) is selected for demotion, the entire storage portion is demoted, irrespective of activity level of sub-portions. Note that it may be possible to promote some sub-extents of a super-extent and then demote the remaining sub-extents of the same super-extent since whether data is active or inactive may be determined on a sub-extent level. Note also that, in the particular embodiment illustrated herein, a past state (tier) of the data is not factored in to a decision to promote or demote data.","In some cases, it may be desirable to minimize the amount of data that is demoted. A mechanism for doing this may take into account the capacity and amount of data that has been placed onto the higher tiers and set the demotion threshold lower (so less data is demoted) if the amount of promoted data is less than the capacity (or specified percent of capacity) of the higher tiers. For example, if the policy indicates a desire to fill the higher tiers within fifty percent of capacity, but the promotion portion of the algorithm has only promoted data so that the higher tiers are thirty percent full, the demotion threshold may be set lower so that less data is demoted.","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates steps performed in connection with creating the histograms , . Processing begins at a first step  where an index variable, I, is set to one. The index variable I is used to iterate through the storage portions (e.g., extents) of a storage space. Following the step  is a test step  where it is determined if I is greater than MAX, a maximum value for I (e.g., the number of extents of the storage space). The test at the step  determines if all of the storage portions of a particular storage space have been processed. If not, then control transfers from the test step  to a step  where the raw promotion score and the raw demotion scores are calculated.","The raw promotion score and the raw demotion score reflect an amount of I\/O activity for a particular extent. Any appropriate mechanism may be used to calculate the scores. In an embodiment herein, the raw promotion score is provided by the formula:\n\n(1*_rrm+p2*_3*_4*_rrm+p5*_6*_)\/(# Active Subext+1)\n\nwhere s_rrm is the rate of short term random read misses, s_w is the rate of short term writes, s_p is the rate of short term pre-fetches, l_nm is the rate of long term random read misses, l_w is the rate of long term writes, and l_p is the rate of long term pre-fetches for a given extent. The coefficients p1-p6 may be set as appropriate. In an embodiment herein, the values used may be 12, 4, 4, 3, 1, and 1, respectively. Of course, different values may be used to emphasize or deemphasize different I\/O characteristics in connection with determination of the promotion raw score. In an embodiment herein, the different short term and long term rates my be provided using the mechanism described in U.S. patent Ser. No. 12\/924,396 filed on Sep. 27, 2010 and titled \u201cTECHNIQUES FOR STATISTICS COLLECTION IN CONNECTION WITH DATA STORAGE PERFORMANCE\u201d, which is incorporated by reference herein. Of course, any appropriate technique may be used for collection of the statistics used herein.\n","The demotion raw score may be determined using the following formula:\n\n(4*_rrm+p5*_6*_1*_rrm+p2*_3*_)\n\nwhere s_rrm, s_w, p1, etc. are as set forth above.\n","Following the step  is a step  where the promotion bucket index and the demotion bucket index are both calculated. The indexes are used to add data to the histograms , . Determination of the bucket indexes is discussed in more detail elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the promotion raw score may be multiplied by a priority factor (e.g., one, two, or three) prior to obtaining the bucket index. The priority factor may be used to give higher priority (i.e., increase the likelihood of promotion) for some of the storage, possibly selected by a user or by a policy. For example, important operations in an organization may be assigned a higher priority so that storage associated therewith is provided with a priority factor of two or three (or some other value).","Following the step  is a test step  where it is determined if the promotion and demotion bucket indices determined at the step  are the same as the promotion and demotion indices determined for the most recent extent or set of extents. If so, then control passes from the test step  to a step  where the current extent being processed is added to a super-extent data element for the most recent extent or set of extents. The super-extent represents data for a number of contiguous extents having the same promotion and demotion indices. The super-extents are provided to increase efficiency and decrease the amount of storage needed. Note that other criteria may be used to combine information for contiguous extents.","If it is determined at the test step  that the promotion and demotion bucket indices determined at the step  are the same as the promotion and demotion indices determined for the most recent extent or set of extents, then control passes from the test step  to a step  where a new super-extent is created. Adding to an existing super-extent at the step  and creating a new super-extent at the step  are both discussed in more detail elsewhere herein. Following the step  and following the step  is a step  where the index variable, I, is incremented. Following the step , control transfers back to the test step  for another iteration.","If it is determined at the test step  that I, the index variable used to iterate through the storage portions (e.g., extents), is greater than a maximum value (the number of extents being processed), then control transfers from the test step  to a step  where a delay is introduced. Following the step , control transfers back to the step  to reprocess the extents of a data storage space to reconstruct the histograms , .","The amount of delay at the step  represents the cycle time for repeatedly reconstructing the histograms , . The delay may be a constant and\/or may be adjustable depending upon the amount of time spent performing other processing associated with promotion and demotion of data. In some embodiments, the delay may be set so that the histograms are recalculated every ten minutes. It is also possible to keep track of instances where the algorithm does not complete in a certain amount of time (e.g., ten minutes). In such a case, a counter could be incremented each time the algorithm does not complete and decremented when it does. If the counter reaches a certain value (e.g., ten), the system may operate in a degraded mode indicating that data tiering is not being performed properly.","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates steps performed in connection with providing values for converting the raw promotion and demotion scores into promotion and demotion indices (buckets). In an embodiment herein, each of the buckets (bins) has a lower boundary of a raw score that falls into a particular bucket. Thus, for example, given a bucket I, a raw score will map to bucket I if the raw score has a value between the lower boundary of bucket I and one less than the lower boundary of bucket I+1. The following describes how the lower boundary values are set for the bins and thus describes how to map raw scores to particular histogram buckets (bins). Accordingly, the processing performed at the step , discussed above, where raw scores are mapped into particular buckets involves finding a particular bucket where the raw score falls between the low boundary thereof and the lower boundary of the next bucket.","Processing begins at a first step  where I, an index variable, is set to one. The index variable, I, is used to iterate through all of the buckets (bins). Following the step  is a test step  where it is determined if I is greater than NBUCKETS, the number of buckets (histogram values) used by the system. In an embodiment herein, NBUCKETS is five thousand, although other values may be used. If it is determined at the step  that I exceeds the number of buckets, then process is complete. Otherwise, control transfers from the step  to test step  where it is determined if I is greater than a pivot value. In an embodiment herein, a linear scale is used for setting a lower boundary for buckets below the pivot value and a logarithmic scale is used for setting the lower boundary for buckets above the pivot value. Determination of the pivot value is discussed in more detail elsewhere herein.","If it is determined at the test step  that I is not greater than the pivot value, then control passes from the test step  to a step  where a linear scale is used for setting the lower boundary of bucket I. In an embodiment herein, the lower boundary is set equal to I (the bucket number) at the step , but of course other mappings are possible. If it is determined at the test step  that I is greater than the pivot value, then control passes from the test step  to a step  where a logarithmic mapping is used. In an embodiment herein, the following formula is used:\n\nlower boundary=exp(log(pivot value)+logperbucket*(-pivot value))\n\nwhere logperbucket equals (maxlog-minlog)\/(numbuckets-pivot value-2), maxlog=log(max raw score), minlog=log (pivot value), and numbuckets is the total number of buckets. In an embodiment herein, numbuckets is five thousand and max raw score is 4,800,000. Of course, other values may be used.\n","Following the step  or the step  is a step  where I is incremented. Following the step , control transfers back to the step  for another iteration.","As discussed elsewhere herein, determining the low boundary for each of the buckets allows mapping the raw scores into particular buckets at the step , discussed above. A raw score maps to a particular bucket when the raw score is greater than or equal to the low boundary and when the raw score is less than the lower boundary of the next higher bucket. The processing illustrated by the flow chart  constructs a table used to map raw promotion and demotion scores into buckets. The mapping may be performed using a binary search of the table.","Referring to , a diagram  illustrates a data structure that may be used for storing metadata for a super-extent. The data structure  includes an entry for the promotion bucket index for the super-extent and an entry for the demotion bucket index for the super-extent. The data structure  also includes an entry for the number of extents in the super-extent.","As discussed elsewhere herein, an extent may include a number of sub-extents. In an embodiment herein, there are forty-eight sub-extents for each extent. Some of the sub-extents may be active (i.e., have been accessed within a particular amount of time). In an embodiment herein, a sub-extent is considered active if there has been at least one I\/O operation thereon within the last 4\u00bd days and is considered inactive otherwise. The data structure  includes a field indicating the average number of active sub-extents for all of the extents of the super-extent. The value of the average number of active sub-extents field is provided by:\n\n(total number of active sub-extents)\/(number of extents)\n","The data structure  also includes a flag field that indicates whether data for a particular super-extent was recently promoted or demoted and to which tier. In some embodiments, it is possible to use the flag field to decide to add a particular super-extent to a histogram and\/or whether to demote (or promote) data corresponding to a particular super-extent. For example, in an embodiment herein, data that had been recently promoted to the first or second highest level (according to the flag field) is not considered for demotion to the lowest level and data that been recently promoted to the highest level (according to the flag field) is not considered for demotion at all. Note that handling promotion first followed by demotion may be considered part of the policy. The data structure  may also include other information. In an embodiment herein, the flag indicates whether a corresponding data portion had been promoted or demoted in connection with the previous histogram (e.g., the most recent iteration). Thus, after running the promotion algorithm, the flag may be used to eliminate from the demotion histogram any data that had just been promoted, as described above.","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates steps performed in connection with creating a new super-extent at the step , described above. Processing begins at a first step  where space is allocated for the metadata for the super-extent. In an embodiment herein, the super-extent metadata may be provided in the global memory , although other storage locations are possible, provided that the metadata is accessible to provide the processing described herein.","Following the step  is a step  where the promotion bucket index is set to the value determined at the step , described above. Following the step  is a step  where the demotion bucket index is set. Following the step  is a step  where the number of extents field is set to one. Following the step  is a step  where the value for the average number of active sub-extents field is set according to the number of active sub-extents for the extent and where the number of allocated chunks for the super-extent is set. Following the step  is a step  where the flag field is initialized (e.g., cleared) because the data corresponding to the new super-extent had not been recently promoted or demoted (i.e., marked, according to the flag, as having been promoted or demoted in the previous operation). Following the step , processing is complete.","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates steps performed in connection with adding an extent to an existing super-extent at the step , described above. Processing begins at a first step  where the number of extents field is incremented. Following the step  is a step  where the average number of active sub-extents field is adjusted to account for the active sub-extents in the extent being added. Following the step  is a step  where the flag field is modified (e.g., cleared). Following the step , processing is complete.","Referring to , a flow chart  illustrates steps performed in connection with determining the pivot value. As described elsewhere herein, the pivot value is used to determine when to use a linear scale to set the lower boundary for a bucket index and when to use a log scale to set the lower boundary. It is desirable to set the pivot value so that the log scale does not cause the same lower boundary value to be provided for adjacent buckets. In an embodiment herein, the pivot value is set so that the difference between adjacent lower boundary values is at least one, but a different value for the desired difference may also be used.","Processing for the flow chart  begins at a first step  where a variable, DIFF, is set to zero. The DIFF variable is used to keep track of the difference between the lower boundaries of adjacent buckets as the pivot value is increased. Following the step  is a test step  where it is determined if DIFF is less than one. If not, then processing is complete. Otherwise, control transfers from the test step  to a step  where the pivot value is calculated using the formula:\n\npivot value=1+1\/(multiplier\u22121)\n\nwhere multiplier equals exp (logsperbucket) and where determination of logsperbucket is described above. For the initial determination of logsperbucket prior to first performing the step , it is assumed that pivot value is one so that the initial value of minlog is zero.\n","Following the step  is a step  where minlog is recalculated. As discussed elsewhere herein, minlog is the log of the pivot value. Following the step  is a step  where logsperbucket is recalculated. Determination of logsperbucket is discussed elsewhere herein. Following the step  is a step  where multiplier (which equals exp(logsperbucket)) is recalculated. Following the step  is a step  where DIFF is recalculated using the formula:\n\nDIFF=(pivot value)*multiplier\u2212pivot value\n","Following the step , control transfers back to the step  for another iteration.","In some embodiments, it is possible to have multiple independent storage groups that share the same physical storage space, where each storage group has its own independent set of thresholds used for tiering data. Note also that, since it is not necessary to provide absolute comparison of statistics of all of the data stored in physical storage space, the system could be implemented with multiple independent processes (possibly executed by different processors) that determine histograms and provide tiering for different storage groups. Constructions of the histograms ,  may be independent of each other and may be independent of processing that uses the histograms to promote and demote data.","Although the system has been described herein in connection with thin devices, it should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the system may be applied to any type of logical device, including thick devices, VLUN technology, and\/or any other type of storage device. In an embodiment herein, it is possible to have multiple storage groups where each storage group provides its own demand for different levels of storage. Although the system has been illustrated herein with different tiers representing different relative storage speeds, tiers may be generally understood to represent different classes of storage that may be differentiated by one or more of the characteristics, such as physical location, dependability, reliability, security, cost, etc.","The above-noted steps, and other steps described herein, may be performed automatically by the system described herein. For example, steps described herein may be performed periodically, at designated times, and\/or after particular trigger events, such as receipt of a write request, access by a particular user to the system (log in and\/or log out), after assessment of space usage on the disk drives (for example, space usage on the fast disk drive) and\/or after some other suitable I\/O action. Alternatively, the steps described herein may be activated manually by a user and\/or a system administrator. In an embodiment, the system described herein may include a system having at least one processor that performs any of the above-noted steps. The ordering of the steps may be changes in certain instances, as appropriate. Further, computer software, stored in a computer-readable medium (non-transitory computer-readable medium), may be provided according to the system described herein including executable code for carrying out any of the steps and processes described herein.","Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein.
