{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein was made under Contract No. MDA 972-00-9-0009 with the Government of the United States of America and may be manufactured and used by and for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to antennas and more particularly to broadband meander line antennas.","Modern military communication systems require antennas that are small, broadband and have good gain. It is difficult to make electrically small antennas (i.e. less than \u00bc-wavelength in maximum linear dimension) broadband without seriously impacting gain performance.","One widely used method of making an electrically small antenna broadband is to add a resistive taper along the length of the antenna. This taper is usually determined empirically. More recently, people have applied genetic algorithms (GA) to arrive at an optimal taper.","A major disadvantage of the resistive taper is the amount of resistance that needs to be added to an electrically small antenna in order to achieve a good VSWR (i.e. <3:1) which severely reduces the gain of the antenna due to ohmic losses. Additionally, the taper affects gain at all frequencies since it is in series with the element.","The problem with all broadband antennas is to make sure the VSWR is uniformly low, less than 3:1, over the entire band. What often occurs is that there are large VSWR spikes which can exceed 10:1. Since the VSWR spikes induce mismatch loss, this significantly diminishes the ability to pump in energy to the antenna at various points in the broad frequency band that the antenna is to operate over.","What is desired is to have a broadband antenna which does not have VSWR spikes so that it has a uniform operation across the band.","Broadband meander line loaded antennas are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,790,090; 6,313,716; 6,323,814; 6,373,440; 6,373,446; 6,480,158; 6,492,953; and 6,404,391, incorporated herein by reference and assigned to the assignee hereof. U.S. Pat. No. 6,590,543 describes a double monopole meander line loaded antenna used for instance in airborne applications in a dome-like configuration.","In each of the above meander line loaded antennas or antenna couplers the meander lines are insulated from a plate or sheet by a dielectric layer. The designs of such antennas or couplers can be maximized for bandwidth by a number of techniques described in the above patents.","Oftentimes, however, VSWR spikes across the broad bandwidth provide the antenna designer with problems when seeking to provide a uniform smooth low VSWR across the entire broadband.","A need, therefore, exists for a broadband meander line antenna assembly which may be small and is broadband with good gain characteristics and yet have a uniform low VSWR across the band.","In the subject invention a meander line of one or more segments is spaced from the associated conductive plate by a lossy dielectric material. This permits inserting a distributed resistance under low impedance sections of the meander line so as to provide the entire meander line structure with the distributed resistance to reduce VSWR spikes without affecting bandwidth. The insertion of this lossy material in essence smoothes out the VSWR by minimizing mismatches.","A meander line loaded antenna is a tuned circuit realized in many forms, one of which is a folded transmissionline meander line structure of alternating high and low impedances. Past implementations of such a structure utilize a dielectric material to insulate the meander line from a conductive plate normally used. Such an antenna structure exhibits an anti-resonant point or frequency between the natural resonant frequency fo and 0.5 fo which is very difficult to match. At the anti-resonant point, it has been found that very little current flows in the meander line but very high electric fields exist. By mounting the meander line structures on a sheet of a poor conductor material having, for instance, conductivities on the order of from about 0.01 siemens\/m to about 0.1 siemens\/m instead of using dielectrics, the anti-resonance is significantly diminished due to conduction current flowing in the material as a result of the high electric fields. Thus two distinct current paths are provided in the structure which are: (1) current through the meander line element and (2) current through a lossy sheet on which the meander line is mounted. By properly choosing the meander line geometry and lossy sheet properties, broadband response can be achieved over bandwidths of 5:1 or more.","It has been found in the past that lowering the natural resonant frequency of an antenna structure is possible by utilizing meander line elements. However, all resulting antennas exhibit a strong anti-resonance between the tuned frequency and the natural resonant frequency of the structure. This anti-resonance is difficult to match and results in large VSWR spikes. It has been discovered, however, that at the anti-resonant point, very little current flows in the meander line element and that very large electric-fields exist in the vicinity of the meander line element. By mounting the meander line on a poor conductor, conduction current is caused to flow at the anti-resonant frequency resulting in suppression of VSWR spikes. This in turn results in broadband behavior that has a uniform or smooth low VSWR over the entire broadband operating frequency band.","In summary, a method of operating a higher conductivity broadband loaded meander line antenna is provided wherein the meander line is positioned on a sheet of a lower conductivity material having a conductivity of from about 0.01 siemens\/m to about 0.10 siemens\/m; and allowing a first electrical current to flow in a first current path in the meander line. An electrical field is formed in the vicinity of the lower conductivity material and a second current flows in a second current path in the lower conductivity material, whereby anti-resonance in the meander line loaded antenna is diminished so that a broadband response can be achieved over bandwidths of 5:1 or more. An assembly for carrying out this method is also disclosed.","Referring to , a meander line  includes a number of low impedance sections  coupled to high impedance sections , which are in turn coupled to upper sections , with each corresponding to a meander line segment. Note that the segments are serially connected, as can be seen by conductors .","As is typical, the meander line structure is spaced from a conductive plate  and in this case by a lossy dielectric material , which lies between low impedance sections  and plate . This lossy dielectric material is in essence a resistive layer and in one embodiment is available from Eccosorb as model VF-30.","Referring to , one such meander line is formed as part of a meander line loaded antenna. If a standard dielectric is utilized as the layer between the meander line and the conductive plate, then the VSWR curve  is occasioned by high VSWR peaks  at various frequencies. The result is that at these frequencies there is a substantial impedance mismatch which results in the difficulty of transferring energy to the meander line loaded antenna or meander line loaded coupler.","While the utilization of a lossy dielectric material is available for use in any of the aforementioned meander line loaded antenna or coupler applications, by way of illustration, a bifurcated hemispherical double monopole antenna is illustrated in  to include semi-hemispherical halves  and , separated by a slot . Interposed in this slot is a vertical plate  which has a fan-shaped configuration. A point  on the top edge  of the fan-shaped vertical plate is coupled to respective meander lines  and  at respective points  and . Each of the meander lines  and  is mounted to the top surface of respective semi-hemispherical conductors by lossy dielectric layers  and  as illustrated.","From a side view and referring to , the bifurcated hemispherical antenna can be seen as including semi-hemispherical elements  and  carrying meander lines  and . The antenna is fed by vertical plate , in turn coupled to the central conductor  of a coaxial cable feed , which has its outer braid grounded to the semi-hemispherical sections as illustrated at . A signal source  drives center conductor  between conductor  and ground.","In one embodiment, the meander line loaded antenna of  employs meander lines for tuning the antenna lower than its natural resonant frequency. The natural resonant frequency of the illustrated antenna is about 60 MHz. The meander lines are insulated from the semi-hemispherical pates by the aforementioned lossy dielectric sheets.","In this embodiment, two meander lines are used that are tuned to slightly different frequencies in order to provide a double resonance, one at 32.1 MHz and one at 35.5 MHz in an attempt to enhance bandwidth. Alternatively, other bandwidth enhancing techniques noted above may be utilized.","In the illustrated embodiment, there are correspondingly two anti-resonances at 33.5 MHz and 40 MHz where the return loss is very poor. This behavior is shown in . It has been found that the surface currents in the antenna at the resonant and anti-resonant frequencies have magnitudes that are significantly larger at the resonant frequencies than at the anti-resonant frequencies. The inability for current to flow at the anti-resonant frequencies causes the impedance to be very high and thus difficult to match. Since there is no current flowing at anti-resonance, very high electric fields exist in the vicinity of the meander line element.","When the meander line substrate is a good dielectric with a low loss-tangent, the applied electric field does not cause current to flow from the meander line element directly to the associated plate. By replacing the dielectric between the meander line and the plate with a poor conductor having conductivities on the order of 0.2 to 0.01 siemens\/meter, an alternate RF current path is provided which diminishes VSWR spikes and yields a broadband response.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Note that the gain of the antenna of  is 12 dB higher than a 24-inch resistive blade which has 50% more vertical dimension, clearly indicating the gain advantage of the subject resistively-loaded meander line approach.","While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications or additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features of the subject invention will be better understood in connection with a detailed description in conjunction with the drawings, of which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
