Batteries are typically the limiting factor in the performance of most portable commercial and military electronic equipment due to the restrictions on the size, weight and configuration imposed on the equipment by limitations from the power source. In some cases, safety and environmental factors are also significant considerations for deploying a particular power source. Lithium batteries provide high energy density, conformal packaging and improved safety, which make them one of the most promising electrochemical systems under development today.","Lithium batteries use high valence metal oxide materials, which are reduced during the electrochemical reaction. This reaction in rechargeable lithium and rechargeable lithium ion batteries must be fully reversible in order to have a viable cell. Common reversible metal oxide materials used in lithium batteries include: LiMnO, LiCoOand LiNiO. These materials remain reversible against lithium whenever the lithium subscript \u201cx\u201d is maintained between 0.15 and 0.90 for LiMnOand 0.4 and 0.95 for LiCoOand LiNiO. However, if the stoichiometry exceeds these limitations, the material undergoes a phase change and is no longer reversible. The primary consequences of this phase change of the material and subsequent irreversibility are that the cell will no longer accept a charge, which makes the cell inoperable. In order to maintain this stoichiometry rigid electronic control in employed, but rigid controls such as current and voltage limiters employed at the stack level and are often not practical for many situations where lithium batteries are deployed, which makes maintaining reversibility even more critical for those lithium electrochemical systems used in portable electronic devices and apparatus.","Thus there has been a long-felt need to solve the problems associated with maintaining reversibility in lithium batteries without suffering from the disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings associated with rigid stoichiometry electronic control and phase change. It has been found that a mixed metal oxide that introduces bismuth into the manganese dioxide cathode structure yields a material with high voltage stability and a reduced charge transfer impedance due to catalytic activity. This reduced charge transfer impedance provides a lower potential charge mechanism avoiding the problems associated with loss of reversibility in lithium batteries without suffering from the disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings associated with rigid stoichiometry electronic control and phase change.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide cathode material as the positive electrode in rechargeable lithium and lithium ion electrochemical cells.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide cathode material having the general formula MnO(BiO)as the positive electrode in rechargeable lithium and lithium ion electrochemical cells.","It is still a further object of the present invention is to provide a manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide cathode material having the general formula MnO(BiO)as the active positive electrode where subscript x is between 0.05 and 0.25 and subscript y is about 2.","It is yet another object of the present invention is to provide a manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide cathode material having the formula MnO(BiO)as the positive electrode in rechargeable lithium and lithium ion electrochemical cells.","It has now been found that these and the aforementioned objects can now be advantageously attained by reacting metallic bismuth or a compound containing bismuth with MnO. Manganese based mixed metal oxides with bismuth were initially examined as a cathode material for rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries in order to provide a new mixed metal oxide cathode material as the positive electrode in rechargeable lithium and lithium ion electrochemical cells. A stable mixed metal oxide was fabricated through a solid-state reaction between manganese dioxide, and bismuth or a bismuth compound. The electrochemical reaction is:\n\nLi+MnO(BiO)=LiMnO(BiO)\n\nwhich is reversible when the lithium subscript \u201cz\u201d in this reaction is between 0.0 and 0.50. Further, overcharge protection is not required due to the stability of the material as the lithium subscript z approaches 0.0. In preferred embodiments, subscript x is between 0.05 and 0.135. It is anticipated that the MnO(BiO)materials, cathodes and cells of the present invention will also provide inexpensive and less costly lithium and lithium ion electrochemical cells, without suffering from the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art devices. The devices and methods of the present invention provided much improved sustained specific capacity of about 120 mAhrs\/g, and the material exhibited an inherent catalytic behavior for charge transfer.\n","The present invention also encompasses a single step method for making manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide cathode material for lithium electrochemical devices having the general formula MnO(BiO)as the active positive electrode where subscript x is between 0.05 and 0.25 and subscript y is about 2. The single-step method for making a cathode material for a lithium electrochemical system, comprises forming a mixture by mixing the manganese oxide and bismuth metal or bismuth oxide. The mixture is then heat treated in an annealing oven.","The manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide material of the present invention advantageously provides cathode materials answering long-felt needs for a fully reversible lithium battery without suffering from any of the drawbacks, limitations and disadvantages of prior art phase changing batteries. In order to resolve the reversibility problem, electrochemical measurements were performed on rechargeable lithium batteries using a manganese, bismuth mixed metal oxide as the positive electrode. Initial efforts concentrated on a primary Li\/BiMnOsystem, which showed an increased operating voltage when compared to Li\/\u03b2MnO. These measurements identified an increased discharge potential for the Li\/LiMnO(BiO)electrochemical couple and suppressed charge potentials for the Li\/LiMnO(BiO)compound. Changes in cell behavior as a function of bismuth stoichiometry in MnO, as well as cell discharge and charge properties with respect to the bismuth stoichiometry, were also measured. Preliminary results indicated that MnO(BiO)electrochemical cells would produce the required reversibility and still meet other necessary lithium battery operational objectives, without suffering from the setbacks, limitations and disadvantages associated with prior art lithium batteries. Subsequent efforts have yielded an improved solid-state reaction process for rechargeable Li\/MnO(BiO)systems. The mixed metal oxide materials, cathodes and cells showed a reversible couple between lithium and the mixed metal oxide.","The present invention provides a manganese bismuth mixed metal oxide cathode material through a solid-state reaction between manganese dioxide, and either bismuth or a bismuth compound in a compound having the general formula MnO(BiO). This MnO(BiO)compound affords charge transfer catalytic behavior that allows the cathode to be fully reversible at suppressed charge potentials and increased discharge potentials. The MnO(BiO)cathode material of the present invention is incorporated into an electrochemical cell with either a lithium metal or lithium ion anode and an organic electrolyte. In all embodiments, the cathode of the present invention comprises a compound with the general formula MnO(BiO), where subscript x is between 0.05 and 0.25, preferably between 0.05 and 0.135, subscript y is about 2 and the overcharge protection is not needed as the subscript z approaches 0.0 in this reaction:\n\nLi+MnO(BiO)=LiMnO(BiO)\n\nwhich provides charge transfer catalytic behavior allowing the cathode to be fully reversible. In the preferred embodiment, a cathode material where subscript x is between 0.05 and 0.135 with the formula MnO(BiO)provides the much-needed full reversibility, high voltage stability and reduced charge transfer impedance. The materials, cathodes and cells of this invention answer the long-felt need for a reversible cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries without suffering from the shortcomings, limitations and disadvantages of rigid stoichiometry electronic control, phase change and loss of reversibility.\n","Referring now to the drawings,  shows the X-ray diffraction spectra for MnO(BiO)after heat treatment.

Additionally, the system exhibited a coulombic efficiency greater than 97 percent and a 95 percent energy efficient charge. A number of other variations are also possible, including the manganese, bismuth mixed metal oxide resulting from a solid-state reaction between manganese dioxide and bismuth the cathode material, providing a sustained specific capacity of about 120 mAhrs\/g, the subscript x being between 0.05 and 0.135 and the compound being fully reversible.

The electrolyte used was 1 M LiPFin proportional mixtures of dimethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate.","The cells were cycled with an ARBIN Model BT-2043 Battery Test System. A two-step charge profile was used. The charge profile consisted of a constant current charged at 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mA to 4.2 volts followed by an applied constant voltage of 4.2 volts. The constant voltage was maintained for 5 hours or until the charge current dropped to 0.1 mA. The cells were discharged at 1.0, 2.0 and 4 mA to 2.0 volts.
