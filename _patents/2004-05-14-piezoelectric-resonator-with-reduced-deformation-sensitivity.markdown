{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without payment to me of any royalties thereon.","The invention relates generally to piezoelectric resonators and particularly to mounting and packaging piezoelectric resonators to minimize deformation.","Piezoelectric resonators are well known in the art. Piezoelectric resonators are electronic elements used to make a frequency stable and selectable. Piezoelectric resonators are widely used in various kinds of electronic equipment including communication systems, intelligence sensors, precision guided munitions, cordless telephones, broadcast and television, satellite telecommunication, electronic clocks, digital instruments and so on. Piezoelectric resonators can also be used as sensors of temperature, pressure, and weight. The properties of the crystal resonator depend on the angles of cut. Metal electrodes are disposed upon the crystal wafer, which is mounted in a structure designed to hold the crystal wafer. This crystal and holder assembly is called a piezoelectric resonator. Piezoelectric crystal devices are used primarily for precise frequency control and timing. Quartz is the most widely used piezoelectric material. Quartz resonators are manufactured by cutting wafers from the mother crystal along precisely controlled directions with respect to the crystallographic axes. A quartz crystal acts as a stable mechanical resonator, which, by its piezoelectric behavior and high Q, determines the frequency generated in an oscillator circuit. Bulk-wave resonators are available in the frequency range from about 1 kHz to 200 MHz. Surface-acoustic wave (SAW) and shallow-bulk-acoustic-wave devices can be made to operate at well above 1 GHz.","A typical low noise oscillator uses a crystal resonator as the frequency-determining element. An understanding of the fundamental nature of acceleration sensitivity in crystal oscillators resides primarily in understanding the behavior of the crystal resonator. The driving factor behind the acceleration-induced frequency shift is shown to be deformation of the resonator. The deformation drives two effects: an essentially linear change in the frequency determining dimensions of the resonator and an essentially nonlinear effect of changing the velocity of the propagating wave.","In a similar fashion, the frequency of a piezoelectric resonator is also affected by other stresses that deform the resonator, including gravitational stress, vibration and shock, temperature, aging, thermal hysteresis and so on. Even the acceleration due to gravity produces measurable effects and the frequency of a piezoelectric resonator can shift significantly when turned upside down due to gravity. For example, when an oscillator using an AT-cut crystal is turned upside down, the frequency typically shifts about 4\u00d710and acceleration sensitivity of an AT-cut crystal is typically 2\u00d710g. The sensitivity is the same when the crystal is subjected to vibration, i.e., the time-varying acceleration due to the vibration modulates the frequency at the vibration frequency with amplitude of 2\u00d710g. In the frequency domain, the vibration sensitivity manifests itself as vibration-induced sidebands that appear at plus and minus the vibration frequency away from the carrier frequency. The acceleration sensitivity of SC-cut crystals can be made to be substantially less than that of comparably fabricated AT- or BT-Cut crystals.","The stresses caused by acceleration, vibration and shock are well-known to those skilled in the art. Periodic acceleration in the form of vibration can cause frequency modulation in piezoelectric resonators, and shock can cause a step frequency change in a piezoelectric resonator due to the piezoelectric resonator's acceleration sensitivity. Shock can also cause a permanent frequency change in a piezoelectric resonator if either the supporting structure or the electrodes are stressed beyond their elastic limits. If during shock the elastic limits in the crystal's support structure or in its electrodes are exceeded, the shock can produce a permanent frequency change. Crystal units made with chemically polished plates can withstand shocks in excess of 20,000 g. Such crystals have been successfully fired from howitzers, however this ability to withstand shock is not typical. Therefore the stresses caused by acceleration, vibration and shock and the consequent significant effects on piezoelectric frequency instability have caused prior art piezoelectric resonators to suffer from numerous disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings.","Thus, there has been a long-felt need to provide piezoelectric structures that reduce the undesirable and harmful effects of the stresses caused by acceleration, vibration and shock sensitivity and provide affordable and easy to produce piezoelectric resonators. As a general trend, each order of magnitude in precision of determining the device aspect ratio yields an order of magnitude reduction in the acceleration sensitivity being compensated. For example, if we try to build a length to width ratio of 2:1, making the device 2 mm +\/\u22120.001 mm will be about 10 times better than building it 2 mm +\/\u22120.01 mm, and so on. This inventor has observed that whenever the +\/\u2212tolerance is reduced by a factor of 10, the acceleration sensitivity aspect ratio compensation improves by about the same order of magnitude. In accordance with the present invention, achieving tolerances on the order of microns=0.001 mm should be feasible, as compared to the 1 mm tolerance of the prior art. The structures of the present invention provide reliable piezoelectric restraint mechanisms that substantially reduce the ill effects of acceleration sensitivity through an increasingly rigid and precise orientation system. The innovative piezoelectric resonator stress relief apparatus and systems of the present invention resolve the long-standing disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of prior art acceleration sensitive resonators by stacking a number of rigid plates, layers and spring cushions around the piezoelectric resonator by means of a mounting structure that provides in-plane stress relief and precise definition of the mounting plane. The piezoelectric resonator stress relief apparatus and structures of the present invention can essentially eliminate any deformation or may include precisely defined features to tailor the allowed deformation of the piezoelectric resonator, without suffering from the long-standing disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of prior art acceleration sensitive resonators.","It is an object of the present invention to minimize piezoelectric resonator deformation.","It is another object of the present invention to minimize piezoelectric resonator deformation and precisely control piezoelectric resonator deformation.","It is still a further object of the present invention is to provide a practical means for mounting and packaging a piezoelectric resonator to minimize piezoelectric resonator deformation and precisely control piezoelectric resonator deformation.","It is yet another object of the present invention is to provide a practical means for mounting and packaging a piezoelectric resonator, and precisely controlling resonator deformation using aspect-ratio compensation.","These and other objects and advantages are provided by piezoelectric resonator stress relief apparatus of the present invention comprising a piezoelectric resonator held by means of a mounting structure that provides in-plane stress relief and precise definition of the mounting plane with respect to out-of-plane stresses. The mounting plane may be simple in order to essentially eliminate any deformation or it may include precisely defined features to tailor the allowed deformation of the piezoelectric resonator. The piezoelectric resonator may be a bulk acoustic wave resonator (BAW) comprising a plano-plano, plano-convex or bi-convex thickness profile, or a surface acoustic wave resonator (SAW) comprising a plano-plano thickness profile. Spring cushions that may be formed as either separate components or assembled together with a piezoelectric resonator and a means for lateral restraint provide the in-plane stress relief. In other embodiments, the spring cushions may be an integral part of either the crystal resonator or lateral restraint or as part of a monolithic resonator-spring-restraint assembly.","The lateral profiles of both the resonator and restraint are illustrated as rectangular, however, circular and oval geometries are other likely embodiments for this invention. The present invention also contemplates a piezoelectric resonator stress relief device, a piezoelectric resonator stress relief device, a piezoelectric resonator stress relief packaging system and a monolithic piezoelectric resonator stress relief packaging system.","These and other objects, advantages, and features will become readily apparent in view of the following descriptions.","Referring now to the drawings,  is a breakaway perspective view of the piezoelectric resonator stress relief apparatus  of the present invention depicting a number of different layers and assemblies. The piezoelectric resonator restraint assembly  further comprises a piezoelectric resonator plate  held steady on one surface of a means for lateral restraining  by a plurality of spring cushions  along the edges  of resonator . The piezoelectric resonator stress relief apparatus  of the present invention further comprises stacking the piezoelectric resonator restraint assembly  between an upper plate , a vertical tensioner gasket  and a lower plate . The upper and lower plates,  and  respectively, are also enclosed by an upper lid  and lower lid , respectively. The rectangular crystal piezoelectric resonator plate  provides precise orientation, and the plurality of spring cushions  on each horizontal side  of crystal resonator  provide in-plane stress relief.","Upper lid  is disposed upon a vertical tensioner gasket , which is a thermal expansion gasket used to alleviate excessive vertical pre-tensioning. Gasket  is stacked on upper plate . Gasket  should be compatible with high-vacuum conditions, but must be more compressible than the essentially incompressible piezoelectric resonator plate , spring cushions , plates  and  and the other component parts of the present invention to allow for thermal expansion. Gasket  can also be configured with a predetermined thermal expansion in order to compensate for the other components.","The rigid definition of the lateral restraining means  is accomplished by stacking the piezoelectric resonator restraint assembly  between the rigid upper and lower plates  and ; Upper plate  and lower plate  are preferably formed from a material with maximal stiffness per unit weight and absolute stiffness equal to or greater than that of the piezoelectric resonator plate . An example of a suitable material for the upper plate  and lower plate  would be alumina ceramic.","Upper plate  and lower plate  are depicted with a first and a second opening  and , respectively, in the center of their major surfaces. In operation, the first and second openings  and  provide for two functions. First, they provide traction-free surfaces on the piezoelectrically active areas of the piezoelectric resonator plate . Secondly, the openings  and  allow for application of aspect-ratio compensation to minimize the out-of-plane acceleration-induced frequency shift. In accordance with the present invention, reduced out-of-plane acceleration-induced deformation is readily negated by an aspect-ratio compensation that is applied through the first and second openings  and . The lateral restraint means  and its spring cushions  impinging on the piezoelectric resonator plate  permit an in-plane stress relief that minimizes lateral movement and a reduced in-plane acceleration-induced deformation. The structures of the present invention provide reduced out-of-plane acceleration-induced deformation and reduced in-plane acceleration-induced deformation that result in a more precise aspect ratio yield, a decreased acceleration sensitivity and a decreased amount of acceleration-induced frequency shifts in the resonator . Further, the innovative structure of the present invention reduces the allowed in-plane effects of acceleration to a simple translation as determined by the spring cushions , disposed upon each horizontal side  of the piezoelectric resonator plate . In-plane stress relief in accordance with the present invention reduces the out-of-plane acceleration-induced deformation to a simple flexure, whose overall effects, inclusive of in-plane stretch and thickness compression, can be negated through aspect-ratio compensation. The lower plate  is disposed upon lower lid .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["15","14","11","15","10","11","12","14","11","16","17","21","11","18","20"]},"A number of variations of the piezoelectric resonator stress relief device are within the contemplation of the present invention.
