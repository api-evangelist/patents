MCB0446179 and MCB0956027, National Institutes of Health Grant Nos. R03MH081231, R21NS7740241, P30CA1181000, U54 MH074425 and U54 MH084690 as well as National Institutes of Health, MLPCN, Grant No. (U54 HG005031). The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to the use of small molecule inhibitors of Rab7 GTPase to treat or prevent the onset of Rab7 GTPase-associated disorders such as infectious diseases, neuropathies, immune dysfunction, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and lipid storage diseases. This is due to the critical role Rab7 plays in a host of cellular processes including antigen presentation, autophagy, pathogen degradation and growth factor downregulation that impact intracellular survival of pathogens, immune and neuronal cell function among others. In one aspect, methods of treatment of the invention are used to treat or prevent the onset of hereditary sensory neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B disease. In another aspect, the inhibitor can be used as a scaffold or as a reference for the development of selective inhibitors of related GTPases. Related pharmaceutical compositions, assays, and drug screens are also provided.","Ras and related small molecular weight GTPases function in the regulation of signaling and cell growth, and collectively serve to control cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis () [Takai et al. 2001; Wennerberg et al. 2005]. The Ras-related GTPases are divided into four subfamilies with the Rab proteins regulating membrane transport, Rho proteins (including Rac and Cdc 42) regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and responses to signaling, Arf\/Sar proteins regulating membrane and microtubule dynamics as well as protein transport, and Ran proteins controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport.","Ras and Ras-related GTPase functions are tightly regulated (), and dysregulation is causal in a wide variety of human diseases. Ras mutations resulting in impaired GTP hydrolysis and plasma membrane hyperactivation are linked to many human cancers [Farnsworth et al. 1991; Sukumar et al. 1983; Taparowsky et al. 1982; Boylan et al. 1990; Hruban et al. 2004; Abrams et al. 1996]. Point mutations in the Rab and Rho GTPases are also causal in diverse human diseases affecting pigmentation, immune, and neurologic functions [Houlden et al. 2004; Verhoeven et al 2003; Williams et al. 2000; Bahadoran et al. 2003; and preliminary findings]. Rab and Rho mutants identified in human disease act as dominant negatives either due to a failure to bind GTP or due to inappropriate coupling of the active proteins with downstream effectors. To date, inhibition of Ras and Ras-related proteins has relied largely on altering membrane recruitment with various drugs affecting prenylation [Morgillo F Lee H Y, 2006; Russell R G, 2006; Park, et al. 2002]. Generally, Ras proteins must be farnesylated for proper membrane localization, while Rab and Rho proteins are geranylated. Such strategies lack specificity and are problematic because each of these prenylation machineries is required for the proper function of many Ras superfamily members. Rational drug design has only recently been applied to identify the first two small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase family members [Gao, et al. 2004; Nassar et al. 2006]. There are currently no nucleotide binding inhibitors or analogs for any member of the GTPase superfamily, prompting us to undertake a high throughput screen resulting in the identification of novel chemical entitites described herein ().","The Rab GTPase subfamily is responsible for regulating membrane transport of proteins and lipids shuttling between various intracellular destinations with individual members governing specific transport events and causal in human disease (). Rab7 is a regulator of transport from early to late endosomes and as such is critical for growth factor receptor down-regulation, for control of cell fate through autophagy pathways, nutrient uptake, immune cell regulation, to name a few (). Thus, Rab7 is a late endosome-\/lysosome-associated small GTPase. Rab7 plays critical roles in the endocytic processes. Through interaction with its partners (including upstream regulators and downstream effectors), Rab7 participates in multiple regulation mechanisms in endosomal sorting, biogenesis of lysosome (or LRO (lysosome-related organelle)) and phagocytosis. These processes are important in substrate degradation, antigen presentation, cell signaling, cell survival and microbial pathogen infection. Consistently, mutations or dysfunctions of Rab7 result in traffic disorders, which cause various diseases, such as neurologic disorders (Alzheimer's, Downs, sensory neuropathies), bone metabolic disorders, cancer and lipid metabolism or storage diseases (, -). Rab7 inactivation plays important roles in microbial pathogen infection and survival, as well as in participating in the life cycle of viruses {Zhang, M., Cheng, L., Wang, S. and Wang, T. 2009, 29:193-209).","Hereditary sensory neuropathies (HSNs) are a group of genetically determined peripheral neuropathies with prominent disturbance of the peripheral sensory neurons (). They are characterized by sensory loss, insensitivity to pain, a variable degree of muscle weakness and wasting, as well as autonomic features. Frequent complications are foot ulcerations and infections that may lead to osteomyelitis, followed by necrosis and amputations. Consequently, the hereditary sensory neuropathies have also been termed ulceromutilating neuropathies. On the other hand, in the presence of additional motor weakness, they have been sub-classified among the group of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disorders, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder (\u02dc1:2500) that causes peripheral neuropathy, foot ulcers and frequently requires amputation. Sporadic and familial cases with different modes of inheritance are known to affect both children and adults. The most prevalent forms of the autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary sensory neuropathies are HSN I and CMT2B. HSN1 is associated with mutations in the SPTLC1 gene, whereas mutations in the Rab7 gene have been identified in CMT2B that result in mutant proteins with single amino acid substitutions of highly conserved residues (). The mutants are thought to disrupt critical functions of Rab7 in shuttling cargo between the neuronal synapse and the soma where signaling to the nucleus occurs. The enumerated roles and disease associations of Rab7 thus provides a rationale to identify small molecules that may functionally modulate Rab7 GTPase. Currently, there are no small molecules directed against any member of the Rab GTPase family despite their diverse cellular functions that ensure normal physiology.","It is an object of the present invention to provide novel methods of treating or preventing the onset of Rab 7 GTPase associated disorders such as infectious diseases, neuropathies, cancer and lipid metabolism and storage diseases.","It is a more particular object of the present invention to provide novel methods of treating or preventing the onset of Rab 7 GTPase associated hereditary sensory neuropathies (HSNs) such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B disease.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions that are useful in the treatment or prevention of Rab 7 GTPase associated disorders either through the inhibition or activation of Rab7 GTPases function.","It is a further object of the invention to provide novel small molecule based assays and screens that are useful in determining Rab GTPase functional inhibition or activation in vitro and in vivo and that may also aid in determining structure activity relationships of the identified small molecule(s).","It is another object of the current invention to use the small molecule guanine nucleotide binding inhibitor as a template\/scaffold for the design of selective and specific competitive guanine nucleotide binding inhibitors for other small GTPase super family members such as Rho-family members (Rae, Rho and Cdc42), Ras, Arf, and Ran. The current scaffold does not inhibit G-protein coupled receptor family of GTPases Inhibition of ATP binding has proved effective for inhibiting kinases through various inhibitors (e.g. imatinib, gefitinib, vandetanib, among others) that are now commonly used to treat many different human diseases and especially multiple cancers.","It is still a further object of the invention to modulate the scaffold such that it can either freeze Rab7 in the constitutively active or constitutively inactive states. Inactivation of mutant or hyperactive proteins would be applicable in neurodegenerative disorders, osteoporosis and cancers. Activation would be applicable in diseases where Rab7 function is insufficient or aberrantly inactivated. Examples include, lipid storage diseases where overexpression of wild-type Rab7 has been shown to be beneficial {Choudhury, A et al., 2002; J. Clin Invest. 109:1541}, osteopetrosis and pathogen-mediated infectious diseases where Rab7 inactivatation enables pathogen survival {Zhang et al., Biosci Reports attached}. A currently FDA approved treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C disease entails cholesterol depletion via central nervous system administration of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin. This compound is highly toxic and systemic administration causes lysis of red blood cells and death in animals. Thus, other improved therapies are still urgently needed.","Any one or more of these and\/or other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the drawings and descriptions herein.","The invention relates to small molecule inhibitors or activators of Rab7 GTPase to treat or prevent the onset of Rab7 GTPase associated disorders such as neuropathies, cancer and lipid metabolism disease.

The compound has nanomolar potency and 90% efficacy against the Rab7 GTPase (, -), as measured using in vitro assays, as well as in cell-based assays, and as described further below. The compound also showed some efficacy against other small GTPases of the Rho-family, Ras and Rab family (). The compound was identified by screening the NIH Roadmap of more than three hundred thousand unique chemical compounds using an in vitro BODIPY-GTP binding assay, as explained hereinafter. Active small molecules were identified by scoring for a greater than 20% increase or decrease in fluorescent GTP-binding relative to untreated controls. Hence the scaffold in conjunction with known GTPase structures and rationale drug design may serve as a template for generating selective derivatives with greater efficacy and potency on individual small GTPase subfamilies such as Arf, Rho-family, Ras, and Ran all of which are associated with human diseases from cancers to ciliopathies affecting kidney, pancreas, liver and vision.","Based on in vitro analyses described below, CID1067700 behaves like a competitive inhibitor (, D, -) and docking studies show the compound can be accommodated in the nucleotide binding pocket of Rab7 in both the GTP-bound and GDP-bound conformations (, -). In some cell based assays, CID1067700 may mimic the activated state of Rab7 and increase membrane bound Rab7 (). This can occur by CID1067700 binding to the nucleotide pocket and promoting the transition of the Rab7 GTPase into the GTP-bound conformation. In other cell-based assays the compound was found to act as an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor degradation, a process dependent on active Rab7 for transport to lysosomes and implying Rab7 inactivation (). Hence, the scaffold through further development of structure activity relationships can serve as a template for inhibition of function by favoring Rab7 in the inactive GDP-bound conformation or activation of function by favoring the Rab7 in the active GTP-bound conformation.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B disease patients retain a wild type protein ().

Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged Rab7 GTPase was bound to glutathione beads, labeled with a red fluorescence intensity. Beads were mixed dispensed into 384-well plates with test compounds, and fluorescent-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding was used as the readout. This novel multiplex assay allowed the authors to screen a library of almost 200,000 compounds and identify positive compounds, which were further verified by dose-response analyses, using 6- to 8-plex assays. After the elimination of false-positive and false-negative compounds, PubChem No. CID1067700 was identified and characterized. CID1067700 was shown to be a general inhibitor of small molecular weight GTPases. It is the first small molecule to prevent guanine nucleotide binding and to inhibit a Rab subfamily member. As detailed in this invention, CID1067700 inhibits the Rab7 GTPase in a dose-dependent manner with high potency and efficacy and is active in biochemical and cell-based secondary assays.","As depicted in , over 300,000 unique chemical compounds in the NIH Roadmap small molecule library were screened for Rab7 GTPase-inhibition using an in vitro BODIPY-GTP binding assay in accordance with the protocols described herein. Active small molecules were identified by scoring for a greater than 20% increase or decrease in fluorescent GTP-binding relative to untreated controls. PubChem No. CID1067700 (aka ML282 and MLS000673908) (2-(benzoylcarbamothioylamino)-5,5-dimethyl-4,7-dihydrothieno[2,3-c]pyran-3-carboxylic acid) (, ) was determined to be the most active inhibitor of Rab7 GTPase. Subsequent chemical synthesis and structure activity analyses identified several additional compounds with high efficacy and potency (, , -, ).","High Throughput Flow Cytometry Protocol","Bead sets were coated with individual GST-small G proteins, blocked with Buffer (0.01% NP-40; 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 100 mM KCl; 20 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.1% BSA and 1 mM DTT), incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C., and finally washed in buffer. The different bead sets, acquired from Duke Scientific, had similar size (\u02dc4 microm diameter) however they were distinguished by varied magnitude of emission at 665+\/\u221210 nm with excitation at 635 nm.","The assay was conducted in 384-well microplates in a total well volume of 10.1 microliters (5 microliters of bead mixture, 0.1 microliters of test compound, and 5 microliters of 200 nM Bodipy-FL-GTP in buffer containing BSA and DTT for a final concentration of BODIPY-GTP of 100 nM). Positive Controls, which contain bead mixture and BODIPY-GTP but no test compound, are located in columns 1 and 2 on plate. Negative Controls containing bead mixture with BODIPY-GTP and 0.5 mM unlabeled GTP, were collected from a separate test tube. Plates were placed on rotators and incubated for 40-45 minutes at 4 degrees C.","Test compounds were cherry-picked from compound storage plates at 10 mM in neat DMSO, then serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations in DMSO. Final compound dilutions in DMSO ranged from 1 microM to 10 mM. These dilutions were then diluted 1 to 100 to give an assay concentration range of 10 nM to 100 \u03bcM.","Beads were coated with proteins as described in the primary screening procedure. Dose response experiments reported here include one multiplex format for Rab7 wt and GST-GFP.","Sample acquisition and preliminary analysis was conducted with the HyperCyt\u00ae high throughput flow cytometry platform. The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates [Kuckuck, et al., 2001; Ramirez, et al., 2003]. The stream of particles is excited at 488 nm and 635 nm, and flow cytometric data of light scatter and fluorescence emission at 530+\/\u221220 nm (FL1) and emission at 665+\/\u221210 nm (FL8) are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako). Analysis of the time-resolved acquisition data file uses IDLE Query software to merge the flow cytometry data files with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip software. The raw data were parsed in IDLe Query software to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well. The parsed data were then processed through an Excel template file constructed specifically for the assay to segregate data for each target and the fluorescence scavenger in the multiplex. Gating based on forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters was used to identify singlet bead populations. Gating based on FL8 emission distinguishes the beads coated with different proteins, and the green median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per bead population (well) was calculated.","Calculations","In dose response experiments, the assay was performed without compound (DMSO control) and with nine different concentrations of compound, from 10 nM to 100 \u03bcM, to produce a series of 9 data points. IDLe Query software calculates the median channel fluorescence (MCF) for each of these ligand concentrations, generating competition curves.","Ligand competition curves were fitted by Prism\u00ae software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using nonlinear least-squares regression in a sigmoidal dose response model with variable slope, also known as the four parameter logistic equation. Curve fit statistics were used to determine the following parameters of the model: EC50, microM\u2014concentration of added test compound competitor that inhibited fluorescent ligand binding by 50 percent; LOGEC50\u2014the logarithm of EC50; TOP\u2014the response value at the top plateau; BOTTOM\u2014the response value at the bottom plateau; HILLSLOPE\u2014the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient; STD_LOGEC50, STD_TOP, STD_BOTTOM, STD_HILLSLOPE\u2014standard errors of LOGEC50, TOP, BOTTOM, and HILLSLOPE; EC5095CI_LOW, EC5095CI_HIGH\u2014the low and high boundaries of the 95% confidence interval of the EC50 estimate, RSQR\u2014the correlation coefficient (r squared) indicative of goodness-of-fit.","In order to be considered active and get a score >0, the compounds have to pass the following criteria:","8<LOGEC50<\u22124 (the computed EC50 value should be in the interval of tested concentrations)","0.5<|HILLSLOPE|<2 (the absolute value of HILLSLOPE should be higher than 0.5 and lower than 2)","[TOP-STD_TOP]>[BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM] (the amplitude of the biological signal should be statistically significant)","|LOGEC50|>STD_LOGEC50 (the standard error of LOGEC50 should be lower than the absolute value of LOGEC50)","|HILLSLOPE|>STD_HILL SLOPE (idem for the HILLSLOPE)","[TOP-BOTTOM] scavenger<0.5*[TOP-BOTTOM] target (the inherent fluorescence of the test compound should be lower than 50% of the biological signal)","[TOP-BOTTOM]\/TOP for GST-GFP<0.5*[TOP-BOTTOM]\/TOP for the target (the interference of the compound with the GST\/GSH interaction should be lower than 50% of the biological signal).","The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the following equation;\n\nPUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE=1000*(\u22124\u2212LOG 50)\/4*[(TOP-STD_TOP)\u2212(BOTTOM+STD_BOTTOM)]\/TOP*(1\u2212\u2225HILLSLOPE|\u22121|)*(1\u2212STD_LOG 50\/|LOGEC50|).\n","In this assay active compounds have the activity score higher or equal than 1, and for inactive compounds the activity score is 0.","In the experiments of this example, it was determined: (1) that CID1067700 modulates Rab7 wild-type, Rab7T22N and Rab7Q67L guanine nucleotide interaction in vitro and Rab7 wild-type membrane association in cell based assays; and (2) that Rab7WT protein-protein interactions can be assayed in vitro enabling testing of CID1067700 modulation of specific protein-protein interactions.","Assessment of Binding and Kinetics of Binding and Disassociation (, -) Protocol","Rab7WT (4 microM) was bound to glutathione beads overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Rab7WT on GSH-beads was depleted of nucleotide by incubating with 10 mM EDTA containing buffer for 20 min at 30\u00b0 C., washing twice with 0.01% NP-40 containing HPS buffer, then re-suspending in the same buffer containing 1 milliM EDTA, 1 milliM DTT and 0.1% BSA. Kinetic assays were performed by incubating 50 microliter of GST-Rab7WT-GSH-bead suspension for 2 min with either DMSO, or 10 \u03bcM CID1067700 and subsequently adding 50 \u03bcl of various concentration ice cold BODIPY-GTP. Association of the fluorescent nucleotide was measured using a FacSCAN flow cytometer in the kinetic mode. Data were converted to ASCII format using IDLE Query software.","Measured values of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP after 3 minutes of binding were converted to molecular equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) with the aid of calibration beads (Bangs Lab) by the following equation;\n\nMESF=Slope*MCF+Intercept\n\nwhere MCF is the Median Channel Fluorescence measurement of bead-bound BODIPY-GTP, kMESF are kiloMESF (1000*MESF), and Slope and Intercept are the from the linear regression fit of the 5 different levels of calibration beads.\n","The resulting values of kMESF were graphed versus the different concentrations of BODIPY-GTP in GraphPad Prism and fitted by non-linear regression to one site binding pre the following equation;\n\nMESF=max*ConcBODIPY-GTP\/(+ConcBODIPY-GTP)\n\nwhere ConcBODIPY-GTP is the concentration of BODIPY-GTP, Bmax is the maximum binding of BODIPY-GTP per bead and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant of BODIPY-GTP to protein on bead.\n","Based on the equilibrium binding results shown in  (left panel) and the competition curve results shown  (right panel), as well as  it was concluded that CID1067700 bound to the nucleotide binding pocket of Rab7 GTPase.","Referring to , binding and disassociation experiments were conducted in which increasing amounts of DMSO or another inhibitor were added in accordance with a dilution protocol as described above and mean channel fluorescence (MCF) values were determined. Based on the results shown in , it was concluded that CID1067700 is a competitive inhibitor of the nucleotide binding site of Rab7 GTPase.","Virtual Docking Studies","Virtual docking studies were conducted and it was determined that CID1067700 docked to the Rab7 nucleotide binding pocket in both the GDP and GTP conformations (, ).","CID1067700 as a Potential Modulator of Rab7WT Protein-Protein Interaction In Vitro","The putative functions and malfunctions of proteins encoded by genes mutated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in normal and affected peripheral nerves may be investigated. Some proteins implicated in demyelinating CMT, peripheral myelin protein 22, protein zero (P0), and connexin32 (Cx32\/GJB1) are crucial components of myelin. Periaxin is involved in connecting myelin to the surrounding basal lamina. Early growth response 2 (EGR2) and Sox10 are transcriptional regulators of myelin genes. Mutations in proteins associated with endosomes and lysosomes are central players in CMT (). The late endosomal GTPase Rab7 controls phospholipid synthesis and signaling, while the lipid phosphatases myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2), and MTMR13\/set-binding factor 2 are involved lipid dephosphorylation and signal termination. Together these proteins regulate membrane trafficking that is critical for myelin homeostasis and nerve growth factor mediated signaling and receptor degradation. Pathomechanisms related to alterations of endocytic processes are a widespread phenomenon in demyelinating neuropathies because of their essential nature in myelin homeostasis. Due to the close interaction between myelinating Schwann cells and neurons, related disease mechanisms are also involved in axonal neuropathies although there is considerably more functional heterogeneity. Some mutations, most notably in P0, GJB1, ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1), neurofilament light chain (NF-L), and dynamin 2 (DNM2), can result in demyelinating or axonal neuropathies introducing additional complexity in the pathogenesis. Often, this relates to the intimate connection between Schwann cells and neurons\/axons leading to axonal damage even if the mutation-caused defect is Schwann-cell-autonomous. See . This mechanism is likely for P0 and Cx32 mutations and provides the basis for the unifying hypothesis that also demyelinating neuropathies develop into functional axonopathies. In GDAP1 and DNM2 mutants, both Schwann cells and axons\/neurons might be directly affected. NF-L mutants have a primary neuronal defect but also cause demyelination.","As shown in , Rab7 function in endocytosis depends on protein-protein interactions.  illustrates how CID1067700 could be used to test and modulate Rab7WT protein-protein in vivo.","Results of an in vitro binding study using Rab7-GFP and GST-DENN fusion proteins pre-coupled to GSH beads ( panel A) confirmed that Rab7 interacts with MTMR13 via a DENN domain. As shown in  (panel B), another in vitro binding assay using His-tagged Rab7 immobilized on Ni beads and GTP confirmed GTP binding by His-Rab7. RILP is an effector of Rab7 and only binds to the GTP-conformer ( panel C-D). Inlcusion of the inhibitor blocked RILP binding ( panel C). Thus, the combination of these assays can be used to discern nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, as well as protein-protein interactions. The assays can also measure if a small molecule binds the guanine nucleotide binding pocket, interferes with protein-protein interaction or causes the protein to adopt the GTP- or GDP-bound conformations.","Results of an immunofluorescence study indicate that CID1067700 increased membrane localization of Rab7 in a HeLa cell line. See . Measurement of growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in response to growth factor stimulation, showed CID1067700 inhibited lysosomal degradation, in human keratinocytes (SCC-12F) and cervical carcinoma cells overexpressing Rab7 (HeLa-Rab7 wt), a process that depends on Rab7 activity (). These data confirm that small molecule is capable of crossing the cell membrane and altering Rab7 activity in situ. It also illustrates that small molecules can modulate activation status through binding to the guanine nucleotide binding pocket. Thus, depending on the fit in the pocket, the molecule could give rise to a protein that is constitutively active or inactive. Such compounds have utility for treatment of human diseases including genetic and acquired diseases where Rab7 is defective or hyperactivated (lipid storage disorders, bone metabolic diseases, cancers, neuropathies, among others) and infectious diseases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0218"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 21","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0220","num":"0219"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIGS. 26-28"]},"Methods","Reagents","Reagents used in this study were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Sephadex G-25, glutathione (GSH) Sepharose 4B, and Superdex peptide beads (13 \u03bcm with an exclusion limit of 7 kDa) were from Amersham Biosciences. BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene or dipyrromethene boron difluoride) nucleotide analogues (BODIPY FL GTP 2\u2032-(or 3\u2032)-O\u2014[N-(2-aminoethyl)urethane] G-35778 and BODIPY FL GDP 2\u2032-(or -3\u2032)-O\u2014[N-(2-aminoethyl)urethane], G-22360) were from Invitrogen Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, Calif., USA). Concentrations of BODIPY nucleotides were based on absorbance measurements and an extinction coefficient value of 80,000 Mcm. 2-(benzoylcarbamothioylamino)-5,5-dimethyl-4,7-dihydrothieno[2,3-c]pyran-3-carboxylic acid with compound identification number (CID) 1067700 was from ChemDiv.","Expression and Purification of GST-Rab7","GST-Rab7 protein was expressed in BL21(DE3). Cultures were grown at 37\u00b0 C. to a bacterial density of 0.5-0.7 absorbance units at 595 nm and protein induced by transfer to room temperature and addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16-18 h to maximize yield of properly folded active fusion protein. Purification of GST-Rab7 was performed according to standard procedures and as previously described (34).","High GSH density beads used for flow cytometry were synthesized by loading Superdex peptide beads with GSH as previously reported (34, 35).","Immobilization of Rab7 on GSH Beads for Flow Cytometry","All nucleotide binding to Rab7 and measurements were performed in the HPS buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl and 100 mM KCl) containing 1 mM EDTA. A BectonDickinson FACScan flow cytometer with a 488-nm excitation laser and standard detection optics was used for all assays (33). Pure GST-Rab7 protein was incubated in 96-well plates at 4\u00b0 C. overnight with 10GSH beads in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl of HPS buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) added fresh. Unbound protein was removed by centrifugation twice at 800 g and resuspension in fresh buffer.","Dose Response or Competition Binding Assays","Dose response assays were conducted in two different modes. In the first case, 2\u00d710GSH beads loaded with GST-Rab7 were incubated with a fixed concentration of nucleotide (GDP or GTP) for 1 h in the presence of 1% DMSO (final) or increasing concentrations of CID1067700 (10-100 \u03bcM) in 1% DMSO and a total volume of 20 \u03bcl on a 96-well plate. A stock solution of CID1067700 (10 mM) was prepared in 100% DMSO and stored in single use aliquots at \u221280\u00b0 C. In the second mode, 2\u00d710GSH beads loaded with GST-Rab7 protein were incubated for 2 h 15 min at 4\u00b0 C. with varying concentrations of fluorescent guanine nucleotide (0-2 \u03bcM) in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl on a 96-well plate in the presence of either 1% DMSO or a fixed CID1067700 concentration (0.1-1 \u03bcM). For measurements on the flow cytometer, samples were transferred to a tube suitable (BD Bioscience) for flow cytometry and were diluted at least 10-fold in HPS buffer. This dilution step was necessary to ensure discrimination of bead-associated fluorescence and background fluorescence of soluble proteins and also ensured sufficient sample volume for the measurement.","Nucleotide Dissociation Assays","Nucleotide dissociation under equilibrium conditions was accomplished by first loading GST-Rab7 with fixed concentrations of BODIPY-GTP (100 nM) or BODIPY-GDP (40 nM) for 2 hr 15 min at 4\u00b0 C. followed by initiating release of bound nucleotide with either unlabeled GDP (10 \u03bcM) or CID1067700 (10 \u03bcM). As a negative control, GST-Rab7 was preloaded with unlabelled GDP (1 mM) for 2 hr 15 mM at 4\u00b0 C. prior to adding BODIPY-GTP or BODIPY-GDP at the above concentrations for a further 2 hr 15 min and then similarly initiating release of bound BODIPY-linked nucleotide with unlabeled GDP (10 \u03bcM) to obtain fluorescence for non-specific binding under equilibrium binding conditions. This low level bead associated fluorescence was subtracted from specific binding to obtain accurate measurement of the off rates. Data normalization was performed by subtracting dilution only values from competitor treated experimental values.","Molecular Docking of CID1067700 on Rab7","Docking calculations were performed using OpenEye Fred (Fred, version 2.2.5, OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc., Santa Fe, N. Mex., USA, www.eyesopen.com, 2010) docking software. Rab7 crystal structures (PDB code: 1T91 GDP-conformer, 1VG8 GNP-conformer) were used to dock CID1067700 on Rab7 for the wild type. Chemgauss3 scoring function was used to evaluate ligand binging potential. Docking simulations provide only a qualitative assessment of binding probability of our ligand to Rab7 and should be examined with care, however the results indicate that CID1067700 can potentially bind to Rab7 nucleotide binding site and no steric constrains were observed.","Data Analyses","All data processing and analyses employed GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software). For kinetic experiments, raw data acquired were first processed using IDLE query software (obtained from University of New Mexico Center for Molecular Discovery, UNM CMD) before further analysis using GraphPad Prism. All experiments are representative of at least three independent trials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0228"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00020","num":"00020"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00020","he":"177.04mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08765803-20140701-C00020.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"General experimental and analytical details: H and C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer (operating at 400 and 101 MHz respectively) in CDClwith 0.03% TMS as an internal standard or DMSO-d.

The eight GTPases were grouped into two sets: Rab7, H-Ras wild type and its V12 mutant, and Cdc42 and its L61 mutant were assayed in a buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, while Rho, Rac1 and its L61 mutant, and Cdc42 and its L61 mutant were assayed in the same buffer but instead containing 1 mM Mg with Cdc42 and its mutant being tested in both buffers. Besides 1 mM EDTA or 1 mM Mg, the buffer contained 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v\/v) NP-40 and 1% BSA. For each multiplex reaction, an extra set of beads was included to serve as scavengers to bind any proteins that dissociate from their assigned bead set and thereby reduce interference due to protein dissociation during the assay. As a control, GST-tagged GFP was bound to a set of glutathione beads in a separate reaction to make sure that the fluorescence drop observed in the assay reaction in the presence of a compound was not due to fluorescence quenching of GFP nor interference of GST-tagged protein binding to beads, but due to the bona fide inhibition of fluorescent nucleotide binding. The assay protocol has been described previously [29-30]. Briefly, each individual GST-tagged enzyme was incubated with 4 \u03bcm glutathione-coated microsphere beads overnight with gentle rotation. The microsphere beads have different red fluorescence dyes incorporated and therefore could be separated by a flow cytometer. The unbound enzyme was removed by sufficient washing with the buffer. The bead sets were then combined and dispensed to 384-well plates at 5 \u03bcL\/well. For one plate, 0.5 \u03bcg each of the enzymes and 4.0\u00d710of each bead were used. Then 100 nL compound was added using Biomek FX followed by the addition of 5 \u03bcL\/well of BODIPY-FL-GTP (ribose-linked BODIPY). For assays carried out in EDTA-containing buffer, the final concentration of BODIPY-FL-GTP was 100 nM while in Mg buffer, the concentration of BODIPY-FL-GTP was 1 nM. The plate was incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 h with gentle rotation. The beads were aspirated and delivered with the HyperCyt\u00ae instrument and read on CyAnADP flow cytometer. Forward scatter and side scatter was used to define the whole bead population. FL9 channel (ext\/em: 635\/750LP nm) was used to separate different bead sets each of which was bound with an individual enzyme. FL1 channel (ext\/em: 488\/530 nm) measures the FITC fluorescence associated with the beads. The data was analyzed by the HyperView\u00ae software developed by Dr. Bruce Edward at the University of New Mexico.","Secondary Assays","Cytotoxicity of Compounds","U937 cells were grown to a density of 0.4\u00d710cells\/mL Compounds were added to a final concentration of 20 \u03bcM or otherwise indicated.

U937 \u0394ST cells (0.4\u22120.8\u00d710cells\/mL) were constantly stirred with a magnetic stir bar at 500 rpm in a test tube. The fluorescence was recorded on a FACScan flow cytometer. The base line fluorescence of the cells was established for 30s. FITC-LDV at a concentration of 4 nM was then added. After the fluorescence stabilized at around 120s, the chemotactic ligand N-formyl peptide was added for stimulation resulting activation of VLA-4 integrin and additional FITC-LDV binding. When a plateau was reached at around 280s, compounds at different concentrations were added to the cell suspension. Fluorescence was continually recorded until no further change was observed.

that inhibits fluorescent guanine nucleotide binding to all of the small GTPases tested which included representatives of Rho, Ras and Rab subfamilies. The compound was titrated in the presence of fluorescent GTP and the ECvalues for the panel were determined to be in the nanomolar potency range. The biochemical binding assay was performed in a multiplex format with multiple purified GST-GTPases tested simultaneously. Integrin VLA4 binding towards its receptors is known to be activated by Rho GTPases. This interaction was found to be inhibited by CID1067700. EGFR degradation in response to growth factor stimulation was used to assess cellular inhibition of Rab-regulated pathways. CID1067700 inhibited EGFR degradation in two independent cell lines. Thus, CID1067700 is capable of inhibiting both Rho and Rab subfamily GTPases in cells. SAR was also conducted to characterize the molecular features that are important for the CID1067700 activity.","Scaffold\/Moiety Chemical Liabilities","Aqueous PBS and media solubility was for CID1067700 and several analogs was determined to be excellent. The thienylpyran-benzoylthiourea scaffold and its derivatives have been easily handled in terms of stability to reaction conditions, exposure to acid or base, heating, and general manipulation. We have not observed decomposition under these conditions nor have we experienced any chemical liability with these compounds. Most compounds were obtained as stable solid materials. The CID1067700 structure does not contain moieties that are known generally to be reactive. As discussed above, aqueous stability of CID1067700 revealed that after 48 h, only 77% of parent compound remained. It is unknown at this time what degradation might be occurring or what this result truly represents. As it was also shown, treatment of CID1067700 with excess glutathione for 72 h at 37\u00b0 C. did not result in LCMS detection of any conjugates or other product peaks; only the unchanged parent CID1067700 was detected. These results suggest that the compound is not generally electrophilic or susceptible to protein-derived nucleophiles. The team recommends generally that CID1067700 be prepared for dilution prior to use in any assay, as opposed to doing so days in advance.","SAR Tables","The HTS effort produced a single hit that demonstrated potent Rab7 potency and was suitable for chemical manipulation and SAR exploration. The potency for the thienylpyran hit of interest (CID1067700, 2 batches were used: SIDs 57578339 and 85747738, ) showed inhibition for each of the tested GTPases in the panel with potencies for each summarized in the table set forth in . While the hit met the defined probe criteria, the team set out to determine if the hit scaffold had tractable SAR and if any selectivity could be developed through the generation of supporting analogs. For this effort, 39 compounds were tested (31 synthesized, 8 purchased), and all analogs were purified and analyzed for structural integrity and purity prior to assay. The SAR strategy focused on five regions of the scaffold (shaded areas, ).","Data from the primary assay using EDTA were used to drive the SAR, except for Rac and Rho GTPases which could not be assessed under these conditions. These targets, Rab7 and Cdc42, were also assayed using magnesium, and that data are tabulated for comparison in this section. The parent hit compound, submitted as two separate batches, was found to potently inhibit each of the GTPases in the panel. The separate batches of the hit and the associated data are listed individually (Table 4, entries 1-2), along with averaged values (entry 3). Generally, for active compounds, the percent response for Rab7 was greater than that for other GTPases.","Some of the first structural modifications that were investigated involved modification of the pyran ring. Reducing the steric bulk at the gem dimethyl position, effected by removal of one or both of the methyl groups (entries 4 and 5, respectively), was tolerated without much change in potency or selectivity. Likewise, exchange for one methyl group for ethyl or installation of a spiro-cyclopentane ring (entries 6 and 7, respectively) afforded analogs with profiles analogous to the hit activity. Exchange of the gem dimethyl groups for a t-butyl group resulted in a decline in potency, particularly for Rab7 (entry 8). Lastly, replacement of the pyran oxygen atom with a methylene unit (entry 9, X=O\u2192CH) did not appreciably alter the activity profile from that of the hit. These changes indicated that the pyran ring is relatively flexible in terms of substitution and alteration without attenuating potency; however, these measured modifications also did not affect selectivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0312","num":"0314"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00048","num":"00048"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00048","he":"33.53mm","wi":"58.25mm","file":"US08765803-20140701-C00048.TIF","alt":"embedded

was shifted to the importance of the carboxylic acid moiety. Esterification of this functionality resulted in loss of activity for all GTPases tested; thereby, indicating it was essential for retaining potency (data not shown). Isosteres or other replacements were not pursued due to synthetic challenges; however, this may be a possibility in future work. Alterations of the thiourea-carbonyl linker were also briefly studied (). Replacement of the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom (SID 99381130) led to an average 7-fold loss in potency across all GTPases. Replacement of the carbonyl with a methylene unit (SID 9938117) or alternatively, removal of the carbonyl (SID 99381127), thus shortening the linker, led to inactive analogs for all GTPases.","Most structural variations resulted from phenyl moiety substitutions (Table 4). Generally, of the 2- or 3- or 4-substituted phenyl rings that were tested, 2-substituted phenyl rings were the least active. Regardless of the electronics of the substituent installed on the ring, none were more beneficial than the parent structure which possessed an unsubstituted phenyl ring. Replacement of the phenyl ring with other heterocycles such as 2-furyl or 2-thiophene (entries 16 and 17) gave analogs with profiles analogous to the parent hit. The 2-thiophene analog possessed a slightly better potency profile across all GTPases tested, and no changes in selectivity were noted. A non-aromatic cyclohexyl substituent was also surveyed (entry 18) without benefit.","Probe Selection The structural modifications described in this section delivered several analogs with potency near that of the hit and demonstrated that there are critical features of the scaffold that are necessary for retaining potency.

Briefly, six sets of beads (each with a unique red fluorescence intensity) were individually coated with six representative GST-tagged Ras-related GTPases (Cdc42 wt, Rac1wt, Rac1Q61L, Rab2 wt, Rab7 wt, and H-Ras wt) (). The individually conjugated beads were then assayed in the presence of individual compounds in the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository using a HyperCyt flow cytometry to identify molecules that altered the binding of fluorescent nucleotide to Ras-family GTPases (36). CID1067700 () was identified as a hit that decreased fluorescent nucleotide (GTP) binding in the primary screen and was confirmed in secondary, multiplex dose response assays to have an ECof 20-500 nM and at least 40% inhibition against all tested GTPases (). CID1067700 was the only compound identified in the screen to have significant inhibitory activity against the Rab GTPases (Rab2 and Rab7). Because of its pronounced inhibitory effect on BODIPY-nucleotide binding (>90%) to Rab7 (), analogous to unlabeled nucleotides (), and the absence of any known chemical inhibitors for Rab-family GTPases, we further characterized the mechanism of CID1067700 inhibition using Rab7 as a model protein.","Dose Dependent Inhibition of Rab7 Nucleotide Binding by CID1067700","Single-plex dose response measurements were used to determine the inhibitory efficacy and potency of CID1067700 on nucleotide binding by Rab7. This allowed the GDP and GTP concentrations in the assay to be fixed to the previously determined equilibrium dissociation constants (K=100 nM BODIPY-GTP; K=40 nM BODIPY-GDP) for the wild-type (wt) Rab7 protein (33). Increasing CID1067700 concentrations resulted in strong inhibition of both BODIPY-GDP- and BODIPY-GTP-binding by Rab7 wt with ECvalues of 25 nM for BODIPY-GTP and 40 nM for BODIPY-GDP (). The efficacy of inhibition was 40% for BODIPY-GDP and 80% for BODIPY-GTP. These results demonstrate high efficacy and potency of the CID1067700 molecule with respect to inhibition of Rab7 nucleotide binding. Maximum inhibition by CID1067700 occurred at 1-10 \u03bcM concentration range. Lower inhibitory efficacy against BODIPY-GDP binding may either represent a preference for one nucleotide conformer over another or the known higher affinity of Rab7 for GDP than for GTP (33, 37).","Inhibition of Rab7 wt nucleotide binding by CID1067700 could be effected through allosteric or competitive binding. To distinguish between the two scenarios, we tested the inhibition of Rab7 wt by CID1067700 under conditions where CID1067700 concentration was held at a fixed concentration (100-200 nM) while increasing the concentration of the fluorescent nucleotide competitor (-). These values were equivalent to approximately 5 times the observed ECfor CID1067700 using each of the two nucleotides. The inhibitory effect of CID1067700 was most pronounced at lower nucleotide concentrations, resulting in an overall rightward shift of the dose response curves (). Significantly, both control (DMSO only) and inhibitor (CID1067700 treated) curves had statistically similar Bvalues that correspond to the number of binding sites on Rab7 (). Thus, at high concentrations, the nucleotide out competes the CID1067700 compound for the binding pocket, accounting for the Bvalues that are not statistically different. On the contrary, there was \u22663-fold increase in the observed ECfor both nucleotides in the presence of CID1067700 indicating competition of nucleotides by the inhibitor. Inhibitor constants (K) calculated using Cheng Prusoff equation (38) show a 2-fold increase between inhibition of BODIPY-GTP and BODIPY-GDP confirming that CID1067700 is better at inhibiting BODIPY-GTP binding than BODIPY-GDP binding (Supplemental Table 51). Analysis of the constitutively active Rab7Q67L and dominant negative Rab7T22N mutants, that mimic the GTP-bound and GDP-bound conformers respectively showed that both were similarly inhibited by CID1067700 (-). The composite data suggest that the CID1067700 compound and the nucleotide most likely compete for the nucleotide binding pocket of Rab7.","CID1067700 does not Affect Nucleotide Release by Rab7","To further confirm the mode of Rab7 nucleotide inhibition by CID1067700, we analyzed the fluorescent nucleotide dissociations rates from Rab7 in the presence of CID1067700. The experiment was carried out by pre-binding BODIPY-GTP or BODIPY-GDP to GST-tagged Rab7 protein to equilibrium and then assaying for the loss of fluorescence over time occasioned by the release of bound nucleotide (). As a competitor, we used CID1067700 (10 \u03bcM) or unlabeled GDP (10 \u03bcM). Dissociation rate constants were calculated from data fit to exponential functions using Prism software. Kvalues of Rab7 wt obtained at room temperature were statistically similar between unlabeled GDP and CID1067700 competitor for both BODIPY-GTP or BODIPY-GDP. Together the data confirm that the CID1067700 compound has no effect on the rate of release of bound fBODIPY-GTP or BODIPY-GDP by Rab7, ruling out allosteric binding of the CID1067700 inhibitor in preference to competitive binding to the nucleotide pocket.","Molecular Docking of CID1067700 on Rab7 Wt GDP and GTP Bound Crystal Structures Shows Optimal Binding to the Nucleotide Binding Pocket of the GTP-Conformer","The molecular docking of CID1067700 in the nucleotide binding site of Rab7 as predicted by the experimental data was examined using molecular docking OpenEye Fred docking software (-). Docking of CID1067700 on the GDP- and GTP-conformers revealed that the molecule fills the nucleotide binding pocket of both conformers in a manner that mimics the nucleotides (-). However, the interaction map revealed that the compound had fewer potential interactions with the GDP-conformer where the binding pocket is more exposed to solvent, which may also explain why BODIPY-GDP outcompetes CID1067700 better than the BODIPY-GTP (-). The good alignment between CID1067700 with GNP where 5,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[2,3-c]pyran ring system has the same orientation as guanine ring system could suggest the binding mode of the small molecule in the nucleotide binding pocket. To confirm the most likely binding mode however, a crystal structure determination study involving both CID1067700 and Rab7 will be required.","Structure Activity Analyses Identify Critical Determinants for Competitive Inhibition","To determine structure activity relationships (SAR), eighteen variants of the parent compound were evaluated. This preliminary SAR set was obtained through synthetic effort (11 compounds) or commercial acquisition (7 compounds). The parent scaffold, represented by CID1067700, was modified in any of three major regions to afford the initial analog collection. The structural alterations focused on esterification of the carboxylic acid (R), geminal substitution changes on the fused pyran ring (R, R), mutation of the ring-fused pyran to an N-methylated ring-fused piperidine, or revision of the N-acyl thiourea linker (L). Only three of the compounds retained activity in a multiplex GTPase screen with all other derivatives being inactive (). The parent, three active derivatives and one inactive derivative were assayed in single-plex dose response assays and ECdetermined against Rab7 (-). Esterification of the carboxylic acid moiety resulted in loss of inhibition, a finding that supports the suggested participation of this group in hydrogen bonding (). Removal of one or both of the gem-dimethyl groups from the parental thiophenylpyran structure (R-R) resulted in a 10- or 20-fold loss in potency respectively when compared across multiple GTPases (). The effect on potency observed with the gem dimethyl substitution suggests an advantageous lipophilic ligand-binding site interaction that is lost upon substituent removal. Alteration of the N-acyl thiourea linker further attenuated potency, as demonstrated by the 35-fold loss in potency observed with N-acyl urea CID46916265 (and ), and the complete loss of activity for thiourea CID1251121 (and ) and amide CID740871 (). These results indicate that the orientation of tethered groups, and the length and hydrogen-bonding character of the linker region are critical to maintaining a beneficial activity profile.","Discussion","In the present study we identify CID1067700 as a small chemical molecule that inhibits nucleotide binding to Rab7 in the nanomolar range with ECvalues of 25 nM for GTP and 40 nM for GDP and a calculated efficacy of nucleotide binding inhibition as 40% for BODIPY-GDP and 80% for BODIPY-GTP. Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies demonstrate that the compound acts as a competitive inhibitor and exhibits a good fit to the nucleotide binding pockets of both the GTP- and GDP-bound conformations of Rab7. By assaying on rate kinetics of Rab7 nucleotide binding in the presence of CID1067700, we noted a decrease in the number of available BODIPY-GTP and BODIPY-GDP binding sites on Rab7 across the entire nucleotide concentration range considered (data not shown). Based on equilibrium dissociation measurements, we also showed that CID1067700 does not affect how fast or slow Rab7 releases bound nucleotide and hence confirming that CID1067700 inhibits Rab7 nucleotide binding through a competitive mechanism. Initial structure activity relationships demonstrate a dependence on the lipophilic interactions with the substituted ring-fused pyran, the hydrogen bonding capability of the carboxylic acid, and the integrity of an extended N-acyl thiourea linker to properly extend and orient the tethered aryl functionality. Although our assays focused on characterizing the small molecule on Rab7, CID1067700 also exhibits inhibitory activity on other small GTPases. To the best of our knowledge CID1067700 is the first example of a competitive inhibitor for small GTPases.","CID1067700 was found to inhibit nucleotide binding by both the Rab7Q67L and Rab7T22N mutants that are known to be constitutively in the GTP and GDP bound states, respectively (39). Although the Q67L mutation lies in the nucleotide binding pocket of Rab7, the actual location of the Gln67 residue in the pocket is remote from all predicted contacts with CID1067700. From analysis of the crystal structure Thr22 residue is involved in forming interactions with Mg cofactor which is required for GTP\/GDP binding, and although our small molecule inhibitor has a similar binding mode to nucleotides, molecular docking studies suggest that a Mg cofactor may not be essential for its binding. The identification of CID1067700 as a competitive inhibitor of Rab7 nucleotide binding presents an exciting and novel route to characterize Rab family proteins. Most small molecules reported to be active against low molecular GTPases are allosteric inhibitors and have activities that are restricted to the Rho-family GTPases based on their mechanism of action of blocking GEF interactions with Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA. Thus, the identification of CID1067700 together with our analyses of structure activity relationships suggest that it may be possible with further development to prepare more specific analogs with unique advantages when compared to traditional approaches such as conditional knock out or RNA interference as a means to perturb Rab GTPase functionality. Small molecules can be applied to cells to rapidly and often reversibly inhibit targets. This is exemplified by Brefeldin A, an allosteric inhibitor of Arf GTPases (Vigil, 2010} and inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases that have been shown to inhibit specific kinase isoforms (40). More over, Rab7 function depends on numerous protein-protein interaction partners including hVps39 (41), TBC1D15 (42), RILP (27, 43), ORPIL (44, 45), Rabring7 (46) and the alpha proteasome subunit XAPC7 (47, 48) whose interaction with Rab7 may be potential candidates for small molecule modulation. Use of small molecule might also be useful for dissecting the order of protein binding to a multimeric complex and\/or the importance of nucleotide for stability of the protein complex involving Rab7. Taken together, our findings present CID1067700 as a novel competitive inhibitor of small GTPase nucleotide binding that has potential in vitro for dissecting protein function. It may serve as a springboard for further development of families of compounds selective for individual GTPases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0329","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
