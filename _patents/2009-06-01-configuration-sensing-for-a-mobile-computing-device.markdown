{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, have become highly capable communication devices in recent years. In addition to the wide array of processing capabilities such as digital assistant (PDA) features, including word processing, spreadsheets, synchronization of information (e.g., e-mail) with a desktop computer, and so forth, mobile computing devices also typically include wireless communications capabilities to provide features, such as mobile telephony, mobile e-mail access, web browsing, and content (e.g., video and radio) reception. Exemplary wireless communications technologies include cellular, satellite, and mobile data networking technologies.","The increasing number of features for a smart phone poses a design challenge in keeping it small and compact. As such, smaller form factor devices are often designed with multiple mechanical sections that fold or slide into different positions or configurations. If the device is in a \u201cclosed\u201d position, for example, then it is smaller and more compact, allowing easy portability. In a partially open configuration, the mechanical section may reveal a keyboard or touch panel that allows easy user input. In a fully open configuration, the device may present a full display screen, touch pad, keyboard or other functionality for ease of use. For such devices, it is desirable to detect the position or configuration of the mechanical sections in an efficient manner.","Embodiments are generally directed to techniques for sensing a mechanical configuration for a mobile computing device, such as a smart phone. Some embodiments are particularly directed to a mobile computing device with multiple sections that can be placed in different mechanical configurations. One section may have a component with a magnet, such as an acoustic speaker, while another section may have a magnetic sensor. The magnetic sensor may detect and measure a magnetic field strength for the magnet based on proximity, and output a position signal indicating a particular configuration for the smart phone. Feature sets for the mobile computing device may be enabled or disabled based on the detected configuration. Using a magnet for another component of the smart phone to determine its mechanical configuration reduces costs, board space, internal volume, power consumption and overall physical size of the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A","b":["1","100","100"]},"In one embodiment, for example, the mobile computing device  may be implemented as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone, sometimes referred to as a smart phone. Examples of smart phones include various Palm\u00ae products such as Palm\u00ae Pre\u2122 and Treo\u2122 smart phones, made by Palm Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif. Although some embodiments may be described with the mobile computing device  implemented as a smart phone by way of example, it may be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context.","The mobile computing device  has multiple sections that can be placed in different mechanical configurations. The sections are connected and arranged for physical and mechanical movement of one or more sections to form different shapes and geometries for the mobile computing device . For instance, when implemented as a Palm Pre, the mobile computing device  may have a slider mechanism or hinge that allows two sections to move away from another to lengthen the mobile computing device . Other mechanical configurations are possible as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A","FIGS. 1A"],"b":["1","100","1","100","102","104","106","108","110"]},"In one or more embodiments, the housing  may comprise multiple mechanical sections or parts, including a first housing portion , a second housing portion , and a configuration portion . The configuration portion is typically a structure internal to the housing  and is therefore not shown in , B. The housing  may comprise other mechanical sections or parts as well.","The configuration portion  may be arranged to allow the first housing portion and the second housing portion to move relative to each other to form multiple mechanical configurations, including a first configuration and a second configuration. In various embodiments, the configuration portion may comprise a sliding structure, a pivot structure or a folding structure. A sliding structure allows the housing portions , to slide towards each other or away from each other. The sliding structure may comprise, for example, a sliding hinge or rails. A pivot structure allows the housing portions , to pivot around a pivot point, thereby rotating the housing portions , so that a longitudinal center axis for each of the housing portions , are aligned or misaligned. A folding structure allows the housing portions , to fold towards each other or away from each other, and is sometimes referred to as a \u201cclamshell\u201d design. Some embodiments are described with the configuration portion implemented as a sliding structure by way of example and not limitation.

When in the closed configuration, the mobile computing device  only shows the display , the speaker , and the input button . Conversely, the mobile computing device  may be re-configured from the open configuration to the closed configuration by sliding the housing portions , towards each other. When in the open configuration, the mobile computing device  shows the display , the speaker , and the input button  as in the closed configuration, and further exposes the thumbboard .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A","b":["2","100","102","102","202","204","202","204","100"],"i":["a","b ","a","a ","b","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["100","202","202","102","204","204","102","100"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","a ","b ","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["100","202","202","102","204","204","102","100"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","a ","b ","b"],"sub":["1","1"]},"In various embodiments, a given mechanical configuration may be detected using a magnet and a magnetic sensor located in respective housing portions , . The magnetic sensor may be arranged to measure a magnetic field strength for the magnet, and output a position signal based on the measured magnetic field strength. The measured magnetic field strength represents a distance between a magnet and a magnetic sensor. The position signal may indicate whether the mobile computing device  is in a closed configuration or an open configuration. Examples for the magnetic sensor may include without limitation a Hall effect sensor, a Corbino effect sensor, and any other sensors that are sensitive to changes in magnetic fields produced by a magnet or electrical current.","In one embodiment, a magnetic sensor may be implemented as a Hall effect sensor. A Hall effect sensor is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to changes in a magnetic field. As such, Hall effect sensors may be used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications. In its simplest form, the sensor operates as an analogue transducer, directly returning a voltage. With a known magnetic field, its distance from the Hall plate can be determined. Using one or more sensors, the relative position of a magnet can be deduced.","In one or more embodiments, a magnet for use with a magnetic sensor may comprise part of another component for the mobile computing device . The mobile computing device  contains an acoustic speaker or receiver to reproduce sounds. Acoustic speakers are used to support a cellular phone, voice recorder, portable music or video player, portable speakers, and other acoustic components. Acoustic speakers typically have a built-in magnet as part of the acoustic system. An existing magnet inside an acoustic speaker generates a magnetic field that can be measured by the Hall effect sensor. In this manner, embodiments avoid the use of a dedicated magnet for a magnetic sensor, thereby reducing associated costs, board space, internal volume, power consumption and overall physical size of the mobile computing device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A","b":["3","100","100","308","308","308","102","100","304","306","304","306","102"],"i":["a","b.

For instance, a voltage level may increase as the magnetic sensor  moves closer to the magnet  thereby decreasing a distance (D) between the magnetic sensor  and the magnet . The closed configuration may be indicated at or before a peak voltage level is reached.
