{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Many advertisers pay to have their advertisements featured via a set-top box (STB) FOR display of along with regularly scheduled television content, on demand programming and premium broadcasting. The advertisement may include details regarding the product or service, contact information such as a phone number or web address of the advertiser, pricing information and other details intended to drive viewer interest in the product or service. While television advertising has the potential to reach millions of viewers, the advertiser is usually limited in their ability to understand the effectiveness of the advertisement, especially as it pertains to viewers contacting the advertiser in response to the advertisement. Unfortunately, relevant data for correlating the viewer's contact activity regarding the product or service\u2014i.e., placement of a phone call or accessing of a website\u2014with actual consumption of the advertisement by the viewer is not available.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach that provides flexible, efficient techniques to enable advertisers to correlate a communication session with an amount of consumption of the advertisement by a viewer.","A preferred apparatus, method, and software for enabling advertisers to correlate a communication session with the amount of consumption of the advertisement by a viewer are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.","Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to advertisements presented in the form of television content via a set-top box, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to any media content capable of being presented including broadcasts, digital media, on demand programming, streaming media and the like. Additionally, the various embodiments have applicability to any device capable of processing audio-video (AV) signals for presentation to a user, such as a home communication terminal (HCT), a digital home communication terminal (DHCT), a stand-alone personal video recorder (PVR), a television set, a digital video disc (DVD) player, a video-enabled phone, an AV-enabled personal digital assistant (PDA), and\/or a personal computer (PC), as well as other like technologies and customer premises equipment (CPE). Furthermore, although the STB is explained in the context of call events, it is contemplated that other device events relating to various services and functions are applicable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","103","113","105","107","119","119","121","123","107","101"]},"It is observed that television remains the prevalent global medium for entertainment and information as individuals spend a great deal of time tuning into both public television programs as well as paid televised media (e.g., cable television). Consequently, advertisers typically pay broadcast and media service providers a fee in order to have advertisements featured in connection with scheduled programming. In one embodiment, these advertisers may operate advertisement system(s)  to interact with correlation platform . According to certain embodiments, advertisement systems  can refer to computing and\/or telecommunication systems associated with the advertisers for processing service or product orders. The advertisements vary in form and function, some being presented between portions of a program in, e.g., fifteen to thirty-second segments while others are presented as stand-along programs (e.g., infomercial, direct response media). In some instances, the advertisements may also be featured in conjunction with scheduled broadcast media as in-line content, banner ads, interactive content, etc. Typically, the advertisements include details regarding the product or service, contact information such as a phone number, web address or social networking handle of the advertiser, pricing information regarding the product or service, endorsement information, physical store location information and other data useful for encouraging viewers to pursue the offer.","While television advertising has the potential to reach millions of viewers, the advertiser is usually limited in their ability to understand the effectiveness of the advertisement, and particularly, the impact of the advertisement on enticing viewers to contact the advertiser regarding the product. This includes any means of contacting or initiating communication with an advertiser by a user (or subscriber), including by way of phone, chat, e-mail, web based communication and social networking. Also, advertisers typically deduce such information based on limited call center volume and web traffic data, extrapolating what they can from the results. In other instances, the advertisement system  may poll or survey the various viewers who place a call or access the web address to determine how they learned about the product or service, what aspects of the advertisement appealed to them, etc. Unfortunately, these approaches result in the compiling of inaccurate or incomplete data and do little to enable advertisers to pinpoint specific factors or characteristics of the advertisement that cause viewers to respond. Data for correlating the viewer's initiation of a communication session with an advertisement system  thereof in direct response to determined viewer consumption of the advertisement is not available.","Thus, the approach of system , according to certain embodiments, stems from the recognition that advertisers may benefit from information that correlates contact activity initiated by the user with the display and presentment of advertisements. The data collected by the correlation platform  can be provided to the advertisement system , which can distribute their content via various broadcast channels, media outlets and other advertisement mediums at an aggregate level. Data may be provided to the advertisement system  without presenting any personally identifiable information about the viewers to which the advertisements were directed. By way of this approach, the correlation platform  may be implemented as a service or hosted solution by a service provider (e.g., a communication services provider) for generating data that correlates viewing and communication habits and tendencies of one or more people. One or more advertisers may access the data by subscribing for access to the correlation platform .","By way of example, aggregation of such data, referred to in certain embodiments as effectivness data can be stored in a database , which can be used by advertisement system  to determine the most and\/or least effective characteristics of their advertisements. The effectiveness data  may be used to enable advertisement system  to determine what time intervals or channels yield the greatest outcomes, how much of the advertisement is being consumed by viewers, the extent of penetration of linked advertisements (e.g., as part of a marketing campaign), opportunities for cost savings and marketing dollar usage, etc. The effectiveness data  can also be used by advertisement system  to engage in targeted adverting wherein a limited but more relevant number of viewers are targeted based on various factors. The data may be compiled based on one or more qualitative and\/or quantitative metrics executed by the correlation platform , including those customized by respective advertisement systems  for enabling the generation of customized feedback. Hence, as advertisers vary in terms of product specialty, market approach, size and customer base, they may utilize different models and metrics to generate different effectiveness data types for accommodating their reporting needs.","In certain embodiments, a portal  interfaces with platform  to permit access by advertisement system  to any effectiveness data  by way of a communication network . Portal  provides, for example, a web-based user interface to allow advertisement system  to set and update advertiser profile information (e.g., as part of a registration or update process), define customized metrics for use in generation of effectiveness data  and various other features of the correlation platform . The portal may also be a means in which various advertisement systems  may access effectiveness data  in the form of one or more web-based reports or as a downloadable data file corresponding to a predetermined format, etc. It is noted that the correlation platform  may also be configured to transmit, via the portal , the effectiveness data  in accordance with a defined reporting frequency. By way of this approach, the portal may serve as a secure communication channel established between the service provider network  and the advertisement system , media service provider , television broadcast system , third-party content provider system  or other interested party.","The correlation platform  is configured to detect the initiation or execution of a communication session by one or more devices  belonging to a viewer. Hence, in certain embodiments, the correlation platform  may interface with and detect the generation of communication signals generated by a set-top box , a mobile (e.g., cellular) phone , a laptop computer , a telephone  and a desktop computing device . By way of example, the STB  may be integrated with the telephone  for supporting teleconferencing, web-based communication (e.g., Voice over IP) and the like. Respective devices  may also be configured to receive broadcast, media and content signals for rendering advertisements to a display. By way of example, cell phone  may be configured to receive television content on a live or streaming basis from over a communication network . As such, the cell phone  may be used to both initiate a call and receive content, including advertisements, for viewing. Hence, the correlation platform  may account for all forms of communication and\/or content and media presentment devices and mechanisms available to users (e.g., viewers) to which advertisements may be directed.","Communication network  can include: a public data network (e.g., the Internet), various intranets, local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), the public switched telephony network (PSTN), integrated services digital networks (ISDN), other private packet switched networks or telephony networks, as well as any additional equivalent system or combination thereof. These networks may employ various access technologies including cable networks, satellite networks, subscriber television networks, digital subscriber line (DSL) networks, optical fiber networks, hybrid fiber-coax networks, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks, wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks, other wireless networks (e.g., 3G or 4G wireless broadband networks, mobile television networks, radio networks, etc.), terrestrial broadcasting networks, provider specific networks (e.g., fiber optic networks, cable networks, etc), and the like. Such networks may also utilize any suitable protocol supportive of data communications, e.g., transmission control protocol (TCP), internet protocol (IP), file transfer protocol (FTP), telnet, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), socket connections, Ethernet, frame relay, and the like, to connect content processing devices  to various sources of media content, such as one or more third-party content provider systems . Although depicted in  as separate networks, communication network  may be completely or partially contained within service provider network . For example, service provider network  may include facilities to provide for transport of packet-based communications.","According to certain embodiments, devices  may also be configured to communicate over one or more local area networks (LANs)  corresponding to the user (e.g., viewer). In this manner, routers (not shown) may be used for establishing and operating, or at least connecting to, a network such as a \u201chome\u201d network or LAN , and is used to route communications among various interconnected devices . For example, set-top box  may be communicatively coupled to LAN  via a router and a coaxial cable, whereas devices ,  and  may be connected to LAN  via a router and a wireless connection, a network cable (e.g., Ethernet cable), and\/or the like. It is noted, however, that in certain embodiments set-top box  may be configured to establish connectivity with LAN  via one or more wireless connections. Further, set-top box , wireless devices  and , phone  and computing device  may be uniquely identified by LAN  via any suitable addressing scheme. For example, LAN  may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to set-top box  and devices , i.e., IP addresses that are accessible to the devices  that are part of the LAN  facilitated via a router.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 5"],"b":["101","103","115","101","201","101","211","203","205","207","209","213","215","217","203","217","103"]},"In addition, the correlation platform  also maintains user profile data and advertiser profile data pertaining to the users (e.g., television viewers) and advertisers who advertise to the viewers. By way of example, the user profile data may include data for identifying the user, including a user identifier value or code. Also, the user profile data may include data specifying the name, address and other contact details of the user. Still further, the user profile data specifies the one or more user devices  that are to be configured to the correlation platform for the purpose of detecting communication session activity or content\/media consumption activity. For example, the user may specify that their cell phone , laptop  or video game system be connected to the correlation platform  as part of their user profile.","The advertiser profile data includes data for identifying the advertiser, including an advertiser identifier value or code. The advertiser identifier value or code may be used in connection with an advertisement displayed to the set-top box for identifying the originator of the advertisement. Also, the advertiser profile data may include data for specifying the name, address and other contact details of the advertiser including a contact phone number, e-mail address, web address or social networking handle. Still further, the advertiser profile may include data for indicating one or more advertisements made available for presentment to viewers\u2014i.e., Advertisement A and Advertisement B. It is noted that advertisement system  establishes a profile during initial registration or subscription with the correlation platform .","In one embodiment, the communication interface  provides connectivity to one or more user devices  available to and designated by a user (e.g., viewer), as well as enabling the various interfaces required to configure to a router\/LAN . Interface  can also communicate with various service provider systems  or communication systems  for supporting network communication and interaction. Still further, the communication interface  can also support execution of a web portal  for enabling advertisement system  to access platform  via a browser application or the like, such as for accessing effectiveness data .","In one embodiment, a tracking module  maintains data for indicating the rate, level or amount of consumption of an advertisement by a viewer as it is rendered to a display of the set-top box  (or computer  and other devices ). This module  may initiate or directly exchange signaling with the relevant STBs  to acquire such data. By way of example, the tracking module  tracks the number of times the user has viewed a given advertisement as well as the amount of time elapsed during each viewing. Time is recorded at the beginning and end of play of the advertisement, including when the advertisement is interrupted due to the viewer changing channels, starting of an external device such as a DVD player, or the like. The tracking module  also tracks which channels the advertisement was featured on at a given time as well as relevant time zone and network data. This data is maintained by the tracking module  in association with the advertiser profile data and user profile data . As such, the contact information associated with a given advertisement, including a phone number or web address, may be associated with a specific time period of display. This data may be tracked over a predetermined time period\u2014i.e., over a week, month, quarter, etc.","It is noted that the tracking module  may be configured for operation in connection with differing set-top boxes  as well as other media presentment devices (e.g., computing device ). As such, the tracking module  may interpret media or advertising based content as directed to the set-top box  or other devices  by one or more broadcast systems , media service providers  or third-party content providers . As mentioned, module  may monitor the control signals generated by the STB  for rendering content to the display in conjunction with the specific application programming interfaces (APIs), graphics primitives, display features and operating system (OS) of the particular STB  or device . By way of this approach, details pertaining to the advertisement may be extrapolated during broadcast or play including contact information, product details, etc.","Also operating in connection with the tracking module , in one embodiment, is a contact detection module . The contact detection module  tracks information regarding the placement of a call, accessing of an IP address, transmission of an SMS message or other means of communication or contact initiated by the television viewer. In particular, the module  detects initiation of a communication session, i.e., via a control signal, corresponding to one of the user (viewers) devices  configured for operation over the service provider network  or communication network . The module  then determines the various contact information associated with the communication, such as the phone number, social networking handle, e-mail address or web address (internet protocol address) used to facilitate the session. This data is then passed on to the correlation module .","The correlation module , in one embodiment, analyzes the data gathered by the tracking module  and the contact detection module  to determine a correlation between an advertisement featured to the STB  and\/or other devices  and a communication session initiated via at least one of the devices . The correlation is based, at least in part, on timing information for the advertisement and the call, along with contact information pertaining to the communication session. By way of example, the correlation module  determines if the contact information used to facilitate the communication session corresponds to that featured in the advertisement. Still further, the correlation module  then compares a start time corresponding to viewing of the advertisement with a time of initiation of the communication session as executed based on determined contact information. When the communication session is determined to be placed within a predetermined time (threshold) of tracked consumption of the advertisement by the viewer, the correlation module  flags the communication session as being related to the advertisement consumed. The threshold may be defined by the advertisement system  accordingly (e.g., within five minutes of ending of the advertisement, anytime during presentment of the advertisement).","In another embodiment, the effectiveness determination module  processes the data captured by the tracking module (e.g., length of time of viewing of an advertisement) as well as data captured by the contact detection module  against various effectiveness metrics. The metrics are configured by the one or more advertisers and\/or content providers for determining the effectiveness of an advertising campaign, receptiveness of a user to specific programming, persuasiveness of a particular characteristic or feature of the advertisement, etc. In addition, the effectiveness determination module  operates in connection with a reporting module  in order to translate the metrics into a report that is presentable to the various advertisement systems . It is noted that the effectiveness determination module  operates in response to a determined correlation between a communication session and a consumed advertisement (e.g., advertisement based content) by the correlation module .","By way of example, the effectiveness determination module  may be configured to determine how many times the user (viewer) viewed an online advertisement for a given company against the number of times the user viewed the commercial via STB  prior to placing a call to the advertiser. Under this scenario, the advertiser may better understand the relationship and impact between the online advertisement and the commercial. As another example, the module  can determine how many times the user had seen the commercial on television (e.g., via the STB) prior to visiting the website of the advertiser. As such, the advertiser can determine how effective the online content is for enhancing the appeal of the advertisement. Various other qualitative calculations or analysis may also be performed.","As another example, the effectiveness determination module  may be configured, by virtue of one or more metrics, to recognize how much of the entire advertisement the viewer consumed prior to placing a call to an advertiser. For example, the user may have been switching between channels at the STB  and thus may have viewed the advertisement in the 10th minute of a 30 minute infomercial as opposed to from the very beginning. As mentioned previously, the start, stop or elapsed time of consumption is tracked accordingly by the tracking module . Hence, the advertiser may determine whether the user placed the call in the 12th minute or on the 28th minute of the advertisement. By trending this data over multiple samples (e.g., viewers), advertisement system  may evaluate the effectiveness of the first 10 minutes of the advertisement.","In certain embodiments, the reporting module  notifies one or more advertisement systems  of the effectiveness data or information generated with respect to a particular advertisement. By way of example, the reporting module  packages the effectiveness information and transmits it to the advertiser according to a predetermined frequency. The frequency may be established by the advertisement content provider to occur instantaneously, according to a threshold of users, based on an elapsed time period (e.g., every Tuesday), etc. In other instances, the report may be made available to advertisers by way of the portal .","It is noted that the effectiveness determination module  operates in connection with the reporting module  to present data for enhancing advertisers' ability to recognize various qualitative and\/or quantitative characteristics regarding their advertisements, whether online or broadcast. In particular, the effectiveness data  may be utilized to assess how many times the user has seen a given advertisement, in which channels, at what time frames, prior to calling the advertiser. The provider of the correlation platform  can map this data over a period of time for reporting purposes (e.g., a day, week, month, etc.). Correlation between the placement of a call, initiation of a social networking session, advancement of an e-mail or other contact means and actual viewing of the advertisement presents advertisers with a more complete perspective of the impact of advertisements.","In certain embodiments, a sanitization module  aggregates the profiles of multiple users based on like characteristics and packages this information for use in connection with data generated by the effectiveness determination module  (effectiveness data ). For example, the sanitization module  performs a composite analysis of various uses based on demographic factors\u2014i.e., age, gender, socio-economic status, device type, subscriber type, network and\/or channel preferences, general location, etc. Specific identifying information of a user, such as their name, phone number or contact details is removed as part of the composite analysis process, thus enabling the generation of sanitized demographic data. This data may be used in connection with the data generated for conveying the effectiveness of an advertisement, including enabling the superimposition of such data in reports generated by the reporting module \u2014i.e., as presented via the portal  or encoded in hardcopy form according to preferred document format.","While specific reference will be made to the above described implementation, it is also contemplated that platform  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components. For example, it is contemplated that the components of platform  may be combined, located in separate structures, and\/or separate locations. By way of example, platform  may be implemented in accordance with a cloud-based server implementation. As another example, several of the components of the platform  may be integrated within a set-top box  for communication with various other components of the platform. In certain embodiments, a control module  regulates the execution and interaction of the various components of the platform  accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3C","FIG. 1"],"b":["301","300","101","103","103","101"]},"Consumption is tracked, by way of example, according to various factors including: the number of times the advertisement was viewed; one or more channels in which the advertisement was viewed; data indicating user interest in an item related to the advertisement; a time frame corresponding to initiation of the communication session; a start, stop or elapsed time corresponding to viewing of the advertisement; or a combination thereof. Also, in certain embodiments, it is contemplated that the consumption may be expressed as a number, a percentage, an indicator (e.g., according to a star rating), an alphanumeric expression (e.g., 75% consumption), as a predetermined unit (e.g., 1 unit of airtime) or a combination thereof. When considered with respect to a broader time interval or other data, the consumption may also be captured as a rate for reporting purposes.","In step , the correlation platform  correlates the amount of consumption of the advertisement to a communication session initiated by the user in response to the presentation of the advertisement. By way of example, the correlation module  detects the initiation of a communication session by one or more devices  associated with the viewer; the session being initiated based on contact information as entered at or transmitted by the device via a network , . The contact information may include a phone number, web address, social networking handle or identifier, or other data for specifying a particular party to engage in a communication session with the viewer via the device. Hence, the communication session includes a voice call or a data session to access a website or social networking medium related to the advertisement.","The correlation process includes performing a check to determine whether the communication session is based on contact information pertaining to the advertiser. When a match is determined, the correlation process further includes comparing a start time corresponding to viewing of the advertisement with a time of initiation of the communication session. By way of example, a start time of viewing may correspond to a time of 2:30 pm and a time of initiation of the communication session corresponding to 2:37 pm, a time difference of 7 minutes. A correlation between these two times may be determined if they are within a predetermined threshold of one another\u2014i.e., within 8 minutes of presentment of the advertisement. In one embodiment, the correlation process can exclude the amount of consumption that does not satisfy a predetermined threshold for the amount of consumption.","In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that contact information unrelated to the advertisers may also be maintained or tracked by the correlation platform  as influence data. Influence data may be any data useful for enabling the advertiser to determine a level of influence of others upon one or more viewers. By way of example, upon determining a similar amount of consumption of an advertisement, it may be observed that multiple users visit a particular web resource other than that of the advertisers. Repeated occurrences of this event may enable the advertisers to direct their advertising efforts at these resources or to somehow update any content they feature regarding their product and\/or company via this resource. As another example, it may be observed that users of a younger demographic repeatedly initiate a communication session with a trusted third-party (e.g., parent, friend, mentor, etc.) at the eighth minute of a fifteen minute infomercial, where the eighth minute follows a portion of the advertisement featuring a popular cartoon character. Based on this trend, the advertisement system  may modify the advertisement to more directly encourage or incent viewers in this demographic to share information about the product or service with others. They may also feature the popular cartoon character more prominently and regularly throughout the advertisement due to the popular response.","In step  of process  (), the correlation platform  tracks an amount of consumption of an advertisement presented via another set-top box associated with another user. In another step , the platform  correlates the amount of consumption of the advertisement to another communication session initiated by the other user in response to the presentation of the advertisement. Per step , the platform  stores the amount of consumption and the correlation for the plurality of users. As mentioned previously, the steps of  pertain to the aggregating of consumption data and correlation data for multiple users. From a reporting standpoint, this enables the advertisers to view effectiveness data  across a broad sampling of viewers for enabling a more reassuring assessment of their advertisements. The data may be aggregated and sanitized by the correlation platform  to prevent the sharing of sensitive information pertaining to the various viewers.","In step  of process  (), the correlation platform  determines demographic information related to the user or another user. As mentioned previously, the demographic information may be extrapolated from user profile data made available to the correlation platform . The demographic data may be based on various characteristics including age, gender, location, device type, etc. Per step , the correlation platform  associates the demographic information with the correlation. Based on this information, advertisers may adjust their advertisements to more effectively target certain viewers. By way of example, it may be determined that a particular community call response rate is 10%, but the elderly community response rate is 20%. The advertiser may adapt the advertisement to feature more spokespersons fitting the senior demographic. As another example, effectiveness data  for indicating receptivity or responsiveness to political ads in a particular geographical region (e.g., number of candidate site visits) may be channeled back to a political operation for deducing potential voter responsiveness, adapting campaign messaging, etc. It is noted, therefore, that the correlation platform  may be used for performing test marketing, polling verification and other uses.","It is noted that the effectiveness data  may be generated based on one or more models, metrics, optimization formulas, performance ratios, industry valuation methods, etc. Compilation of a report for viewing by an advertiser may include various charts, indicators and graphics for conveying relevant information regarding an advertisement relative to call and\/or site visit responsiveness. In addition, the data  may also be presented in the form of specific recommendations and\/or considerations for the advertiser as deduced based on the applied metrics.  are diagrams of a user interface for presenting data for indicating the effectiveness of an advertisement, according to an exemplary embodiment. For purposes of illustration,  are described within the context of an exemplary use case of Advertiser A (e.g., advertising manager representing Advertiser A) interacting with the correlation platform  via a portal  to access effectiveness data  regarding Advertisement A.","In , Advertiser A logs onto the correlation platform  via a browser interface and accesses an effectiveness data report view . One section  of the report features a graph  for representing call volume at various times of broadcast\/play of Advertisement A. The x-axis corresponds to call volume, while the y-axis corresponds to a specific segment in time of Advertisement A. Data points used to generate the graph are based on the tracking of consumption and calls of multiple viewers over a 30 day period. Alternatively, the advertising manager may opt to select different reporting periods, report types or formats by selecting the \u201cChange Period,\u201d \u201cChange Type,\u201d and \u201cChange Format\u201d actions buttons - respectively. Selection of these buttons results in generation of a pop-up window or other menu selection means for enabling the advertising manager to adapt a setting. Similarly, the advertising management may select demographic profile settings for which to restrict the report to\u2014i.e., by age, marital status, income range, gender and geography.","Under this scenario, Advertisement A is an 8 minute advertisement currently featured during a prime time slot (e.g., a higher cost to the advertiser). The report includes labels  and  for indicating the title and\/or features of the advertisement and graph  respectively for enabling the user to conveniently navigate the report. Also, the graph  is analyzed by the advertising manager across successive time frames X and Y respectively. Time frame X corresponds to the first 5 minutes of Advertisement A while Y corresponds to the final 3 minutes of the advertisement. The advertising manager is interested in the data presented in time frame Y, which is also shown in the advertisement statistics portion  of the report, as this corresponds to a newly added section of the advertisement (e.g., updated advertising content).","In section Y of the graph , it is shown that the time intervals in minutes and seconds from point  to  (5:01 to 6:00) and  to  (7:01 to 8:00) correspond to an increase in call volume while the interval from  to  (6:01-7:00) corresponds to a decrease in call volume. By way of example, table  of the advertisement statistics portion  of the report shows the site volume , call volume , time frame  data upon which section Y of the graph is generated. In addition, the table  also features rank data  for indicating which segments of Advertisement A (time intervals) are most effective based on overall viewer responsiveness\u2014i.e., a measure of the sum of determined website volume  and call placement volume . Based on this information, the advertising manager is able to observe that the lower ranked interval at 6:01 to 7:00 is limiting the overall effectiveness of the advertisement.","Under this scenario, to determine the cause of the drop in call volume during this time interval, the advertising manager can decide to playback the advertisement corresponding to this interval via a media viewer  embedded in the report. During this time interval, the manager notices the background color featured in the advertisement is identical to the color of the featured phone number and web address of the advertiser (e.g., red background on red lettering). Consequently, the contact information is obscured, unlike that for the higher ranked intervals which feature a white background with black lettering. The advertising manager is presented with various action buttons for using this report, including a \u201cSave\u201d action button  for saving the data set as shown, a \u201cExit\u201d action button  for exiting from the report, a \u201cPrint\u201d action button  for printing the report and a \u201cSee Recommendations\u201d action button  for being presented with one or more recommendations based on the data set presented.","Upon selecting the \u201cSee Recommendations\u201d action button , the advertising manager is presented with a recommendations view . This view presents a section  of the report featuring one or more recommendations for the advertising manager. As noted, the recommendations are based on the above described scenario and data set. In addition, the recommendations may be based on one or more metrics or models, or alternatively, based on proprietary data available to the advertising manager such as budget data, marketing campaign data, project execution data, etc. By way of example, the recommendations include removing the portion of the advertisement at the lower ranked time interval to resulting in a savings of $23,400. Another recommendation is for the manager to move the associated content at the highest ranked interval to achieve a projected increase in responsiveness of 26%. Another recommendation includes restricting the ad to focus on a single product A, as represented by section Y of the graph , rather than product B as represented by section X of the graph . The advertising manager can go back to the previous effectiveness data view  by selecting the \u201cBack To Data\u201d action button . The manager can also view different or additional recommendations by adapting the demographic data settings .","It is noted that the exemplary methods and systems presented in various embodiments enable a means of convenient, efficient access to data for indicating the effectiveness of advertisements featured by way of a set-top box or other media presentment means. The consumption and communication session related data collected by the system allows advertisers to make informed decisions about advertisements as well as maximize the use of their advertising dollars. As another advantage, the effectiveness data may enable advertisers to generate targeted advertising that is more acutely aligned with tendencies within a given market or demographic. As yet another advantage, the correlation platform  is configured to provide specific reports on what specific parts of an advertisement are the most effective depending on when viewers place the calls, i.e., out of the 4000 calls, 2500 calls were placed after the 5th minute of the advertisement.","Still further, the system is configured to provide general responsiveness data as scoped by geography as well. For example, reports may be generated for indicating that the best time for an advertisement targeting college students in a given college community is between 4 PM-5 PM on Saturdays and 10 PM-11 PM on weekdays, as this corresponds to peak times of responsiveness (e.g., call activity, website viewing, etc.). In addition, data for indicating the number of times an advertisement was viewed before a call was made, since the day the advertisement was aired, since addition new features to the product, etc. can be tracked accordingly.","The processes described herein for enabling advertisers to correlate a communication session with the amount of consumption of the advertisement by a viewer may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","501","503","501","500","505","501","503","505","503","500","507","501","503","509","501"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","600","600","600","600"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) .
