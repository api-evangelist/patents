title: Chromatic scheduler for network traffic with disparate service requirements
abstract: System(s) and method(s) are provided for managing network capacity in a wireless network that serves various traffic flows with disparate quality of service requirements. Management is based on multi-stage scheduling in frequency-time domain. A first scheduling stage generates an allocation of radio resources that minimizes inter-cell interference amongst a plurality of base stations. Based on the first-stage allocation of radio resources, a second scheduling stage computes flow capacity for a set of radio resources specific to a base station, and acquires guaranteed-bit-rate (GBR) and non-guaranteed GBR traffic flows. GBR traffic flows are matched to computed flow capacity to generate an allocation of frequency-time resources. In second scheduling stage, GBR traffic flows are scheduled based at least in part on allocated resources and priority queuing. Based on allocation(s) in first and second scheduling stages, a third scheduling stage schedules non-GBR traffic flows based at least in part on fair scheduling.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and, more particularly, to management of network resource allocation for traffic with disparate quality-of-service requirements.","Network resources are scarce and costly to acquire from both a regulatory and an economical perspective. Availability of portions of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation employed to transport wireless signal, and power allowances for communication of such signal are highly regulated. Development and deployment of new radio technologies that more efficiently exploits available network resources is time consuming and requires substantive financial commitment from telecommunication carrier(s). Thus, productive management of network resources is paramount to the commercial viability of telecommunication carrier(s). In particular, network planning and associated network capacity administration are principal to delivery of high-quality telecommunication service and subscriber satisfaction, on which much of the commercial success of telecommunication carrier(s) relies.","As wireless communication becomes ubiquitous and integrated with other non-wireless communication technologies and services, an ever-increasing number of subscribers demand service with the ensuing operational pressure in network capacity. Accordingly, preservation of quality of service (QoS) for guaranteed-bit-rate traffic while retaining satisfactory non-GBR (n-GBR) traffic QoS becomes increasingly difficult. Conventional solutions to management of network capacity and QoS preservation, such as semi-persistent scheduling, generally allow satisfactory delivery of GBR traffic at the expense of poor dynamic response to traffic conditions in loaded cells or sectors and ensuing detriment to capacity management.","The following presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate any scope. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","One or more embodiments provide system(s) and method(s) for managing network capacity in a wireless network that serves various traffic flows with disparate quality of service requirements. Management is based on multi-stage scheduling in frequency-time domain, wherein the multiple stages of scheduling are periodically effected, with each stage having an associated period. The multi-stage scheduling in frequency-time domain is termed herein chromatic scheduling, in that radio resources are cast and administered in terms of colors and associated color saturation and color luminance. A color is a specific block of available frequency-time resources, color saturation is the spectral span of frequency resources allotted to a color, and color luminance is a transmit power allocated to at least a portion of frequency-time resources within a color. One or more functional elements that implement such chromatic scheduling are termed herein chromatic scheduler. A first scheduling stage generates an allocation of radio resources for a set of base stations that minimizes inter-cell interference amongst a plurality of base stations in the set. The allocation of radio resources results in a resource exclusion list that mitigates spectral overlap of allocated radio resources for disparate base stations. Based on the first-stage allocation of radio resources, a second scheduling stage acquires radio link quality indicators and associated modulation and coding scheme indicators, and computes flow capacity for a set of radio resources utilized by a base station. In the second scheduling stage, guaranteed-bit-rate (GBR) and non-guaranteed GBR traffic flows are acquired. GBR traffic flows are matched to computed flow capacity or bit-rate requirement(s) to generate an allocation of frequency-time resources, whereas non-GBR traffic flows are allocated remaining frequency-time resources. In scenarios in which Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) power control is employed, PDSCH attenuation can be included in the determination of a satisfactory (e.g., optimal or nearly-optimal) allocation of frequency-time resources. In addition, in the second scheduling stage, GBR traffic flows are scheduled based at least in part on the allocated resources and priority queuing. Based on the radio resource allocation(s) effected in the first and second scheduling stages, a third scheduling stage schedules non-GBR traffic flows based at least in part on fair scheduling.","Aspects, features, or advantages of the subject disclosure can be exploited in substantially any, or any, wireless telecommunication, or radio, technology or network; Non-limiting examples of such technologies or networks include femtocell technology, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX); Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE); 3GPP UMTS; Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB); High Speed Packet Access (HSPA); High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA); High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA); UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN); or LTE Advanced.

It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems or embodiments may include additional components, layers, etc. and\/or may not include all of the components, layers, nodes, interfaces, platforms, etc. discussed in connection with the annexed drawings. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","With reference to the drawings,  is a schematic example wireless environment  that can operate in accordance with aspects described herein. In particular, example wireless environment  illustrates a set of macro cells. Three macro cells -comprise the illustrative wireless environment; however, it should be appreciated that wireless cellular network deployments can encompass up to 10-10coverage macro cells. Coverage macro cells  (\u03bb=1,2,3) are illustrated as hexagons; however, coverage cells can adopt other geometries generally dictated by a deployment configuration or floor plan, geographic areas to be covered, and so on. Each macro cell  is sectorized in a 2\u03c0\/3-radians central-angle configuration in which each macro cell includes three sectors, demarcated with dashed lines in . It should be appreciated that other sectorizations are possible, and aspects or features of the subject disclosure can be exploited regardless of type of sectorization. Macro cells , , and are served respectively through Node B , , and and respectively associated radio component(s) , , and . It is noted that radio component(s) (e.g., -) are functionally coupled through links  such as cables (e.g., RF and microwave coaxial lines), ports, switches, connectors, and the like, to a set of one or more antennas (e.g., , , ) that transmit and receive wireless signals. It is noted that a radio network controller (not shown), which can be a part of mobile network platform(s) , and set of base stations (e.g., Node B , with n=1,2,3) that serves a set of macro cells; electronic circuitry or components associated with the base stations in the set of base stations; a set of respective wireless links (e.g., links , with \u03bb=1,2,3) operated in accordance to a radio technology through the base stations form a macro radio access network (RAN). It is noted that based on network features, the radio controller can be distributed among the set of base stations or associated radio equipment. In an aspect, for UMTS-based networks, wireless links  embody a Uu interface.","Mobile network platform(s)  facilitates circuit switched (CS)-based and packet-switched (PS)-based (e.g., internet protocol (IP), frame relay, or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)) traffic and signaling generation, and delivery and reception, for networked telecommunication in accordance with various radio technologies for disparate markets. In an aspect, CS-based traffic can include voice and video streaming, while PS-based traffic can comprise data associated with IP-based applications such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server-client suites, web browsers, VoIP server-client environments, or the like. In addition telecommunication can exploit various frequency bands, or carriers, which include all EM frequency bands licensed by the service provider, or service provider network , (e.g., personal communication services (PCS), advanced wireless services (AWS), general wireless communications service (GWCS), and so forth), and all unlicensed frequency bands currently available for telecommunication (e.g., the 2.4 GHz industrial, medical and scientific (IMS) band or one or more of the 5 GHz set of bands). In addition, wireless network platform(s)  can control and manage base stations , and radio component(s) associated thereof, in disparate macro cells  via, for example, a wireless network management component (e.g., radio network controller(s), cellular gateway node(s) or associated serving node(s)). Similarly, wireless network platform(s)  also can control and manage radio component(s) in distributed antenna system(s) (DAS(s)). Moreover, wireless network platform(s) can integrate disparate network technologies (e.g., femtocell network(s), Wi-Fi network(s), broadband network(s), service network(s), enterprise network(s) . . . ), and associated components or infrastructure. In cellular wireless technologies (e.g., 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)), wireless network platform  is embodied in a core network and a set of radio network controllers.","In addition, backhaul link(s)  can include wired link components like T1\/E1 phone line; a digital subscriber line (DSL) either synchronous or asynchronous; an asymmetric DSL (ADSL); an optical fiber backbone; a coaxial cable, etc.; and wireless link components such as line-of-sight (LOS) or non-LOS links which can include terrestrial air-interfaces or deep space links (e.g., satellite communication links for navigation). In an aspect, for UMTS-based networks, backhaul link(s)  embodies IuB interface. In another aspect, for Evolved Packet System (EPS) network, backhaul link(s)  embodies the S1\/X2 interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3-12","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","210","210","108"]},"Distributed scheduling  thus produces a color allocation  for each base station in the set of base stations that can achieve a satisfactory network capacity, which can be optimal or nearly optimal. The scheduler, or scheduler component, that implements the distributed scheduling , can utilize the distribution of preferred colors as an initial color allocation, which is further iterated, e.g., adjusted, to produce the color allocation  and to compensate for time-dependent variations in load condition, interference, or other radio link changes, associated with the set of one or more base stations. In an aspect, the scheduler, or scheduler component, can execute (e.g., via at least in part a processor) a distributed fixed point algorithm (e.g., retained in a memory) to generate color allocation  through iteration of an initial color allocation, e.g., preferred color distribution. Color allocation  for the set of base stations can be retained in a resource exclusion list (REL). In an aspect, a REL conveys a partition of electromagnetic radiation spectrum available to the telecommunication carrier that administers the set of base stations, recording allocation(s) of spectrally disparate frequency resources, or color(s), to each base station in the set of base stations.","At least for high-priority traffic, e.g., guaranteed-bit-rate (GBR) traffic, such allocation of frequency resources, or color allocation , is directed to increase capacity of the set of base stations through reduction of inter-cell or inter-sector interference. As described below, at least a portion of frequency resources in color allocation  that are insufficient for transport, or delivery, of high-priority traffic, can be deemed non-preferred color allocation and can be assigned to low priority traffic, e.g., non-GBR traffic, overflowed high-priority traffic, or traffic in coverage areas without significant mutual interference amongst serving cells or sectors.","Color allocation  is supplied to a scheduler (not shown in ), or scheduler component, that conducts priority scheduling  as second-stage scheduling. Such scheduling incorporates at least one of radio link condition(s)  or traffic input , which includes GBR flow(s) , also referred to as GBR traffic flow(s) , and non-GBR flow(s) , also referred to as n-GBR traffic flow(s), and allocates frequency-time resources, e.g., physical resource blocks in 3GPP LTE based technology, in accordance at least in part with estimated available capacity in a set of frequency-time resources for a specific base station and service requirements of GBR flow(s) . Available frequency-time resources for allocation are constrained in part by color allocation . Allocation of frequency-time resources in second-stage scheduling includes generation of a first set of frequency-time resources, which is included in a resource reservation list (RRL) for GBR traffic flow(s)  and the REL, and a second set of frequency-time resources which is included in a complementary RRL (CRRL) that allocates frequency-time resources for n-GBR traffic flow(s) . Conventional priority queuing (PQ) technique(s) can be employed to schedule transmission of one or more flows in GBR traffic flow(s) .","CRRL is complementary to RRL in that the CRRL includes frequency-time resources that are part of the color allocation  for the base station, but have insufficient bit rate throughput (due, for example, to poor radio link quality) to support transmission of GBR packets, which are part of GBR traffic flow(s) , in accordance with pre-determined requirements. Accordingly, in addition to scheduling GBR traffic flow(s) , second-stage scheduling or priority scheduling  produces a complement-color allocation  which is conveyed to a scheduler, or scheduler component, that effects fair scheduling  as third-stage scheduling of non-GBR traffic flow(s)  and re-transmission of data packets that compose such traffic.","Scheduling stages are repeated periodically as illustrated in diagram ; arrows that connect disparate points in delay timeline  represent such periodicity. It should be appreciated that reiteration of a scheduling stage leads to reiteration of subsequent scheduling stage(s). First-stage scheduling, represented with solid circle(s) , has a period \u0394\u03c4 which is longer than period \u0394\u03c4 of second-state scheduling, represented with grey circle(s) , which in turn is longer than period \u0394\u03c4 of third-state scheduling, represented with open circle(s) . In an aspect, \u0394\u03c4 can be two orders of magnitude longer than \u0394\u03c4, which can be one order of magnitude longer than \u0394\u03c4: As an example, \u0394\u03c4=60 s; \u0394\u03c4=20 ms; and \u0394\u03c4=1 ms. Time scale of period of each scheduling stage described herein can be dictated, at least in part, by at least one of time scale of changes in input information utilized to allocate radio resources and to schedule traffic, or computational cost to perform the scheduling stage. In an aspect, distributed scheduling  is the most computation intensive since includes collection or exchange of load condition(s) of a plurality of base stations and analysis of a significant manifold of frequency and power allocation, particularly for small (e.g., 1.25 KHz) sub-carrier spacing and large portions of available EM radiation spectrum (also termed herein available spectrum). In another aspect, changes in load condition(s) within a served sector or cell occur over longer time scale(s) than changes to service requirement for queued traffic. Accordingly, \u0394\u03c4>\u0394\u03c4. Similarly, to increase likelihood of successful delivery of data packets in n-GBR traffic , \u0394\u03c4>\u0394\u03c4allows various re-transmission attempts of such data packets and adjustment of traffic load that result from served n-GBR, e.g., best effort, data packets.","In an aspect of the subject disclosure, magnitude of at least one of \u0394\u03c4, \u0394\u03c4, or \u0394\u03c4can be configured statically or dynamically. Static configuration can be effected by a network administrator. Dynamic configuration can be performed automatically in accordance with a predetermined set of criteria, such as magnitude and rate of changes in load condition(s) , traffic input , or radio link quality, as determined from radio link condition(s)  (e.g., CQI report(s), MCS indicator(s), signal strength data . . . ). In addition or in the alternative, dynamic configuration can be conducted autonomously based at least in part on analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of load condition(s)  in the set of base stations or network performance resulting from at least color allocation  or complement-color allocation . Dynamic configuration of scheduling period(s) also can be implemented based on cost-utility trade-off amongst scheduling costs (e.g., collection of load condition(s) , signaling level of delivery of load condition(s) information or scanning of available traffic flow(s) . . . ), which are incurred at each instance of a scheduling stage, and benefit of allocating radio resources and traffic in accordance at least in part with updated load condition(s) and traffic input.","Periodic or iterative implementation of the scheduling stages can enable optimization or nearly-optimization of network capacity through periodic or iterative update of radio resource allocation(s) and schedule(s) that are based at least in part on updated load condition(s) in one or more served sectors. Reiteration of first-stage scheduling  can afford re-packing, or redistribution, of frequency radio resources in color allocation  in response to changes in load condition(s) in a set of one or more served sectors, e.g., change in traffic or change in inter-cell interference levels in one or more sectors. In an aspect, re-generation of a color allocation  for a set of base stations is implemented even in scenarios in which a base station within the set of base stations is failing. Re-packing of radio-resources can warrant re-generation of RRL and CRRL, which is afforded by reiteration of second-stage scheduling. It should be appreciated that such reiteration allows for acquisition of updated traffic input , and associated GBR flow(s)  and n-GBR flow(s) . Updated RRL and CRRL enable re-scheduling of both GBR flow(s)  and n-GBR flow(s)  as traffic is served. In addition, substantially shorter period \u0394\u03c4with respect to \u0394\u03c4allows efficient scheduling of re-transmission of n-GBR, e.g., best effort, packet(s).","The multi-stage, nested scheduling described herein and enabled by the system(s) described below, provide at least the following advantages with respect to conventional approaches to scheduling of traffic flow(s) with strict service requirements: (i) Distributed scheduling  ensures that interference to a traffic loaded base station is minimized, thus network capacity is optimized or nearly-optimized. (ii) Priority scheduling  ensures that traffic flow(s) that demand strict service requirements or quality of service (QoS), such as voice traffic or audiovisual media content, can have requirements fulfilled. (iii) Through scheduling of non-GBR traffic in a shorter scheduling period, re-transmission of data packets and recovery of unused radio resources allocated to GBR traffic flow(s) is allowed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","210","310","202","312","312","312","312","312","312","312","338","312","312","310"]},"As described supra, based on the color allocation, stage I scheduler  can generate a REL that conveys color saturation and color luminance for the set of base stations. The REL can be retained in memory element REL(s) . Methodologies to search for suitable color allocation(s) for a base station can be retained in algorithm storage . As an illustration,  presents a color allocation for two neighboring cells and , with loads characterized through functions \u0192(t) and \u0192(t), respectively. In the illustration in , cells and are served, respectively, by base stations and ; such base stations are functionally connected via backhaul pipe(s)  (see also ). At a time \u03c4, cells and are allocated blocks of frequency resources and , respectively. Blocks and are colors characterized, respectively, by saturations \u03bd-\u03bdand \u03bd-\u03bd. Saturation of color represented by block can be larger than saturation for color of block to reflect, for example, larger load in cell . At time \u03c4\u2032, stage I scheduler  can generate a disparate color allocation that can reflect variations in cell loads or in other network performance metrics, wherein cell is allocated a block of frequency resources with saturation \u03bd\u2032-\u03bd\u2032, and cell is allocated a block of frequency resources with saturation \u03bd\u2032-\u03bd\u2032, with \u03bd\u2032=\u03bd.","For the set of base stations, stage I scheduler  can supply a color allocation, which includes color saturation and color luminance, to stage II scheduler component , also referred to herein and annexed drawings as stage II scheduler , which can implement priority scheduling  as described supra. Such color allocation can be a preferred color allocation determined as described hereinbefore. In an aspect, for each base station in the set of base stations that provides input to load condition(s) , a received color allocation can be discriminated in accordance with physical resource blocks, which are frequency resources that span a set of frequency sub-carriers with a specific bandwidth during a transmission time interval. Stage II scheduler  can acquire, via, for example, a collection component (not shown) a CQI estimate and associated modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for each PRB allocated to a predetermined base station as established in the supplied REL; in an aspect, the predetermined base station can be that which hosts scheduler component . The CQI estimate and associated MCS can be acquired as part of radio link condition(s) , which can be received from one or more user equipment. In the alternative or in addition, the CQI estimate and associated MCS can be acquired through assessment of a radio link quality metric based at least on channel quality data that is measured by the one or more user equipment and received as part of radio link condition(s) . As an illustration, diagram  in  displays CQI estimates for a set of PRBs that are part of an example REL and for a set of traffic flows. Numerical indices associated with each represented PRB (a sketched rectangle in ) convey the respective CQI estimate; higher values indicate higher radio channel quality, and a null value represents a PRB with insufficient CQI to transport high-priority traffic.","Based on the acquired CQIs and associated MCSs, stage II scheduler  can compute flow capacity for the color allocation associated with the predetermined base station and determine an effective bit rate that can be transported for each PRB. In an example, the flow capacity and the effective bit rate can be established in Kbps. In an aspect, flow capacity for a PRB can be computed or determined based on Kaufman-Roberts recursion for GBR traffic flow(s)  and non-GBR traffic flow(s) . It should be appreciated that other approximation(s) or formalism(s) can be employed to determine flow capacity for the PRB; variation(s) of Kaufman-Roberts recursion also can be employed to establish the flow capacity for the PRB. It should be further appreciated that flow capacity in stage II scheduling, or priority scheduling, can be determined as a bit rate q, e.g., q Kbps, since service requirements of GBR traffic, e.g., GBR flow(s) , are typically expressed in terms of committed information rates (CIR). Accordingly, scheduler platform , via, for example, stage II scheduler , performs MCS time filtering to estimate an effective bit rate, or bit rate metric, for the duration of a call session in order to mitigate, e.g., minimize, signaling to a mobile device that initiates and maintains the call session.","Stage II scheduler  can acquire traffic input , which includes GBR flow(s)  and non-GBR flow(s) . Acquisition can be non-local (as illustrated in diagram ), wherein stage II scheduler  conveys and indication to a network node (e.g., a mobility management entity (MME)) to deliver queued traffic for the base station that includes stage II scheduler . Alternatively, acquisition can be local, wherein stage II scheduler  polls a queue (not shown) in data storage  to determine volume of GBR and n-GBR data available data packets that compose GBR traffic flow(s)  and n-GBR traffic flow(s) . As illustration, diagram  in  indicates two GBR flows for user equipment with identities (IDs)  and . Based on acquired GBR traffic flow(s) , stage II scheduler  generates at least one of an RRL and a CRRL, and retains at least one of RRL or CRRL in memory element  or . To produce the RRL, stage II scheduler  can match bit requirements for acquired GBR data flows with computed bit rate capacity for the PRBs in the color allocation available to the base station for which the GBR traffic flow(s)  is available. To produce CRRL, stage II scheduler  allocates PRBs that are part of the color allocation for the base station for which RRL is configured and do not provide suitable radio link quality or associated MCS. Thus, PRBs indicated in CRRL can transport at least a portion of data packets that compose non-GBR traffic flow(s) . In diagram  in , open blocks represent PRBs that are part of a generated RRL, wherein, as described supra, numerical indices in each open block convey a bit rate that respective PRBs can support or transport. A set of 10 transmission time intervals (TTIs) is illustrated in diagram . Based on radio resources reserved in RRL, stage II scheduler  schedules GBR traffic flow(s)  based on priority queuing (PQ), whereas scheduling of non-GBR traffic flow(s)  are based on fair scheduling . Methodologies to implement PQ can be retained in algorithm storage .","In an example scenario such as the one illustrated in , blocks  and  sketch an RRL and CRRL for frequency resource blocks, or colors, and . In blocks  and , dashed rectangles represent allocated resources for GBR traffic, e.g., GBR flow(s), while grey rectangles represent resources allocated to n-GBR traffic, e.g., n-GBR flow(s) . Likewise, for color allocation at time \u03c4\u2032, blocks  and  both represent RRL and CRRL allocations. As illustrated, stage II scheduler  produces allocation(s) in which spectral separation amongst frequency resources for high-priority traffic (e.g., GBR flow(s) ; dashed rectangles) is larger than spectral separation between frequency resources assigned to low-priority traffic (e.g., n-GBR flow(s) ; grey area) in order to reduce effects of mutual interference amongst cell and in transport of GBR traffic. Such mutual interference can be caused by telecommunication (e.g., wireless delivery or wireless reception) of traffic (e.g., user data, or control data or signaling) associated with user equipment , and . In addition or in the alternative, color allocation at time \u03c4 can result from a reduction in high-priority traffic in at least one of cell or ; for instance, UE and UE can terminate call sessions that consume (e.g., transmit or receive) GBR traffic. As illustrated, reduced high-priority traffic from instant \u03c4 to instant \u03c4\u2032 can lead to reduced spectral separation amongst frequency resources allocated in blocks and , and reduced levels of frequency resources with respect to allocation at time \u03c4. It should be appreciated that the resources granted to a cell or sector in a color allocation are available for user equipment that operates in the cell or sector. As indicated supra, dashed rectangles represent allocation of frequency resources for user equipment that transmit and receive high-priority traffic, and grey-area rectangles represent resources allocated for user equipment that transmits and delivers low-priority traffic.","In an aspect, scheduler , or component(s) therein (e.g., stage II scheduler ), can allocate frequency resources in accordance with an allocation probability profile, which can determine, at least in part, a blocking probability for assignment of a frequency resource to a specific call class, e.g., high-priority traffic call or low-priority traffic call. In an example scenario, Kaufman-Roberts algorithm can be employed to determine the blocking probability and thus a satisfactory (e.g., optimal or nearly-optimal) PRB allocation. At instant \u03c4, allocation probability profile  can lead, for example, to allocation realization shown in block , while allocation probability profile  can result, for example, in allocation displayed in block . As indicated supra, if traffic in at least one of cell or is reduced from instant \u03c4 to instant \u03c4\u2032, probability allocation profiles  and  can display a smaller probability for a larger portion of available frequency resources in blocks and , respectively.","In an aspect of the subject disclosure, in operational scenarios in which Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) power control is employed, e.g., by a base station, PDSCH attenuation can be factored in, or included, in the determination of overall chromatic priority, or probability profile(s), to produce a satisfactory (e.g., optimized or nearly-optimized) PRB allocation. In an aspect, user equipment with higher PDSCH attenuation can have a lower chromatic priority than user equipment that operates at full PDSCH transmit power.","Stage III scheduler component , also referred herein and in the annexed drawings as stage III scheduler , performs fair scheduling . To at least that end, in an aspect, stage III scheduler  acquires CQI and allowable MCS per PRB for the set of PRBs conveyed in CRRL, which are PRBs allocated for non-GBR traffic. If current or nearly current load condition(s) determined from such acquisition requires additional radio resources, e.g., PRB(s), to transport the non-GBR traffic flow(s) , stage III scheduler  can unmask a set of non-committed PRBs listed in RRL(s) ; non-committed PRBs are those resources not scheduled to transport a data packet. To unmask a PRB, stage III scheduler  can logically remove, e.g., through a tag, the PRB from the RRL and allocate the PRB for transport of non-GBR traffic data packet(s). Based on allocated PRBs, including the set of unmasked PRBs, stage III scheduler  can schedule transmission of non-GBR traffic in accordance with fair queuing, e.g., weighted fair queuing (WFQ); methodologies to implement fair queuing can be retained in algorithm storage . Accordingly, a scheduled transmission can be substantially random and based primarily in CQI estimates. Diagram , in , displays acquired CQI for a set of PRBs, and a respective set of TTIs, wherein black rectangles indicate PRBs that are granted for high-priority traffic transport (see, e.g., ); the set of PRBs is the same as the set of PRBs illustrated in diagram . Diagram  presents a transmission schedule for the set of PRBs, and respective TTIs, included in diagram ; numerical indices convey scheduler bit-rate capacity for respective PRBs.","As an illustration,  displays an example color allocation and assignment of frequency resources to high-priority and low-priority traffic for coverage cells and . The color allocation includes frequency blocks and , which are spectrally adjacent. As described supra, saturation for block can be larger because of larger load level (e.g., larger value of function \u0192) in cell . Diagram  displays two illustrative sketches of resource allocation probability profiles that scheduler platform , or components therein, can produce for disparate times (\u03c4 and \u03c4\u2032) and frequency resource blocks and in accordance with multi-stage scheduling described herein. In diagram , Cand Cindicate, respectively, center of cell  and , while B indicates the point at cell boundary that is intersected by a straight line connecting centers Cand C. At a first time \u03c4, for load conditions determined in part by \u0192(\u03c4) and \u0192(\u03c4), allocation probability Pof frequency resources for high-priority traffic, or GBR traffic, in block obeys a profile , while in block , Pis determined by profile . Allocation probability of frequency resources for low-priority traffic, or n-GBR traffic, is determined by P=1\u2212P. As illustrated in diagram , and indicated supra, scheduler platform , or components therein (e.g., stage II scheduler ), can generate an allocation of frequency resources that increases spectral separation of frequency resources granted to high-priority traffic in different coverage cells. At a second time \u03c4\u2032, load conditions in coverage cells and and mutual interference amongst such coverage cells can change and scheduler platform , or components therein (e.g., stage I scheduler  or stage II scheduler ), can update allocation probability of resources granted for traffic within cells and . Such update is herein termed repacking and can be characterized by adjusted allocation probability profiles, e.g.,  and . It should be appreciated that, based on time-scale, re-packing also can include adjustment of color allocation; for instance, every period \u0394\u03c4 can result in repacking of frequency-time resources due to color allocation re-generation.","In a particular, illustrative scenario, changes in load and mutual interference conditions can result from mobility of user equipment from cell-center operation to cell-edge operation. In an aspect, cell-center operation can be characterized by UE low transmit power and high path loss relative to neighboring cells, whereas cell-edge operation can be characterized by high transmit power (e.g., a predetermined substantial fraction of maximum allowed transmit power for UE) and low path loss relative to neighboring coverage cells. Accordingly, to mitigate inter-cell interference resulting from mobility of UE that results in a transition from cell-center to cell-edge operation, repacking produced by scheduler platform , or components therein (e.g., stage II scheduler  and stage III scheduler ), can increase spectral separation amongst frequency resources granted for high-priority traffic in cells and . In view of spectral separation of frequency resources granted to high-priority traffic, traffic exchange between a mobile device, such as , that operates in the vicinity of the edge of coverage cell is protected, at least in part, from interference that can be caused by displacement of UE towards the edge of cell .","In one or more operational scenarios in which PDSCH power control is effected, user equipment that consumes high-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP traffic) can contribute different interference costs per PRB based at least in part on dynamic power allocated to the PDSCH. With respect to multi-stage scheduling, or chromatic scheduling, described herein, UE that consume high-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP traffic) at cell center utilize less power per PDSCH PRB, create less interference on disparate UE, and therefore can require lower priority than cell edge UE with full PDSCH power. In particular, though not exclusively, and in an aspect, PDSCH-attenuated cell-center UE that consume high-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP or other GBR traffic) can require lower priority than non-attenuated cell-center UE that consumes low-priority (e.g., best-effort or other n-GBR traffic) with MCS that includes M-ary QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), with M a natural number. Accordingly, repacking of frequency-time resources as implemented by scheduler platform , or components therein (e.g., stage II scheduler  and stage III scheduler ), can afford to allocate such PDSCH-attenuated cell-center UE that consume high-priority traffic to PRB(s) which, for example, are co-channel with the primary color of a neighboring cell, e.g., block . However, for substantially the same conditions (e.g., PDSCH power control), the repacking avoids allocation of such PRB(s) to cell-center UE that consumes low-priority traffic (e.g., best-effort traffic or other n-GBR traffic) with M-ary QAM at full power.","With respect to repacking, scheduler platform , or components therein (e.g., stage II scheduler ), can adjust granted resources for high-priority traffic (e.g., GBR flow(s) ) and low-priority traffic (n-GBR flow(s) ) in response to load changes originating from changes in traffic, e.g., GBR flow(s) . In an aspect, such adjustment can mitigate surplus of frequency resources assigned to low-priority traffic, as represented in . In an example scenario, at instant \u03c4\u2033, a first color allocation of frequency resources, e.g., frequency blocks and , illustrated n diagram , can result in an assignment of frequency resources, e.g., profiles  and , for high-priority traffic that presents a surplus of frequency resources in view of low high-priority traffic in one or more of cells or . In addition, the first color allocation (diagram ) includes frequency blocks and . As illustrated, the surplus of frequency resources is represented by a substantive allocation of such resources to low-priority traffic, which in view of the finite amount of frequency resources available to a telecommunication carrier, it can lead to network performance degradation related to non-optimal or limited frequency resources allocation for traffic in coverage cells other than cells and , e.g., coverage cells associated with frequency blocks and . To assign resources to the high-priority traffic more effectively, scheduler platform , or components therein, can adjust, via implementation of multi-stage scheduling described herein, the first color allocation and the assignment of frequency resources to reduce available surplus of frequency resources and thus improve overall network performance. As illustrated, at time \u03c4\u2032\u2033, a second color allocation, e.g., frequency blocks and , illustrated in diagram , spans a lesser number of frequency resources, while profiles  and  of allocation probability for high-priority traffic assign lesser resources to low-priority traffic. In addition, as part of adjustment to the initial color allocation, blocks and (diagram ) are assigned increased saturation.","Repacking of frequency resources thus can improve resource allocation for various interference condition(s). In particular, scheduler platform , or component(s) therein, also can grant radio resources in response to, or to accommodate, inter-cell interference, as illustrated in . The sketched example allocation of frequency resources optimizes or nearly-optimizes inter-cell interference condition(s) in a cluster of four coverage cells -. The inter-cell interference condition(s) can be current or historical; in view of the periodic scheduling of radio resources (see, e.g., ), in one or more scenarios, such inter-cell interference can correspond to historical values of mutual interference. In addition, scheduler platform , or component(s) therein, can assess mutual inter-cell-interference through construction of a mutual interference matrix I (with \u03b1,\u03b2 a positive integer) via collection of load condition(s) , as described supra. For the cluster of cells illustrated in diagram , at a specific time, mutual interference can be represented by the set of values {I, I, I, I, I, I}. For relative magnitudes of such values of inter-cell interference as illustrated in diagram , scheduler platform , or component(s) therein, can generate color allocation  and produce allocation probability profiles , , , and , as presented in diagram . Frequency blocks -increase spectral separation amongst cells with larger inter-cell interference. Likewise, frequency resources granted to high-priority traffic (represented with dashed surface) also display increased spectral separation for traffic in cells with higher mutual interference. As inter-cell interference condition(s) changes, e.g., values in diagrams  are modified in view of operation condition in cluster shown in diagram , scheduler platform , or component(s) therein, can adjust allocation of frequency resources (e.g., diagrams  and ) to accommodate changed mutual interference condition(s).","In addition or in the alternative, repacking of frequency resources can mitigate high-traffic collisions that can result from allocation of spectrally overlapping frequency-time resources to user equipment in disparate cells or sector. Traffic collision risk can be estimated, e.g., by stage II scheduler  via an analysis component (not shown), based in part on portion of overlapping frequency-time resources allocations, or assignments, between cell or sectors with highest or substantially highest mutual interference. In an aspect, mutual interference can be estimated by stage II scheduler , via the analysis component (not shown), through determination of traffic served in overlapping regions where reported neighbor interference is similar; stage II scheduler can receive reports of interference as part of load condition(s)  and via backhaul pipe(s) that functionally connect one or more base stations.","In an aspect of the subject disclosure, to provide reservation of resources (e.g., PRB(s)) to a mobile device, scheduler platform  can guarantee specific capacity for set(s) of one or more traffic flows, e.g., GBR flow(s)  or n-GBR flow(s) . In an aspect of the subject disclosure, capacity guarantee(s), or committed capacity lower bound, can be afforded via service curve(s), or service function(s), as described hereinafter. Such service curve(s), or service function(s), can be determined for a specific set of frequency-time resources (e.g., PRBs) and for specific user equipment. In contrast to conventional scheduling approaches in which a bit rate guarantee for a traffic flow is provided based upon a continuum model, e.g., based on an idealized Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) node as part of conventional Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), service curve(s) establish a capacity guarantee that incorporates the discrete, e.g., packetized, nature of a traffic flow.","Definition of a service curve, also referred to as service function, generalizes the continuum GPS scheduling model in the following manner For an input flow R, e.g., GBR flow(s) , that is served with an allocated bit rate p and has an associated output flow R* and in the absence of overflow (e.g., scheduler buffer sufficiently large to avoid traffic rejection), output flow at time t for a busy period that starts at time t, satisfies\n\n()\u2212()\u2267\u03c1\u00d7().\n","In addition, under the assumption of null backlog at time t, which can be expressed as R(t)\u2212R*(t)=0, net output flow at time t after busy period starting instant tobeys\n\n()\u2212()\u2267\u03c1\u00d7().\n","Accordingly, for a time t, the net output flow is bound as follows:\n\n*()\u2267in()+\u03c1\u00d7()},\n\nwhere inf{S} denotes the infinum of set S spanned over domain arg.\n","A service function \u03b2(t\u2212s), with s a delay that demarcates packet traffic initiation, can be defined as\n\n()\u2267in()+\u03b2()}\u2003\u2003(Eq. (1))\n\nif and only if \u03b2(\u03c4), with \u03c4 a real argument, is wide sense increasing, \u03b2(0)=0, and output flow at t is lower bounded through the min-max convolution of input flow and \u03b2(\u03c4) and an initial incoming flow R(\u03c4), with \u03c4the initial time; namely,\n\n*(\u03c4)\u2267(\u03c4)\u03b2(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4).\n\nFor a continuous \u03b2(\u03c4), R*(\u03c4) is bounded from below as follows:\n\n*(\u03c4)\u2267(\u03c4)+\u03b2(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4),\n\nwhere R(\u03c4)=supR(s) and supF(\u2022) is the supremum of function F(\u2022) over domain set {set}. Scheduler platform , via, for example, stage II scheduler , can compute \u03b2(t\u2212s) from Eq. (1) for a specific (mobile device, frequency-time set) pair through computation of output flow for the specific frequency-time set, e.g., PRB, and mobile device and based on requested input flow, e.g., GBR flow(s) .  illustrates, in chart , input flow R(t), represented with solid line , and estimated output flow R*(t), represented with solid line , for a specific (UE,PRB) pair and an extracted service function, while in chart  an extracted service function \u03b2(\u03c4) is displayed; thick line  with arrowhead) as a function of time shift. For illustration purposes, lower envelope R(\u03c4)\u03b2(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4) is generated within an simplified model in which the service function in diagram  is rigidly shifted in accordance with incoming flow R(\u03c4).\n","Since channel quality indicator (CQI) for a specific (UE, {frequency-time resource(s)}) pair is time dependent in view of the dynamic nature of the air-interface, capacity associated with {frequency-time resource(s)} (e.g., one or more PRBs) is not constant\u2014as indicated supra, in a scenario, capacity can be established in Kbps. Accordingly, scheduler platform , which can reside in an eNode B, can provide variable service capacity to the specific UE in the (UE, {frequency-time resource(s)}) pair. To account for the dynamic nature of the provided capacity, e.g., afforded Kbps, of the (UE, {frequency-time resource(s)}) pair, scheduler platform  can generate a cumulative function M(t), where M(t) is the total service capacity, for example, estimated in bits, that is available to a traffic flow such as GBR traffic , between instants 0 and t. In an aspect, stage II scheduler  can generate, at least in part, the cumulative function M(t), which can be retained in data storage ; method(s) to generate M(t) can be stored in algorithm storage . Stage II scheduler  can generate, e.g., compute, the cumulative function M(t) under the assumption that a node buffer, e.g., at least a portion of data storage , is sufficiently large to accommodate incoming traffic flow(s), e.g., traffic input , and avoid overflow. In one or more embodiments, if scheduler platform  is implemented as part of a telecommunication network that exploits LTE radio technology and thus exploits Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing, M(t) is the aggregated number of bits conveyed within the (0,t] interval in a set of frequency-time resources that comprise a specific PRB. As an example, it should be noted that for GBR services such as VoIP, the specific PRB allocation can be repeated with a period, or cadence, of 20 ms.","In an aspect, if the time-dependent capacity of a set of frequency-time resources, e.g., a PRB, satisfies a minimum guarantee of the form\n\n()\u2212()\u2267\u03b3(),\n\nfor some fixed function \u03b3 and for all 0\u2266s\u2266t, then \u03b3(t\u2212s) is a strict service curve, or service function, as defined supra. Scheduler platform , or one or more components therein, can compute a service curve \u03b3(t\u2212s) and related slope \u03b3\u2032(t\u2212s)=d\u03b3(t\u2212s)\/dt. Scheduler platform , or the one or more components therein, can cast \u03b3\u2032(t\u2212s) as a guaranteed bit rate provided by a specific set of frequency-time resources, e.g., a specific PRB, for which service curve \u03b3(t\u2212s) is computed. It should be appreciated that for GBR services such as VoIP communication, e.g., transmission, that are scheduled periodically with a predetermined cadence, e.g., 20 ms, the guaranteed bit rate as determined by \u03b3\u2032(t\u2212s) is to be recomputed and adjusted, e.g., scaled, accordingly. In an aspect, stage II scheduler  can compute service curve \u03b3(t\u2212s) and its slope \u03b3\u2032(t\u2212s)=d\u03b3(t\u2212s)\/dt.  illustrate example cumulative functions M(t) for specific pairs (PRB,UE), and related service curves \u03b3(t\u2212s) extracted from the cumulative functions under the assumption of null delay, e.g., s=0. Time t is in units of transmission time interval (TTI) and capacity is in bits per interval (0,t]. In chart , straight line  is extracted service curve, whereas the remaining trace , or line, is the related cumulative function. It is noted that specific PRB in chart  is different from a set of two PRBs for which respective cumulative functions and service curves that are displayed in diagram . In diagram , a first pair  of traces illustrate the following: straight line  is extracted service curve and remaining trace  is cumulative function for a pair (PRB,UE). A second pair  of traces illustrate the following: straight line  is extracted service curve and remaining trace  is cumulative function for a pair (PRB,UE). Likewise, UE in chart  is different from pair of UEs associated with respective PRBs in diagram . Diagram  also displays traces , which correspond to instantaneous capacity at instant t.\n","As described supra, service curve(s) can establish a lower bound for afforded bit rate or capacity of a set of frequency-time resources, e.g., one or more PRBs. Accordingly, scheduler platform , via, for example, stage II scheduler , can allocate resources, such as PRB(s), that match specific traffic specification(s) within the framework of Integrated Services (IntServ) as characterized by a manifold of one or more arrival curves:\n\n\u03b1()=min(\u03bc+),\n\nwhere t is time, \u03bc is maximum packet size conveyed in the traffic, p is peak rate, b is burst tolerance, and r is sustainable rate; and min(\u2022,\u2022) is the minimum function. Within IntServ, four-tuple (\u03bc, p, r, b) represents a particular traffic specification (T-SPEC). T-SPEC parameters for GBR and n-GBR services can be specified and retained in a network memory, or repository, such as a call control database, which can be part of a Home Location Register (HLR), a Home Subscriber Server (HSS), or the like. In addition or in the alternative, T-SPEC parameters can be retained in a memory functionally coupled to scheduler platform , or any other scheduler described herein; for example, memory  can retain T-SPEC parameters for GBR and n-GBR services within data storage . Based at least in part on T-SPEC for a specific UE, scheduler platform , or any other scheduler platform described herein, can match, as part of call admission phase, per-UE T-SPEC bit requirements with available frequency-time resources, e.g., a set of PRBs. In one or more embodiments, stage II scheduler  can compute an arrival curve (\u03b1(t)) for a specific service, either GBR service or n-GBR service and related data flows, in accordance with available (e.g., retained in an accessible memory, such as memory ) T-SPEC parameters. In addition, in such one or more embodiments, stage II scheduler  can match bit-rate requirement(s), as determined by a computed arrival curve according to per-UE T-SPEC, with available frequency-time resources. It should be appreciated that matching of bit requirement(s) and available frequency-time resources can enable a satisfactory (e.g., optimal or nearly-optimal) allocation of such available frequency-time resources, e.g., a set of PRBs.\n","In a further aspect of the subject disclosure, slope (\u03b2\u2032(t\u2212s)=d\u03b2(t\u2212s)\/dt of a service curve \u03b2(t\u2212s) characterizes long-term performance of a specific set of frequency-time resources, e.g., a PRB, for which \u03b2(t\u2212s). Thus, scheduler platform  or any other scheduler platform described herein can offload scheduling of call session(s) (e.g., VoIP session(s), FTP session(s) . . . ) from multi-stage scheduling as described herein to Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) to increase call handling capacity for a cell or a sector. Scheduler platform , via, for example a monitoring component (not shown), can monitor performance of the cell or sector and, if at an instant the frame error rate (FER), for example, increases beyond a predetermined threshold, the call session(s) can be dispatched back from SPS to multi-stage scheduling, or chromatic scheduling, implemented by scheduler platform  or component(s) therein.","In another aspect of the subject disclosure, scheduler platform  or any other scheduler platform described herein can improve utilization of radio link quality information, e.g., CQI reports, or channel state information (CSI), such as channel rank, available in radio link condition(s) , to grant radio resources for traffic telecommunication. To at least such end, stage II scheduler  can extract radio link condition(s), e.g., CQI reports or CSI, for a first set of radio resources from received radio link condition(s) ; the extracted radio link condition(s) can be generated by a first set of wireless devices. The first set of radio resources need not be granted to one or more wireless devices in the first set of wireless devices; e.g., a mobile handset can generate radio link condition(s) for radio resources (e.g., PRBs) at a time in which such radio resources have not been granted to the mobile handset. The first set of radio resources can include frequency resources, e.g., physical resource blocks for different sub-carrier bandwidth, that span various portions of a color allocation. For instance, the first set of radio resources can include frequency resources (e.g., PRB(s)) for disparate coverage cells or sector, such as frequency resources in blocks and . The first set of wireless devices can include wireless devices that operate in one or more coverage cells or sectors, and consume (e.g., transmit and receive) low-priority traffic, such as n-GBR flow(s) . In one or more scenarios, the first set of radio resources can include PRBs that are allocated for telecommunication of high-priority traffic through a mobile device located in the vicinity of the edge of a coverage cell or sector (e.g., UE ). Additionally, stage II scheduler  can extract radio link condition(s) for a second set of resources, wherein CQI reports or CSI is generated by a second set of wireless devices. Similar to the first set of wireless devices, the second set of wireless devices can include wireless devices that operate in one or more coverage cells. However, differently from the first set of wireless devices, wireless device(s) in the second set of wireless devices consumes high-priority traffic (e.g., GBR flow(s) ). The second set of radio resources can span various portions of a color allocation and can overlap, at least in part, with the first set of radio resources. Extracted radio link condition(s) can be retained in data storage .","Through the extracted radio link condition(s), in an aspect, stage II scheduler  can assess a path loss metric for one or more wireless devices in the first set of wireless devices and in the second set of wireless devices. The path loss metric can be determined in accordance with one or more models of electromagnetic propagation in the environment in which the first and second sets of wireless devices operate. Based on value(s) of the assessed path loss metric, stage II scheduler  can generate one or more groups or segments of wireless devices with value(s) of path loss metrics within a predetermined interval, and thus identify a wireless device with a path loss metric value within a specific range. In particular, though not exclusively, stage II scheduler  can identify a first wireless device (e.g., UE ) that is part of the first set of wireless devices, wherein the first wireless device has a first path loss value within a tolerance from a second path loss value for a second wireless device (e.g., UE ) in the second set of wireless devices. The second wireless device can operate in the same cell (e.g., cell ) in which the first wireless device operates. Through identification of the first and second wireless device with relative path loss metrics within a predetermined tolerance, scheduler platform , via one or more components therein or in part through processor(s) , can schedule a group of radio resources in the second set of radio resources for the second wireless device based at least in part on the collected radio link condition(s) for the first set of radio resources. It should be appreciated that the scheduled group of radio resources is directed to granting radio resources for telecommunication of high-priority traffic. Accordingly, the second wireless device that consumes high-priority traffic can be assigned optimized or nearly-optimized radio resources (e.g., set of PRBs) in accordance with the multi-stage scheduling described herein, without incurring costly uplink signaling.","At least one advantage of utilization of radio link quality information, e.g., one or more CQI reports or channel state information (CSI), such as channel rank, is that dependency on some of the inter-eNB load information exchange is reduced and optimization or near optimization of allocation of frequency-time resources can be nearly real-time. In addition, in view of the granularity and availability of radio link information generated and signaled by user equipment that consumes low-priority traffic, utilization of such radio link information allows for improved exploitation of time-dependent traffic patterns for produce maximum or nearly-maximum capacity of a set of base stations.","It is noted that EM radiation propagation aspects such as fading or Doppler effect can compromise, at least partially, the validity of the assumption of similar interference environments for the first wireless device and the second wireless device. To utilize radio link quality information generated by wireless devices that consume low-priority traffic and avoid conditions that invalidate the assumption of similar interference environment(s), scheduler platform , via one or more components therein or in part through processor(s) , can exploit radio link quality information generated by stationary or pseudo-stationary devices that communicate wirelessly and assign radio resources based at least in part on such radio link quality to mobile devices.","In example system , stage I scheduler , stage II scheduler , and stage III scheduler  can exploit clock layer  to account for elapsed time. Clock layer  can implement clock strata and time-stamp features in accordance with Network Time Protocol to supply timing information necessary for periodic reiteration of multi-stage scheduling.","In example system , processor(s)  can be configured to provide or can provide, at least in part, the described functionality of the various components or layer(s) of scheduler platform . To provide such functionality, processor(s)  can be functionally coupled (indicated with arrows in ) through a bus (not shown) or any other information exchange conduit, protocol, or mechanism among disclosed memory(ies) or component(s) or subcomponents. Such bus or conduit can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus, a system bus, an address bus, or a message bus, for data. In an aspect, processor(s)  can execute code instructions (not shown) stored in memory  or alternative or additional memory components or elements therein, to provide the described functionality of example system  and various components thereof.","In addition to memory elements described supra, and illustrated in , for example, memory  can retain template(s) of service curves, cumulative service curves, or arrival curves, based on determined, e.g., computed, historical values. Such template(s) can be generated, for example, as described. Memory  also can retain template(s) of preferred color allocations, as described supra.","In additional or alternative embodiment(s), scheduler platform  and component(s) or layer(s) therein can be retained in memory  as one or more sets of code instructions, which can be executed by processor(s)  to implement scheduler platform  and described functionality thereof.","Scheduler platform  and components therein, memory , and processor(s)  can be part of or embodied in a base station.
