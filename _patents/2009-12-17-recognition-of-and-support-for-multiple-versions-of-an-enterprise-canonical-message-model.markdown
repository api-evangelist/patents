{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to meta models, and more specifically to recognition of and support for multiple versions of an enterprise conical message model at design and runtime.","Support of a conical message model within an enterprise is an important part of software architecture design pattern of service oriented architecture. By standardizing a common message model across the messaging infrastructure and using this message model to define the service definition, the level of complexity inherent in integration as an enterprise transforms to be more service oriented is greatly reduced. Thus, an enterprise can transform from complex and unwieldy point to point integrations across different service definition and message models to a much more scalable hub and spoke architecture where the conical enterprise message model is standardized.","Often times there is need for support of different versions of the canonical message model. Typically for an enterprise message mode, an enterprise will standardize on some industry vertical message model. Typically this is a \u201cpoint in time\u201d decision and the enterprise will standardize on a particular version of the message model. However, over time the message model will change as new features are added. The enterprise cannot compensate for the different versions of the message models.","According to one embodiment of the present invention a method of recognizing and supporting multiple versions of a canonical message model in a service oriented architecture industry model repository is provided comprising determining differences between at least one first version of a canonical message model and at least one other version of the canonical message model; mapping the differences between the at least one first version of a canonical message model and the at least one other version of the canonical message model to the SOA IMR; and providing the mapping of the differences between the at least one first version of a canonical message model and the at least one other canonical message model to a message access service, mapping of differences between the at least one first version of a canonical message model and the at least one other version canonical message model is applied and updated to the later of the at least one first version of a canonical message model and the at least one other version of the canonical message model to support the versions of the canonical message models seamlessly.","With reference now to the figures, and in particular, with reference to , exemplary diagrams of data processing environments are provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. It should be appreciated that  are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented.

In the depicted example, server  provides information, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients , , and . Clients , , and  are clients to server  in this example. Network data processing system  may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown.","Program code located in network data processing system  may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium and downloaded to a data processing system or other device for use. For example, program code may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium on server  and downloaded to client  over network  for use on client .","In the depicted example, network data processing system  is the Internet with network  representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system  also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as, for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN).  is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation, for the different illustrative embodiments.","With reference now to , a block diagram of a data processing system is shown in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented.

Processor unit  may be a set of one or more processors, or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit  may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit  may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Memory  and persistent storage  are examples of storage devices . A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information, such as, for example, without limitation, data, program code in functional form, and\/or other suitable information either on a temporary basis and\/or a permanent basis. Memory , in these examples, may be, for example, a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage  may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage  may contain one or more components or devices. For example, persistent storage  may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage  also may be removable.

Program code  and computer readable media  form computer program product  in these examples. In one example, computer readable media  may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage  for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage . In a tangible form, computer readable media  also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system . The tangible form of computer readable media  is also referred to as computer recordable storage media. In some instances, computer readable media  may not be removable.","Alternatively, program code  may be transferred to data processing system  from computer readable media  through a communications link to communications unit  and\/or through a connection to input\/output unit . The communications link and\/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The computer readable media also may take the form of non-tangible media, such as communication links or wireless transmissions containing the program code.","In some illustrative embodiments, program code  may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage  from another device or data processing system for use within data processing system . For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage medium in a server data processing system may be downloaded over a network from the server to data processing system . The data processing system providing program code  may be a server computer, a client computer, or some other device capable of storing and transmitting program code .","The different components illustrated for data processing system  are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented.

As one example, the data processing system may include organic components integrated with inorganic components and\/or may be comprised entirely of organic components excluding a human being. For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.","As another example, a storage device in data processing system  is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory , persistent storage  and computer readable media  are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.","In another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric  and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input\/output bus. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter.
