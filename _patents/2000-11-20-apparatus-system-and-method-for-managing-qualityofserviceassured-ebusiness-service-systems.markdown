title: Apparatus, system, and method for managing quality-of-service-assured e-business service systems
abstract: One or more SLA-specified service-level monitors and/or one or more provider-owned service-level management monitors are used by the invention to monitor one or more quality measures of one or more QoS-assured service systems and to generate one or more service-level monitoring events when the monitored system does not conform to the respective quality measures. The invention includes a cross-SLA event manager that receives the monitoring events and determines which one or more SLA contracts are affected by the events. Then one or more SLA management objects (SMOs) track the SLA-specific events generated by the event manager according to each of the respective SLA contracts. The SMOs also determine how to allocate/deallocate/configure SLA management resources and/or to determine the effect of these changes on the service system operation to assure the contracted quality of service. A cross-SLA resource manager handles the SMOs' resource allocation requests and optimizes the allocation of available resources per the service provider's SLA management objectives. Finally, a SMO manager manages the execution of SMOs and facilitates the integration and management of service system testing-time and production-time activities.

More specifically, the invention relates to managing quality-of-service-assured e-business service systems.","Many companies in the world have started participating in the Internet-based global e-business economy to ensure a prosperous future. Rapid innovations in Web computing technologies and applications coupled with a serious worldwide shortage of information technology skills have made it increasingly desirable for the companies to outsource their network-based e-business service systems and to manage those systems via service level agreements (SLAs). In general, a SLA is a monetary, legal contract that specifies the minimum expectations and obligations that exist between a service provider and a service recipient. The SLA for a quality of service (QoS) assured e-business service system would include, among others, the components listed below (see Best Practices Committee of Application Service Provider Industry Consortium, A Guide to Service Level Agreements, 2000; Hiles, A., \u201cAn Overview of Service Level Agreements: What They Can and Cannot Do,\u201d The Complete Guide to IT Service Level Agreements: Matching Service Quality to Business Needs, 1999\/2000 Edition, pp. 1\u201423, 1999; Verma, D., \u201cService Level Agreements Overview\u201d, Supporting Service Level Agreements on IP Networks,\u201d MacMillan Technology Series, pp. 5\u201413, 1999):\n\n","Compared with best-effort based e-business service contracts, QoS-assured e-business SLAs feature the inclusion of production-time QoS assurances with refund policies for service level violations (i.e., penalties for non-performing). The refund policies can be stated relative to the service cost (e.g., credit the customer one day of the service cost if the service is unavailable more than 10 minutes a day) or in absolute terms (e.g., cut a check of one thousand dollars to the customer if the service is unavailable more than 10 minutes a day).","In order to objectively determine service-level violations, each service-level specification in an e-business SLA would include the components listed below:\n\n","Before adding a measurable QoS assurance to a specific e-business SLA, the service provider must ensure adequate service-level-management technologies and processes can be deployed to manage the financial risk of service-level violations (which can be automatically detected via SLA-specified service-level monitors). It may turn out that the assurance cannot be made because, for example, (1) the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) used for creating and integrating the service software components provide insufficient service-level management support, (2) the cost of deploying the needed service-level management software and changing existing service management process for the new QoS assurance cannot be justified, or (3) the new QoS assurance would introduce nontrivial impact to the other terms and conditions in the SLA such that the possibility of service-level violations and\/or the cost of justifying the resulting SLAs would be significantly increased. The decision making process depends heavily on the design and implementation of the provider-owned e-business SLA manager.","All of the prior art e-business SLA managers are developed with the goal of preventing service-level violations (see Best Practices Committee of Application Service Provider Industry Consortium, A Guide to the ASP Delivery Model, 2000; Hiles, A., \u201cKeys to Measuring and Monitoring Service: Designing and Implementing a SLA,\u201d The Complete Guide to IT Service Level Agreements: Matching Service Quality to Business Needs, 1999\/2000 Edition, pp. 67\u2014122, 1999; Verma, D., \u201cA General SLA Architecture\u201d, Supporting Service Level Agreements on IP Networks,\u201d MacMillan Technology Series, pp. 137\u2014160, 1999). Besides SLA-specified service-level monitors, provider-owned service-level management monitors are usually used by the prior art e-business SLA managers to proactively manage QoS-assured e-business service systems, especially when SLA-specified service-level monitors cannot feed the provider's e-business SLA manager the-service quality measurement data in a timely fashion. Implementation and deployment details of these provider-owned service-level management monitors are not documented in the SLA and are not exposed to the customer. Moreover, the provider usually do not negotiate with the customer on the mechanisms and policies it uses for meeting its own technical requirements on service-level management objectives (e.g., minimum service availability, maximum transaction response time, minimum service system throughput, minimum and maximum network bandwidth, etc.). The provider ensures SLA conformance by integrating its e-business SLA manager with SLA-specified service-level monitors; provider-determined service-level management monitors; service system management agents (e.g., router\/middleware configuration change agents, server allocation\/deallocation agents, application software installation agents, problem determination agents, third-party service management agents, sub-SLA management agents, etc.); and operations management staff Operations management staff are notified whenever the SLA manager does not know how to deal with an abnormal condition detected via the monitors.","Prior art e-business SLA managers are developed mainly to determine service-level violations and\/or to determine trends of service-level violations per provider-determined technical requirements on service-level management objectives (e.g., minimum service availability, maximum transaction response time, minimum service system throughput, minimum and maximum network bandwidth, etc.). They do not know the business impact (e.g., revenue loss) a specific service-level violation would create, though they could detect and\/or predict the violation. They cannot optimize the usage of the provider's e-business SLA management resources (e.g., network connection bandwidth, servers, disk storage, software, customer support personnel, operations management staff, service management agents, etc.) to help the provider maximize its profits or its customer satisfaction because they are ignorant of service quality related non-technical SLA components (e.g., pricing terms, refund policy for service-level violations, problem escalation procedures, customer support procedures and response time, etc.).","Prior art SLA managers cannot determine and execute, in a timely manner, adequate service management actions and related business processes for the provider because they do not have sufficient access to service-level management data. They do not know what service management actions should be taken when abnormal conditions are detected via the monitors. Skillful operations management staff are usually notified to handle those abnormal conditions and are responsible for executing the needed service management actions, though some ad hoc approaches may be used to link specific monitoring events (e.g., machine failure) to system management agents or mechanism (e.g., failover management middleware). Such best-effort based people intensive approach to managing the operations of e-business SLAs will soon lead the provider to face cost-efficiency and shortage of skills issues soon in light of the demand for (and the increasing complexity of) QoS-assured e-business service systems.","An object of this invention is an improved apparatus, system, and method for managing quality of service (QoS) assured e-business service systems.","An object of this invention is an improved apparatus, system, and method for managing the execution of QoS-assured e-business applications running atop one or more e-business hosting platforms.","An object of this invention is an improved apparatus, system, and method for determining and executing service management actions in support of the operations management of e-business SLAs.","An object of this invention is an improved e-business SLA management apparatus, system, and method that optimize the usage of e-business SLA management resources.","An object of this invention is an improved e-business SLA management apparatus, system, and method that support planned and\/or on-demand change of QoS-assurances and service-level management tasks.","An object of this invention is an improved e-business SLA management apparatus, system, and method that support planned and\/or on-demand change of QoS-assurances and service-level management tasks with service-level assurances on the change latency.","An object of this invention is an improved e-business SLA management apparatus, system and method that facilitate the integration and management of service system testing-time and production-time activities.","The present invention is an e-business service level agreement (SLA) management apparatus, system, and method for managing quality of service (QoS) assured e-business service systems. One or more SLA-specified service-level monitors and\/or one or more provider-owned service-level management monitors are used by the invention to monitor one or more quality measures of one or more QoS-assured service systems and to generate one or more service-level monitoring events when the monitored system does not conform or might soon not conform to the respective quality measure. The invention includes a cross-SLA event manager (CSEM) that receives the monitoring events, determines which one or more SLA contracts are affected by the events, and generates one or more SLA-specific service-level management events to one or more SLA-specific SLA management objects (SMOs). The SMOs track the events according to each of the respective SLA contracts, determine how to allocate\/deallocate\/configure SLA management resources and\/or determine the effect of those resource management actions on the service system operation to assure the contracted quality of service. When more than one SMO requests a resource, such as to prevent or alleviate a QoS violation, resources are allocated based at least in part on a financial impact assessment.","In a preferred embodiment, the actions can be performed by SMOs themselves, operations management staff, and\/or service management agents. The SMOs submit one or more resource allocation requests to cross-SLA resource manager (CSRM) when they need one or more additional SLA management resources so that the resource manager can optimize the allocation of available resources per the service provider's overall SLA management objectives. The SMOs are managed by a SMO manager which facilitates the integration and management of service system testing-time and production-time activities.","The present invention is an improved apparatus, system, and method for managing quality of service (QoS) assured e-business service systems. It discloses an e-business SLA manager that could (1) manage the execution of QoS-assured e-business applications running atop one of more e-business hosting platforms; (2) determine and execute service management actions in support of the operations management of e-business SLAs; (3) optimize the usage of e-business SLA management resources per the service provider's overall SLA management objectives; (4) support planned and\/or on-demand change of QoS-assurances and service-level management tasks with service-level assurances on the change latency; and (5) facilitate the integration and management of service system testing-time and production-time activities.","The disclosed SLA manager comprises one Cross-SLA Event Manager (CSEM), one SLA Management Object (SMO) for each established SLA contract, one Cross-SLA Resource Manager (CSRM) and one SMO Manager. The Cross-SLA Event Manager processes service-level monitoring events generated by one or more SLA-specified service-level monitors and\/or one or more provider-determined service-level management monitors, and use SMO-registered event handlers to generate SMO-specific service-level management events.","The monitors monitor one or more quality measures of one or more monitored service systems and generate one or more service-level monitoring events when the monitored system does not conform or might soon not conform to the respective quality measures. The quality measures include any one or more of the following: monitored service system availability\/reliability, monitored transaction service time, monitored end-to-end transaction response time, monitored network connection bandwidth, monitored change latency of on-demand capacity allocation, and monitored problem resolution response time.","Every SMO supports the operations management of the associated SLA contract per its SLA management data. It determines and executes service management actions (with support for planned and\/or on-demand change of QoS assurances and service-level management tasks) for each of the service-level management events (or SMO events) it receives from CSEM. It also acquires and\/or releases SLA management resources per provider-determined SLA management objectives for the associated SLA contract. The actions can be performed by itself, one or more operations management staff, and\/or one or more service management agents. The service management agents include any one or more of the following: router\/middleware configuration change agents, server allocation\/deallocation agents, application software installation agents, problem determination agents, third-party service management agents, and sub-SLA management agents.","Compared with prior art data models for capturing SLA management data, the SMO data model features the inclusion of Service Packages, Service Package Transition Triggers, and terms and conditions for handling those triggers. Every Service Package captures not only terms and conditions for the associated SLA under some specific conditions (e.g. time of the day, day of the week, and workload conditions, etc.), but also provider-determined service-level management data like mappings of SMO events to service management action plans. There is only one active Service Package at any time for each SLA contract. The SMO data model enables SMOs to support planned and\/or on-demand change of QoS assurances and service-level management tasks with service-level assurances on the change latency.","The Cross-SLA Resource Manager handles resource allocation requests submitted by SMOs and optimizes the allocation of available computing and people resources based upon the provider's SLA management objectives for all of the established SLA contacts. In the preferred embodiment, quantitative business impact assessment for each resource allocation request is performed by the submitting SMO, and is sent to CSRM as a numeric attribute of the request. The attribute is a function of estimated amount of profit\/revenue decrease if the request cannot be honored in a specific period of time. In alternative embodiments, the assessment can be made by CSRM (with or without input from the submitting SMO). The assessment function could also include non-monetary parameters such as customer satisfaction related measurements (e.g., number of trouble tickets that have been issued for the SLA), membership class of the SLA customer (e.g., gold customer vs. regular customer), etc.","The SMO Manager as well as the SMOs makes it easier for the service provider to integrate and manage service system testing-time and production-time activities. The SMO Manager manages the execution of SMOs by controlling the transitions of their states, which structure both testing-time and production-time SMO management activities. If a SMO terminates its execution unexpectedly (e.g. due to unexpected machine crashes), the SMO Manager would attempt to restore the SMO's execution from an appropriate SMO state.","For example, a Web hosting SLA may require the service provider to guarantee, among others, the minimum availability of a Web server system which comprises one or more Web servers and presents to the Web client applications (e.g., Web browsers) on the Internet as a single Web site. The SLA may also specify a trusted third party to monitor the availability measure of the Web server system by fetching a specific URL from the Web site via the HTTP protocol every 10 minutes. In order to proactively assure the availability of the contracted Web server systems, the provider may use one or more service-level management monitors that use the Internet \u201cping\u201d protocol to check if the server machines allocated to all of the SLA contracts are up every 3 minutes. When a server machine fails, one of the service-level management monitors would send the CSEM a machine failure event. The CSEM then figures out the SLA to which the server machine is currently assigned to, and sends a machine-failure service-level management event to the associated SMO. The SMO then composes a Web server allocation request for the affected SLA with a business impact assessment value calculated based upon the SLA's refund policies for service-level violations on Web site availability and the number of server machines that are still up and running for the SLA. If the request is honored by the CSRM, the SMO executes a server allocation action via a Web server installation agent and ensures successful completion of the action.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00051","num":"00051"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The e-business SLA management framework  comprises an established e-business SLA contract (), users and applications supported by SLA customer (); an e-business service access system managed by SLA customer (); SLA-specified service access controllers () and service-level monitors (); and computing and people resources managed by SLA provider (, , , , , ). The bi-directional arrows (, , ) show the service access flow. The directional ones with solid lines (, , , , ) illustrate service management flow. The directional arrow with dotted line () is a data access flow.","SLA users and applications () access the QoS-assured e-business service system () through the service access system managed by SLA customer () when the customer wants to control access to the contracted service (e.g., via user registration and sign-on processes) or to facilitate such access (e.g., via service access gateways). The SLA customer could let SLA users and applications () directly access the provider-managed e-business service system () when appropriate. For example, most Web hosting customers let Internet users access their outsourced Web sites directly for unprotected Web pages. If the users want to gain access to protected Web objects, they would normally need to go through a security\/entitlement management system managed by the SLA customer. The SLA customer itself can also be a user of the contracted service.","The service access controllers () are specified in SLA when workload control is necessary for the provider to guarantee performance related service-level management objectives like transaction service time.

In step , the SMO chooses a most urgent event from the SMO event management queues, and removes it from the queue it is in. In step , a SMO event handler is invoked (in accordance with the type of the chosen SMO event) to generate a prioritized list of SMO action plans.

In the preferred embodiment, each resource allocation request is sent to CSRM with a numeric attribute whose value is a function of estimated amount of profit decrease if the request cannot be honored in a specific period of time. CSRM uses that as a quantitative assessment of the impact on provider's business if the request is rejected, and takes that into account when making resource allocation decisions.

The Service Package transition Triggers enable a SMO to support planned or on-demand change of QoS assurances and service-level management tasks with service-level assurances on the change latency. Each Service Package Transition Trigger is associated with a preference list () of Service Package transitions (). For SLA-specified Service Package Transition Triggers, terms and conditions for handling each of the transitions on the preference list is documented in the SLA (e.g., pricing, QoS assurances, refund policy for non-performing for each of the transitions).","Depending upon terms and conditions in the SLA contact, the provider can also add extra Service Packages and related Triggers to facilitate its management of the QoS-assured service without the customer's awareness. For example, the provider could create Service Packages for planned service maintenance windows to cost-efficiently manage the transitions between normal service offering mode(s) and planned service maintenance mode(s). When the provider is able to support a SLA via more than one sub-SLA (i.e., via integrating third-party services), it can also create a Service Package for each of the sub-SLAs to facilitate its use and management of the QoS-assured services provided by other service providers.","We note that SMO events are either Service-Package-specific service-level management events or Service Package Transition Trigger events. The former are generated mainly to help the provider manage the financial risk of service-level violations, while the latter are created mainly to help the provider to capture profit generation opportunities per customer's need under various conditions. For example, a Web hosting service provider capable of offering a capacity-on-demand service could use the Triggers to support on-demand upgrade and\/or degrade of performance related QoS assurances based upon URL access request statistics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00073","num":"00073"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"By executing process , CSRM prioritizes the processing of resource allocation requests a submitted by SMOs and manages the allocation of computing and people resources based upon provider-determined business impact assessment metrics.

They enable CSRM to optimize the usage of e-business SLA management resources per the provider's overall SLA management objectives. Each request honor queue holds a specific class of requests that CSRM has tentatively decided to honor. The decisions are tentative because the requested resources have only been reserved and will not be allocated or released until the submitters are notified. When CSRM must reclaim some of the reserved resources to satisfy the need of a new preferred request, it reclaims all of the resources reserved for the affected requests. After the resource reclamation process is over, CSRM adds the affected requests to its resource request management queues so that they can be handled as new requests in the current request processing cycle.","CSRM rejects or honors a new resource allocation request in each iteration of the loop .
