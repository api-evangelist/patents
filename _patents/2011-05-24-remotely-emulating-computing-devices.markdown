No. 61\/454,986, filed on Mar. 21, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","There are many specialized forms of computing devices such as, for example, smartphones, electronic book readers, tablet computers, video game consoles, and so on. Because of the physical differences among such devices, applications may differ from device to device. Even within a device category such as smartphones, different models of smartphones may have different display and input features.","The present disclosure relates to emulating computing devices over a network. Customers may wish to purchase applications for various computing devices over a network. In order to make an informed purchasing decision, a customer may wish to try the application before buying it. However, the customer may be using a different client device from the computing device that is intended to run the application. For example, the customer may be using a desktop computer and searching for applications for a mobile device such as a smartphone. Various embodiments of the present disclosure enable customers to use applications running remotely on emulated computing devices. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the customers may be able to buy the applications through an associated user interface. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","Various techniques related to executing applications remotely are described in U.S. Patent Application entitled \u201cProviding Remote Access to Games Designed for a Single-Machine Experience\u201d filed on Nov. 5, 2010 and assigned application Ser.

No. 12\/956,693, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more computing devices  in data communication with one or more clients  by way of a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores  as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a emulation server application , an electronic commerce application , a plurality of wrappers . . . N, a plurality of applications . . . N, a plurality of media encoders . . . N, and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The emulation server application  may correspond to a type of application session server. The emulation server application  is executed to launch applications , which are executed within the wrappers . The emulation server application  is also executed to obtain application input data  from the clients  and provide the application input data  to the respective wrapper .","The emulation server application  is also executed to send application output data  that is captured from the application  to the clients . The emulation server application  may communicate with the client  over various protocols such as, for example, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), simple object access protocol (SOAP), representational state transfer (REST), real-time transport protocol (RTP), real time streaming protocol (RTSP), real time messaging protocol (RTMP), user datagram protocol (UDP), transmission control protocol (TCP), and\/or other protocols for communicating data over the network . The emulation server application  is configured to maintain state information  and input queues  associated with the executing applications .","In various embodiments, the emulation server application  may be configured to generate a user interface using one or more network pages. The network pages may include the streaming video and\/or audio generated by the emulated application . In various embodiments, images of virtual input devices may be rendered in conjunction with the streaming video and\/or audio. For example, a virtual keyboard for the emulated computing device may be included in the network page. Where the emulated computing device is a mobile computing device, an image of the mobile computing device may be included in the network page. The emulation server application  may facilitate interaction with the image of the mobile computing device in conjunction with the application . Where the emulated computing device corresponds to a mobile computing device with a screen, the video captured from the application  may be surrounded by the image of the mobile computing device, as if the video were shown on the screen of the mobile computing device.","The electronic commerce application  is executed in order to facilitate the online purchase of items, such as downloaded applications, from a merchant over the network . The electronic commerce application  also performs various backend functions associated with the online presence of a merchant in order to facilitate the online purchase of items. For example, the electronic commerce application  may generate network pages or portions thereof that are provided to clients  for the purposes of selecting items for purchase, rental, download, lease, or other forms of consumption. In some embodiments, the electronic commerce application  is associated with a network site that includes an electronic marketplace in which multiple merchants participate.","The application  may correspond, for example, to a game or other types of applications. As non-limiting examples, the application  may correspond to a first-person shooter game, an action game, an adventure game, a party game, a role-playing game, a simulation game, a strategy game, a vehicle simulation game, and\/or other types of games. The application  may be originally designed for execution in a general-purpose computing device or in a specialized device such as, for example, a smartphone, a video game console, a handheld game device, an arcade game device, etc. The applications  may also correspond to mobile phone applications, computer-aided design (CAD) applications, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) applications, photo manipulation applications, video editing applications, office productivity applications, operating systems and associated applications, emulators for operating systems, architectures, and capabilities not present on a consumer device, and other applications and combinations of applications.","The application  may expect to access one or more resources of the device on which it is executed. Such resources may correspond to display devices, input devices, or other devices. In some cases, the application  may request exclusive access to one or more of the resources, whereby no other applications may have access to the particular resources.","The wrapper  corresponds to an application that provides a hosted environment for execution of the application . In various embodiments, the wrapper  may be configured to provide a virtualized environment for the application  by virtualizing one or more of the resources that the application  expects to access. Such resources may include a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, a video device, a sound device, a global positioning system (GPS) device, an accelerometer, a touchscreen, built-in buttons, a file system, a built-in battery, etc. In this way, the wrapper  is able to provide input commands and other data to the application  as if the wrapper  emulates a keyboard, a mouse, or another type of hardware device.","Further, the wrapper  is able to obtain a video signal and\/or audio signal generated by the application  as if the wrapper  emulates a display device, an audio device, or another type of output device. Although many of the examples discussed herein relate to emulated computing devices with a display, emulated computing devices may also include, for example, set-top boxes, audio players, and\/or other devices without an integrated display screen. The wrapper  is able to encode the video signal and\/or audio signal by way of one or more media encoders  into a media stream. To this end, the wrapper  may include various types of media encoders , such as, for example, Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) encoders, H.264 encoders, Flash\u00ae video encoders, etc. Such media encoders  may be selected according to factors such as, for example, data reduction, encoding quality, latency, etc. In some embodiments, the wrappers  may communicate directly with the clients  to obtain the application input data  and to serve up the application output data .","Different types of wrappers  may be provided for different applications  or classes of applications . As non-limiting examples, different wrappers  may be provided for applications  using different application programming interfaces (APIs) such as OpenGL\u00ae, DirectX\u00ae, the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), and so on. Where the application  is configured for execution in a specialized device or another type of computing device, the wrapper  may include an emulation application that emulates the device. In some embodiments, the output of the application  may be captured by the wrapper  at a device level. For example, the application  may be executed in a physical game console, and the video output may be captured by way of a video graphics array (VGA) connection, a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) connection, a component video connection, a national television system committee (NTSC) television connection, and\/or other connections. In other embodiments, the output of the application  may be captured by the wrapper  by intercepting system calls, such as drawing calls under a graphics API or other system calls.","The state information  that is maintained by the emulation server application  includes various data relating to application sessions that are currently active. For example, the state information  may track the users that are currently participating in the application session, status information associated with the users, security permissions associated with the application session (e.g., who can or cannot join), and so on. In some embodiments, some or all of the state information  may be discarded when an application session ends. The input queues  collect input commands from the application input data  for a given application . The input commands may be reordered to a correct sequence and delays may be inserted between commands to ensure that they are interpreted correctly when presented to the corresponding application .","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, applications , media encoders , wrappers , saved state data , user data , device interfaces , and potentially other data. The applications  correspond to a library of different applications that are available to be launched as applications . The applications  may correspond to executable code within the computing device . Alternatively, the applications  may correspond to code that is executable within another type of device but is not executable within the computing device . Such applications  may be referred to as \u201cbinaries,\u201d read-only memory images (ROMs), and other terms. A particular application  may be executed as multiple instances of the applications  for multiple application sessions.","The media encoders  correspond to the various types of media encoders  that may be employed in the computing device . Some media encoders  may correspond to specific formats, such as, for example, H.264, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, and\/or other formats. The wrappers  correspond to the executable code that implements the various types of wrappers . The wrappers  are executable in the computing device  and may be executed as multiple instances of the wrappers  for multiple application sessions.","The saved state data  corresponds to game states that have been saved by the applications . Because the applications  may be executed in a virtualized environment, the applications  may write state information to a virtual location, which is then mapped for storage in the data store  as the saved state data . The saved state data  may correspond to data saved normally by the application  or may correspond to a memory image of the application  that may be resumed at any time. The user data  includes various data related to the users of the applications , such as, for example, types of computing devices associated with a user, security credentials, application preferences, billing information, a listing of other users that are permitted to join application sessions started by the user, and so on.","The device interfaces  correspond to images, animations, code, hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), cascading style sheets (CSS), and\/or other data that may be used to generate a graphical representation of a virtualized computing device. It is noted that an application  that is executable on a particular computing device platform may be associated with a multitude of device interfaces . As a non-limiting example, the Android\u00ae platform for smartphones may be supported by a multitude of different models of smartphones. Some of the models may have mini-keyboards with a touchscreen, while others may have merely a touchscreen with no physical mini-keyboard. The models may have different controls and casings. Therefore, different device interfaces  may be provided for different models of Android\u00ae smartphones.","In some embodiments, multiple different device interfaces  may be used in conjunction with one wrapper . Where the emulated computing device does not include an integrated display, the device interface  may include a representation of an external display device showing video generated by the emulated computing device. Similarly, other non-integrated external devices that may connect to the emulated computing device (e.g., keyboards, mice, etc.) may be represented by the device interface .","The client  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The clients  may be geographically diverse. The client  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, set-top boxes, televisions that execute applications and can access the network , music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, electronic book readers, or other devices with like capability.","The client  may include a display . The display  may comprise, for example, one or more devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRTs), liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, gas plasma-based flat panel displays, LCD projectors, or other types of display devices, etc. The client  may include one or more input devices . The input devices  may comprise, for example, devices such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, accelerometers, light guns, game controllers, touch pads, touch sticks, push buttons, optical sensors, microphones, webcams, and\/or any other devices that can provide user input. Additionally, various input devices  may incorporate haptic technologies in order to provide feedback to the user.","The client  may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application  and\/or other applications. The client application  is executed to allow a user to launch, join, play, or otherwise interact with an application  executed in the computing device . To this end, the client application  is configured to capture input commands provided by the user through one or more of the input devices  and send this input over the network  to the computing device  as application input data . The application input data  may also incorporate other data (e.g., GPS data, audio data, etc.) generated by the client  for use by the application . In various embodiments, the client application  corresponds to a browser application.","The client application  is also configured to obtain application output data  over the network  from the computing device  and render a screen  on the display . To this end, the client application  may include one or more video and audio players to play out a media stream generated by an application . In one embodiment, the client application  comprises a plug-in or other client-side code executed within a browser application. The client  may be configured to execute applications beyond the client application  such as, for example, browser applications, email applications, instant message applications, and\/or other applications. In some embodiments, multiple clients  may be employed for one or more users to interact with the application . As non-limiting examples, some clients  may be specialized in display output, while other clients  may be specialized in obtaining user input. It is noted that different clients  may be associated with different latency requirements which may affect a delay employed before providing input commands to the application .","Turning now to , shown is one example of a user interface  rendered in a client application  () executed in a client  () in the networked environment  (). The user interface  shown in  corresponds to a network page generated by the electronic commerce application  (). The network page corresponds to a detail network page for an application  () that is available for download through the electronic commerce application . The user interface  includes a description  of the application , which, in this example, is titled \u201cThe Stupid Quiz\u201d and is priced at $0.99. The application  is available for download for Android\u00ae devices. Various screenshots and other descriptive information may be provided in the user interface . The user interface  may also include links to similar items.","An emulation request tool  is provided for a customer to launch a session of the application  through the emulation server application  (). In this case, when a customer activates the emulation request tool , the customer is able to use the application  in a virtualized environment that resembles the computing device on which it is intended to execute. Activating the emulation request tool  may cause a new network page to be loaded and\/or a frame, lightbox, or other component within the user interface . A purchase component  may be provided for purchasing the application  for use on a particular computing device. In this non-limiting example, the customer is associated with two computing devices that are compatible with the application : \u201cDevice \u201d and \u201cDevice .\u201d In other examples, incompatible devices associated with the customer may be listed as incompatible. The application  may also be added to a shopping cart, wish list, gift registry, or any other type of list of items.","Continuing on to , shown is another example of a user interface  rendered in a client application  () executed in a client  () in the networked environment  (). The user interface  shown in  corresponds to a network page generated by the electronic commerce application  () as in  but overlaid with a user interface  that is a lightbox. In other examples, the user interface  may be presented in a full-screen format or another format. Portions of the user interface  may be generated by the electronic commerce application , while other portions of the user interface  may be generated by the emulation server application  ().","The user interface  includes a device interface  that is a graphical representation of an emulated computing device, which is in this case a particular model of an Android\u00ae smartphone. In some examples, the device interface  may correspond to a generic version of the emulated computing device, e.g., a generic version of an Android\u00ae smartphone. Which model is used may be specified by the customer in the user interface  or the user interface . In addition, a preference for a model of the emulated computing device may be stored in the user data .","The device interface  is generated by the emulation server application  from the applicable device interface  (). The device interface  includes virtual versions of input buttons  and\/or other controls that are present in the actual device. Animations and\/or images may be used to translate the physical experience into a virtual experience. Within the device interface  is a screen  () that corresponds to the video portion of a media stream captured by the wrapper  () from an application  () that corresponds to the selected application  (). An audio portion of the media stream may be played out by the client application  in conjunction with the video portion of the media stream. Audio hardware controls  may be provided to control the audio playback from the emulated computing device, e.g., increasing or decreasing the volume of the audio. In other examples, other hardware controls may be provided, e.g., record, fast forward, rewind, stop, previous track, next track, screen brightness, selected display device, etc.","The user interface  may also include descriptive information  that may be an abbreviated version of the description  () in the user interface . The descriptive information  may include title, publisher, price, narrative description, and\/or other information about the application . In this non-limiting example, the user interface  includes a timer  because the time spent testing the application  for possible purchase is limited. In other examples, the time for use of the application  by the customer may be unlimited.","The user interface  may include an orientation control  to rotate the orientation of the screen . Activating such an orientation control  may cause a virtualized version of an accelerometer or other device to inform the application  that the orientation of the emulated computing device has been changed, e.g., from portrait to landscape and vice versa. The user interface  may also include one or more purchase components  for initiating a purchase of the application  or adding the application  to a shopping cart, wish list, gift registry, or other list of items as can be appreciated.","Next, with reference to , a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, a customer at a client  browses a network site served up by the electronic commerce application . The customer may, for example, navigate a catalog taxonomy, execute a search query, select links, and\/or perform other navigational functions. The customer may arrive at a detail network page such as that shown in the user interface  of  or another similar network page that features an application  for download. The customer may specify one or more preferred models of an emulated computing device for which the customer is seeking applications .","In addition to purchasing and\/or downloading the application , the customer may be given an opportunity to use the application  through a simulated interface. To this end, the customer at the client  sends a request to launch an application  to the emulation server application , for example, by activating the emulation request tool . The emulation server application  obtains the corresponding application , media encoder , wrapper , and device interface  from the data store . The emulation server application  then launches the application  in the corresponding wrapper . The emulation server application  tracks the status of the application  within the state information .","The wrapper  provides a hosted environment for execution of the application . In some embodiments, the hosted environment may include a virtualized environment for the application  that virtualizes one or more resources of the computing device . Such resources may include exclusive resources, i.e., resources for which the application  requests exclusive access. For example, the application  may request full screen access from a video device, which is an exclusive resource because normally only one application can have full screen access. Furthermore, the wrapper  may virtualize input devices such as, for example, keyboards, mice, GPS devices, accelerometers, etc. which may not actually be present in the computing device . The wrapper  may also provide access to a virtual file system to the application . In various embodiments, the wrapper  may correspond to a virtual machine and\/or the wrapper  may be executed within a virtual machine.","The user at the client  enters input commands for the application  by use of the input devices  of the client . As a non-limiting example, the user may depress a left mouse button. Accordingly, the client application  functions to encode the input command into a format that may be transmitted over the network  within the application input data . The emulation server application  receives the input command, adds it to the input queue  for the application , and ultimately passes it to the wrapper . The wrapper  then provides a left mouse button depression to the application  by way of a virtualized mouse.","It is noted that variable latency characteristics of the network  may cause some input commands to be misinterpreted by the application  if the input commands are provided to the application  as soon as they are received. As a non-limiting example, two single clicks of a mouse button may be misinterpreted as a double click if the first single click is delayed by the network  by a greater amount than the second single click. Similarly, mouse clicks and mouse drags may be misinterpreted if the relative temporal relationship between certain input commands is not preserved.","As another non-limiting example, suppose that the application  corresponds to a game application within the fighting game genre, e.g., Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, etc. The user at the client  may perform a series of complicated moves through a rapid sequence of input commands. If the input commands are subject to variable latency over the network , the series of moves may be misinterpreted by the application , thereby resulting in the character controlled by the user not performing the intended moves. For instance, two buttons may need to be pressed within a certain period of time to perform a punch move successfully. If the second input command is delayed by the network , but the first input command is not, the move may be unsuccessful without any fault of the user. To remedy this, the emulation server application  may delay the first input command to preserve the relative temporal relationship between the first and second input commands. In so doing, the gesture, or command sequence, performed by the user is preserved for the application .","Although the additional delay used may be predetermined, it may also be calculated based on the difference between the time period between the commands when generated in the client  and the time period between when the commands are received by the emulation server application . The time period between the commands when generated in the client  may be determined by referring to timestamps in metadata associated with the commands. It is noted that the various fixed latencies in the system (e.g., video encoding delay, minimum network latency) might not adversely impact the functionality of the application .","Various techniques related to adding latency and accommodating latency are described in U.S. Patent Application entitled \u201cAdding Latency to Improve Perceived Performance\u201d filed on Oct. 29, 2010 and assigned application Ser. No. 12\/916,111, and in U.S. Patent Application entitled \u201cAccommodating Latency in a Service-Based Application\u201d filed on Sep. 17, 2010 and assigned application Ser. No. 12\/885,296, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","In some cases, the delay in providing the input command to the application  may depend at least in part on a video frame region that is associated with the input command. As a non-limiting example, with an application  that is a game, it may be important to delay an input command relating to game play to preserve the meaning of the input command. However, the game screen  may also include a chat window, and the input command may be text to be sent to another player in the game by way of the chat window. If the input command relates to the chat window, the wrapper  may be configured to provide the input command to the application  without additional delay. That is, it may be preferable to send the text to the other user as soon as possible. Accordingly, the delay may depend on whether the input command is related to the region of the screen  that is the chat window. Also, it is understood that an application  may have multiple modes, where one mode is associated with a delay in providing input commands while another is not.","It may also be important to ensure that the input command is synchronized with the video frame presented to the user on the screen  when the user generated the input command in the client . As a non-limiting example, because of the various latencies of the system, a fireball intended to be thrown by the character controlled by the user in a fighting game may be thrown later than intended. In some cases, this may not matter. For example, the user may merely want to throw the fireball, and a short delay in throwing the fireball may be perfectly acceptable to the user. However, for more precision, the application  may support an API that allows the wrapper  to associate a frame number or other temporal identifier with an input command. Therefore, the application  can know precisely when the input command was performed and react accordingly. The frame number or other temporal identifier may be sent to the emulation server application  by the client application  as metadata for the input command.","In some embodiments, different input commands may be presented to the application  from those that were generated by a client . As a non-limiting example, if a user sends a mouse down command and the client application  loses focus, the wrapper  may be configured to send a mouse down command followed by a mouse up command. In various embodiments, the input commands may be relayed to the wrapper  as soon as possible, or the input commands may be queued by the wrapper  in the input queue  and relayed to the application  sequentially from the queue according to another approach.","Meanwhile, the graphical output of the application  is captured by the wrapper  and encoded into a media stream. Additionally, the audio output of the application  may be captured and multiplexed into the media stream. The graphical output and\/or audio output of the application  may be captured by hardware devices of the computing device  in some embodiments. The media stream is transmitted by the emulation server application  to the client  over the network  as the application output data . The client application  obtains the application output data  and renders a screen  on the display  in a user interface . The screen  may be surrounded by a device interface  generated from the corresponding device interface  that facilitates input and output for the emulated computing device.","In some embodiments, a customer may start an application  at one client  and continue the application  at another client . Furthermore, multiple users at diverse locations may participate in an application . As a non-limiting example, an application  may have been developed to be executed in one device with multiple controllers. Accordingly, the wrapper  may be configured to map input commands from one client  to a first virtual controller and input commands from another client  to a second virtual controller. As another non-limiting example, an application  may have been developed to be executed in one device, where one side of the keyboard controls the first player and the other side of the keyboard controls the second player. Accordingly, the wrapper  may be configured to map input commands from one client  to keys on one side of a virtual keyboard and input commands from another client  to keys on another side of the virtual keyboard.","Various embodiments enable input generated through one type of input device  in a client  to be transformed by the wrapper  into input commands provided to the application  through an entirely different type of virtual input device. As a non-limiting example, input generated by an accelerometer in the client  may be translated by the wrapper  into input provided through a virtual mouse. Thus, completely different kinds of input devices  may be used in the application  that may not have been contemplated when the application  was implemented.","Where the input devices  incorporate haptic technologies and devices, force feedback may be provided to the input devices  within the application output data . As a non-limiting example, a simulated automobile steering wheel may be programmed by force feedback to give the user a feel of the road. As a user makes a turn or accelerates, the steering wheel may resist the turn or slip out of control. As another non-limiting example, the temperature of the input device  may be configured to change according to force feedback. In one embodiment, force feedback generated from the application input data  of one client  may be included in the application output data  sent to another client .","Because the client  is decoupled from the hardware requirements of the application , the application  may be used remotely through a diverse variety of clients  that are capable of streaming video with acceptable bandwidth and latency over a network . For example, a game application  may be played on a client  that is a smartphone. Thus, the client  need not include expensive graphics hardware to perform the complex three-dimensional rendering that may be necessary to execute the application . By contrast, the hardware of the computing device  may be upgraded as needed to meet the hardware requirements of the latest and most computationally intensive applications . In various embodiments, the video signal in the media stream sent by the emulation server application  may be scaled according to the bitrate and\/or other characteristics of the connection between the computing device  and the client  over the network .","Having thoroughly tested the application  with an interface that resembles their own computing device, customers are well prepared to purchase the application . At any time, the customer may choose to purchase, lease, and\/or download the application  by selecting various purchase components , . Additionally, if a customer does not own the particular version of the emulated computing device, the customer may decide to purchase a physical version of the emulated computing device after interacting with the virtual version.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the emulation server application  according to various embodiments.
