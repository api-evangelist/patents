Further, the display apparatus is connected to the Internet and the computer with the support of wired or wireless Internet function to perform functions such as email, web browsing, banking or game and the like, too. A standardized general-purpose OS may be use for such a various function.","Accordingly, the display apparatus described in the invention may perform user-friendly functions by, for example, freely adding or deleting various applications on a general-purpose OS kernel. The display apparatus may become in more detail, for example, network TV, HBBTV, smart TV and the like and in some cases may be applied to smartphones.","Furthermore, although the embodiments of the invention are described in detail with respect to the attached drawings and the contents written in the attached drawings, and the invention is not limited to the embodiments.","The terms used in the present specification selects now widely available general terms while considering the functions at the invention, but which may be varied depending on intention of one skilled in the art, practice or the emergence of new technologies and the like. Further, terms randomly selected by the applicants may also be present in specific cases, and in this case, the meaning thereof will be written in the description of the invention. Therefore, the terms used in this specification should be interpreted based on substantive meaning of the terms and the contents of this specification than the mere designation of terms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , the broadcasting system may include a Content Provider (CP) , a Service Provider (SP) , a Network Provider (NP) , and a Home Network End Device (HNED) .","The HNED  corresponds to, for example, a client  which is a display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. As stated before, the display apparatus may be a network TV, a smart TV, an Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), etc.","The CP  creates and provides content. The CP  may be, for example, a terrestrial broadcaster, a cable System Operator (SO) or Multiple System Operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, or an Internet broadcaster, as illustrated in .","Besides broadcast content, the CP  may provide various applications, which will be described later in detail.","The SP  may provide content received from the CP  in a service package. For instance, the SP  may package first terrestrial broadcasting, second terrestrial broadcasting, cable broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, Internet broadcasting, and applications and provide the package to users.","The SP  may unicast or multicast a service to the client . Unicast is a form of transmission in which information is sent from only one transmitter to only one receiver.","In other words, the unicast transmission is point-to-point, involving two nodes only. In an example of the unicast transmission, upon receipt of a request for data from a receiver, a server transmits the data to only one receiver.","The multicast transmission is a type of transmission or communication in which a transmitter transmits data to a group of receivers. For example, a server may transmit data to a plurality of pre-registered receivers at one time. For multicast registration, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) may be used.","The NP  may provide a network over which a service is provided to the client . The client  may construct a home network and receive a service over the home network.","Content transmitted in the above-described broadcasting system may be protected through conditional access or content protection. CableCard and Downloadable Conditional Access System (DCAS) are examples of conditional access or content protection.","The client  may also transmit content over a network. In this case, the client  serves as a CP and thus the CP  may receive content from the client . Therefore, an interactive content service or data service can be provided.","Referring to , the display apparatus  that corresponds to a client of  is connected to a broadcast network and the Internet.","The display apparatus  includes, for example, a broadcast interface , a section filter , an Application Information Table (AIT) filter , an application data processor , a broadcast data processor , a media player , an IP processor , an Internet interface , and a runtime module .","The display apparatus  receives AIT data, real-time broadcast content, application data, and stream events through the broadcast interface . The real-time broadcast content may be referred to as linear Audio\/Video (A\/V) content.","The section filter  performs section filtering on the four types of data received through the broadcast interface , and outputs the AIT data to the AIT filter , the linear A\/V content to the broadcast data processor , and the stream events and application data to the application data processor .","Meanwhile, the display apparatus  receives non-linear A\/V content and application data through the Internet interface . The non-linear A\/V content may be, for example, a Content On Demand (CoD) application.","The non-linear A\/V content and the application data are transmitted to the media player  and the runtime module , respectively.","The runtime module  includes, for example, an application manager and a browser as illustrated in . The application manager controls the life cycle of an interactive application using the AIT data, for example. The browser displays and processes the interactive application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Referring to , an SP performs an SP Discovery operation (S) and the display apparatus transmits a Service Provider Attachment Request signal to the SP (S). Upon completion of attachment to the SP, the display apparatus receives provisioning information from the SP (S). Further, the display apparatus receives Master System Information (SI) Tables, Virtual Channel Map Tables, Virtual Channel Description Tables, and Source Tables from the SP (S to S).","For example, SP Discovery is a process by which SPs that provide IPTV services search for Service Discovery (SD) servers having information about the offerings of the SPs.","In order to receive information about the SD servers, an SD server address list can be detected, for example, using three methods, specifically use of an address preset in the display apparatus or an address manually set by a user, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)-based SP Discovery, and Domain Name System Service (DNS SRV)-based SP Discovery.","The display apparatus accesses a specific SD server using the SD server address list obtained through one of the above three methods and receives a SP Discovery record from the specific SD server. The Service Provider Discovery record includes information needed to perform Service Discovery on an SP basis.","The display apparatus then starts a Service Discovery operation using the SP Discovery record. These operations can be performed in a push mode or a pull mode.","The display apparatus accesses an SP attachment server specified by an SP attachment locator included in the SP Discovery record and performs a registration procedure (or a service attachment procedure).","Further, after accessing an authentication service server of an SP specified by an SP authentication locator and performing an authentication procedure, the display apparatus may perform a service authentication procedure.","After service attachment is successfully performed, a server may transmit data in the form of a provision information table to the display apparatus.","During service attachment, the display apparatus may include an Identifier (ID) and location information thereof in data and transmit the data to the service attachment server. Thus the service attachment server may specify a service that the display apparatus has subscribed to based on the ID and location information.","In addition, the service attachment server provides, in the form of a provisioning information table, address information from which the display apparatus can obtain Service Information (SI). The address information corresponds to access information about a Master SI Table. This method facilitates provision of a customized service to each subscriber.","The SI is divided into a Master SI Table record for managing access information and version information about a Virtual Channel Map, a Virtual Channel Map Table for providing a list of services in the form of a package, a Virtual Channel Description Table that contains details of each channel, and a Source Table that contains access information about actual services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Referring to , a display apparatus  includes a network interface , a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) manager , a service delivery manager , a Demultiplexer (DEMUX) , a Program Specific Information (PSI) & (Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP) and\/or SI) decoder , a display A\/V and On Screen Display (OSD) module , a service control manager , a service discovery manager , a metadata manager , an SI & metadata DataBase (DB) , a User Interface (UI) manager , and a service manager .","The network interface  transmits packets to and receives packets from a network. Specifically, the network interface  receives services and content from an SP over the network.","The TCP\/IP manager  is involved in packet reception and transmission of the display apparatus , that is, packet delivery from a source to a destination. The TCP\/IP manager  classifies received packets according to appropriate protocols and outputs the classified packets to the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","The service delivery manager  controls received service data. For example, when controlling real-time streaming data, the service delivery manager  may use the Real-time Transport Protocol\/Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTP\/RTCP).","If real-time streaming data is transmitted over RTP\/RTCP, the service delivery manager  parses the received real-time streaming data using RTP and outputs the parsed real-time streaming data to the DEMUX  or stores the parsed real-time streaming data in the SI & metadata DB  under the control of the service manager . In addition, the service delivery manager  feeds back network reception information to a server that provides the real-time streaming data service using RTCP.","The DEMUX  demultiplexes a received packet into audio data, video data and PSI data and outputs the audio data, video data and PSI data to the audio decoder , the video decoder , and the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , respectively.","The PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes SI such as PSI. More specifically, the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes PSI sections, PSIP sections or SI sections received from the DEMUX .","The PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  constructs an SI DB by decoding the received sections and stores the SI DB in the SI & metadata DB .","The audio decoder  and the video decoder  decode the audio data and the video data received from the DEMUX  and output the decoded audio and video data to a user through the display A\/V and OSD module .","The UI manager  and the service manager  manage the overall state of the display apparatus , provide UIs, and manage other managers.","For example, the UI manager  provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the form of an OSD and performs a reception operation corresponding to a key input received from the user. For example, upon receipt of a key input signal regarding channel selection from the user, the UI manager  transmits the key input signal to the service manager .","The service manager  controls managers associated with services, such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","The service manager  also makes a channel map and selects a channel using the channel map according to the key input signal received from the UI manager .","And, the service manager  sets the audio\/video Packet ID (PID) of the selected channel based on SI about the channel received from the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder .","The service discovery manager  provides information necessary to select an SP that provides a service. Upon receipt of a channel selection signal from the service manager , the service discovery manager  detects a service based on the channel selection signal.","The service control manager  takes charge of selecting and control services. For example, if a user selects live broadcasting, like a conventional broadcasting service, the service control manager selects and controls the service using Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) or Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). If the user selects Video on Demand (VoD), the service control manager  selects and controls the service.","The RTSP supports trick mode for real-time streaming. Further, the service control manager  may initialize and manage a session through an IP Multimedia Control (IMC) gateway using IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The protocols are given by way of example and thus other protocols are also applicable according to other embodiments.","The metadata manager  manages metadata related to services and stores the metadata in the SI & metadata DB .","The SI & metadata DB  stores the SI decoded by the PSI & (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , the metadata managed by the metadata manager , and the information required to select an SP, received from the service discovery manager . The SI & metadata DB  may store setup data for the system.","The SI & metadata DB  may be constructed in a Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) or a flash memory.","An IMS gateway  is a gateway equipped with functions needed to access IMS-based IPTV services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Referring to , the display apparatus  includes a broadcasting receiver , an external device interface , a memory , a user input interface , a controller , a display , an audio output unit  and a power supply . The broadcasting receiver  may include a tuner , a demodulator  and a network interface .","The tuner  selects a Radio Frequency (RF) broadcast signal corresponding to a channel selected by a user from among a plurality of RF broadcast signals received through an antenna and downconverts the selected RF broadcast signal into a digital Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal or an analog baseband A\/V signal.","For example, if the selected RF broadcast signal is a digital broadcast signal, the tuner  downconverts the selected RF broadcast signal into a digital IF signal DIF. On the other hand, if the selected RF broadcast signal is an analog broadcast signal, the tuner  downconverts the selected RF broadcast signal into an analog baseband A\/V signal, CVBS\/SIF.","That is, the tuner  may be a hybrid tuner capable of processing not only digital broadcast signals but also analog broadcast signals. The analog baseband A\/V signal CVBS\/SIF may be directly input to the controller .","The tuner  may be capable of receiving RF broadcast signals from an Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) single-carrier system or from a Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) multi-carrier system.","The tuner  may sequentially select a number of RF broadcast signals corresponding to all broadcast channels previously stored in the display apparatus  by a channel add function from a plurality of RF signals received through the antenna and may downconvert the selected RF broadcast signals into IF signals or baseband A\/V signals.","The demodulator  receives the digital IF signal DIF from the tuner  and demodulates the digital IF signal DIF. For example, if the digital IF signal DIF is an ATSC signal, the demodulator  may perform 8-Vestigal SideBand (VSB) demodulation on the digital IF signal DIF.","The demodulator  may also perform channel decoding. For channel decoding, the demodulator  may include a Trellis decoder (not shown), a de-interleaver (not shown) and a Reed-Solomon decoder (not shown) so as to perform Trellis decoding, de-interleaving and Reed-Solomon decoding.","For example, if the digital IF signal DIF is a DVB signal, the demodulator  performs Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (COFDMA) demodulation upon the digital IF signal DIF.","The demodulator  may also perform channel decoding. For channel decoding, the demodulator  may include a convolution decoder (not shown), a de-interleaver (not shown), and a Reed-Solomon decoder (not shown) so as to perform convolution decoding, de-interleaving, and Reed-Solomon decoding.","The demodulator  may perform demodulation and channel decoding on the digital IF signal DIF, thereby obtaining a stream signal TS. The stream signal TS may be a signal in which a video signal, an audio signal and a data signal are multiplexed.","For example, the stream signal TS may be an MPEG-2 TS in which an MPEG-2 video signal and a Dolby AC-3 audio signal are multiplexed. An MPEG-2 TS may include a 4-byte header and a 184-byte payload.","In order to properly handle not only ATSC signals but also DVB signals, the demodulator  may include an ATSC demodulator and a DVB demodulator.","The stream signal TS may be input to the controller  and thus subjected to demultiplexing and A\/V signal processing. The processed video and audio signals are output to the display  and the audio output unit , respectively.","The external device interface  may serve as an interface between an external device and the display apparatus . For interfacing, the external device interface  may include an A\/V Input\/Output (I\/O) unit (not shown) and\/or a wireless communication module (not shown).","The external device interface  may be connected to an external device such as a Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) player, a Blu-ray player, a game console, a camera, a camcorder, or a computer (e.g., a laptop computer), wirelessly or by wire.","Then, the external device interface  externally receives video, audio, and\/or data signals from the external device and transmits the received input signals to the controller . In addition, the external device interface  may output video, audio, and data signals processed by the controller  to the external device.","The A\/V I\/O unit of the external device interface  may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, a Composite Video Banking Sync (CUBS) port, a Component port, a Super-video (S-video) (analog) port, a Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port, a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) port, and a D-sub port.","The wireless communication module of the external device interface  may perform short-range wireless communication with other electronic devices. For short-range wireless communication, the wireless communication module may use Bluetooth, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra WideBand (UWB), ZigBee, and Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA).","The external device interface  may be connected to various set-top boxes through at least one of the above-described ports and may thus receive data from or transmit data to the various set-top boxes.","The external device interface  may receive applications or an application list from an adjacent external device and provide the applications or the application list to the controller  or the memory .","The network interface  serves as an interface between the display apparatus  and a wired\/wireless network such as the Internet. The network interface  may include an Ethernet port for connection to a wired network. The wireless communication module of the external signal I\/O unit  may wirelessly access the Internet. For connection to wireless networks, the network interface  may use Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) (i.e., Wi-Fi), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), World Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax), and High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA).","The network interface  may transmit data to or receive data from another user or electronic device over a connected network or another network linked to the connected network.","Especially, the network interface  may transmit data stored in the display apparatus  to a user or electronic device selected from among users or electronic devices pre-registered with the display apparatus .","The network interface  may access a specific Web page over a connected network or another network linked to the connected network. That is, the network interface  may access a specific Web page over a network and transmit or receive data to or from a server.","Additionally, the network interface  may receive content or data from a CP or an NP.

The memory  may store information about broadcast channels by the channel-add function.","The memory  may store applications or a list of applications received from the external device interface  or the network interface .","The memory  may include, for example, at least one of a flash memory-type storage medium, a hard disk-type storage medium, a multimedia card micro-type storage medium, a card-type memory (e.g. a Secure Digital (SD) or eXtreme Digital (XD) memory), a Random Access Memory (RAM), or a Read-Only Memory (ROM) such as an Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory.","The display apparatus  may reproduce content stored in the memory  (e.g. video files, still image files, music files, text files, and application files) to the user.","The user input interface  transmits a signal received from the user to the controller  or transmits a signal received from the controller  to the user. For example, the user input interface  may receive various user input signals such as a power-on\/off signal, a channel selection signal, and a screen setting signal from a remote controller  or may transmit a signal received from the controller  to the remote controller , according to various communication schemes, for example, RF communication and IR communication.","Also, the user input interface  may provide the controller  with user input signals or control signals received from local keys (not shown), such as inputs of a power key, a channel key, and a volume key, and setting values.","For example, the user input interface  may transmit a control signal received from a sensor unit (not shown) for sensing a user gesture to the controller  or transmit a signal received from the controller  to the sensor unit. The sensor unit may include a touch sensor, a voice sensor, a position sensor, a motion sensor, etc.","The controller  may demultiplex the stream signal TS received from the tuner , the demodulator , or the external device interface  into a number of signals and process the demultiplexed signals into audio and video data.","The video signal processed by the controller  may be displayed as an image on the display .

For example, the controller  may control the tuner  to select an RF broadcast signal corresponding to a user-selected channel or a pre-stored channel.","The controller  may control the display apparatus  according to a user command received through the user input interface  or according to an internal program. Especially the controller  may access a network and download an application or application list selected by the user to the display apparatus  over the network.","For example, the controller  controls the tuner  to receive a channel selected according to a specific channel selection command received through the user input interface  and processes a video, audio and\/or data signal of the selected channel.","The controller  outputs the processed video or audio signal along with information about the user-selected channel to the display  or the audio output unit .","In another example, the controller  outputs a video or audio signal received from an external device such as a camera or a camcorder through the external device interface  to the display  or the audio output unit  according to an external device video playback command received through the external device interface .","The controller  may control the display  to display images.
