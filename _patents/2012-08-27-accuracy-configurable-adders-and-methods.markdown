The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Fields of the invention include arithmetic circuitry, microelectronics and integrated circuits. Example applications of the invention include applications where approximation can increase performance or reduce power consumption with a simplified or to inaccurate circuits in application contexts where strict requirements are relaxed. Example applications are related to circuits used to provide output to human senses, because approximate arithmetic can be used to generate sufficient results rather than absolutely accurate results","Adders are key to many circuits, including microprocessor architectures. Adders perform critical operations including arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication), comparison functions, and incrementing or decrementing functions. Adders are of interest as a bottleneck to further improvements in the performance of microprocessors and other general and specific purpose circuits.","Approximation has been recognized as providing an opportunity to increase performance or reduce power consumption through use of a simplified or inaccurate circuit in application contexts where strict requirements are relaxed. Approximate design enables a tradeoff of accuracy in computation versus performance and\/or power. Various approximate arithmetic designs have been proposed that provide a fixed approximation to achieve a set performance. The approximation is designed at a level that provides an error rate that is an acceptable penalty. If error detection and correction is used, the penalty rate is set such that correction still results in a net speed\/computation benefit.","Lu described a faster adder which has shorter carry chains and considers only the previous k bits of input in computing a carry bit. Lu, \u201cSpeeding Up Processing with Approximation Circuits\u201d, 37(3) (2004) pp. 67-73. Verma et al. describe a modification of Lu's adder in the form of a variable latency speculative adder (VLSA). Verma et al., \u201cVariable Latency Speculative Addition: A New Paradigm for Arithmetic Circuit Design\u201d (2008, pp. 1250-1255). The Verma et al. paper describes a modification of Lu's approximate fast adder that includes error detection and correction to Lu's design. This modification is a variable-latency adder that produces a correct result very fast with extremely high probability using an approximation. When an error is detected, a correction term must be applied and the correct result is produced after is a time delay. Shin et al. also propose a data path redesign technique for various adders which cuts the critical path in the carry chain. Shin et al., \u201cA Re-Design Technique for Datapath Modules in Error Tolerant Applications\u201d (2008, pp. 431-437). Zhu et al. propose an error-tolerant adders (ETA). ETAI is divided into an accurate part and an inaccurate part to achieve approximate results. Zhu et al., \u201cDesign of Low-Power High-Speed Truncation-Error-Tolerant Adder and Its Application in Digital Signal Processing\u201d (18(8) (2010), pp. 1225-1229). ETAII cuts carry propagation to speed up the adder, and ETAIIM modifies ETAII by connecting carry chains in accurate MSB parts. Individually and collectively, these approximate adder designs produce almost-correct results at prescribed accuracy for a particular application, and obtain power reductions or performance improvements in return.","These prior techniques are therefore restricted or at least best-suited to particular application contexts. In contexts where the accuracy requirement can change dynamically, the previous methods' benefits from the accuracy tradeoff are reduced since the implementation must be targeted to the maximum accuracy requirement.","A preferred method of accuracy configuration with an approximate adder receives two input operands and generates a first approximate adder output with a plurality of sub-adders having a first accuracy under a first condition. Error detection and correction is selectively enabled to generate a next approximate adder output having a second accuracy that is higher than the first accuracy under a second condition. In preferred embodiments, a pipelined architecture provides selectable stages and the enablement of each successive stage provides a high level of accuracy. Power gated control can achieve enablement of error correction stages to conserve power.","Reference numbers in the drawings correspond to the following features in the drawings:\n\n","The present invention recognizes that required accuracy varies according to applications, and 100% accurate results are still required in some situations. The invention provides adders and adding methods with run-time solutions that are scalable. To the knowledge of the inventors, but without limiting the nature of the advancement of the invention, it is not believed that previous approximate adders have been described that can configure the output accuracy during runtime. Previous approximate adders known to the inventors have difficulty detecting and correcting errors since they are designed for error-acceptable applications with a target accuracy. However, the present inventors have recognized that accurate computations are still required at certain times. The invention provides an approximate adder that supports both accurate and inaccurate computation with error-correction and accuracy-configuration capability.","A preferred embodiment of the invention is an accuracy-configurable approximate adder and adding method for which the accuracy of results is configurable during runtime. The preferred adder and method can adaptively operate in both approximate (inaccurate) mode and accurate mode. The preferred adder and method can achieve significant throughput improvement and total power reduction over conventional adder designs and methods. The preferred adder and method can be used in accuracy-configurable applications, and improves the achievable tradeoff between performance\/power and quality.","A preferred embodiment includes an approximate adder section and an error detection and correction section. The approximate adder section will produce incorrect results when it processes specific input patterns. The error detection and correction section can detect and correct such incorrect results with a is small overhead.","A preferred embodiment implements an accuracy-configurable adder of the invention in combination with a pipelined architecture. In the pipelined accuracy configurable adder of the invention, each stage generates a result with different accuracy. The output accuracy increases as the number of pipeline stages increases. According to a specified or selected accuracy requirement, later stages of the pipeline can be turned off with a power gating technique. This reduces accuracy according to the specified or selected accuracy requirement and results in a desirable reduction in computational load, delay and power consumption further with the accuracy tradeoff.","Artisans will recognize that the invention can be applied to all arithmetic designs which allow inaccurate results during specific periods. The invention is applicable to datapath (arithmetic) parts of digital processors. In some applications, more accurate or totally accurate results are required under certain conditions\u2014e.g., image processing in security cameras would require cleaner images after detecting a motion. In contexts where the required accuracy changes during runtime, accuracy configurable adders of invention can configure the accuracy of results and maximize the benefit of approximate operations.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings may include schematic representations, which will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows. Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for artisans will recognize additional effective embodiments that are within the scope of the present invention.","Approximate Adder Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","102","103","104","105","106","104","107","108","105","106","109","110","111","101","102","104","105","106","103","106","110","111","105","109","104","108","107","104"]},"The sub-adders ,  and  can be conventional adders, e.g., carry-look ahead adders (CLA), ripple-carry adders, Kogge-Stone adders. Any type of adders can be used for the sub-adders; and all sub-adders can be same type of adder, or can be mix of different type of adders. Another option is a Wallace tree adder. The Wallace tree adder is a three-input adder, and can receive three operands. The invention supports use of Wallace tree adders as the  sub-adders, and such a change does not affect error correction to enable configurable accuracy as indicated below.","With the reduced critical-path delay, high performance (by increasing the clock frequency) and\/or low power consumption (by decreasing the operating voltage) is obtained. The second (middle) sub-adder  adds accuracy. Without the middle sub-adder , error occurs when the eighth carry bit is high, and for random input patterns the error rate is 50.1%.

However, the error can be detected and corrected with a small overhead in accordance with the invention. A low overhead error detection is accomplished by detecting an error for each sub-adder by checking the output of the sub-adder and the carry-in signal that comes from the previous sub-adder.

In the pipelined architecture, approximate additions are computed at a first pipeline stage  and error correction can be completed in a subsequent stage . The approximate adder  produces approximate output  in the first pipeline stage . An error bit  is generated with the error detection circuit () of . In the second pipeline stage , the error is corrected with the incrementor circuit . The pipelined implementation of the proposed approximate adder invention has a structural analogy with the pipelined adder of the patent \u201cFast Pipelined Adder\/Subtractor using Increment\/Decrement Function with Reduced Register is Utilization\u201d (U.S. Pat. No. 7,007,059, 2006, incorporated by reference herein) in which partial summations are performed at the first stage and carry bits are added at the later stages. However, the '059 patent is directed to accurate operations, and not approximate computations.","In the pipelined approach, there is no improvement of the clock frequency since the achievable clock period is the same as that of the conventional adder. However, power benefits are obtained through configuration of accuracy: in the approximate mode, the error correction stage is power-gated with foot (and\/or head) switches , and power reduction over the conventional adder design can be achieved. The switches  are controlled by a mode signal . The foot (head) switches are placed between the voltage ground (supply) and a given block of functional circuitry; the block's leakage is stopped when the switch cuts off the current path from supply to ground.","To achieve higher performance or lower power consumption, we can reduce the carry chain depth (k) of sub-adders. However, when k is less than N\/4, it is impossible to correct all errors and achieve 100% correct results within one clock cycle since the error-correction paths become critical. To achieve correct results in the pipelined implementation, the error-correction stage should be extended to multiple stages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["501","502","503","504","507","514","515","516","517","508","509","510"]},"Designs of the invention have been simulated. The experiments with simulations show excellent performance potential and advantages.","To test approximate designs, each design was written in Verilog and synthesized it to a TSMC 65GP cell library with Synopsys Design Compiler. Gate-level simulations were performed using Cadence NC-Sim. In the simulations, gate delay was taken from an SDF (standard delay format) file. For voltage scaling experiments, a Synopsys Liberty (.lib) file for each voltage was prepared from 1.00V to 0.60V in 0.01V increments, using the Cadence Library Characterizer v9.1. The prepared libraries were used for SDF file generation and power estimation at each voltage. Each simulation was performed with input patterns for one million cycles. During the simulation, each output value is compared with a reference (correct) value to produce the accuracy metrics. Random data, as well as actual data from SPEC 2006 benchmarks were used as input patterns. Operand data was extracted from ADD instructions in the SPEC benchmarks.","To quantify errors in approximate designs, two metrics have been previously proposed. See, M. A. Breuer, \u201cIntelligible Test Techniques to Support Error-Tolerance\u201d, Test Symposium, pp. 386-393 (2004). Error rate (ER) is the percentage of cycles in which output value is different from the correct value. Error significance (ES) is the numerical difference between correct and output results. which quantifies the amount of error. In image\/video applications, uses the product of ES and ER can be used as a metric of error tolerance. See, I. Chong et al., \u201cNew Quality Metric for Multimedia Compression Using Faulty Hardware\u201d, Proc. International Workshop on Video Processing and Quality Metrics for Consumer Electronics, pp. 267-272 (2006). ES\u00d7ER can be used as criterion for acceptability, called an acceptance threshold, where the acceptance threshold is specified according to the application. See, D. Shin and S. K. Gupta, \u201cA Re-Design Technique for Datapath Modules in Error Tolerant Applications\u201d, Asian Test Symp., pp. 431-437 (2008). For the error significance (ES) metric, only amplitude of error needs to be considered for certain applications. N. Zhu et al., \u201cDesign of Low-Power High-Speed Truncation-Error-Tolerant Adder and Its Application in Digital Signal Processing\u201d, IEEE Trans. on VLSI Systems, 18(8) pp. 1225-1229 (2010). This approach is useful for many digital signal processing (DSP) systems that process, e.g., sound and image data. However, in communication systems that mainly handle information data, the number of incorrect bits (Hamming distance).","A metric for the amplitude data can be labeled ACCand is defined as 1\u2212|R\u2212R|R, where Rand Rare the correct and obtained results, respectively. We provide an additional metric for information data, ACC, that measures error significance as Hamming distance. This metric is defined as 1\u2212B\u2212B, where Bis the number of error bits and Bis the bit-width of the data. The amplitude and significance metrics were averaged over the entire simulation to evaluate the approximate circuits.","Table I summarizes results\u2014minimum clock period, area, error rate and throughput improvements\u2014for each implementation of the 16-bit adder with different k values. According to the results, with smaller k, the minimum operating frequency increases, but the error rate increases as well. With higher k, the error rate is reduced significantly, but the benefit of the approximate circuit, i.e., clock period reduction, is small. In the table, throughput improvement over conventional design is calculated including error recovery overhead. From the implementations, a maximum throughput improvement is achieved when k=3. If we correct erroneous results with error correction and detection as in , then 17.2% additional clock cycles are required for error correction. With this overhead, the present configurable approximate adder with error correction can improve data throughput by 24.6% over a conventional CLA adder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0109"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE I"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"k",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"2","3","4","5"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"min. clock period (ps)","180","190","220","230"]},{"entry":[{},"area (um)","550","990","920","840"]},{"entry":[{},"pass rate (%)","55.3","82.8","94.0","98.1"]},{"entry":[{},"throughput improvement (%)","11.3","24.6","22.3","21.4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Gate-level simulation at each possible clock period was conducted to compare five adders: carry look-ahead adder (CLA), Lu's adder (S.-L.

In the pipelined architecture, the present adder can provide various configurable modes according to the pipeline depth. To improve the design performance, increase the pipeline depth; the deeper pipeline reduces the path depth of the design. In the conventional pipelined adder, bit-width of the adder in each stage can be reduced to N\/#stage, where N is the entire bit-width and #stage is the depth (number) of the pipeline stages. In the present adder, the value of parameter k can be reduced with deeper pipeline depth. To show the benefit of accuracy configuration, a 32-bit ACA adder (N=32, k=4) with 4-stage pipeline was simulated and compared with a conventional pipelined adder with an 8-bit CLA in each stage.

The ACA adder can operate in four different modes with the power gating of each stage. The modes show different power consumptions and different achievable accuracies. From the results, due to the presence of recovery circuits, the present adder consumes 11.5% more power than the conventional adder in accurate mode (mode-1). At the same time, it shows a significant power reduction with approximate modes: 12.4%, 31.0% and 51.6% at mode-2, mode-3 and mode-4, respectively. Data showed that accuracy configuration with the mode change is much more effective than with voltage scaling, in terms of the tradeoff between accuracy and power.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0114"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"power-","ACC","ACC","total power","reduction"]},{"entry":["config.","gating","(max.)","(max.)","(mW)","(%)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["mode-1","none","1.000","1.000","5.962","\u221211.5%"]},{"entry":["mode-2","stage-4","0.998","0.960","4.683","12.4%"]},{"entry":["mode-3","stage-3, 4","0.991","0.925","3.691","31.0%"]},{"entry":["mode-4","stage-2, 3, 4","0.983","0.900","2.588","51.6%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
