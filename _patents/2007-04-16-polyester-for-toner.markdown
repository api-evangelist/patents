A toner containing a linear polyester resin of which physical properties such as a molecular weight are defined (see Patent Publication 1); a toner containing a nonlinear cross-linked polyester resin in which a rosin is used as an acid component in the polyester (see Patent Publication 2); a toner with improved fixing ability in which a rosin modified with maleic acid is used (see Patent Publication 3); and the like have been reported. In addition, a toner containing a low-molecular weight polyester in which an aliphatic alcohol is used as a monomer as an alcohol component, and a high-molecular weight polyester has been reported (see Patent Publication 4).\n\n","The present invention relates to a polyester for a toner, obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component containing a fumaric acid-modified rosin; and a toner containing the polyester for a toner.","However, with further progress in speeding up and energy conservation of the machine in the recent years, it has been found that conventional resin binders for toners do not sufficiently meet the demands of the market. In other words, it has become very difficult to maintain a sufficient fixing strength due to the shortening of a fixing time in the fixing step and lowering of a temperature of a heating temperature fed from the fixing device.","On the other hand, if a softening point of a resin is tried to be lowered or the like in order to increase low-temperature fixing ability, the lowering of a glass transition temperature inevitably accompanies, whereby resulting in worsening of storage ability such as undesired aggregation of the toner.","In addition, while the rosin usable in Patent Publication 2 or Patent Publication 3 is effective in the improvement of low-temperature fixing ability, a further improvement for storage ability is in demand, and at the same time there is a disadvantage that an odor is more likely to be generated depending upon the kinds of the rosins.","Further, although the polyester in which the aliphatic alcohol is used has excellent fixing ability, there is a disadvantage that the resins are fused during the pulverization because its pulverizability is too excellent, so that the productivity is rather worsened.","The present invention relates to a polyester for a toner having excellent low-temperature fixing ability, storage ability, and durability and having reduced generation of an odor, and a toner containing the polyester. Further, the present invention relates to a polyester for a toner not only having excellent low-temperature fixing ability, storage ability, and durability, but also having excellent offset resistance and pulverizability, and a toner containing the polyester.","The toner containing the polyester for a toner of the present invention exhibits excellent effects of having excellent low-temperature fixing ability, storage ability, and durability, and having reduced generation of an odor. In addition, in a case of a toner obtained by using the polyester of the present invention obtained from an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol, in addition to the above-mentioned effects, the toner exhibits excellent offset resistance and pulverizability.","A significant feature in the polyester for a toner, obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component, of the present invention resides in that the carboxylic acid component contains a fumaric acid-modified rosin. Since the polyester contains a fumaric acid-modified rosin, fixing can be carried out at a very low temperature, whereby improving storage ability and durability. A maleic acid-modified rosin obtained by modification with maleic acid, which is a conventionally used modified rosin, has three functional groups, the modified rosin functions as a cross-linking agent. Therefore, a polyester obtained from a carboxylic acid component containing a large amount of a conventionally used maleic acid-modified rosin in order to increase the fixing ability contains a low-molecular weight component that worsens durability in a large amount, while containing a large amount of a high-molecular component effective in durability, so that its durability is insufficient. On the other hand, if the amount of the maleic acid-modified rosin is reduced, the low-temperature fixing ability of the resulting polyester is lowered. However, the fumaric acid-modified rosin usable in the present invention has a very high glass transition temperature (Tg) as compared to the conventional rosin and the maleic acid-modified rosin, so that a low-molecular weight component is reduced; therefore, it is presumed that surprising effects that low-temperature fixing ability and contradictory physical properties thereto, such as offset resistance and storage ability, can be satisfied are exhibited.","The fumaric acid-modified rosin in the present invention refers to a rosin modified with fumaric acid, and obtained by an addition reaction of fumaric acid to a rosin of which main component is abietic acid, neoabietic acid, palustric acid, pimaric acid, isopimaric acid, sandaracopimaric acid, dehydroabietic acid, levopimaric acid, or the like. Specifically, the modified rosin can be obtained through a Diels-Alder reaction between levopimaric acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid, and palustric acid, having a conjugated double bond in the main component of the rosin, and fumaric acid while heating.","The rosin has a modification degree with fumaric acid (fumaric acid-modified degree) of preferably from 5 to 105, more preferably from 20 to 105, and even more preferably from 40 to 105, and even more preferably from 60 to 105, from the viewpoint of increasing a molecular weight of the polyester, thereby increasing its glass transition temperature.","The fumaric acid-modified degree is calculated by the formula (A):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0018"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Su","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Fumaric","Acid","Modified","Degree"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"X","mn":"1"},"mo":"-","mi":"Y"},{"msub":{"mi":"X","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mi":"Y"}]},"mo":"\u00d7","mn":"100"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"A"}}]}]}}}},"wherein Xis a SP value of a fumaric acid-modified rosin of which modified degree is calculated, Xis a SP value of a fumaric acid-modified rosin obtainable by reacting one mol of fumaric acid and 0.7 mol of a rosin, and Y is a SP value of the rosin.","Here, the SP value means a softening point as determined with a ring-and-ball type automatic softening point tester described later. The molecule of the formula (A) means an increased degree of a SP value of the rosin modified with fumaric acid, where the larger the value of the formula (A), the higher the degree of modification.","The fumaric acid-modified rosin has a glass transition temperature of preferably from 40\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 C., more preferably from 45\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 50\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of increasing the storage ability of the resulting polyester.","A method for producing a fumaric acid-modified rosin is not particularly limited. For example, a fumaric acid-modified rosin can be obtained by the steps of mixing a rosin and fumaric and heating to a temperature of 180\u00b0 to 260\u00b0 C. or so, to carry out a Diels-Alder reaction, thereby adding (meth)acrylic acid to an acid containing a conjugated double bond contained in the rosin.","Further, it is preferable that the rosin and the fumaric acid are allowed to react in the presence of a phenol, from the viewpoint of efficiently reacting the rosin and the fumaric acid. The phenol is preferably a dihydric phenol and a phenolic compound having at least a substituent at an ortho-position to the hydroxyl group (hereinafter referred to as a hindered phenol), and the hindered phenol is more preferred.","The dihydric phenol means a compound in which two OH groups are bonded to a benzene ring, but other substituents are not bonded thereto, and hydroquinone is preferred.","The hindered phenol includes mono-t-butyl-p-cresol, mono-t-butyl-m-cresol, t-butyl catechol, 2,5-di-t-butyl hydroquinone, 2,5-di-t-amyl hydroquinone, propyl gallate, 4,4\u2032-methylenebis(2,6-t-butylphenol), 4,4\u2032-isopropylidenebis(2,6-di-t-butylphenol), 4,4\u2032-butylidenebis(3-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), butylhydroxyanisole, 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol, 2,6-di-t-butylphenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-ethylphenol, 2,4,6-tri-t-butylphenol, octadecyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3\u2032,5\u2032-di-t-butylphenyl)propionate, distearyl(4-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-t-butyl)benzyl malonate, 6-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-t-butylanilino)-2,4-bisoctylthio-1,3,5-triazine, 2,6-diphenyl-4-octadecanoxyphenol, 2,2\u2032-methylenebis(4-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), 2,2\u2032-methylenebis(4-ethyl-6-t-butylphenol), 2,2\u2032-isobutylidenebis(4,6-dimethylphenol), 2,2\u2032-dihydroxy-3,3\u2032-di-(\u03b1-methylcyclohexyl)-5,5\u2032-dimethyldiphenylmethane, 2,2\u2032-methylenebis(4-methyl-6-cyclohexylphenol), tris[\u03b2-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyloxyethyl] isocyanurate, 1,3,5-tris(2,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-t-butylbenzyl) isocyanurate, tris(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenol) isocyanurate, 1,1,3\u2032-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-butylphenyl)butane, 2,6-bis(2\u2032-hydroxy-3\u2032-t-butyl-5\u2032-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenol, N,N\u2032-hexamethylenebis(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), hexamethyleneglycolbis[\u03b2-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate], triethyleneglycolbis[\u03b2-(3-t-butyl-5-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate], tetrakis[methylene-3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane, and the like. Among them, t-butyl catechol is preferred.","The amount of the phenolic compound used is preferably from 0.001 to 0.5 parts by weight, more preferably from 0.003 to 0.1 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 0.005 to 0.1 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the raw material monomers for the fumaric acid-modified rosin.","The fumaric acid-modified rosin may be used as it is, or may be further purified through a procedure such as distillation and used.","The rosin used in the fumaric acid-modified rosin in the present invention includes natural rosins obtained from pine trees, isomerized rosins, dimerized rosins, polymerized rosins, and disproportionate rosins, and a known rosin can be used without particular limitation, so long as the rosin may be a rosin of which main components are abietic acid, neoabietic acid, palustric acid, pimaric acid, isopimaric acid, sandaracopimaric acid, dehydroabietic acid, levopimaric acid, and the like. From the viewpoint of color, natural rosins, such as a tall rosin obtained from a tall oil obtainable as a by-product in the process of manufacturing a natural rosin pulp, gum rosin obtainable from a crude turpentine, a wood rosin obtained from stumps of pine tree, and the like are preferred. The tall rosin is more preferred, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability.","The fumaric acid-modified rosin in the present invention is obtained through a Diels-Alder reaction while heating, so that impurities which are causations for an odor are reduced making it less odorous. From the viewpoint of further reducing an odor and improving storage ability, the fumaric acid-modified rosin is preferably obtained by modification of a rosin having reduced impurities through a purification step (purified rosin) with fumaric acid, and more preferably obtained by modification of a purified tall rosin with fumaric acid.","The purified rosin in the present invention is a rosin from which impurities are reduced by a purification step.

In the present invention, peak intensities of three kinds of impurities of those listed above, hexanoic acid, pentanoic acid, and benzaldehyde, which are detected as volatile components according to headspace GC-MS method, can be used as an index for a purified rosin. Here, the reason why that the specified volatile components are used as indexes, not in absolute amounts of impurities, is in that the use of the purified rosin in the present invention has an objective of improvement in odor against conventional polyesters using rosins.","Specifically, the purified rosin in the present invention refers to a rosin in which a peak intensity of hexanoic acid is 0.8\u00d710or less, a peak intensity of pentanoic acid is 0.4\u00d710or less, and a peak intensity of benzaldehyde is 0.4\u00d710or less, under measurement conditions for headspace GC-MS method described later.

As a method of distillation, a method described, for example, in JP-A-Hei-7-286139 can be utilized. The method of distillation includes vacuum distillation, molecular distillation, steam distillation, and the like, and it is preferable that the rosin is purified by vacuum distillation. For example, distillation is carried out usually at a pressure of 6.67 kPa or less and at a stilling temperature of from 200\u00b0 to 300\u00b0 C., an ordinary simple distillation as well as a method of thin-film distillation, rectification, or the like can be applied. The high-molecular weight compound is removed as a pitch component in an amount of from 2 to 10% by weight, and at the same time an initial distillate is removed in an amount of from 2 to 10% by weight, each based on the charged rosin under ordinary distillation conditions.","The rosin before the modification has a softening point of preferably from 50\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 C., more preferably from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 65\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 C.

Since the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol component is molecularly compact and has a high reactivity, a polyester having a large number-average molecular weight is obtained, even when a fumaric acid-modified rosin being molecularly bulky and having a low reactivity is used. In other words, a polyester having a reduced low-molecular weight component and a large number-average molecular weight is obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol and a carboxylic acid component containing a fumaric acid-modified rosin, so that it can be deduced that low-temperature fixing ability and contradictory physical properties thereto, such as offset resistance and storage ability can be satisfied, without impairing pulverizability.","The aliphatic polyhydric alcohol is preferably a dihydric to hexahydric aliphatic polyhydric alcohol, and more preferably a dihydric to trihydric aliphatic polyhydric alcohol, from the viewpoint of its reactivity with a carboxylic acid containing a modified rosin.
