filed on Feb. 29, 2008.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to a process for making the compounds and to the use of the compounds in therapy. More particularly, it relates to certain substituted 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine compounds useful for inhibiting Raf kinase and for treating disorders mediated thereby.","2. Description of the State of the Art","The Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway is critical for cell survival, growth, proliferation and tumorigenesis. Li, Nanxin, et al. \u201cB-Raf kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment.\u201d . Vol. 8, No. 6 (2007): 452-456. Raf kinases exist as three isoforms, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf. Among the three isoforms, studies have shown that B-Raf functions as the primary MEK activator. B-Raf is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. B-Raf kinase represents an excellent target for anticancer therapy based on preclinical target validation, epidemiology and drugability.","Small molecule inhibitors of B-Raf are being developed for anticancer therapy. Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib tosylate) is a multikinase inhibitor, which includes inhibition of B-Raf, and is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Other Raf inhibitors have also been disclosed or have entered clinical trials, for example SB-590885, RAF-265, PLX-4032 and XL-281. Other B-Raf inhibitors are also known, see for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006\/0189627, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006\/0281751, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2007\/0049603, International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/002325 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/002433.","Pyrazolopyridines are known, see for example, International Patent Application Publication WO 03\/068773 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/013896.","Kinase inhibitors are known, see for example, International Patent Application Publication WO 2005\/062795.","International Patent Application Publication WO 2008\/079906 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2008\/079909 also disclose kinase inhibitors.","International Patent Application Publication WO 2006\/066913, International Patent Application WO 2008\/028617 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2009\/012283 also disclose kinase inhibitors.","In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of Raf kinases, particularly B-Raf inhibitors. Certain hyperproliferative disorders are characterized by the over activation of Raf kinase function, for example by mutations or over expression of the protein. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, such as cancer.","More specifically, one aspect of the present invention provides compounds of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"31.75mm","wi":"68.92mm","file":"US08394795-20130312-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4 ","5 "]},"More specifically, one aspect of the present invention provides compounds of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"31.75mm","wi":"68.92mm","file":"US08394795-20130312-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4 ","5 "]},"Another aspect of the present invention provides intermediate compounds of Formula III:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"33.44mm","wi":"59.10mm","file":"US08394795-20130312-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4 ","20 "]},"Another aspect of the present invention provides intermediate compounds of Formula IV:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"21.08mm","wi":"53.34mm","file":"US08394795-20130312-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"5 "},"Another aspect of the present invention provides methods of preventing or treating a disease or disorder modulated by B-Raf, comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of this invention or a stereoisomer, prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl (\u201cBoc\u201d), benzyloxycarbonyl (\u201cCBz\u201d) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (\u201cFmoc\u201d). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, et al. . New York: Wiley Interscience, 2006.","Methods of Separation","It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (\u201cSMB\u201d) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. . New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., et al. \u201cChromatographic resolution of enantiomers: Selective review.\u201d 113(3) (1975): pp. 283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: Wainer, Irving W., Ed. . New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1993.","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. . New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III, Peyton. \u201cResolution of (\u00b1)-5-Bromonornicotine.
