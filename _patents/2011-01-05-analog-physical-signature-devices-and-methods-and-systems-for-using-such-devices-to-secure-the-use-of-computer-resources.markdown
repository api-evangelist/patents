The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This application is directed generally to computer resource security, and more specifically, to the binding of analog physical signature devices to computer resources for the purpose of identifying and controlling the use of such bound computer resources.","The security of computer resources has many diverse aspects. The facet of security of concern herein is controlling the use of computer resources. By computer resources we shall mean throughout both computer hardware operated by means of program instructions (e.g., central processing unit, storage disc and peripheral device) and computer software that comprises said program instructions (e.g., executable computer program, linkable object library and programming language source code). A method and system to control the use of a computer resource provides the means to describe, implement and enforce policies regarding where, when, why, how, and by whom the computer resource may be used.","Controlling the use of computer resources provides benefits to both the entity providing the computer resources and the entity using the computer resources. The entity providing the computer resources can, for example, rely on methods and systems for controlling use of the computer resources to insure that the computer resources are used in the proper place, at the proper time, in the proper way and by the proper user. On the other hand, the entity using computer resources can, for example, rely on methods and systems for controlling use computer resources to insure that the computer resources are fit-for-purpose, are in working condition, are the latest versions and are genuine and unaltered.","A necessary component of methods and systems for controlling the use of computer resources is the reliable and unambiguous identification of individual computer resources. For example, to implement the policy that a particular program must only be used on a particular computer, it is necessary to be able uniquely identify both the individual program and the individual computer.","An individual computer resource can be provided with a unique identification by binding it to a uniquely identified physical object. The metallic serial number tag on the back of a computer chassis is an example of identifying an individual computer resource by binding it to a uniquely identified physical object. The product identification sticker on the jewel case or shrink-wrap containing an individual computer program is another example of identifying an individual computer resource by binding it to a uniquely identified physical object.","In order to be reliable and unambiguous, the identification of individual computer resources must be provided in a way that cannot be subverted, modified, sabotaged, tampered, altered, cloned, copied, or in any other way, means or manner undermined by parties seeking to violate the control of the computer resource. Examples of acts to be rendered as practically impossible include, but are by no means limited to, removing the identification of an individual computer resource (\u201canonymizing\u201d), changing the identification of an individual computer resource to the identity of a second computer resource (\u201cspoofing\u201d), and creating a second computer resource with the same identification as an existing computer resource (\u201ccloning\u201d).","Both of the examples of computer resource identification through binding to a uniquely identified physical object above, the serial number tag and the product identification sticker, are subject to all three of these attacks. Both the serial number tag and the product identification sticker can be removed (\u201canonymizing\u201d), attached to alternative computer resources (\u201cspoofing\u201d), and duplicated (\u201ccloning\u201d).","These attacks and others mounted on the identification of an individual computer resource through binding to a uniquely identified physical object are mounted on the uniquely identified physical object as well as the binding of the uniquely identified physical object to the individual computer resource. Therefore, both the nature of the uniquely identified physical object and the nature of its binding to the individual computer resource must be considered when assessing the suitability and security of means for providing an individual computer resource with a unique identification through binding to an uniquely identified physical object.","There are in the current art methods and systems for the identification of an individual computer resource through binding to a uniquely identified physical object. In order to counter attacks on the binding of the computer resource to the uniquely identified physical object in this case, means are provided such that the individual computer resource operates correctly if and only if the binding to the uniquely identified physical object is intact. A physical device employed as the uniquely identified physical object in the identification of an individual computer resource is designated as a physical signature device because the successful use of the individual computer resource implies the presence of the physical signature device and thus the physical signature device can be said to sign for and consequently authorize the use of the individual computer resource.","A familiar and widely used example of binding a software computer resource to a physical signature device is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,489 (Solid state key for controlling access to computer software). Such a device is often referred to as a \u201cdongle\u201d. An executable program software computer resource that is bound to an individual dongle will operate correctly if and only if it is currently connected to that individual dongle. In other words, the dongle is a physical signature device.","Physical signature devices are of two kinds: digital and analog. The dongle is an example of a digital physical signature device. It stores a particular identification number in digital circuitry and provides this identification number in digital form to the executable program on demand, typically through the serial, parallel or USB port on the computer on which the executable program is being used. When the executable program is placed into execution, the executable program checks for the presence of an individual dongle on the communication port and only continues to execute if the individual dongle is found to be present on the communication port.","As another example of a digital physical signature device is the trusted computing platform. An example of this technique is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,327,652 (Loading and identifying a digital rights management operating system). When an executable program is placed into execution on an individual trusted computing platform, the executable program performs a cryptographic protocol to verify the authenticity of the credentials of the individual trusted computing platform. If the credentials of authenticity not present or are not in order then the executable program does not continue execution.","A shortcoming of methods and systems based on digital physical signature devices such as the dongle and the trusted computing platform is that explicit instruction sequences must be included in and executed by the executable program to interact with the digital physical signature device. These instruction sequences in the executable program, however, can be excised from or bypassed without affecting the functionality of the computer resource. In this way, a version of the computer resource is created that can used successfully without requiring the presence of the digital physical signature device (\u201canonymizing\u201d).","Another shortcoming of methods and systems that use digital physical signature devices such as the dongle and the trusted computing platform is that additional means must be provided to make it difficult to fabricate duplicate copies of the digital physical signature devices (\u201ccloning\u201d) and to ensure that the unique identification provided by the digital physical signature device cannot be altered (\u201cspoofing\u201d). Providing these means adds expense to the production of both the computer resource and the uniquely identified physical object used for its identification and control of its use.","Another shortcoming of methods and systems that use digital physical signature devices such as the dongle and the trusted computing platform is that few precautions are taken to prevent intrusive physical investigation and analysis (\u201ctamper-resistance\u201d) and intrusive physical investigations and analyses may be performed without leaving any indications that an intrusion has been made or attempted (\u201ctamper-evidence\u201d).","Another method and system available in the current art to control the use of a computer resource using a digital physical signature device is based on encryption of the instructions for operating the computer resource and execution of the encrypted instructions inside a special-purpose processor that is operative to decrypt the instructions as they are used to operate the computer resource. An example of this technique for an executable program software computer resource is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,123,045 (Comprehensive software protection system). The executable program and the data to which it is being applied are stored in an encrypted form in an uncontrolled computer memory. The uncontrolled computer memory is connected to a controlled central processing unit that is contained in a sealed, tamper-resistant enclosure. The controlled central processing unit retrieves the encrypted instructions and data from the uncontrolled computer memory, decrypts the instructions and data once they are inside the controlled central processing unit, encrypts the results of applying the decrypted instructions to the decrypted data, and places the encrypted results back in the uncontrolled memory.","One shortcoming of this method and system is that it requires a special-purpose computer in a secure enclosure, which adds expense to the production of both the computer resource and the uniquely identified physical object used for its identification. Another shortcoming of this method and system is that the computer resource operates more slowly than it is capable of operating due to the necessity to continuously decrypt the instructions and the data with and on which it operates and to continuously encrypt the results of applying the decrypted instructions to the decrypted data. Another shortcoming of this method and system is that is not readily applied to computer resources other than executable program software computer resources.","A need exists, therefore, to provide a low-cost physical signature device and a method and system for binding said low-cost physical signature device to computer resources for the purpose of controlling the use of computer resources that does not exhibit the above-mentioned shortcomings of the current art. Such a physical signature device should provide a unique indicium (\u201csignature\u201d). Such as physical signature device should be difficult to alter or duplicate. Such a physical signature device should be easily and yet tightly, securely and irrevocably bound to a computer resource. Such a physical signature device should be tamper-resistant and tamper-evident. Such a physical signature device should be able to be used with many different kinds of hardware and software computer resources. The security provided by such a physical signature device should not be based exclusively on instructions for the purpose of interacting with the device. Nor should such a physical signature device require the encryption\/decryption of the operating instructions for the computer resource or the use of a special purpose central processing unit.","An object of the present invention is providing a low-cost analog physical signature device that provides a unique signature, is difficult to duplicate, and is tamper-resistant and tamper-evident. An additional object of the present invention is providing a low-cost analog physical signature device and a method and system for binding such an analog physical signature device to computer resources for the purpose of controlling the use of such computer resources. An additional object of the present invention is providing a low-cost analog physical signature device and a method and system for binding such an analog physical signature device to computer resources for the purpose of protecting against reverse engineering.","These and other objects of the present invention are provided by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous and unique properties of an individual physical object that is bound to an individual computer resource for the purpose of identifying and controlling the use of such individual computer resource. A physical object that has these properties and is used for these purposes is referred to hereafter as an analog physical signature device.","The aforementioned properties of an analog physical signature device provide unique indicium (consequent, dependent analog outputs that provide unique signatures) while at the same time making it difficult to duplicate or alter the analog physical signature device without altering or destroying such unique indicium. The aforementioned properties of an analog physical signature device also provide resistance to and evidence of attempts to intrusively examine, analyze or alter the analog physical signature device.","Also in accordance with the present invention, the aforementioned properties of an analog physical signature device are embedded in and tightly bound to the functionality of the computer resource in such a manner that altering, tampering with or removing the bound analog physical signature device or its binding to the computer resource impacts the functionality of the computer resource to a degree that the computer resource is no longer of any use or value for its intended purpose.","Also in accordance with the present invention, the properties of embedding and tightly binding the analog physical signature device to the computer resource provide protection against reverse engineering of the computer resource.","An analog physical signature device by its intrinsic nature provides a wider range of signatures, is less expensive to construct, and is more difficult to attack than a digital physical signature device. An analog physical signature device is inherently difficult to duplicate, clone or spoof because of its relatively complex and inhomogeneous nature. An analog physical signature device is inherently tamper-resistant and tamper-evident because intrusive attempts to physically examine and analyze such an analog physical signature device irreversibly alters the device and thereby destroys the capability of the analog physical signature device to generate the unique signature ascribed to it.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals or characters identify corresponding or similar elements throughout the several views,  is a schematic illustration of an analog physical signature device  according to the present invention. The analog physical signature device  comprises a relatively complex, immutable (\u2018immutable\u2019 is used in the sense that physical properties of the material are invariant over time unless the medium is subject to a deliberate externally-applied stimulus) inhomogeneous medium  that is configured and operative to generate, from a predetermined analog input provided by an analog input means , a consequent and dependent analog output (the terminology \u201cconsequent, dependent\u201d as hereinafter used to define outputs means, that for any predetermined input, a \u2018unique\u2019 output is produced), detected by an analog detection means , that is unique to the individual analog physical signature device . In other words, the consequent, dependent analog output of the analog physical signature device  detected by analog detection means  represents and can suitably function as the unique signature of the analog physical signature device  for the predetermined analog input provided by analog input means . This unique signature, in turn, reliably and securely authenticates and uniquely identifies the analog physical signature device  and, concomitantly, an individual computer resource to which it is bound.","An analog physical signature device  according to the present invention overcomes the shortcomings of prior art digital physical signature devices in several respects.","First, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium contained in or comprising an individual analog physical signature device  has the property that it is, for practical purposes, impossible to reproduce with sufficient precision to duplicate the signature produced by the individual analog physical signature device  and as a consequence, creation of a duplicate of (\u201ccloning\u201d) the individual analog physical signature device  is, for all practical purposes, statistically impossible.","Second, the relatively complex consequent, dependent analog output produced by and which uniquely identifies an individual analog physical signature device  is, for practical purposes, impossible to alter in such a way that it is mistaken for (\u201cspoofing\u201d) the consequent, dependent analog output generated by another analog physical signature device from the same predetermined analog input.","Thus, the innate complexity of both the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous nature of the analog physical signature device , and the relatively complex nature of its consequent, dependent analog output, provide protection against two well-known physical attacks, cloning and spoofing, on systems and methods for controlling use of computer resources using analog physical signature devices.","Third, invasive attempts to physically analyze and explore the signature generation capability of the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium of the analog physical signature device  will alter the consequent, dependent analog outputs produced by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium, and thus will both destroy the capability of the analog physical signature device  to create its identifying signature and also make evident the invasion. Any interference with any consequent, dependent analog output in an attempt to alter it to represent the analog output of another analog physical signature device will destroy the identifying signature carried by such consequent, dependent analog output, likewise making evident the interference. As a result neither the analog physical signature device  nor the consequent, dependent analog outputs it produces require an additional or secondary protection system to protect their functional elements. Rather the inherent and indigenous nature of the analog physical signature device  and its consequent, dependent analog outputs simultaneously provide and protect such functionality.","Fourth, since the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention does not need to be built into the computer resource and since the analog input and output interface requirements of any particular analog physical signature device can be met using conventional, widely available analog input means  and analog detection means , the analog physical signature device  can be bound to a wide range of computer resources.","The analog physical signature device  according to the present invention creates a unique signature, i.e., consequent, dependent analog output, for each predetermined analog input, relying on the physical (\u201canalog\u201d) properties and processes inherent to the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material , rather than computational (\u201cdigital\u201d) processes, to transform a particular input into a unique output.","For the purposes of clarity and understanding, the following paragraphs describe two illustrative and exemplary embodiments of the analog physical signature device  having utility in the practice of the present invention, one based on light waves and the other based on sonic waves. Those skilled in the art will recognized that radiation from any part of an acoustic or electromagnetic spectrum could similarly be employed, and accordingly, the invention of the present application is not intended to be limited by such exemplary embodiments.","For one class of embodiments of the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention, the particular physical process involves the transformation of a predetermined light wave input due to its interaction with, e.g., transmission through or reflection\/refraction from, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium of the analog physical signature device . A unique physical signature is created by interacting a predetermined light wave with the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium of the analog physical signature device  at a first known interface point A and detecting the transformation of this predetermined light wave produced by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium at a second known interface point B. The transformation of the predetermined input light wave to the consequent, dependent output light wave realized by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium is the signature that uniquely identifies the analog physical signature device . See  which illustrates an exemplary process for using the analog physical signature device  of the present invention to generate the unique signature of the analog physical signature device  by transforming a predetermined light wave input into a consequent, dependent light wave output.","For another class of embodiments of the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention, the particular physical process involves the transformation of a predetermined sonic wave due to its interaction with, e.g., transmission through or reflection\/refraction from, a relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium of the analog physical signature device . A unique physical signature, i.e., consequent, dependent analog output, is created by interacting a predetermined sonic wave with the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium comprising the analog physical signature device  at a first known interface point A and detection of the consequent, dependent output sonic wave resulting from the transformation of the predetermined sonic wave produced by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium out at a second known interface point B. The transformation of the predetermined input sonic wave to the consequent, dependent output sonic wave by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium is the signature that uniquely identifies the analog physical signature device . See  which illustrates an exemplary process for using the analog physical signature device  of the present invention to generate the unique signature of the analog physical signature device  by transforming a predetermined sonic wave input into a consequent, dependent sonic wave output.","For the first class of embodiments of the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention, one preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  comprises a solid translucent rod , for example of acrylic plastic, having embedded therein small reflective flakes  and\/or small translucent colored glass balls , as exemplarily illustrated in , that functions as the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material, a means  for inputting a predetermined light wave at the first known interface point A at one end of the translucent rod , and a means  for detecting the consequent, dependent light wave output at the second know interface point B at the other end of the translucent rod .","In another preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  using light waves, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material of the analog physical signature device  comprises an imperfect mirror  made from glass with embedded impurities , e.g., air bubbles, and\/or having surface irregularities , and\/or an inhomogeneous metallic backing , as exemplarily illustrated in . The predetermined light wave input is directed onto the imperfect mirror  at a first known interface point A and the consequent, dependent light wave output, i.e., unique signature, is detected at a second known interface point B.","In the foregoing embodiments of the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention using light waves, and in all others constructed and operated so as to interact a predetermined light wave with a relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium , the nature of the transformation of the predetermined light wave input by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium  from the first known interface point A to the second known interface point B provides the consequent, dependent light wave output that uniquely identifies the analog physical signature device , and, concomitantly, the computer resource to which the analog physical signature device  has been bound.","For the second class of embodiments of the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention, one preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  comprises a solid block  of relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material, a means  to direct a predetermined sonic wave at a first known interface point A in the volume of the block , and a means  to detect the consequent, dependent sonic wave output at a second known point B in the volume of the block  as exemplarily illustrated in .","In another preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  using sonic waves, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material  comprises a closed hollow container filled with a viscous fluid, a means  to direct a predetermined sonic wave at a first known interface point A in the volume of the fluid, and a means  for detecting the consequent, dependent sonic wave output at a second known interface point B in the volume of the viscous fluid.","In yet another preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  using sonic waves, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material  comprises a disc of porous sintered metal, a means  to direct a predetermined sonic wave at a first known interface point A of the porous sintered metal disc, and a means  to detect the consequent, dependent sonic wave output at a second known interface point B of the porous sintered metal disc.","In yet another preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  using sonic waves, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material  comprises closed hollow container filled with ringing metal objects such as tuning forks and bells, a means  to direct a predetermined sonic wave at a first known interface point A in the volume of metal objects, and a means  to detect the consequent, dependent sonic wave output at a second known interface point B in the volume of the metal objects.","In yet a further preferred embodiment of the analog physical signature device  using sonic wave, the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous material  comprises a membrane stretched over a rigid body or frame, a means  to direct a predetermined sonic wave at a first known interface point A on the stretched membrane , and a means  for detecting the consequent, dependent sonic wave output at a second known interface point B on the membrane.","In the foregoing embodiments of the analog physical signature device  according to the present invention using sonic waves, and in all others constructed and operated so as to interact a predetermined sonic wave with a relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium , the nature of the transformation of the predetermined sonic wave input by the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous medium  from the first known interface point A to the second known interface point B provides a consequent, dependent sonic wave output that uniquely identifies the analog physical signature device , and, concomitantly, the computer resource to which the analog physical signature device  is bound.","The following paragraphs describe one preferred method for binding an analog physical signature device to a computer software resource to define an interactive system that controls the use of such computer software resource for its intended purpose according to the present invention. In the case that the computer software resource is operative to define the functionality of a computer hardware resource\u2014such as software embedded in a disc or a printer\u2014the method binds the analog physical signature device to the computer hardware resource. In both cases the computer resource performs correctly if and only if it is operated in association with the analog physical signature device to which it has been bound. Thus we henceforth speak without loss of generality of binding a computer program to an analog physical signature device without differentiating between the cases that the computer program is a part of a computer hardware resource or is in the form of a computer software resource. Thus, the terminology computer software resource or computer program as used herein embraces instructions that any digitally programmed device executes to realize a defined and predetermined functionality, including but not limited to application programs, operating systems, basic input\/output systems, and embedded program instructions for hardware resources such as computer peripherals, industrial machines and consumer products.","The binding of a computer program to an analog physical signature device according to the present invention embeds the unique output from an individual analog physical signature device into the computer instructions comprising the computer program, and thereby merges in an inseparable manner the relatively complex, immutable, inhomogeneous and unique properties of the individual analog physical signature device and the functionality of the computer program. As a consequence of the method and system of the present invention, the computer resource will function correctly if and only if it is operated in association with the analog physical signature device to which it has been bound. Furthermore as a consequence of the method and system of the present invention, to excise or bypass the computer instructions bound to the analog physical signature device would be tantamount to excising or bypassing the functionality that the computer resource is intended to perform, essentially rendering the computer resource useless for its intended functionality.","Any useful computer program makes use of constant values. Constant values may be used in a computer program to conditionally or unconditionally branch from one instruction in the computer program to another instruction in the computer program (a \u201clogical\u201d constant). Constant values may also be used as indexes and offsets into arrays of data (a \u201cpointer\u201d constant). Constant values may also be used to position text or graphics that are displayed to the user of the program for the purpose of operating the program and indeed the text and graphics themselves may be represented by sequences of constant values (a \u201crepresentational\u201d constant). Constant values may also be used as means to send messages to other computer programs (a \u201cmessage\u201d constant). Finally, in computer programs involving scientific calculations, constant values may be used in scientific formulae and mathematical equations (a \u201ccomputational\u201d constant). Collectively, any of the constant values of a useful computer program, as exemplarily illustrated by means of the foregoing examples, are defined herein as program constants.","Any useful computer program also makes use of variable values. Variable values may be used in a computer program to hold input to the computer program (an \u201cinput\u201d variable). Variable values may also be used in a computer program to hold intermediate results (an \u201cintermediate result\u201d variable). Variable values may also be used in a computer program to hold the memory address of data or instructions (a \u201cpointer\u201d variable). Variable values may also be used in a computer program to hold output from the computer program (an \u201coutput\u201d variable). Collectively, any of the variable values of a useful computer program, as exemplarily illustrated by means of the foregoing examples, are defined herein as program variables.","Any useful computer program also makes use of functions of program constants and program variables. Functions of program constants and program variables may be used in a computer program to compute offsets into program data structures (an \u201coffset\u201d function). Functions of program constants and program variables may also be used in a computer program to compute the size of program data structures (a \u201csize\u201d function). Functions of program constants and program variables may also be used in a computer program to compute positions in input or output formats (a \u201cformat\u201d function). Functions of program constants and program variables may also be used in a computer program to compute mathematical and scientific values (a \u201cmathematical or scientific\u201d function). Collectively, any of the functions of program constants and program variables of a useful computer program, as exemplarily illustrated by means of the foregoing examples, are defined herein as program functions.","Such program constants, program variables, and\/or program functions, individually, collectively, and\/or in any combination, are defined hereinafter using the terminology \u201cprogram expression\u201d. During conventional execution of a computer program embodying any such program expressions, these program expressions are processed by the instructions comprising the computer program as exemplarily illustrated in the method of .","In a preferred embodiment of a method and interactive system according to the present invention, an individual analog physical signature device is bound to an individual computer program by replacing the code segment (the terminology \u2018code segment\u2019 as used herein encompasses both the singular and plural) representing a selected program expression in the computer program with an alternative code segment that is a function of the unique output from the individual analog physical signature device. The inventive consequence of such replacement is that the individual computer program will perform consistent with its intended purpose if and only if it is operated in association with the individual analog physical signature device to which it has been bound. Another inventive consequence of this alteration is that the individual computer program is difficult to reverse engineer.","It is to be understood that a plurality of program expressions in a computer program can be replaced with alternative code segments to strengthen the binding of the computer program to the analog physical signature device. In such applications, each program expression is replaced by a specific alternative code segment that has a singular correspondence to such replaced program expression.","Interactive System:","The analog physical signature device that is bound to the computer program in this interactive system is operative to transform a predetermined analog signal input to a consequent, dependent (unique) analog signal output. The bound computer program, including the alternative code segment embedded therein that binds the computer program to the analog physical signature device, is only executable using digital values.","The interactive system, therefore, includes conversion means that are operative to realize causal relationships between digital values and analog signals to ensure the proper functioning of both the computer program (using digital values) and the analog physical signature device (using analog signals) to which it is bound. More specifically, the interactive system includes a digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion means  (see ) that is operative to realize the causal relationship between a predetermined digital input, which is defined by the alternative code segment, and a predetermined analog input for the bound analog physical signature device. The interactive active system further includes an analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion means  (see ) that is operative to realize the causal relationship between the consequent, dependent analog output produced by the analog physical signature device and a predefined digital output that is used in the program functionality of the bound computer program.","Referring to , which depicts an interactive system according to the present invention, the conversion means ,  can be implemented as elements of the analog physical signature device , as illustrated by the larger dashed rectangle. Alternatively, the conversion means ,  can be implemented as elements separate and distinct from the analog physical signature device , as illustrated by the smaller dashed rectangle. In these alternative embodiments, the conversion means ,  can be implemented as stand-alone hardware or implemented as part of the digitally-programmed hardware that holds the bound computer program.","There are in the current art many means for causally relating a digital value to an analog signal and many means for causally relating an analog signal to a digital value. For example, digital-to-analog (D\/A) converters are known prior art devices or means that are operative to provide the causal relationship function by converting digital values to an analog signal. Similarly, analog-to-digital (A\/D) converters are known prior art devices or means that are operative to provide the causal relationship function by converting an analog signal to digital values. An example of an digital-to-analog converter is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,208 (Digital to analog converter). An example of an analog-to-digital converter is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,570,091 (Analog-to-digital converter). These types of D\/A and A\/D conversion means have particular utility in the interactive systems described in Examples 3-5 below.","Or, for example, a mapping function can be implemented as the conversion means to define the causal relationship between digital values and analog signals. Such a mapping function would be operative to causally relate (by mapping) each predetermined digital input \u2018x\u2019 to a predetermined analog input, f(t). The predetermined analog input f(t) is transformed by interaction with the analog physical signature device into the consequent, dependent analog output g(t). The mapping function would be further operative to causally relate (by mapping) the consequent, dependent analog output g(t) to a predefined digital output \u2018y\u2019. The causal relationships defined by such mapping functions may be arbitrary or may be associated with particular parameters of the analog signals.

The Binding Transformation that is the subject of this patent application can be applied in the same manner to any programming language source code text form such as Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, C, Basic, Java or assembly language.","The Binding Transformation can also be applied in the same manner to binary forms of computer programs that result from processing the programming language source code text form and preparing it for use on a particular processor. The binary form to which the Binding Transformation is applied can be, for example, a static library object form, a dynamic link library form or an executable form.","The Binding Transformation that is the method and interactive system of the current invention has the property that in addition to binding an individual computer program to an individual analog physical signature device, it also provides protection against reverse engineering of the individual computer program. An attacker that comes into possession of the individual computer program, for example, in any of the forms mentioned above, without also being in possession of the individual analog physical signature device to which the individual computer program is bound will find it difficult to reverse engineer the computer program to discover the original program expressions in the unprotected program that have been replaced by the Binding Transformation.
