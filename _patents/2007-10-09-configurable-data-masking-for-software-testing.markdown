title: Configurable data masking for software testing
abstract: A data masking tool can support a wide variety of data sources and execution mechanisms. For example, any of a wide variety of data masking techniques can be achieved via a web interface, API, command line, SOA, or the like. Connectivity to mainframe environments can be achieved. Multiple data source types and data to and from different technology platform types can be supported. The tool can support interfacing with a metadata management tool. High quality randomness can be provided by a Mersenne Twister random number generator. The tool can be useful for performing data masking during software testing without having to write data masking code.

Ideally, the data used when testing software will resemble live data that is expected when the software is deployed. However, for security reasons, live data is not always available.","For example, some software deals with personal or confidential information. A banking application may access a database that has names, addresses, social security numbers, and bank balances of customers. Besides possibly being in violation of the law, providing such information to testers may not be desirable because the testing environment might not otherwise need to have the security safeguards in place to adequately protect the data.","Accordingly, testing may be done with data that does not resemble live data. However, such an approach can easily lead to inadequate testing. As a result, certain problems with the software are later found after the application is put into production, leading to dissatisfied users.","Although there are certain data masking software packages available, they are not sufficiently flexible and do not lend themselves well to use in a variety of settings.","Therefore, there still remains need for technologies to address shortcomings of current data masking techniques.","A variety of techniques can be used for supporting data masking. As described herein, a wide variety of data sources and execution mechanisms can be supported. Configuration for a wide variety of scenarios can be achieved via a configurable data masking tool without having to write data masking code.","A configurable data masking tool that can be accessed in a variety of ways can be helpful because developers need not start from scratch or re-code if data masking is desired for a particular software development project. Instead, the tool can easily be tailored to work within the particularities of the project via configuration data.","Flexibility of a data masking tool can accommodate data from a variety of sources, including different technology platform types.","The data masking tool can input and output data in a common, editable format (e.g., extensible markup language) so that a variety of other tools can be used.","Data can be extracted from a metadata management tool to avoid re-entry of data.","If desired, a Mersenne Twister random number generation technique can be employed for high quality randomness.","As described herein, a variety of other features and advantages can be incorporated into the technologies as desired.","The foregoing and other features and advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of disclosed embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"In the example, the data masking tool  is configured to receive unmasked data  (e.g., source data) and output masked data  (e.g., output data). The data masking tool  can include a data masking rule engine  that supports any of a variety of masking rules (e.g., static substitution rules, dataset substitution rules, random substitution rules, shuffling rules, encryption rules, and the like).","The data masking tool  can also store a plurality of data masking profiles  that specify configuration settings for various data masking scenarios, including one or more masking rules  per scenario. In practice, the data masking profiles  can be stored outside of the tool . In some implementations, configuration data can be specified without storing a profile with the tool .","In practice, the system  can be more complicated, with additional functionality, features, and the like.","Although some of the examples assume the perspective of the data masking tool , the methods described herein can be implemented from other perspectives (e.g., from the perspective of a hosting application or from one or more client applications). For example, although the terminology \u201creceiving unmasked data\u201d can used from the perspective of the data masking tool , such an act could also be described as \u201csending unmasked data\u201d from the perspective of a client application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","210"]},"At , one or more masking rules are applied (e.g., by a data masking rule engine) to the unmasked data as indicated via configuration data (e.g., in a profile or the like).","At , the masked data is output.","The method  and any of the methods described herein can be performed by computer-executable instructions stored in one or more computer-readable media (e.g., storage or other tangible media).","In any of the examples herein, data masking configuration data can include any of a variety of information by which data masking can be configured. For example, the configuration data can indicate which data masking rules are to be applied to which data (e.g., which table columns).","To facilitate interchangeability of the data masking configuration data, the data masking tool can both send and receive the data masking configuration data as Extensible Markup Language (XML).","To facilitate editing in XML editors and metadata tool, fields can be stored as human-readable names. For example, indications of columns or fields can be stored as column or field names, data types can be stored as human-readable words (e.g., \u201cnumber,\u201d \u201cvarchar,\u201d \u201cdate,\u201d and the like), masking rules stored as human readable words (e.g., \u201cno rule,\u201d \u201cstatic substitution,\u201d \u201cdataset substitution,\u201d \u201crandom substitution,\u201d \u201cencryption,\u201d \u201cshuffling,\u201d and the like), and the like.","The XML generated by the data masking tool can be sufficient to completely reconfigure it to perform the data masking a second or subsequent time. If desired, such XML can be edited using any XML editor, including a text editor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","340","300","340"]},"The API can be used to invoke functionality of the data masking tool  as described herein.

For example, a web interface can present configuration screens by which a user can create configuration data (e.g., a data masking profile) and execute one or more profiles against source data.","The API  can also accept calls from other interfaces  (e.g., any application that can issue API calls or serve as a hosting application for a data masking tool plug in). For example, it may be desirable for an application to have access to data masking functionality, or a custom front end can be provided.","The API  can also accept calls as a result of a command given at a command line . For example, a command can be configured to invoke the API  with specified configuration data.","The API  can also be invoked from a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) endpoint . Thus, data can be masked via the SOA technique (e.g., through a web service without installing the data masking software at a local machine).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","790"]},"In the example, an interface  can invoke the API  and specify that the data masking tool  apply the configuration data .","The configuration data  can be generated by an external configuration tool .","For example, the data masking tool  can be configured to recognize a language (e.g., XML), and the configuration tool  can generate configuration data for consumption by the data masking tool  in the language.","In this way, a commonly available application (e.g., MICROSOFT EXCEL software) can be used to generate the configuration data .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["890","860","870","870","860"]},"In the example, the hosting application  has access to input data  and can send the data to the custom transformation  to generate appropriate configuration data  and invoke the data masking tool  (e.g., via API ) to perform data masking. The custom transformation  can provide the unmasked data  and retrieve the masked data , which is then relayed back to the hosting application , which stores it as output data .","Such an arrangement can be particularly useful if the hosting application  can access data in specialized environments, such as in a mainframe environment.

For example, the custom transformation can specify a target location at which the tool will place the data.","At , the masked data is related to the hosting application. A port arrangement can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"1000"},"In any of the examples herein, the data masking tool  can support a variety of source data types. For example, unmasked flat file data A, unmasked database data B, and unmasked other data C (e.g., data passed when the data masking tool is a plug in hosted by an application) can be supported.","Similarly, the output (e.g., target) data types can be of different kinds A, B, and C.","If desired, a hybrid approach can be used (e.g., input of one type of data and output of another).","Further, the data sources and data targets can be from different technology platform types (e.g., mainframes, microcomputer-based desktops, UNIX-based systems, and the like). Similarly, a platform-hybrid approach (a data source from one platform type and a data target on another platform type) can be implemented.","In any of the examples herein, the data masking tool can be used to mask data in flat files. Features to assist in masking can be offered, such as automatically detecting details about the format of a table represented in a flat file. For example, the tool can be configured to read a table in a flat file and determine the number of columns, name of columns (e.g., if stored in the first row of the flat file), data type, size, precision, and the like. The format (e.g., list of column names) of the table in the flat file and the fields therein can be presented to the user for confirmation. Because the column names are listed, the user can easily identify the familiar column names and select masking rules to be applied to the columns based on their respective names.","A graphical user interface presenting the column names can be used to select masking rules for the respective columns as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},"In the example, the data masking profile  includes a source definition , and one or more masking rules .

For example, if the source data comprises tables, the metadata can indicate column names for tables, data types for the columns, and the like. If multiple tables are represented in the source data , the metadata can also indicate table names, relationships between the tables, and the like.","The metadata can be used to generate data masking configuration data .

For example, a user can choose the appropriate masking rules to be applied to the respective columns in a table.","However, it is also possible for the metadata management tool to store the masking rules and masking parameters as part of its metadata, leading to a more integrated configuration information management approach.","At , data masking is performed with the data masking configuration information, including that obtained from the metadata management tool.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"The client tier need not be considered a part of the system because a standard browser can be used.
