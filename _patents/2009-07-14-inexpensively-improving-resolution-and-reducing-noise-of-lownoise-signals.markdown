title: Inexpensively improving resolution and reducing noise of low-noise signals
abstract: Systems and methods for improving resolution of low-noise signals in an analog-to-digital conversion circuit. A simple, low cost pseudo-noise generating circuit is disclosed that, when connected to the signal conditioning circuitry of A/D conversion circuit, adds pseudo-noise to an analog input voltage signal. Additional pseudo-noise is beneficial for improving the resolution of analog-to-digital conversion when oversampling and summing or averaging are used in post-conversion processing operations. The circuit is composed of a plurality of resistors configured in at least two parallel branches. An individually switchable voltage source output is connected to each branch. A resulting analog voltage can be measured at a common termination point for the branches, depending on the combination of switchable voltage source output turned on, and the branch to which the voltage output is applied. By varying the combination of switchable voltage source outputs turned on over time, a known analog pseudo-noise signal is developed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under U.S. Government Contract No. N00030-08-C-0010 for the U.S. Navy. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.","The noise free code resolution of an A\/D converter is the number of bits of resolution beyond which it is no longer possible to distinctly resolve individual codes. In other words, this is essentially the number of digital code levels actually available after correction for the loss in resolution due to input referred noise. Said another way, this is the degree to which digital codes become lumped together as indistinguishable from one another due to the noise added during conversion, and is called quantization noise.","To counter this loss in resolution, averaging of the digital output signal can be used. Averaging is effective because by collecting a sufficient number of digital output samples, the distribution of sampled outputs that determines noise resolution becomes increasingly tightly defined. The effect is visible as an increase in height and a narrowing in the neck of the distribution of sampled outputs compared with a distribution of fewer samples. This decreases the distribution's standard deviation, and therefore the noise free code resolution.","In order to develop a distribution, though, there must be a minimum level of variability in the acquired signal. This leads to a paradoxical requirement: to raise the resolution of an A\/D converter, one can use digital averaging, but with this technique there is an accompanying need to actually have a minimum level of noise in the signal. If a suitable noise signal is not available, then one must be intentionally generated or something that gives the same result.","A general noise signal is one possibility, but is often not selected, most often because it has been filtered out at earlier circuit stages of the circuit than the A\/D converter, or is an insufficient noise level. White noise is another choice, however it is cumbersome to introduce without adding significant circuitry and has disadvantages.","The present invention provides circuits and methods for improving the resolution of an analog to digital converter. With this method, an analog repeatable deterministic signal is deliberately summed with an analog input voltage signal before passing the summed signal to an analog digital converter. The analog repeatable deterministic signal is generated by a circuit including a plurality of resistors making up at least two circuit branches and a common connection point. The common connection point is connected to a ground connection through a current summing resistor. The common connection point is connected to a signal conditioning circuit at an amplifier input. Finally the two or more circuit branches are connected to a plurality of switchable voltage source outputs.","In one aspect of the invention, the plurality of switchable voltage source outputs are switched on and off in various combinations. At the common connection point, also referred to as the repeating deterministic signal output node, the voltage varies as a function of the combination of switchable voltage source outputs are switched on, and the circuit branches to which this voltage is applied. This deterministic varying voltage is added to the analog input voltage signal by connection of the deterministic signal output node to a signal conditioning amplifier input that is also receiving the analog input signal.","In another aspect of the invention, three switchable voltage source outputs are included. There are eight possible switching combinations for these three voltage source outputs. Each of the eight possible combinations is executed before repeating any combination a second time. In a further refinement, by repeating this sequence of combinations periodically, a known and periodic pseudo-noise signal is available to the signal conditioning circuit at the analog to digital converter.","Connection of the previously described repeating deterministic signal generating circuit to the amplifier input of the signal conditioning circuit makes an analog deterministic signal available to the signal conditioning circuit of A\/D converter circuit. With the addition of the generated deterministic signal to the analog input voltage signal and oversampling and averaging of the resultant digital output signal, the resolution of the analog to digital converter can be increased. By adding a repeating deterministic signal with a repetition rate at an appropriate period shorter than the data averaging period it can be totally filtered out and any DC offset introduced is known and can be subtracted out.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["34","28","24","1","24","1","16","22","1","32","35","32","35","25","34","34","28","32","22","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","22","24","25","26","45","26","22","24","26","28","24","24","16","22","22","32","25","45","34","24"]},"In one embodiment, the signal conditioning circuit  includes a capacitive filter , an operational amplifier , a feedback resistor , a plurality of circuit resistors - - -, a reference voltage source , and a ground connection .
