title: Method for displaying information responsive to sensing a physical presence proximate to a computer input device
abstract: In a computer system, a touch sensitive input device having touch sensitive auxiliary controls system can be used to anticipate a user's action. When a user's hand approaches a touch sensitive input device, feedback can be displayed on a display screen. A user can receive feedback without activating the input device. The feedback may take the form of status information related to the feature controlled by the input device and can vary depending upon the application open. Likewise, when the hand of a user is moved away from the touch sensitive input device, the feedback brought on by sensing the user's hand may disappear.

More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of touch sensitive input devices in computer systems.","B. Related Art","Input devices for computerized systems such as keyboards, touchpads, trackballs, game controllers and mice, often include one or more auxiliary controls such as joysticks, touchpads, trackballs, headsets, microphones, buttons, knobs, rocker switches, triggers, sliders, wheels, biometric sensors, etc. Auxiliary controls may be used alone or in conjunction with input devices and other auxiliary controls.","Most input devices create input signals using transducers, or switches. Switches are typically found in the buttons of mice, joysticks, and game controllers, as well as in the keys of keyboards. Transducers are found in mice and trackballs and create electrical signals based on the movement of balls in those devices or by optically detecting movement of the device across a surface. Transducers are also found in headsets where they convert speech signals into electrical signals. Touchpads create input signals using sensors that provide an electrical signal when the user contacts the touchpad that signal including the location within the touchpad where contact is made.","Although it is desirable to increase the amount of information that an input device and its auxiliary controls can provide to the computer, the number of transducers and switches that can be added to an input device is limited by the user's ability to remember all of the functions that a particular transducer or switch performs and by the practicalities of the available or at least feasibly available real estate for the switches and transducers on the input device (e.g., keyboard or mouse). The ability of a user to determine the functionality of each auxiliary control is also generally limited to a static label on or near the auxiliary control, activating each auxiliary control, clicking a button to select a menu option to request help file or reading a user manual. Furthermore, the functionality of an auxiliary control may vary from one game or application to another game or application. Thus, a static label on an auxiliary control is of little value when the function and status of the input device and its auxiliary controls change from application to application. In this regard, even if a user learns the assignment of the buttons and other controls in one game or application, another game or application may assign the same buttons or controls different features. Similarly, the status of the feature controlled by the auxiliary control generally can only be determined by activating the control.","Thus, there is a need to provide a user with the ability to better determine the functionality and status of auxiliary controls regardless of their context, (e.g., active application or game).","To address this need, indicators such as LEDs or small LCDs may be integrated directly with the input device and its auxiliary controls to provide feedback or state information. However, association of LEDs or LCDs with each auxiliary control increases both the amount of power consumed and the cost of the input device. Furthermore, LEDs and LCDs have very limited output forms and are separated from the main display (e.g., a computer monitor) causing the user to constantly have to look away from the screen and at the auxiliary control to determine the functionality or status of the control. Such constant shifts of attention can mentally tire the user as he or she is forced to repetitively reacquire the current context. Accordingly, there is a need to provide a more efficient, convenient and\/or cost effective way to determine the functionality and\/or status of auxiliary controls of input devices in a computer system.","The present invention overcomes many of the shortcomings of existing input devices by providing touch sensitive input devices which have touch sensitive auxiliary controls that sense a physical presence and provide visual feedback on an on-screen display or on the control itself, acoustic feedback (e.g., voice or music) or tactile feedback (e.g., vibration).","In an aspect of the present invention, keys, buttons, knobs, rocker switches or other auxiliary controls of an input device such as a keyboard, touchpad, trackball, game controller, monitor, joystick, steering wheel, headset or mouse can be augmented with sensors that detect contact or extreme proximity of a user's hand. According to another aspect, a sensed signal of the auxiliary control can provide the user with an on-screen display of status, state information, tool tips, help text or other feedback relevant to the control the user has touched without the user having activated (e.g., depress, turn, roll or otherwise activate) the control. Alternatively, acoustic or tactile feedback may be provided to the user instead of or in addition to the feedback provided by the on-screen display. Hence, a user can simply touch different buttons or other controls to explore their function assignment or status, or obtain other feedback. Such feedback can allow the user to better understand the consequences of their action, should he or she subsequently chooses to activate the control. Also, a user may quickly and casually be able to view status information.","Aspects of the invention include providing context sensitive feedback for an auxiliary control in an on-screen display, such as a display widget (e.g., graphical user interface (GUI)), responsive to detection of a user's hand. Hence, touch sensitive controls can be used to predict the context of a user's action. The context of the situation can be established by preparatory actions by the user such as grabbing, touching or approaching a control. Knowing the context of the action, the computer can begin to execute and predict the will of the user.","According to another aspect of the invention, contexts of an auxiliary control may include, but are not limited to, different types of applications such as games, utility, and productivity applications. Also, contexts may change within various portions of an application or game.","In another aspect of the invention, when a GUI is displayed responsive to detection of a physical presence proximate to or contacting an auxiliary control, a user may interact with the GUI using another auxiliary control or an input device including, but not limited to, a mouse, touchpad or keypad. For example, if a volume control GUI is displayed, a user may adjust the volume with a mouse.","In another aspect of the invention, input devices including their auxiliary controls may have a touch sensor which directly detects when a physical presence (e.g., user) touches the device or its controls, so as to provide display and dismissal of feedback on an \u201con-demand\u201d basis, e.g., whenever the user establishes or breaks physical hand contact with the device.","For example, a transition in a touch indication provided by the device reflective of the user then making contact with the device or control, such as by touching the device with a finger may cause a tool tip to be displayed. A transition indicative of a user breaking physical contact with the device, such as by lifting his finger off the device, can cause the tool tip to be dismissed from the display. In one aspect of the invention, to prevent user distraction, these detected transitions initiate corresponding predefined animation sequences that occur over preset time intervals in which the feedback either begins to fade into view (typically from an invisible, i.e., totally transparent state, to eventually a predefined semi-transparent state or non-transparent state) as soon as user contact begins, and then begins to fade out from view (i.e., eventually back to its invisible state) as soon as user contact with the device is broken, e.g., as soon as the user lifts his or her hand away from the device.","In another aspect of the invention, toolbars, scrollbars and the like may only be displayed on a display screen in response to detection of a physical presence. Illustratively, touching, and not activating, an auxiliary control may cause on-screen display of a toolbar and breaking contact with the control may cause dismissing of the toolbar. In one aspect of the invention, a user may interface with the toolbar using an auxiliary control or input device as desired with one hand while continuing to touch the auxiliary control which caused the on-screen display of the toolbar. According to this aspect, display clutter can be reduced and available application screen area increased at appropriate times during program execution consistent with and governed by user action but without imposing any significant cognitive burden on the user to do so. This, in turn, is likely to significantly improve the \u201cuser experience\u201d.","These and other novel advantages, details, embodiments, features and objects of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from following the detailed description of the invention, the attached claims and accompanying drawings, listed herein, which are useful in explaining the invention.","In accordance with illustrative embodiments of the present invention, an auxiliary control of an input device may be configured to detect when a physical presence (e.g., user's hand, stylus) touches the control so as to provide display and dismissal of a display widget on an \u201con demand\u201d basis. The display widget may be a graphical user interface (GUI) and include information such as functionality (e.g., tool tips) and\/or status information on an \u201con-demand\u201d basis. An exemplary list of display widgets includes toolbars, tool glass sheet, scroll bars, window frames and window decorations, title bars, floating tool palettes, modal and non-modal dialog boxes, list or combo boxes, setting controls, buttons, text entry areas, etc.","A transition in a touch indication provided by the input device reflective of the user then making physical contact with an auxiliary control, such as by touching the control with a finger may cause a display widget to be displayed. A transition indicative of a user breaking contact with the auxiliary control, such as by lifting his finger off the control, causes the display widget to be dismissed. To prevent user distraction, these detected transitions can initiate corresponding predefined animation sequences that occur over preset time intervals in which the display widget either begins to fade into view (typically from an invisible, i.e., totally transparent, state to eventually a predefined semi-transparent state) as soon as user contact begins, and then begins to fade out from view (i.e., eventually back to its invisible state) as soon as user contact with the auxiliary control is broken, for example, as soon as the user lifts his or her finger from the control. Furthermore, depending on a specific touch-sensitive auxiliary control used, it is sometimes preferable to begin the fading after a brief time delay or \u201ccooling period\u201d occurs. For example, the user may reach the edge of the touchpad and \u201creclutch\u201d his or her hand (e.g., briefly lift up his or her finger and then re-center it on the pad) to continue pointer motion. It might be annoying for the display widget to begin fading immediately when this happens. A brief time delay (e.g., approximately 0.5 to 1.0 seconds), coupled with continued contact sensing of the finger, prior to the start of the fading allows brief reclutchings of this sort without any changes to the screen display. Similarly, if a user has not touched the auxiliary control for a sufficiently long period of time, a similar time delay, coupled with sensing for a release of user contact, prior to the start of a fade-in might be used to prevent a short inadvertent contact from causing the display widget from fading in and then out, and otherwise annoying the user.","Furthermore, according to the present invention, touch induced display and dismissal can also readily be used to display and dismiss a display widget (e.g., toolbar) on an \u201con-demand\u201d basis by sensing contact between a user's preferred hand and another touch sensitive auxiliary control or input device, such as, e.g., a touch sensitive mouse. Displaying a display widget in response to detection of touch, specifically when a user grabs an auxiliary control or input device, can exploit a user's desire, to utilize the display widget, implicit in the user's action in reaching for and grabbing the auxiliary control or input device. The display widget would be dismissed when the user releases the auxiliary control or input device, for example, when touch contact is broken. Displaying and dismissing a display widget in this fashion advantageously places little, if any, additional cognitive burden on the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes an illustrative computer system with a conventional personal computer , including a processing unit (CPU) , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the processing unit .

This sensor also includes a capacitive measuring circuit that generates an electrical signal based on the change in capacitance of the conductive film. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other contact sensor technologies are available such as photodiodes, piezoelectric materials, and capacitive pressure sensors. Any of these sensors may be used within the context of the present invention. In one proximity sensor embodiment, the touch sensor uses reflected light from an LED to detect when the user is proximate the sensor. A chip used to drive the LED and sense the reflected light according to this illustrative embodiment may be produced by Hamamatsu Corporation of Bridgewater, N.J. Other proximity sensor embodiments use changes in electric or magnetic fields near the input device to determine when the user is proximate to the device.","In embodiments of the present invention, the touch sensors may provide the same information regardless of where on the touch sensor the user touches the input device or the portion of the sensor to which the user is proximate. Thus, these touch sensors decouple touch data from position data.  provides an illustrative input device with this type of touch sensor.","In other embodiments, for example with touchpads, touch screens, and touch tablets, a given touch sensor may provide location information that would indicate where the user made contact within that touch sensor or where the user came closest to the touch sensor within the touch sensor. In these devices, one cannot specify positional data without touching the device, nor can one touch the device without specifying a position. Hence, touch sensing and position sensing are tightly coupled in these devices.","Referring to , analog-to-digital converter and multiplexer  converts the analog electrical signals found on conductors , , , and , into digital values carried on a line . Line  is connected to microcontroller , which controls multiplexer  to selectively monitor the state of the four touch sensors. Microcontroller  also receives inputs from various other sensors on the input device. For simplicity, these inputs are shown collectively as input . Those skilled in the art will recognize that different input devices and auxiliary controls provide different input signals depending on the types of motion sensors in the input device. Examples of motion sensors include switches, which provide signals indicative of the motion needed to close a switch; microphones, which provide signals indicative of air movement created by an audio signal; encoder wheels, which provide signals indicative of the motion of a mouse ball, trackball, or mouse wheel; and resistance wipers, which provide electrical signals indicative of the movements of a joystick. Each of these motion sensors acts as an input generator that is capable of generating input information to be sent to the computer system. Based on the particular input generator, this input information can include a depressible key's state, a depressible button's state, sound information, or movement information.","Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the number of input lines tied to microcontroller  depends on the number of sensors on the input device and the configuration of the input device. For example, for a keyboard, the microcontroller uses input lines to determine if any of the auxiliary controls have been activated. The micro controller accomplishes this using a multiplexer (not shown) to sequentially test the state of each auxiliary control on the keyboard. The techniques used to detect these auxiliary control states closures are well known in the keyboard art.","In a mouse or trackball, input lines  include lines for detecting the closure of switches and lines for detecting the rotation of encoder wheels. The switches are located beneath buttons on the mouse or trackball. The encoder wheels track the movement of the mouse ball or trackball. Typically, one encoder wheel tracks movement in the X direction and another encoder wheel tracks movement in the Y direction. In most embodiments, each encoder wheel has its own associated input line into microcontroller . In some mice, an additional encoder wheel tracks the rotation of a wheel located on top of the mouse.","In some mice, the X and Y movement of the mouse is tracked by a separate optics microcontroller that is connected to microcontroller  through lines . The optics microcontroller uses optical data to determine movement of the mouse. The optical microcontroller converts this optical data into movement values that are transmitted to microcontroller  along input lines .","In a game controller such as a game pad, input lines  include lines for detecting the closure of multiple switches on the game pad as well as lines for detecting the rotation of wheels on the game pad. In joysticks, input lines  can include lines connected to resistance wipers on the joystick as well as switches on the joystick. In headsets, lines  include multiple lines that carry multi-bit digital values indicative of the magnitude of the analog electrical signal generated by the microphone. An analog-to-digital converter typically produces these digital values. To reduce the weight of the headset, the analog-to-digital converter and microcontroller  can be found on a soundboard located within the computer. To further reduce the weight of the headset, multiplexer and A-to-D converter  of  can also be implemented on the soundboard.","Microcontroller  produces an output , which is provided to serial port interface  of . Typically, output  is a serial, digital value that indicates which motion sensor or touch sensor has been activated. For keyboards, the digital values include scan codes that uniquely identify the key, other auxiliary control or touch sensor on the keyboard that has been activated. For mice, the digital values include a mouse packet that describes the current state of each switch and each touch sensor on the mouse as well as the distances that the mouse wheel and mouse ball have moved since the last mouse packet was sent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["150","150","152","154","156","158","154","152"]},"Output line  carries signals from microphone  and from touch sensor .

The context of the situation may be indicated by the user's preparatory actions with the control, such as grabbing, touching, or approaching the control device. Referring to , for exemplary purposes, assume that the current functionality of control knob  is to control the volume of audio associated with media (as opposed to controlling the volume for other system generated sounds). In this instance, if the user wishes to change the volume, the user may approach or touch the control knob  with his hand. Before the user activates the control knob  by turning the knob, a GUI for the volume control including the status of the volume in the form of a screen volume indicator can appear on screen as shown in . The user may then turn the control knob  to adjust the volume or move a pointer (e.g., caret or arrow) into the GUI while contacting, but not turning, the control knob , and change the volume using another control such as a key (e.g., arrow key), mouse or other pointing device. If the user touches the control knob  and then employs a key or pointing device to change the volume while the GUI is visible, the change in volume state may be shown instantly in the GUI or elsewhere on the display screen. When the user releases the control knob , the system knows the GUI is no longer needed, and it can cause the GUI to be dismissed without perceptible delay. In some embodiments, the GUI will remain visible as long as the pointing device continues interacting with or the cursor remains over the GUI.","In another illustrative embodiment of the invention, when the user approaches or touches the control knob , without activating the control, a display widget such as a tool tip can instantly be displayed on the display screen and identify the current functionality of the control knob . For example, a tool tip may indicate, but is not limited to, one of the following functions 1) tuning for a variety of different applications including audio and video applications; 2) volume control for media applications; 3) volume control for system generated sounds; and 4) control for numerous features which can have multiple settings (e.g., brightness, cropping, color, etc.). In other illustrative embodiments, as a user approaches a control, such as control knob , visual feedback may be provided on the actual control knob by an LED or LCD alone or in addition to the display widget on the display screen. In still further illustrative embodiments, acoustic or tactile (e.g., vibration) feedback may be provided alone, or in addition to visual feedback on the display screen, input device and\/or control, or to each other. Consequently, the input device or control may be able to directly provide feedback (e.g., acoustic feedback) with or without involving or sharing the information with the host computer. In still further exemplary embodiments, one or more portions (e.g., top and side) of the control, such as control knob , may be able to independently detect contact or user proximity and generate unique messages for the host computer based on which portion of the control is being touched.","In another illustrative embodiment of the present invention based on the keyboard input device of , a touch sensitive rocker switch  can be provided. In one context, the rocker switch  may allow a user to switch between applications similarly to using the combination of the Alt and Tab keys, currently used on operating systems such as Windows98\u00ae by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. That is, the rocker switch  can allow a user to move forward and backward between running applications. Illustratively, when the user touches or approaches the rocker switch , an on-screen display showing an icon for each currently running application may be shown with the application in the foreground (at the top of the window stacking order) being highlighted as shown in . Pressing the rocker switch , can allow a user to move forward or backward between the applications in order to highlight the desired application to bring to the foreground of the display. The order may be determined in a number of ways, such as alphabetically or the last time each application was in the foreground of the display. Releasing the rocker switch  can cause the highlighted application to be selected and brought to the foreground of the display.

That is, when the user touches the \u201cCtrl\u201d key and \u201cc\u201d key together, the tool tip \u201cCopy\u201d displayed in  may appear on the screen and when the user touches the \u201cCtrl\u201d key+\u201cv\u201d key together, the tool tip \u201cPaste\u201d shown in  may appear on the screen.","Typically, the on-screen display can be placed near the current cursor or pointer (e.g., caret) position regardless of the input device that the user touches. For example, a keyboard tool tip could appear next to the cursor. Popping up the on-screen display to the right of and above the current cursor position can be beneficial, since the on-screen display does not conflict with traditional tool tips which appear when the user dwells with the pointer over an icon (tool tip appears to the right of and below the pointer or cursor) in the Windows\u00ae operating system by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. The tool tip can follow the cursor or pointer as the user moves the cursor or pointer with a pointing device (e.g., mouse), or it can remain stationary at the point where it initially appears. Maintaining the tool tip where it appears rather than moving the tool tip with the cursor is easier to implement and more efficient, and would likely be well accepted by users. According to other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the display widget may be displayed at the center of the screen, at the center of the currently active (\u201cfocus\u201d) application or widget (e.g. a text entry box), at the bottom of the screen, or above the system tray icons.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIGS. 30A and 30B","FIG. 30A","FIG. 30B","FIG. 30B","FIG. 30A"]},"In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each hot key may be assigned a text macro, where activating the hot key causes a block of text to be inserted, for example where the cursor is located on the screen. When used in this context, touching a hot key displays at least the beginning or another portion, if not all, of the text macro assigned to the hot key as shown in . The on-screen display window may automatically resize according to the amount of text assigned to the text macro in order to display all the text. This context may also be used in conjunction with scrolling controls such that a user, while touching the hot key assigned the text macro, may scroll through the text.","As mentioned previously, according to some exemplary embodiments of the present invention, acoustic or tactile feedback may be employed. Acoustic or tactile feedback can be used in combination with or separately from visual feedback on the display. In some cases, visual feedback may not be appropriate, or acoustic feedback may be desired because of the currently running application, the input device that is currently being used, or user preference.","According to certain embodiments of the invention, acoustic feedback, for example, appropriate cue tones or other sounds could be generated, as the user touches a control. A desired audio cue tone may be mapped to a specific function or control. Volume, pitch, and timbre could be adjusted to produce appropriate cues that mimic desired sounds, such as voice-generated announcement of a control function. Cue sounds may be generated by taking parametric sound event requests and sequencing them using MIDI wavetable synthesizer  through audio generator  (illustratively the Creative Labs AWE64 Gold card sound board) (see ). The specific techniques for establishing correct audio parameters for each audio cue, properly synthesizing the audio cues, and associating cues with corresponding controls and\/or functions have been omitted for simplicity as they are all readily apparent to those skilled in the art and do not form part of the present invention.","Acoustic feedback to identify functionality and other information may be particularly useful for gaming applications and products such as the MS Game Voice\u2122 by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. For example, gaming products may include a headset microphone combination attached to a puck. A puck allows a user to selectively talk to multiple combinations of people and teams with whom he or she is playing. Each person may be automatically assigned a code (1,2,3 . . . ) and a team (A,B,C . . . ). A problem may arise when the player has to remember which code corresponds to which player and team. When the user wants a reminder to whom a button is assigned, the user may touch a control (e.g., number key) and receive acoustic feedback of the name of the person assigned that code via their headset.","In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention identified in Table 1, multiple touch areas on an input device can be used to page backwards and forwards through web pages provided by an Internet browser. Examples of input devices having multiple touch sensitive areas useful in paging backward and forward include, among others, the mice of , D, A, B, A, B, and C. In , touching region  and then region  initiates a page backward function and touching region  and then region  initiates a page forward function. In , touching region  and then region  initiates a page backward function and touching region  and then region  initiates a page forward function. In , touching regions  and , respectively, and then regions  and , respectively, initiates page forward functions and touching regions  and , respectively, and then regions  and , respectively, initiates page backward functions. In , B, and C, touching regions , , and , respectively, and then touching regions ,  and , respectively, initiates page forward functions and touching regions , , and , respectively, and then touching regions , , and , respectively, initiates page backward functions.","Note that a mouse according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention can be configured so that paging functions are initiated simply by touching one touch sensor instead of touching a sequence of two touch sensors. Thus, in  touching region  can initiate a page forward function and touching region  can initiate a page backward function. Similarly, touching region  of  can initiate a page forward function and touching region  of  can initiate a page backward function. In this context, the touch sensors of the present invention provide the functionality of the side switches found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/153,148 filed on Sep. 14, 1998 entitled \u201cINPUT DEVICE WITH FORWARD\/BACKWARD CONTROL\u201d, the inventors of which were under a duty to assign the application to the assignee of the present application.","The paging functions performed using these touch areas are shown in . In  display  shows an Internet browser window  that depicts a current page . A user can page backward to the Internet page that was displayed before current page  to display a past page  of , which is shown in Internet browser window . The user can move forward to a next page , shown in browser window  of display  in , using the touch sensor combination described above. In order to be able move forward to next page , the user must at some point move backward from next page  to current page .","It should be understood that the various responses to making contact with or being in extreme proximity to a touch sensitive control may be used in combination. For example, when a user first makes contact with a button, the button's function may be displayed. In one implementation, if the user maintains contact with the button for more than a prescribed amount of time (e.g., five seconds), more detailed status information may be displayed or a GUI may be available to the user. Alternatively, successive touches of the same button within a predetermined period of time may cause different types of information to be displayed such as the button functionality followed by a GUI. Tactile or acoustic feedback may also be provided following an initial touch with a display of the same or more detailed information following a second touch in a predetermined time period or after touching has been detected for a prescribed time period.","In responsive to detection of a user in contact with or proximate to an input device or auxiliary control of the device, the on-screen display of a display widget may occur instantaneously. Frequently, it may be desirable to delay the appearance of the display widget on the screen slightly so that if a user activates, rather than merely touches, the control or device to activate a function, for example, the display widget will not rapidly appear and disappear from the screen. Delaying the appearance of the display widget a predefined amount of time can prevent unnecessarily displaying of a display widget with tool tip information for example, to a user who is familiar with the active application and the operation of an input device and its auxiliary controls and who rapidly activates the device or its control (e.g., depresses a button) to activate a function. Several illustrative techniques according to the invention are described below that address controlling the display.","In one embodiment of the invention, a brief time period on the order of 0.3 seconds may be employed. In this instance, if a user makes contact with, but does not activate, a key or other control within the brief time period, then the on-screen display appears. If the user activates the control before the expiration of the brief time period, the on-screen display would not be displayed in response to the user contacting the control.","According to some embodiments of the invention, activation of the control (e.g., turning a knob) causes the state of the function controlled (e.g., volume) to change and may display a GUI (e.g., volume setting) as the user changes the state (e.g., volume setting). In contrast, when touching, but not activating, the control for the entire brief period, a GUI representing the existing state (e.g., current volume) of the function may be displayed without causing the state to be changed.","Similarly, according to embodiments of the present invention, a brief time period may also be used to control disappearing or fading out of the on-screen display when a user ceases contact with a control. In this instance, the on-screen display remains visible during the brief time period, at the expiration of which the on-screen display disappears or fades out. If the user again touches the control before the brief time period expires, the on-screen display remains visible. It should be understood that the same type of time periods may be applied in embodiments of the present invention in which detecting contact of a control by a user causes a display widget to be dismissed (i.e., disappear or fade-out) and ceasing contact of the control causes the display widget to reappear or fade-in.","According to illustrative embodiments of the invention, when a display widget including a tool tip or other information appears, schemes for such display can be based on a number of criteria including the control, timeout and other information such as mouse movement.  graphically depict three illustrative alternatives as to the timing and conditions involved with a touch sensitive mouse that causes a display widget such as a tool tip to appear on a display screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":"FIG. 35A"},"According to the timing diagram shown in  of an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the button tool tip is not displayed when the user is touching the button (not activating) and moving the mouse. If the user continues to contact the button and stops moving the mouse for the time-out period (\u0394t), the button tip is displayed. As in , the tool tip remains visible until the user releases contact with the button.","In the timing diagram depicted in , if, when the user touches the button and the mouse is still, the user continues to touch the button and not move the mouse for the time-out period (\u0394t), the tool tip is displayed. As in , the tool tip remains visible until the user releases contact with the button.","Another aspect of display schemes for the touch sensitive input control display involves the response of a tool tip or other display widget to user activation of the button or other input control. After the user activates the control, the user may no longer desire the feedback (of the resulting action or otherwise). For example, at the time that a user clicks a button (button down event), the button tool tip can instantly disappear (or fade out). Also, the button tool tip may reappear or stay hidden after a button up event occurs if the user maintains contact with the button. The computer system can also display visual feedback to associate the button click with the information displayed in the tool tip before the tool tip disappears. According to an illustrative embodiment as depicted by the timing diagram shown in , after a button down event caused by a button click, the button tool tip will not reappear until a user releases the button and again touches, but does not activate, the button for time period \u0394t. Stated differently, following activation of a button, the button tool tip will not be displayed until after the next rising edge of the button touch sensor as shown in . According to another embodiment of the present invention depicted by the timing diagram in , after a button down event followed by a button up event, the button tool tip reappears after the time-out \u0394t as long as the user continues to maintain contact with the button.","Other embodiments of the invention involve handling simultaneous contact with multiple controls on an input device. If a user touches one control while maintaining contact with a second control, the on-screen display or other feedback for the second control should be generated. Alternatively, certain functions can be defined by a combination of controls, for example, key combinations. In this instance, the tool tip of the combination (e.g., key combination) is displayed when both keys are simultaneously touched but not activated, which will override the tool tip, if any, associated with the first key contacted. If the user releases one of the controls, the on-screen display may be dismissed in its entirety, or the feedback for the other touched control can be reinstated.","In another embodiment of the present invention, once the on-screen display in the form of a GUI has appeared or faded in, the GUI may remain visible if the cursor or pointer (e.g., by movement of a mouse) has been located therein, even if the user ceases contact of the control (e.g., button of a touch sensitive mouse) that caused the display of the GUI. In this instance, the GUI may eventually disappear in response to movement of the cursor (e.g., movement of a mouse) outside of the GUI, activation of another control or after a predefined period (e.g., 5 seconds) of inactivity in which no input is received by computer such as movement of a mouse.","According to illustrative embodiments of the invention, an on-screen display may be faded-in and out using an animated transition. It should be understood that techniques for controlling appearance and disappearance of an on-screen display may be used alone or in combination. An embodiment of the invention providing animated transition is described below with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"figref":["FIG. 37","FIG. 37"],"b":["900","20","36","35","48","47","46","43","36","910","915","920","922","924","926","35","60","940"]},"The touch outputs provided by input devices  can be applied, as represented by leads  and , respectively, to input interfaces . These interfaces can produce separate signals reflective of whether contact is then being sensed or not by the contact sensor of each touch sensitive component (e.g., auxiliary control) of each input device. These signals may be routed, as represented by lead , to input device drivers  that form a component within operating system . The device drivers interpret the signals produced by the input devices and, in response, generate appropriate events. With respect to touch, these events can specify the particular input device and the state of the corresponding touch sensor, e.g., whether hand contact is detected. These events can be passed by operating system  to application  and, ultimately within the application, to GUI process . Within this process, the events are processed by fade-in\/fade-out animation process . The animation process, in response to the occurrence of a state transition of each input device, i.e., whether that device has just started sensing hand contact or has just ceased sensing such contact, and whether a display widget (e.g., Tool Glass or toolbar(s)) is then being displayed or not, will generate a predefined animation sequence to either controllably fade-in or fade-out the display widget.","Bitmap generator  stores predefined patterns ,  and , typically texture maps, for the various display widgets, including the Tool Glass sheet, predefined toolbar(s) and\/or other display widgets, respectively. These patterns are typically stored as separate files within the application. As application program  is invoked, the application, during initialization or after any change to the widget, downloads these patterns to Graphics API  via line  which, in turn, may route these patterns to a graphics accelerator (not shown) for local storage therein as texture maps. Alternatively, this downloading may be managed by a service provided by operating system .","During subsequent display, the accelerator will read these maps from its local store, polygonally fill these maps as appropriate, and render resulting filled patterns on display . Once these maps have been downloaded, then, for either a controlled fade-in\/fade-out operation, animation process  changes an alpha-transparency value at which the graphics accelerator will render a corresponding filled pattern for a display widget. For a toolbar, the alpha-transparency value is varied across a full range of transparency values (i.e., between approximately 0 \u03b1 and 1.0 \u03b1, on a linear scale of 0-1 \u03b1 where 0 \u03b1 is fully transparent and 1.0 \u03b1 is fully opaque). For a Tool Glass sheet, the alpha-transparency value is varied across a range of typically 0 \u03b1 to approximately 0.7 \u03b1, such that, even with the Tool Glass sheet rendered at its maximum opacity, underlying document objects are still visible (which some obscuration) through the sheet.","In essence, for a fade-in or fade-out operation, animation process  will issue a series of instructions over a predefined interval of time, specifically one such instruction for each different display frame, to successively change the alpha-transparency value with which a particular display widget is to then be displayed. These instructions will be issued, as also represented by line , to operating system , which, in turn, will pass these instructions to Graphics API  and ultimately to a graphics accelerator.","Fade-in should occur over a relatively short interval of time, such as on the order of approximately 0.3 to 0.5 seconds. However, so as not to distract a user, fade-out should occur over a relatively long interval, such as on the order of approximately 0.7-1.0 seconds. During these intervals, particularly on fade-in, the alpha-transparency values are generally varied in a non-linear fashion. Empirically, to utilize a conventional slow-in\/slow-out technique commonly used in screen animation has been chosen. With this technique, the opacity initially changes rather slowly from being substantially, if not, totally transparent (i.e., essentially invisible) to an intermediate value, then increases rather quickly to another intermediate value with further increases then slowing once again until a maximum opacity (either, e.g., 1 \u03b1 or 0.7 \u03b1 for a toolbar or Tool Glass sheet, respectively) is eventually reached. This results in an approximately \u201cS\u201d shaped curve for opacity as a function of time. The same transparency variations are used for fading-out a display widget (though in a reverse direction). Clearly, other time-based opacity functions, such as a linear function, can be used to vary the opacity during the fade-in and fade-out intervals. Ultimately, the particular function(s) chosen (with possibly a different function being used for fade-in versus fade-out and, in fact, different such functions can be used for different display widgets, if desired) will likely be empirically determined through appropriate user testing.","Furthermore, a human eye exhibits increased sensitivity to certain colors, such as, e.g., red tones, over others, such as blue tones, for a common luminance. Hence, fading-in a display widget that contains any of the former colors, even at relatively low luminance, could be potentially distracting and more so particularly as these colors become brighter. To avoid such distraction, the display widget could be represented by several different texture maps of different or varying coloration and luminance\u2014particularly for color(s) to which the human eye is most sensitive\u2014until a final map with desired coloration and luminance is displayed. In that regard, a monochrome texture map for this widget could be initially displayed, with texture maps for the same widget but having desired coloration with increasing luminance (or even different coloration for that matter) then being rendered at appropriate times during fade-in, until at the end of the fade-in period, a texture map having a final coloration and luminance is rendered. Fade-out could be accomplished in a similar, though reverse fashion. For example, a display widget could fade-out using a succession of colored texture maps, of decreasing luminance, to a monochrome map which itself then fades out to total transparency, or, at the inception of fade-out, change to a monochrome map of the widget and from there fade-out to total transparency.","If a graphics accelerator is not used, then, as symbolized by line , Graphics API  can provide graphics output directly to video adapter  (specifically a standard video card, not shown, therein), which, in turn, will generate appropriate video signals and apply those signals to display . In this instance, the computer system would need to be sufficiently fast to implement the appropriate graphics capabilities, that would have been provided by the graphics accelerator, in software. Furthermore, where fade-in and fade-out graphics capabilities are not supported, the display and dismissal of display widgets could occur through other visual techniques. These techniques include, e.g., simply translating the widget by sliding or shuffling it onto the screen from an off-screen position; instantly and completely displaying or dismissing the widget; rotating the widget (if, e.g., a toolbar is on a 3-D surface that rotates into place) and\/or zooming in or out interface widgets or portions of a document. However, with these techniques, the display widgets such as the toolbars and the Tool Glass sheet are constrained to being displayed fully opaque. Any of these techniques could also be used along with fading with a graphics accelerator that supports alpha-transparency.","Although alpha-transparency capability is supported by a wide variety of currently existing graphics accelerators, this capability can be readily simulated in software, in a well-known manner, by conventional 2-D (two-dimensional) or 3-D (three-dimensional) graphics APIs, such as D3D (which is a 3-D graphics API currently produced by Microsoft Corporation as a standard component of a WINDOWS\u00ae operating system), OpenGL (which is currently available in the art) or GDI (which historically is only a 2-D low-level graphics processing layer currently produced by Microsoft Corporation and also incorporated as a standard component of a WINDOWS\u00ae operating system).","Instances can arise where a display screen is to simultaneously show both a toolbar(s) and a Tool Glass sheet (or other combinations of display widgets). In these instances, unwanted interactions can arise that would cause both widgets to fade-in or out. To prevent these interactions and attendant user frustration, an appropriate decision process, well within the skill in the art, would be incorporated into animation process  to then permit only one, rather than both, of these display widgets to fade-in or out. For example, if both widgets were being displayed but a user is then manipulating the Touch Mouse, then only the Tool Glass would be permitted to fade-out while the toolbars remained fully displayed. The specific decision process would be governed by the particular widgets that could be simultaneously displayed, a need to continue displaying one or more these widgets based on a current contextual setting of the application including an operation then being performed, and relative display prioritization among these widgets.","It should be understood that the present invention may employ other sensing technologies, apart from touch sensing, to invoke on-demand action, such as, e.g.: galvanic skin response, non-contact proximity sensors, pressure sensors, events from touch\/proximity sensors on a keyboard, data from a GPS (global positioning system) receiver (position of the user or location of a mobile computer), video data from a camera, and audio data from a microphone.","While particular embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto since modifications may be made by persons skilled in the art. The present application contemplates any and all modifications that fall within the spirit and scope of the underlying invention disclosed and claimed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A-9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 11A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A and 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A-13D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A-14D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 18A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 18B and 18C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 29A and 29B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 30A and 30B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIGS. 35A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIGS. 36A and 36B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 37","b":["900","20"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
