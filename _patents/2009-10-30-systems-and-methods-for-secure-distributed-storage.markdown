title: Systems and methods for secure distributed storage
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for secure distributed storage. In aspects, a set of remote storage hosts, such as personal computers, servers, media devices, cell phones, or others, can subscribe or register to provide storage via a cloud-based or other distributed network. Source data from an originating computer, such as a data file, can be decomposed into data storage subunits, each of which is encrypted via a cloud management system or other logic or control. The data storage subunits can comprise data blocks or even or uneven size. The set of encrypted data storage subunits can be registered to a table or other record, and disseminated to the remote storage hosts. In the event of data loss at the originating computer or at other times, the remotely stored data storage subunits can be extracted, decrypted, and reassembled to reconstruct the original source data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND"],"p":["The present teachings relate to systems and methods for secure distributed storage, and more particularly to platforms and techniques for receiving data for storage in a cloud-based or other distributed network, in which remote client machines supporting the cloud-based or other network can receive pieces of files or other data objects in secure format from a source machine, store that data locally, and transmit that data back to the original source machine for backup, data reconstruction, or other purposes.","Platforms for redundant data storage are known. For instance, storage such as RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) servers, disaster recovery storage sites, and other storage or services are available which create and store an image of a file, disk or other storage object to permit a user to access and recover data when original or source data becomes compromised or unavailable, such as, for example, a transaction server with an associated database crashes, or other events occur.","In other regards, cloud-based computing networks have become more prevalent for purposes of deploying virtual machines, networks, storage, and other resources or services. It may be possible to generate data storage or data backup using existing cloud-based network infrastructures. However, existing cloud-based or other distributed networks may not permit a user wishing to perform data backups and\/or data recovery to break the data being backed up into smaller storage subunits, and disseminate those data fragments to various remote storage hosts in a cloud-based or otherwise distributed network. Existing data backup platforms likewise may not permit distributed storage to a set of diverse hosts on a secure basis. It may be desirable to provide systems and methods for secure distributed storage, in which a file or other data object can be decomposed into small storage subunits, encrypted or otherwise secured, and distributed to cloud-based or other remote storage hosts, for data recovery or other purposes.","Embodiments of systems and methods for secure distributed storage described herein can be implemented in, or supported by, a cloud network architecture. As used herein, a \u201ccloud\u201d can comprise a collection of resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource for a limited or defined duration. As shown for example in , the collection of resources supporting a cloud  can comprise a set of resource servers  configured to deliver computing components needed to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource. For example, one group of resource servers can host and serve an operating system or components thereof to deliver to and instantiate a virtual machine. Another group of resource servers can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time, to supply a defined level of processing power for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers can host and serve applications to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine, such as an email client, a browser application, a messaging application, or other applications or software. Other types of resource servers are possible.","In embodiments, the entire set of resource servers  or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud  along with its instantiated virtual machines is managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, and network tools that communicate via network  such as the Internet or other public or private network with all sets of resource servers to manage the cloud  and its operation. To instantiate a new set of virtual machines, a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system  for the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud . The request can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, process, or other resource being requested. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of resources necessary to instantiate that machine or resource. In embodiments, the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can for example comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated machine or process is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, or other increment of time. In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance, a user could request resources until a software update is completed. The user's instantiation request can specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example, the request can specify an amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments, the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for their application. Other parameters and settings can be used. One skilled in the art will realize that the user's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters, and others.","When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build that machine or resource have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more set of resource servers  to locate resources to supply the required components. The cloud management system  can select providers from the diverse set of resource servers  to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the set of resource servers  available to the cloud management system , since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware, software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example, other software services that are provided outside of the cloud  and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the cloud , either on an on-demand or subscribed or decided basis.","With the resource requirements identified, the cloud management system  can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic or on-demand basis. For example, one set of resource servers  may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further set of resource servers  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis. In other embodiments, the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example, a set of resource servers  may respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours.","The cloud management system  can select group of servers in the set of resource servers  that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the virtual machine or other resource. The cloud management system  can then coordinate the integration of the completed group of servers from the set of resource servers , to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system  can track the combined group of servers selected from the set of resource servers , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population or other resources.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can generate a resource aggregation table that identifies the various sets of resource servers that will be used to supply the components of the virtual machine or process. The sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet protocol (IP) addresses or other addresses. The cloud management system  can register the finalized group of servers in the set resource servers  contributing to an instantiated machine or process.","The cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines, processes, or other resources to be delivered from the cloud. The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in set of resource servers . The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each participating server in set of resource servers  indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various sets of resource servers may confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, or applications or other software prepared to be served.","As shown for example in , the cloud management system  can then instantiate one or more than one set of virtual machines , or other processes based on the resources supplied by the registered set of resource servers . In embodiments, the cloud management system  can instantiate a given number, for example, 10, 500, 1000, or other numbers of virtual machines to be made available to users on a network , such as the Internet or other public or private network. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table, or other record or image of the instantiated population. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store the duration of each virtual machine and the collection of resources utilized by the complete set of instantiated virtual machines .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track and manage a user's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources. Each user that populates a set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that a user can perform, such as provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources, configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications, submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host, manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources, and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system  can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the services consumed by the user. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can for example meter the usage and\/or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines , to generate subscription billing records for a user that has launched those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine to be made available to users of the network  via a browser interface, or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine can communicate with the cloud management system  and the underlying registered set of resource servers  via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud  or between clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines  from a client or terminal, the processing, memory, communications, storage, and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the cloud . In embodiments, the set of virtual machines  or other resources may not depend on or require the user's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines  on a logical level, the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The user's set of instantiated machines , processes, or other resources can be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the various sets of resource servers that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support a set of instantiated virtual machines  or processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant, since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.","In terms of network management of the set of virtual machines  that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the cloud management system  can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of a given cloud can , for example, install or terminate applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system  can monitor operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines, and for instance terminate the infected application or virtual machine. The cloud management system  can likewise manage an entire set of instantiated clients  or other resources on a collective basis, for instance, to push or delivery a software upgrade to all active virtual machines. Other management processes are possible.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same, overlapping or successive times. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers , with populations of different instantiated virtual machines  such as may be requested by different users. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in a cloud  hosting multiple sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the main cloud . The cloud management system  of a cloud can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual workloads\/processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud. The subdivision of the cloud  into distinct transient sub-clouds or other sub-components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple user scenario, each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the overall cloud system. In further embodiments, sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, and as also shown in , the set of instantiated virtual machines  generated in a first cloud  can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes generated in a second, third or further cloud . The cloud management system  of a first cloud  can interface with the cloud management system  of a second cloud , to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or virtual machines or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system  of a given cloud  can track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud, as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person, customer, subscriber, administrator, corporation, organization, or other entity. In embodiments, the user can be or include another virtual machine, application or process. In further embodiments, multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["212","204","212","212","204","216","212","102","204","210","106","102","210","104","102","210","210"]},"In embodiments as shown, when data storage and\/or backup operations are desired, source system  can transmit one or more source data object  to cloud management system  or other management logic. In embodiments, source system  can host a storage engine , which can comprise software and\/or logic to access source data object , and transmit that object to cloud management system  via one or more networks , for instance using TCP\/IP (transfer control protocol\/Internet protocol) or other formats or connections. Cloud management system  or other logic can receive source data object , and divide, partition, or otherwise decompose source data object  into a set of data storage subunits . Set of storage subunits  can, for instance, be or include files, datagrams, or other data objects of comparatively small size for distribution to remote cloud-based or distributed hosts. In embodiments, set of data storage subunits  can be of equal size, or unequal size, for instance, to accommodate available storage in different hosts.","Could management system  can encrypt or otherwise secure set of data storage subunits , for instance, using an encryption engine  to apply public\/private key security or infrastructure to those data pieces. When secured, cloud management system  can transmit one or more data units in set of data storage subunits  to corresponding hosts in set of remote storage hosts , such as remote personal computers, laptops, workstations, media playback devices, or other storage resources. In embodiments, set of remote storage hosts  can subscribe and participate in cloud  to offer hard disk, electronic, optical or other storage resources via cloud management system , using resource-sharing mechanisms described herein. In embodiments, it will also be noted that set of remote storage hosts  can also or instead contribute hard disk, electronic, optical or other storage via other logic, such as a network management server, or on a peer-to-peer or other basis.","Source data object  can thereby be accessed, decomposed, secured and distributed to set of remote storage hosts  for data backup, recovery, mirroring, and\/or other purposes. In aspects, cloud management system  can record the assignment of individual data subunits to recipient hosts, for instance in a lookup table or other record. Upon the occurrence of a data recovery event or at other times, source system  can request the retrieval and reconstruction of source data object  via cloud management system  or other logic. For example, source system  can detect data corruption or data loss in its copy of source data object , for instance on an incorporated hard disk. Source system  can then transmit a data recovery request or command to cloud management system  or other destination. In response, cloud management system  or other logic can access and retrieve set of data storage subunits  from set of remote storage hosts  via one or more networks , and\/or other channels. After collecting set of data storage subunits from those hosts, cloud management system  or other logic can decrypt set of data storage subunits , and reconstruct source data object  from those constituent data pieces. After reassembly, cloud management system  can transmit the recovered source data object  to source system  and\/or other desired destination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["204","210","106","204","130","132","136","136","130","138","130","134","106","130","138","128","102","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","504","212","204","204","506","212","104","216","204","508","212","104","510","104","212","202","212"]},"In , cloud management system  and\/or other logic can encrypt or otherwise secure set of data storage subunits , for instance using encryption engine  to generate public\/private key pairs, and\/or using an authentication or certificate authority, as understood by persons skilled in the art.

In , cloud management system  and\/or other management logic can assign each data storage subunit in set of data storage subunits  to one or more hosts in set of remote storage hosts , and can store those assignments to storage management store  or other data store. In embodiments, the assignment or association of a data storage subunit to one or more host can be stored in a table, tree, and\/or other record or format.","In , access to the set of data storage subunits  can be initiated based on a recovery event, and\/or other conditions.
