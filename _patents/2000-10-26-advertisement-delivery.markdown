title: Advertisement delivery
abstract: Advertisement delivery capable of providing data to satisfy advertising requests for displaying information to a user accessing an online computer system, generally includes using a first server that is structured and arranged to deliver advertisements to a first region of a display, and a second server that is structured and arranged to deliver advertisements to a second region of a display that is different from the first region. Advertisement delivery may also include a display server that sends input based on demographic data to the servers, where the display server receives instructions from at least one of the first and second servers based on the region controlled by the server, and a configuration system that generates and sends a first configuration file to the first server and a second configuration file to the second server, where the first configuration file includes instructions for displaying advertisements to the first region, and the second configuration file includes instructions for displaying advertisements to the second region.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/161,358, filed Oct. 26, 1999, which is incorporated by reference, and from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/170,367, filed Dec. 13, 1999, which also is incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to advertisement delivery, and more particularly to coordinating delivery of advertisements being presented on an online platform.","The Internet has become an increasingly important platform for advertising. On the Internet, advertisements are typically displayed as combinations of images and text displayed in a specified region of a user's browser window. As in many other forms of mass media, the advertising host (e.g., an online service provider or web site owner) is able to derive income by enabling advertising. Advertising hosts are therefore motivated by profit to attract advertisers.","In the Internet context, advertising income is sometimes used by hosts to offset the costs associated with providing content and\/or services to users, enabling those hosts to provide content and\/or services for free or at a low cost to users. Low cost or free content and service may result in increased usage and corresponding increases in the circulation of the advertisements. Increased circulation makes Internet advertising increasingly effective and valuable for the advertiser.","A metric used in the advertising business is an \u201cimpression,\u201d which is defined as a single display of a given advertisement in a manner perceivable to an observer. A metric used in the online advertising business space is \u201cscreen real estate,\u201d which is the area on a web page, defined by parameters such as size and location, that may be used to display different items, such as advertisements, to create impressions. The term \u201cad space\u201d is used to refer to the \u201cscreen real estate\u201d that is devoted to advertising. A web page may include multiple ad spaces. Each ad space on each web page may be identified by a unique identifier, such as a number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["1200","1202","1204","1204","1200","1204","1204","1204"]},"Advertisers frequently try to \u201ctarget\u201d advertisements to specific demographic groups that are likely to respond favorably to the advertisement (e.g., buy the product being advertised). Typically, a favored method of targeted marketing involves determining whether a given audience includes good candidates for a given advertisement based on demographic data, such as age, gender, profession, and income level.","Another factor typically used in deciding which advertisements should be employed is adherence to a set of advertisement presentation guidelines known as \u201cbusiness rules.\u201d Business rules are designed to increase the likelihood that a user will be exposed to a given advertisement at a desired frequency and in conditions that are conducive to responding to the ad. For example, business rules might be used to ensure not only a minimal exposure level but also a maximum exposure level because overexposure can be detrimental to the effectiveness of the advertisement. An example of a business rule could be the following: \u201cAdvertisement X will be displayed to a user no less than once and no more than three times in any 24-hour period.\u201d","\u201cAd inventory\u201d is a set of advertisements available for a given ad space. For example, if a specific ad space is located on a web page discussing personal computer devices, then advertisers for computer equipment, consumer electronics devices, and long-distance telephone service might all provide a set of advertisements to be displayed to this audience. Thus, in this example, the ad inventory on a personal computing web page might includes at least three different types of advertisements from three separate advertisers.","The objective of the advertiser is to maximize the exposure of the product or service being advertised to the desired audiences, given the cost constraints of the advertiser's budget (i.e., how much the advertiser can afford to pay to the advertising host in return for displaying the advertisements). Toward this end, the advertiser often will provide requirements to the advertising host. For example, an advertiser may require that an advertisement be displayed only at specific times of day, or only at specific positions on the computer screens of the users. The advertiser also may require that its advertisements be displayed a minimum number of times within a defined time period, thus generating a desired number of impressions. Typically, an advertiser purchases a specific number of impressions, for example, in quantities of one thousand, so that their advertisement is displayed in a specific ad space that number of times over a given time period.","There are several criteria pertaining to advertising that affect the price of advertisement (i.e., how much revenue is generated by the advertising host in return for its display of a given advertisement) and the satisfaction of the client. These may include: 1) the size of the advertisement; 2) the placement of the advertisement within the screen; 3) the number of times the advertisement is displayed; and 4) the time(s) of day that the advertisement is displayed. These criteria must be taken into account by the advertising host.","Advertising hosts have used both demographic data and business rules to help make their services and\/or sites attractive to advertisers. This is primarily accomplished through the use of relational databases that store demographic data and advertising usage statistics. Advertising hosts typically use software to run various algorithms and queries to determine which advertisements should be displayed based on the demographic data and advertising usage statistics stored in the databases.","Historically, it has been necessary to continuously update the basic technology used to drive a relational database to account for increases in database size, a necessary incident to increases in the usage of online services and the Internet. Furthermore, the sheer size of the databases has made their use cumbersome and inefficient.","More recent systems for coordinating advertisement configurations and business rules for advertising purposes have generally used large relational databases that are accessed by servers, hereinafter referred to as ad display servers. A typical procedure entails the compilation of a large data file called a configuration file, which is uploaded into the ad display server on a periodic basis (perhaps daily). This file contains all the pertinent information needed for delivery of advertisements for the next period (i.e., until a new configuration file would be generated and uploaded). This information typically includes all of the new advertisements (any advertisements which previously had been displayed would already be present within the relational database), configuration information needed to display the advertisement in the correct ad space, statistical data from the previous period impacting the application of the business rules (e.g., how many times was some specific impression shown the previous day), and updates to demographic data (e.g., data about new subscribers).","In one aspect, generally, advertisement delivery capable of providing data to satisfy advertising requests for displaying information to a user accessing an online computer system, includes using a first server that is structured and arranged to deliver advertisements to a first region of a display, and a second server that is structured and arranged to deliver advertisements to a second region of the display, that differs from the first region.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the first region of the display and the second region of the display may overlap. Alternatively, the first region of the display and the second region of the display may be mutually exclusive.","The first server may receive a first configuration file that includes instructions for displaying advertisements within the first region and the second server may receive a second configuration file that includes instructions for displaying advertisements within the second region, where the first configuration file may be the same as or may be different from the second configuration file.","Advertisement delivery may also include a display server that sends information having associated demographic data to the first server, where the first server determines which of several available advertisements to display in the first region based on the demographic data. Generally, the display server receives instructions from the first server based on the demographic data.","Advertisement delivery may also include a configuration system that generates a first configuration file that includes instructions for directing the first server to display advertisements within the first region, and a second configuration file that includes instructions directing the second server to display advertisements within the second region, where the second configuration file may be the same as or may be different from the first configuration file.","The first server may be structured and arranged to deliver advertisements only to the first region of the display, and the second server may be structured and arranged to deliver advertisements only to the second region of the display. The configuration system may generate a first configuration file that only includes instructions for directing the first server to display advertisements within the first region, and a second configuration file that only includes instructions for directing the second server to display advertisements within the second region. Typically, the configuration system generates the first and second configuration files based on output received from the first and second servers, and updates preexisting configuration files resident on the first and second servers with the first and second configuration files, respectively.","Advertisement delivery may further include a demographics server that extracts from an electronic data store demographic data corresponding to the user of the online computer system and that enables generation of display to the user based on the demographic data extracted.","These general and specific aspects may be implemented using a system or method or combination of system and method.","Aspects of advertisement delivery described above may be beneficial in addressing at least three difficulties with current advertisement delivery. The first two difficulties result from the increasingly large number of online service subscribers, namely 1) a relatively large number of ad display servers are required, and 2) an extremely large size is typically required for each configuration file. While the number of online service subscribers and hence the number of ad display servers is relatively small, the coordination of demographic data and business rules can be coordinated with relative ease. However, the complexity of coordination increases exponentially as the number of online service subscribers and ad display servers increases. Furthermore, with an increase in the amount of online content available, the size of each configuration file also increases. An increase in the size of each configuration file results in increased communication burdens on ad display servers, leading to a compromise in the availability of the ad display servers to provide advertising. This problem may be exacerbated when the servers are independent such that the entire configuration file is uploaded to each server, rendering the ad display servers unavailable for increasingly long periods of time as the configuration file sizes are increased. As a consequence of the resulting ad display server unavailability, potential revenues for the online service provider are lost and the user's experience is degraded.","A third difficulty results from the need for periodic updates to the configuration files of independent ad display servers. Because the servers are independent of one another, the overall system cannot react instantaneously to problems which occur, some of which require a quick remedy in order to deliver properly the advertisements. Rather, the overall system must wait until the updated configuration file is uploaded. This tends to impact revenues directly.","Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description, including the drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings may indicate like elements.","For illustrative purposes,  describe a communications system for implementing techniques for transferring files between subscribers of a host complex. For brevity, several elements in the figures described below are represented as monolithic entities. However, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, these elements each may include numerous interconnected computers and components designed to perform a set of specified operations and\/or dedicated to a particular geographical region.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging data between a client system  and a host system  through a communications link . The client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and\/or client controllers , and the host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and\/or host controllers . For example, the client system  or the host system  may include one or more general-purpose computers (e.g., personal computers), one or more special-purpose computers (e.g., devices specifically programmed to communicate with each other and\/or the client system  or the host system ), or a combination of one or more general-purpose computers and one or more special-purpose computers. The client system  and the host system  may be arranged to operate within or in concert with one or more other systems, such as, for example, one or more LANs (\u201cLocal Area Networks\u201d) and\/or one or more WANs (\u201cWide Area Networks\u201d).","The client device  (or the host controller ) is generally capable of executing instructions under the command of a client controller  (or a host controller ). The client device  (or the host device ) is connected to the client controller  (or the host controller ) by a wired or wireless data pathway  or  capable of delivering data.","The client device , the client controller , the host device , and the host controller  each typically includes one or more hardware components and\/or software components. An example of a client device  or a host device  is a general-purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer) capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner. Other examples include a special-purpose computer, a workstation, a server, a device, a component, other physical or virtual equipment or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions.","An example of client controller  or a host controller  is a software application loaded on the client device  or the host device  for commanding and directing communications enabled by the client device  or the host device . Other examples include a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the client device  or the host device  to interact and operate as described. The client controller  and the host controller  may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to the client device  or the host device .","The communications link  typically includes a delivery network  making a direct or indirect communication between the client system  and the host system , irrespective of physical separation. Examples of a delivery network  include the Internet, the World Wide Web, WANs, LANs, analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, and xDSL), radio, television, cable, satellite, and\/or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  that enable communications through the one or more delivery networks  described above. Each of the communication pathways ,  may include, for example, a wired, wireless, cable or satellite communication pathway.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","210","215","205","220","225","220","210","235","240","235","215","250","255","260"]},"Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to .

Examples of application programs include authoring applications  (e.g., word processing, database programs, spreadsheet programs, and graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications  (e.g., AOL client, CompuServe client, AIM client, AOL TV client, and ISP client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications  (e.g., Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content.","The general-purpose computer  also includes a central processing unit  (CPU) for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation, the client controller  includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage  of the general-purpose computer . In another implementation, the client controller  includes application programs externally stored in and executed by one or more device(s) external to the general-purpose computer .","The general-purpose computer typically will include a communication device  for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device  is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver, a set-top box, a communication card, a satellite dish, an antenna, or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link  through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general-purpose computer  also may include a TV (\u201ctelevision\u201d) tuner  for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast, satellite, and\/or cable TV signals. As a result, the client device  can selectively and\/or simultaneously display network content received by communications device  and television programming content received by the TV tuner .","The general-purpose computer  typically will include an input\/output interface  to enable a wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices  include, but are not limited to, a mouse , a mobile phone , a personal digital assistant  (PDA), a keyboard , a display monitor  with or without a touch screen input, and\/or a TV remote control  for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers. Other examples may include voice recognition and synthesis devices.","Although  illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone , a PDA , and a TV remote control  as being peripheral to the general-purpose computer , in another implementation, such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general-purpose computer  and operate as the client device . For example, the mobile phone  or the PDA  may include computing and networking capabilities, and may function as a client device  by accessing the delivery network  and communicating with the host system . Furthermore, the client system  may include one, some or all of the components and devices described above.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices .

The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system  and other elements of the host device . The host device  also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP (\u201cOnline Service Provider\u201d) host complex  and IM (\u201cInstant Messaging\u201d) host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers, the client system  may include communication software, for example, an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber's interactions with the respective services and, in particular, may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes. For example, Instant Messaging allows a subscriber to use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","Typically, the OSP host complex  supports different services, such as email, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other, certain protocols (i.e., standards, formats, conventions, rules, and structures) being employed to enable the transfer of data. The OSP host complex  ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex  may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common, underlying proprietary protocol.","The IM host complex  is generally independent of the OSP host complex , and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber's network or Internet access. Thus, the IM host complex  allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages, whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex  may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex  has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data, the IM host complex  employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.","The host device  may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes, such as the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex  gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex  with the IM host complex  through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily, when used to facilitate a link between complexes, the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  are privy to information regarding a protocol anticipated by a destination complex, which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance, the OSP host complex  and IM host complex  may use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway  and\/or the IM host complex gateway .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices .

The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex  using OSP protocols that may or may not be exclusive or proprietary. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an IM client application and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with the IM host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . In other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications between client systems  and various elements of the host system , including elements such as OSP host complex  and IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to one or more of these elements.","The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are typically connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may generally perform protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between one or more of the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","The OSP host complex  supports a set of services to be accessed through and\/or performed by from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex  may communicate using the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex  may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example, servers may be arranged in large centralized clusters identified as farms  or in localized clusters identified as pods .","More specifically, farms  are groups of servers located at centralized locations within the OSP host complex . Farms  generally are dedicated to providing particular functionality and services to subscribers and clients from a centralized location, regardless of the location of the subscriber or client. Farms  are particularly useful for providing services that depend upon other remotely-located or performed processes and services for information, such as, for example, chat, email, instant messaging, news, newsgroups, search, stock updates, and weather. Thus, farms  tend to rely on connections with external resources such as the Internet  and\/or other servers within the OSP host complex .","By contrast to farms , pods  are clusters of localized servers that provide some services offered by the OSP host complex  from a location local to the service or information recipient, which reduces and avoids time delays and congestion inherent in centralized processing. Each pod  includes one or more interrelated servers capable of operating together to provide one or more services offered by the OSP host complex  in a geographically localized manner, with the servers of a pod  generally operating independently of resources external to the pod . A pod  may cache content received from external sources, such as farms  or the Internet , making frequently requested information readily available to the local service or information recipients served by the pod . In this way, pods  are particularly useful in providing services that are independent of other processes and servers such as, for example, routing to other localized resources or recipients, providing access to keywords and geographically specific content, providing access to routinely accessed information, and downloading certain software and graphical interface updates with reduced processing time and congestion. The determination of which servers and processes are located in the pod  is made by the OSP according to load distribution, frequency of requests, demographics, and other factors.","In addition to farms  and pods , the implementation of  also includes one or more non-podded and non-farmed servers . In general, the servers  may be dedicated to performing a particular service or information that relies on other processes and services for information and may be directly or indirectly connected to resources outside of the OSP host complex , such as the Internet  and the IM host complex , through an OSP gateway  within OSP host complex gateway . In the event that subscriber usage of a particular service or information of the servers  becomes relatively high, those servers  may be integrated into a farm or pod, as appropriate.","In the implementation of , one particular exemplary pod  is shown in more detail. Pod  includes a routing processor . In a packet-based implementation, the client system  may generate information requests, convert the requests into data packets, sequence the data packets, perform error checking and other packet-switching techniques, and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system , the routing processor  may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . In general, the routing processor  will examine an address field of a data request, use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request, and direct the data request to the appropriate destination.","For example, in the event that a data request from the client system  can be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request to a local server  in the pod . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request internally to one or more farms , one or more other pods , or one or more non-podded servers  in the OSP host complex , or the routing processor  may direct the data request externally to elements such as the IM host complex  through an OSP\/pod gateway .","The routing processor  also may direct data requests and\/or otherwise facilitate communication between the client system  and the Internet  through the OSP\/pod gateway . In one implementation, the client system  uses an OSP client application to convert standard Internet content and protocols into OSP protocols and vice versa, where necessary. For example, when a browser application transmits a request in a standard Internet protocol, the OSP client application can intercept the request, convert the request into an OSP protocol and send the converted request to the routing processor  in the OSP host complex . The routing processor  recognizes the Internet  as the destination and routes the data packets to an IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) tunnel . The IP tunnel  converts the data from the OSP protocol back into standard Internet protocol and transmits the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel  also converts the data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the data to the routing processor  for delivery back to the client system . At the client system , the OSP client application converts the data in the OSP protocol back into standard Internet content for communication with the browser application.","The IP tunnel  may act as a buffer between the client system  and the Internet , and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example, the IP tunnel  can check parental controls settings of the client system  and request and transmit content from the Internet  according to the parental control settings. In addition, the IP tunnel  may include a number a caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches, the IP tunnel  may send the information to the client system  from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .","In another implementation, the client system  may use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access pods  and the Internet . For example, the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system  to generate a request in standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). In a packet-based implementation, data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d), and routed to a web tunnel . The web tunnel  may be a L2TP (\u201cLayer Two Tunneling Protocol\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (PPP) session with the client system . The web tunnel  provides a gateway to the routing processor  within the pod , the Internet , and a web proxy .","The web proxy  can look up subscriber information from the IP address of the client system  to determine demographic information such as the subscriber's parental control settings. In this way, the web proxy  can tailor the subscriber's content and user interfaces. The web proxy  can also perform caching functions to store certain URLs (\u201cUniform Resource Locators\u201d) and other electronic content so that the web proxy  can locally deliver information to the client system  and avoid the need to access the Internet  in the event that data requested by the client system  has been cached.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link .

The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to one or more of the elements. The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","To access the IM host complex  to begin an instant messaging session, the client system  establishes a connection to the login server . The login server  typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex  by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex , the login server  employs a hashing technique on the subscriber's screen name to identify a particular IM server  for use during the subscriber's session. The login server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular IM server , gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie), and breaks the connection. The client system  then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server  through the communications link , and obtains access to that IM server  using the encrypted key. Typically, the client system  will be equipped with a winsock API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) that enables the client system  to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .","Once a connection to the IM server  has been established, the client system  may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server  and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server  supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers  may support associated services, such as, for example, administrative matters, directory services, chat and interest groups. The domain servers  can be used to lighten the load placed on the IM server  by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server  and\/or the domain server , a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","In the implementation of , IM server  is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway  facilitates the connection between the IM server  and one or more alert multiplexors . For example, routing gateway  may serve as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers  to several alert multiplexors . In general, an alert multiplexor  maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.","Once the client system  is connected to the alert multiplexor , a subscriber can register for and\/or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system  and the alert multiplexor  is determined by employing a hashing technique at the IM server  to identify the particular alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session. Once the particular multiplexor  has been identified, the IM server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor  and gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie) used to gain access to the identified multiplexor . The client system  then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor  through the communication link  and obtains access to the alert multiplexor  using the encrypted key.","The alert multiplexor  is connected to an alert gate  that, like the IM host complex gateway , is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to enable communication with the OSP host complex . The alert gate  is the interface between the IM host complex  and the physical servers, such as servers in the OSP host complex , where state changes are occurring. In general, the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . The alert multiplexor  also may communicate with the OSP host complex  through the IM gateway , for example, to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex  with certain information gathered from the alert gate .","The alert gate  can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate  may include a piece of code (alert receive code) capable of interacting with another piece of code (alert broadcast code) on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general, the alert receive code installed on the alert gate  instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate  upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Thereafter, upon detecting an alert feed, the alert gate  contacts the alert multiplexor , which in turn, informs the appropriate client system  of the detected alert feed.","In the implementation of , the IM host complex  also includes a subscriber profile server  connected to a database  for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server  may be used to enter, retrieve, edit, manipulate, or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation, a subscriber's profile data includes, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, designated stocks, identified interests, geographic location and other demographic data. The subscriber may enter, edit and\/or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system  to interact with the subscriber profile server .","Because the subscriber's data is stored in the IM host complex , the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex  using a new or different client system . Accordingly, when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex , the IM server  can instruct the subscriber profile server  to retrieve the subscriber's profile data from the database  and to provide, for example, the subscriber's buddy list to the IM server  and the subscriber's alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server  also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex  to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively, user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , ,  and  and communications links , , ,  and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and may illustrate one possible embodiment of the host systems , , ,  and  shown in .  describes several aspects of one implementation of the host system  in greater detail, focusing primarily on one particular implementation of the login server  and IM host complex .","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the IM host complex . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  utilizing exclusive IM protocols.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . In other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications between client systems  and various elements of the host system , including elements such as the IM host complex  and the OSP host complex ; login server  is also capable of authorizing access by the client system  and those elements. The IM host complex  includes an IM server network , a routing gateway , an alert multiplexor network , and one or more alert gates . The IM server network  may include an interconnected network of IM servers and the alert multiplexor network  may include an interconnected network of alert multiplexors. In the implementation of , the IM server network  and the alert multiplexor network  are interconnected by a routing gateway  that serves as a common hub to reduce the number of connections. Each IM server within IM server network  can directly or indirectly communicate and exchange information with one or more of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network . Each of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network  may be connected to several alert gates  that receive different types of alerts.","During a session, a subscriber typically will be assigned to one IM server in the IM server network  and to one alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  based on one or more hashing techniques. In one implementation, for example, each IM server in the IM server network  may be dedicated to serving a particular set of registered subscribers. Because all of the IM servers can communicate with each other, all subscribers can communicate with each other through instant messaging. However, the IM servers and the alert multiplexors are capable of storing subscriber information and other electronic content that may be accessed by the other IM servers and alert multiplexors. Thus, in another implementation, each alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  may be dedicated to storing information about a particular set or subset of alerts. Because all of the alert multiplexors can communicate with each other, all registered subscribers can receive all types of alerts. This networking arrangement enables the load to be distributed among the various servers in the IM host complex  while still enabling a subscriber to communicate, share information, or otherwise interact with other subscribers and servers in the IM host complex .","Referring to , an advertisement delivery system  includes a user , an ad display server system , ad space servers , and a configuration system . The advertisement delivery system  is suitable for use by an advertising host in a communication system such as that shown and described with respect to , with user  generally corresponding to client systems , , , , , and\/or , and other components of system  generally corresponding to elements within host systems , , , , , and\/or .","Ad display server system , ad space servers  and configuration system  may also be exemplified by one or more pods  of . Additionally or alternatively, ad display server system , ad space servers  and configuration system  may be exemplified by one or more non-podded servers, such as servers  or farms  of . Ad space servers  and other servers included as components of ad display server system  and configuration system , also may be exemplified by one or more electronic data stores (e.g., database).","Typically, a user  accesses the online platform and a request is sent to the ad display server system . The request includes identification information (e.g., an identification number) uniquely identifying the ad space which the user is viewing, and possibly also demographic data or identifying information for the user. An ad display server system  presents advertisements to the user  by displaying the advertisements on the computer screen of the user  where the displaying may include various perceivable formats (e.g., visual, audio). The ad display server system  employs a hashing technique on the ad space that the user has accessed to identify a particular ad space server  that is associated with that ad space. Based on the result of the hashing technique, the ad display server system  directs an advertising request for that ad space to the associated ad space server . The ad space server  also may receive identification data about the user  from the ad display server system  and determine which advertisements to show in that ad space based on attributes, preferences, and\/or historical information associated with that user .","Ad space servers  may also receive configuration files from a configuration system . These configuration files provide instructions to each of the ad space servers  regarding which advertisements should be displayed to users  over a given time period. The configuration system  logs data about which advertisements were shown to which ad spaces over a defined time period (e.g., the last 24 hours, the last 14 days), and then generates configuration files for each ad space using the logged data.","Referring to , ad space servers  may include a first ad space server and a second ad space server . In one embodiment, the first ad space server is structured and arranged to deliver advertisements to a first region of a display, and the second ad space server is structured and arranged to deliver advertisements to a second region of the display that differs from the first region.","The ad display server system  generally directs its output to one or more appropriate ad space servers based on the ad space to which an advertisement will be directed. Output from the ad display server system  is sent to the first ad space server if the advertisement is to be directed to an ad space controlled by the first ad space server . Similarly, output from ad display server system  is sent to the second ad space server if the advertisement is to be directed to an ad space controlled by the second ad space server . The ad display server system  may employ a hashing technique to determine which ad space server , controls the delivery of advertisements to a particular ad space.","The ad display server system  may provide demographic data as part of its advertisement request. The first ad space server and the second ad space server may use the provided demographic data to determine which advertisements to send to the ad display server system . For example, based on the advertisement request having associated demographic data sent by the ad display server system , the first ad space server determines which of several available advertisements to display in the first region of the display. Similarly, the second ad display server determines which of several advertisements to display in the second region of the display. Ultimately, these selected advertisements are communicated to the ad display server system .","The configuration system  typically generates at least one of a first configuration file that includes instructions for displaying advertisements in the ad spaces controlled by the first ad space server and a second configuration file, which may or may not differ from the first configuration file, and that includes instructions for displaying advertisements in the ad spaces controlled by the second ad space server . The first ad space server receives the first configuration file that includes the instructions for displaying advertisements within the first region, and the second ad space server receives the second configuration file that includes the instructions for displaying advertisements within the second region.","In one implementation, the first configuration file replaces the configuration file currently being used by the first ad space server , and the second configuration file replaces the configuration file currently being used by the second ad space server . In another implementation, the first configuration file modifies the configuration file being used by the first ad space server , and the second configuration file modifies the configuration file being used by the second ad space server ","Referring to , a Venn diagram  is used as merely one example to illustrate the relative orientation between several different ad spaces , , , ,  and  on a display that are each supplied advertisements by their respective ad space servers. There may or may not be limits to the number of ad spaces that can be created.","Multiple ad space servers  may be used, each being dedicated to one or more specific ad spaces. More specifically, in one implementation, each ad space server  is responsible for supplying advertisements to one particular ad space. For example, an ad space server  may be responsible for only ad space . Alternatively or additionally, in another implementation, each ad space server  may be dedicated to one or more ad spaces. As another example, an ad space server may be responsible for more than one ad space, such as ad spaces  and . Moreover the ad spaces may or may not be evenly divided across the available ad space servers. For example, one ad space server  may be devoted to serving a small number of popular ad spaces, while another ad space server  may serve a large number of infrequently visited ad spaces. This division of labor among ad space servers  enhances scalability, thereby enabling the advertisement delivery system , as a whole, to handle a large volume of advertisements, users, and configuration data while minimizing performance degradation. Because advertising on the Internet has become increasingly prevalent, dividing the advertising load across multiple ad spaces and corresponding ad space servers  helps to make the resultant high volume of ad traffic more manageable. With such a division, the advertisement delivery system  maintains its scalability, which prevents the system from becoming bogged down under heavy ad traffic.","An important effect of using more than one ad space server  is that the universe of ad spaces becomes divided into groups of manageable size. This allows the system  to generate and transfer configuration files that are small enough to download quickly and frequently, thereby facilitating smooth and continuous system operation.","Typically, overlapping ad spaces, such as ad spaces -, are served advertisements by their corresponding ad space servers at different times. For instance, ad spaces  and  generally do not receive advertisements at the same time. Rather, advertisements delivered to those overlapping ad spaces are staggered in time. Thus, if an advertisement is delivered to ad space  at time t, a different advertisement is not generally delivered to ad space  at the same time t.","However, it is possible to serve advertisements to overlapping ad spaces simultaneously. Typically, using standard HTML protocols, the intersecting section common to two overlapping ad spaces will display content corresponding to the last served advertisement. For instance, when advertisements are simultaneously served to overlapping ad spaces  and , the intersecting section between those ad spaces (see shaded section S between ad space  and ad space ) will display content corresponding to the last served advertisement, whether that advertisement is served to ad space  or ad space . Conversely, using a different protocol, the intersecting section may display content based on some criteria other than temporal ranking, or it may display content representing some amalgamation of the content served to each of the overlapping ad spaces.","Referring to , a screen shot  is shown that illustrates multiple ad spaces , , , and  that are not overlapping, but instead, are mutually exclusive of one another. In this illustration, each ad space , , , and , may correspond to different ad space servers .

To determine which advertisement to display, the ad display server  makes a request to the appropriate ad space server . The ad space server  receives periodic instructions from the configuration server . The ad display server  employs a hashing technique to determine which ad space server  controls the content for the requested ad space. For each ad space, the associated ad space server  may further decide which advertisement should be displayed based on the ad space's configuration, and the user's demographic data.","In addition to being the primary interface with users , the ad display server  interfaces with a demographics server . Demographics server  may include one or more hardware components and\/or software components, examples of which are discussed above with respect to the ad display server system .","The demographics server  is the interface between the ad display server  and a demographics database . The demographics database  includes demographic data about users . An example of a demographics database  includes a relational database or any other type of database or combination thereof.","Demographic data within demographics database  may be collected in various ways. For example, demographic data can be gathered from the users  of online services directly through the use of forms, questionnaires, and the like. For instance, when a user  accesses an online service for the first time, the online service may prompt the user  for various demographic data, such as gender, age, occupation, income level, and hobbies. Demographics may also be collected from third party sources. Regardless of how demographic data is collected, the ad display server  sends the demographic data to the demographics database  via the demographics server  for subsequent retrieval, for example, whenever that user  logs on to the online service. The ad display server  also may send this data to the ad space servers  to determine which advertisements to display to user . The ad space servers  may make this determination based on the current demographic business rules for a particular ad space.","When the ad display server  needs information about which advertisements to display to a given user , the demographics server  may be queried. The demographics server  will access and gather the necessary data from the demographics database  and respond appropriately to the ad display server .","Creative bank  is a repository of graphical images, audio files, video files, intended for use as advertisements on computer monitors or other output devices.

Various reports generated by the reporting system  summarize the information received from logger , such as the total number of advertisements displayed in an ad space over a given time period or the total number of advertisements displayed in a particular ad space that were related to a particular ad campaign run by an advertiser.","The reporting system  then passes the processed data to the predictor server  and to the advertisement reservation entry system . Predictor server  uses the processed data to forecast future ad space availability and sends the forecast information to advertisement reservation entry system . A predictor server  uses an algorithm to predict the expected number of impressions to be served each ad space over a given time period. In one implementation, the predictor server  bases the prediction on a 14 day average. For each ad space, the predictor server  uses the average of the number of impressions served over the last 14 days to predict the number of impressions that will be served for that day.","The advertisement reservation entry system  uses the processed data from the reporting system  and the predictor server  to take reservations and sell impressions for each available ad space.

For example, the fast predictor may use an algorithm that takes into account the numbers of advertisements displayed to users  on ad spaces during the most recent fourteen day period. The slow predictor may, for example, use 3 months of detailed historical data including demographic information, along with years of summarized historical data to account for seasonality and different traffic patterns, e.g., different traffic patterns on different days of the week. The slow predictor may use advanced techniques such as statistics, time series analysis, neural networks, optimization, clustering, pattern recognition, machine learning, and\/or data mining to enhance the accuracy of its output. In addition either the fast or slow predictor , may use a varying sample size of the usage information in order to simulate ad serving over a hypothetical period of time.
