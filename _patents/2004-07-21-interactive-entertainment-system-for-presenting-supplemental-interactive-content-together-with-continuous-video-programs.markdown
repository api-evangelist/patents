title: Interactive entertainment system for presenting supplemental interactive content together with continuous video programs
abstract: An interactive entertainment system enables presentation of supplemental interactive content along side traditional broadcast video programs, such as television shows and movies. The programs are broadcast in a conventional manner. The supplemental content is supplied as part of the same program signal over the broadcast network, or separately over another distribution network. A viewer computing unit is located at the viewer's home to present the program and supplemental content to a viewer. When the viewer tunes to a particular channel, the viewer computing unit consults an electronic programming guide (EPG) to determine if the present program carried on the channel is interactive. If it is, the viewer computing unit launches a browser. The browser uses a target specification stored in the EPG to activate a target resource containing the supplemental content for enhancing the broadcast program. The target resource contains display layout instructions prescribing how the supplemental content and the video content program are to appear in relation to one another when displayed. When the data from the target resource is downloaded, the viewer computing unit is responsive to the layout instructions obtained from the target resource to display the supplemental content concurrently with the video content program. Embedding the layout instructions in the supplemental content advantageously places control of the presentation to the content developers. The developers are free to arrange the data and video in any manner they choose.

No. 09\/349,638, filed Jul. 8, 1999, which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 08\/623,610 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,240,555, filed Mar. 29, 1996.","This invention relates to interactive entertainment systems, such as interactive television or interactive computing network systems. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for presenting supplemental interactive content in conjunction with continuous video programs to enable viewer interactivity with the otherwise non-interactive video programs.","Video content programs, such as TV shows and pay-per-view movies, are delivered to a viewer as a continuous data stream. Today, programs are most commonly distributed using a wireless broadcast system, or a cable system. In the first instance, the programs are broadcast over a wireless network and received at individual homes through an antenna or satellite dish. In the latter case, the programs are transmitted over cable to set-top boxes resident in the viewers' homes.","In broadcast distribution systems, there is no opportunity for interactive control of the content by the viewer. The viewer simply has an option to watch the program, change to a different program, or turn off the television. However, as consumers have learned from playing video games on their televisions, non-interactive viewing is not nearly as fun or sensory rich as interactive entertainment.","To enhance the traditional way of viewing television, there has been some effort toward the production of interactive programming content. As presently contemplated, additional interactive content is created to enhance the existing traditional program. This supplemental content is played along with the continuous video stream to enable viewers to interact with the program in a more involved manner than simply watching it. The supplemental content might, for example, ask the viewer questions about the episode, or play games with the viewer that relate to the show, or describe behind-the-scenes aspects of making the program. However, there remains a significant hurdle concerning how to create and distribute interactive programs.","Apart from the TV environment, however, computer users are familiar with interactive content on their computers. Many users own interactive multimedia CD-ROM applications that combine video, audio, pictures, text, and other content into a rich and responsive presentation. Familiar examples of interactive computer applications include games (e.g., Myst from Broderbund), educational programs (e.g., Reader Rabbit series from the Learning Company or Magic Schoolbus series from Microsoft), and home entertainment (e.g., Encarta from Microsoft).","Interactive content is also available from online services over a public network. Most notably, the Internet is emerging as a means for supplying video, sound, pictures, text, and other multimedia rich resources to a user's computer. Through the Internet, users can access a wide variety of resources that are maintained on computers located around the world.","Resources available on the Internet are most commonly presented as hypertext. \u201cHypertext,\u201d also referred to as \u201chypermedia,\u201d is a metaphor for presenting information in which text, images, sounds, and actions become linked together in a complex, non-sequential web of associations that permit a user to browse through related topics, regardless of the presented order of the topics. Hypermedia content is widely used for navigation and information dissemination on the \u201cWorld-Wide Web\u201d (WWW or Web) of the Internet. An application program referred to as a \u201cWeb browser\u201d is normally used to retrieve and render hypermedia content from the WWW.","Despite the development of interactive entertainment in the computer sector, there has been little activity spilling over into the traditional television world. The TV environment poses a problem in that the programs are typically delivered as a broadcast of a continuous data stream, which inherently does not support interactive control. Interlacing interactive content presents a difficult design issue.","One proposed solution is a technology referred to as \u201cIntercast technology\u201d which is available from the Intercast Industry Group, a consortium of leading television networks, program hardware vendors, and software vendors. The Intercast technology presents both television programs and Internet data together on the same television or computer monitor, but with separate and predefined panes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["14","14","16","18","16","17","18"]},"The Internet data is combined with the video data of the television program to form a single signal that is broadcast to the viewer. The Internet data is transmitted during the vertical blank interval (VBI) between successive frames of the video data. The Internet data and video data are separated at the viewer's computer and presented simultaneously within their respective panes.","The drawback with the Intercast technology is that it rigidly adheres to the paned presentation. The television pane  is a self-contained pane which is dedicated to showing only the video program, and the Web pane  is a separately self-contained pane which is reserved exclusively for Web content. Content providers who develop the Internet data have no control over how the television program and interactive supplemental content is presented to the viewer. They can simply control how the data is presented within its own box . Accordingly, the content providers are significantly limited in what they can create in the way of a full interactive media event.","The inventors have developed a better way of creating and distributing interactive programming that frees the content providers of these restrictions.","This invention concerns an interactive entertainment system for supplying interactive supplemental content along with continuous video content programs to viewers. The programs are supplied from a program provider, such as a cable headend or a broadcast station, over a distribution network to a viewer computing unit. The programs are continuous, non-interactive data streams, such as television shows, movies, or other video content.","The viewer computing unit is implemented as a television, a television\/set-top box unit, a personal computer, or the like. It has a processor and memory. An electronic programming guide (EPG) is stored in the memory and executable on the processor to organize programming information that is descriptive of the video content programs. The EPG maintains a data field that indicates whether the video content program is interactive. The EPG data field contains a pointer, universal resource locator, or other target specification to the target resource that supports the interactive content and correlates this data field with the particular program that the supplemental content is designed to enhance. Accordingly, if a target resource is listed in conjunction with a particular program, the program is recognized as being interactive. The supplemental content can be developed and provided by the same provider that distributes the video content program, or by an independent service provider.","When the viewer tunes to a particular channel, the viewer computing unit consults the EPG to determine if the present program is interactive. If it is, the viewer computing unit launches an interactive support module, such as an Internet browser. This browser is kept in memory and is dynamically loadable for execution on the processor when the viewer tunes to a channel carrying a video content program that the EPG identifies as interactive. The viewer computing unit also depicts a small icon or other indicia to alert the viewer that the program is interactive. The viewer can click on or otherwise activate the icon to enter the interactive mode and display the supplemental content. As an alternative, the supplemental content can be automatically displayed in response to launching the Internet browser.","The Internet browser uses the target specification in the EPG to start the target resource. The target resource contains the supplemental content to enhance the television program. The supplemental content might be, for example, questions about the program, games, trivia information, facts about the actors and producers, information on other episodes, advertisements, a listing of products or memorabilia about the program, and so on. The supplemental content and program can be transmitted together as a single signal, which is separated at the viewer computing unit, or separately over two channels or two different networks.","The target resource also contains display layout instructions prescribing how the supplemental content and the video content program are to appear in relation to one another when displayed on the television or monitor. When the data from the target resource is downloaded to the viewer computing unit, the processor is responsive to the layout instructions obtained from the target resource to display the supplemental content concurrently with the video content program.","Embedding the layout instructions in the supplemental content advantageously returns control of the presentation to the content developers. The developers can now arrange the data and video in any manner they choose. The developers are not restricted to specific fixed panes, as in the prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","22"]},"Each subscriber has a viewer computing unit . In the illustrated implementation, the viewer computing unit is embodied as a set-top box (STB)  coupled to a television (TV) . The STB  receives digital video signals from headend  and controls which programs are displayed on the TV . The STB  is controlled by the viewer through use of a panel control located on its face, or a hand held remote control unit . Instead of a separate STB, however, a viewer computing unit can be incorporated in the TV itself. In addition to televisions, the viewer computing unit might be implemented with other types of visual display units, such as a computer monitor, as is described below with respect to the  implementation.","Each viewer computing unit  is configured to run an electronic program guide (EPG). The EPG provides an on-screen listing of various programs or program titles. The listing is organized in a predetermined arrangement that is displayed on the television. The EPG might also include other program descriptive information, including whether the program is provided in closed caption or stereo.","Headend  is interconnected to the subscribers via a distribution structure or network . The distribution structure  can be implemented in different ways. One implementation is a multi-tier network which includes a high-speed, high-bandwidth fiber optic cable network between the headend and regional distribution nodes (not shown), and conventional home entry lines, such as twisted-pair lines or coaxial cable, between the distribution nodes and viewer computing units. Other implementations include satellite communications (e.g., DSS technologies), RF communication, or other wireless technologies. Moreover, the network can be constructed using a combination of wireless and wire-based technologies.","In the illustrated implementation, the network  provides both the pipeline for distribution of programs from the headend to the subscriber, as well as a back channel which enables communication from the subscriber to the headend. The back channel permits the viewer to send requests and instructions to the headend to facilitate interactive control.","Headend  provides video content programs to the viewer computing unit . The programs are embodied as video data streams that are transmitted from headend  over distribution structure  to the viewer computing unit. The headend maintains a database of programs  that can be served by a continuous media server  to individual viewers in an on-demand mode. The headend can also retransmit to its subscribers broadcast video signals that it receives from another source, such as a satellite feed or another cable system. The video data streams are sent to the viewer computing units in digital or analog format.","An EPG server  is provided at headend  to serve the programming information needed by the EPG at the viewer computing unit . The EPG server  is implemented as a structured query language (SQL) database  with records containing information relating to available shows or programs.","The headend  further includes an enhanced content server  which serves supplemental interactive content to the viewer computing units to enhance or supplement the continuous video streams served by the continuous media server . The supplemental content is stored digitally in database  and can be text, graphics, video, picture, sound, or other multimedia types. Examples of supplemental content include trivia questions or games related to the program, advertisements, merchandise or other memorabilia, hyperlinks to similar programs of similar type or starring the same actor\/actress, and so on.","In the implementation described herein, the supplemental content is constructed as a hypertext file which is rendered by a browser. Hypertext, or hypermedia, is a metaphor for presenting information in which text, images, sounds, and actions become linked together in a complex, non-sequential web of associations that permit a user to browse through related topics, regardless of the presented order of the topics. Hypermedia content is widely used for navigation and information dissemination on the \u201cWorld-Wide Web\u201d (WWW or Web) of the Internet.","Hypermedia content is commonly organized as documents with embedded control information. The embedded control information includes formatting specifications, indicating how a document is to be rendered by the browser. In addition, such control information can include links or \u201chyperlinks,\u201d which are symbols or instructions telling the browser where to find other related documents on the Internet. A hyperlink includes a label, which is typically rendered as a graphical icon or as highlighted keywords, and an underlying target specification. The target specification is set forth in the underlying hypermedia document, but is normally invisible to the user. The target specification unambiguously identifies a targeted document or resource, specifying the name of the computer on which the document resides and the complete file name of the document.","In concept, the target resource can be virtually any type of object-including executable programs, text or multimedia documents, sound clips, audio segments, still images, computers, directories, and other hyperlinks. In WWW documents, hyperlink targets are most often files that can reside on any computers connected to the Internet. However, a hyperlink target can also be a particular location within a document, including the document that is currently being rendered. Hypertext usage is not limited to the Internet. Various multimedia applications utilize hypertext to allow users to navigate through different pieces of information content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["48","46","50","48","42"]},"The data structure  includes a data field  for holding target specifications which reference target resources supporting the supplemental content. The data structure correlates the target specifications with the programs by associating them within the same program record. The presence of a target specification within the data field  indicates that the associated program is interactive and that complementary content can be displayed in addition to the program itself. The target specification can be implemented in different forms. The target specification to the supplemental content stored at the headend which enhances the \u201cMurder, She Wrote\u201d program is in the form of a pointer \u201cCONTENT1.\u201d The presence of this pointer in field  indicates that the program \u201cMurder, She Wrote\u201d is interactive compatible and that the supplemental content resides at a memory location identified by the pointer \u201cCONTENT1.\u201d Similarly, the programs \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cStar Trek\u201d are interactive compatible and have associated supplemental content which are located by the hyperlink URLs in corresponding data field . These URLs reference resources provided by independent service providers (described below with reference to ).","A URL (universal resource locator) is a type of target specification used in WWW documents to describe everything about a particular resource that a browser needs to know to request and render it. The URL describes the protocol a browser should use to retrieve the resource, the name of the computer it is on, and the path and file name of the resource.","The following is an example of a URL listed in the EPG data structure  in association with the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d program:\n\n","The \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d portion of the URL describes the protocol. The letters \u201chttp\u201d stand for HyperText Transfer Protocol, the set of rules that a browser will follow to request a document and the remote server will follow to supply the document. The \u201cwww.nbc.com\u201d portion of the URL is the name of the remote host computer which maintains the document. The last portion \u201c\/seinfeld\u201d is the path and file name of the document on the remote host computer.","The development of the EPG data structure  includes designating separate data fields  within a storage medium for holding programming information, and dedicating at least one of the data fields  to storing target specifications to supplemental content. The target specifications can be in the form of memory pointers, hyperlinks, URLs, or any other designation for referencing a location containing supplemental content. For programs with no corresponding supplemental content, the target specifications data field  is left empty. However, for those programs with supplemental content, the target specification to the target resource containing the supplemental content is entered in the data field  and correlated with the program. The correlation is provided through the data structure by the placing the target specification within the same data record as the program title and other information for a particular program. It is further noted that the target resources can be embedded within other text-based data held in other data fields  which also relate to the corresponding programs.","The same or a subset of data structure  is employed at the EPG application running at the viewer computing unit in the home. The data records stored at the headend on the EPG server are transmitted periodically in batch, or individually, and cached at the local EPG. The local EPG is thus able to identify whether a particular program is interactive compatible by quick reference to the locally cached EPG data structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["60","60","22","62","62","64","66","68","70","72"]},"The headend  serves the programs over a first network , which may be implemented like the fiber optic distribution structure described above, or as a satellite system or other wireless broadcast system, or as a conventional data network. It is noted that other program providers may be used instead of a headend, such as a broadcast station or an online service provider.","The interactive entertainment system  also includes multiple independent service providers (ISPs), as represented by ISP , which distribute digital content to the viewer computing unit  over a second network . An example of the second network  is a public network, such as the Internet. The ISP  has a host  and a content database  to serve various multimedia content to the viewer's computer. The ISP host  stores one or more target resources that can be rendered by the viewer computing unit .","The supplemental content provided by the ISP  is correlated with the programs by data structure  as described above. As shown in , the data field  includes target specifications to supplemental content provided by servers other than the program provider which distributes the show. In the illustrated example, the programs Seinfeld and Star Trek have associated ISP-served content which are located by the hyperlink URLs in corresponding data field . It is further noted that a program might have more than one source of supplemental content. The program record for \u201cStar Trek\u201d has two associated target specifications, one that references a target resource at the host computer \u201cwww.fox.com\u201d and one that references a target resource at the host computer \u201cwww.collections.com.\u201d","According to this  arrangement, the viewer computing unit  receives a non-interactive, continuous video stream from the headend , and supplemental interactive content from either the headend  or from an independent service provider . The supplemental content might therefore be carried to the viewer's computer over the same channel as the program, over a separate channel, or over a separate connection unrelated to the program channels. The back channel for facilitating interactive control is provided through either network  or .","In another implementation, the interactive content can be supplied locally by a storage medium, such as a CD-ROM. Suppose, for example, a content developer creates an interactive CD-ROM that can be played along with a particular movie. The supplemental content is accessed via disk reads to the local storage drive, rather than using URLs to target resources over a network. The supplemental content is synchronized with the program using open loop control, such as a start time followed by measurable ticks or by frame count.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["90","90","92","94","96","90","98","100"]},"The viewer computer runs an operating system  which supports multiple applications. The operating system  is stored in memory and executes on the processor. The operating system is preferably a multitasking operating system which allows simultaneous execution of multiple applications. The operating system  employs a graphical user interface windowing environment which presents the applications or documents in specially delineated areas of the display screen called \u201cwindows.\u201d One preferred operating system is a Windows\u00ae brand operating system sold by Microsoft Corporation, such as Windows\u00ae 95 or Windows\u00ae NT or other derivative versions of Windows\u00ae. However, other operating systems which provide windowing environments may be employed, such as the Macintosh operating system from Apple Corporation and the OS\/2 operating system from IBM.","A channel navigator application  is stored in program memory  and executes on the processor  to control the tuners  and  to select a desired channel for receiving the video content programs. An EPG application  is stored in program memory  and executes on the processor  to organize programming information downloaded from the EPG server at the headend. The EPG  supports a displayable user interface (UI) which visually correlates programs titles to scheduled viewing times and tuning information, such as a channel, in a scrollable grid format. The viewer computing unit  also has an interactive support module in the form of browser  which is kept in memory . The browser  is dynamically loaded on processor  when needed to render content, such as a hypertext document, from an ISP or other content provider. The browser can be implemented as a hyperlink browser, or more particularly, as an Internet Web browser.","Although not shown, the viewer computer might also include on or more storage drives, such as a CD-ROM drive, to play interactive CD-ROMs in the event that supplemental data is supplied locally on disk.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIGS. 8"],"i":["a","c. "],"b":"8"},"The method begins when a viewer tunes to a particular channel (step  in ). The channel navigator  controls the tuner  to tune to the channel. The viewer computing unit checks the appropriate channel and time slot of the EPG data structure  to determine if the program being carried on the selected channel at this time is interactive (step ). As described above, the presence of a target specification in the EPG data field  in association with the program is in indication that the program is interactive compatible and that there is supplemental content for the program. If the data field is empty, indicating that no supplemental content exists (i.e., the \u201cno\u201d branch from step ), the viewer computing unit simply displays the video data stream being received through the tuner  (step ).","A run-time technique can alternatively be used for detecting whether a program is interactive compatible. Rather than checking the EPG data field, the viewer computing unit checks a dedicated channel for the existence of new supplemental content data. The dedicated channel is separate from the selected channel carrying the program so that the supplemental content is received by the viewer computing unit currently with the program video data. The existence of a supplemental content data stream over the dedicated channel indicates that the program being received on the selected channel is interactive compatible. This technique can be carried out without reference to the EPG listing.","If the program is interactive compatible (i.e., the \u201cyes\u201d branch from step ), the viewer computing unit retrieves the target specification from the EPG data structure (step  in ). The target specification might be a pointer to a memory location at the headend, or a pointer to a memory location on a locally running CD-ROM, or a hyperlink to a target resource located at an independent service provider. The hyperlink browser  is loaded onto the processor to render the target resource referenced by the target specification (step ).","At this point, there are several ways to initiate viewing the supplemental content. One approach is to permit the viewer to selectively activate the interactive mode (i.e., the \u201cviewer activate\u201d branch from step ). The viewer may know that the program is interactive compatible by checking a newspaper listing or other program guide. Another way is to have the viewer computing unit display an icon or other indicia on the screen to visually inform the viewer that the program is interactive compatible (step  in ). The icon can be overlaid on the playing video program in an non-conspicuous manner, like the closed caption or stereo labels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6"],"i":"a ","b":["200","202","204","202","204","204","166","168"]},"If the viewer decides to enter into an interactive mode, the viewer employs a remote control handset, mouse, keyboard, or other mechanism to actuate the icon . This causes the browser  to start the target resource located by the target specification listed in the EPG data structure (step  via the \u201cyes\u201d branch from step ).","This leads to another approach to invoking the supplemental content. Rather than displaying an icon and waiting for input from the viewer, the viewer computing unit can automatically activate the target resource as soon as the browser is loaded on the processor (step  from the \u201cautomatic\u201d branch from step ).","The target resource contains digital data which supports interactive functionality in conjunction with the associated video content program. The digital data defines the supplemental content to enable viewer interactivity with the video content program. The digital data also defines a display layout prescribing how the supplemental content and the video program are to appear in relation to one another when displayed on the screen.","The digital data further defines timing information to synchronize presentation of the supplemental content with the video content program. This timing information can be implemented in many different ways. One approach is to coordinate the supplemental content to a particular program start time, and then carefully measure time from that start time to synchronize presentation of the supplemental content with the appropriate points in the program. Another approach is to characterize the program in terms of frames, and key the introduction of supplemental content to the frame numbers.","The video stream and supplemental content can be transmitted together, as a single signal, or separately. In the former implementation, the digital data is packaged with the video stream and transmitted as one signal from the headend. The viewer computing unit receives the single signal at tuner  and separates the digital data from the video signal (steps  and ). In the latter implementation, the video data stream is received over the selected channel via tuner  from the program provider (step ). The digital data is received from the target resource that is activated by the browser (step ). This target resource might be located at the headend, in which case, the data is received over a separate channel using tuner ; or the target resource might be served by an independent service provider, in which case, the data is received over a public network using the modem .","At the viewer computing unit, the digital data is deconstructed to extract the timing information and the display layout from the supplemental content (step  in  and step  in ). The display layout defines a program boundary within which the program is displayed to the viewer. The program boundary is sized and shaped according to parameters prescribed in the display layout. As the size and shape changes, the processor scales the video data for display within the program boundary at that instance (step  in ).","The display layout also defines how the supplemental content is illustrated along with the program. The display layout prescribes the size, style, location, and other parameters for presenting the supplemental content. For instance, the supplemental content might be at least partly overlaid on the video program, or provided as a wrapper around, or along side, the program. The supplemental content is displayed according to this display layout and synchronized to the program according to the timing information (step  in ). As an example, the supplemental content might be a trivia game which quizzes the viewer as to possible outcomes of various scenes. The questions are displayed on the screen according to the display layout and are timed using the timing information to coincide with the part of the program to which the questions pertain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"i":["b ","a "],"b":["200","210","210","212","221","224","226","228","212","221"]},"The illustrated screen is taken from an interactive program based on a Star Trek episode. To provide an example of the main menu, the soft buttons - represent actions for calling up related TV shows and movies. For instance, button  relates to the original Star Trek series; button  concerns The Next Generation series; button  represents the Deep Space Nine series; button  represents the Voyager series; and button  relates to the various motion pictures.","Soft button  is an access\/classified toggle which allows selection of one of two levels of interactivity. \u201cAccess\u201d serves as a default mode of interactivity which contains the main menu functionality. The screen of is an example of the access mode of interactivity. A voice-over narrative announces the mode when selected by button . Once in the access mode, the broadcast video stream is shrunk to fit within the smaller program boundary  to accommodate the main menu graphics.

The display layout can be changed for various reasons. The display layout might change in response to viewer selection of a soft button, as is the case causing the display layout change between and . The display layout might also be altered automatically as part of the timing information.

By embedding the display layout instructions within the digital data provided by a target resource, the developer is empowered to create both the content and the presentation format of how the content and broadcast program are displayed to the viewer. The developer is free to control the location and shape of the broadcast program window, as well as the presentation format of the supplemental content relative to the program window. This facilitates a non-restrictive environment in which the developer can create screens with optimal appeal to the viewer. No longer is the developer simply developing content to be displayed within a fixed pane that cannot be dynamically altered relative to the program.","The creative power is thus placed in the hands of the target resource author.  shows a method for authoring an interactive entertainment program. The author begins by developing the supplemental content which is to accompany a particular television show or movie (step  in ). The author designs the presentation format for each scene of the program (step ), and the timing requirements for synchronizing the supplemental content with the broadcast video stream (step ).","In the implementation described herein, the supplemental content is constructed as a hypertext document which can be rendered by a browser. To control how the content is to be rendered, the author encodes the presentation format and timing instructions as extension attributes to hyperlink codes. More specifically, hypermedia content utilized by the WWW is commonly written using what is referred to as a \u201cmarkup language.\u201d \u201cSGML\u201d (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is one such language, defined formally as \u201ca language for document representation that formalizes markup and frees it of system and processing dependencies.\u201d SGML is a language for describing the structure of documents and for describing a tagging scheme to delineate that structure within text. For creating hypermedia content, WWW documents utilize a subset of SGML called \u201cHTML\u201d (Hypertext Markup Language). An HTML textual document can be thought of as plain text that contains formatting instructions in the form of HTML markup codes or \u201ctags.\u201d Tags tell Web browsers how to render and print documents, and are also used to specify hyperlinks.","The following is a simple example of a start tag for an HTML hyperlink:\n\n","The leading \u201cA\u201d in the start tag is the name of HTML element. The letter \u201cA\u201d indicates that the tag is an \u201canchor\u201d tag\u2014the type of tag that defines a hyperlink. The start tag contains an \u201cattribute\u201d indicating a target specification:\n\n","The attribute name is \u201cHREF\u201d and the attribute value is \u201chttp:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/upgrades.\u201d HTML documents are organized according to various tags. Tags define the start and end of headings, paragraphs, lists, character highlighting and links, and so on.","The interactive entertainment system described herein supports conventional HTML documents as target resources. Accordingly, authors can use familiar HTML elements, such as Head, Body, and Character-Level elements, to construct a target resource. However, the inventors have also developed new types of tags, as well as extension attributes to existing HTML tags. The author of a target resource can use the new tags and extension attributes to formulate how and when the browser renders the supplemental content along with the continuous video stream.
