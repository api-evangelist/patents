{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to foreign French patent application No. FR 1401105, filed on May 16, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The field of the invention is that of navigation aids for aircraft and, more precisely, of a dynamic information correlation aid with a 4D flight trajectory.","Aeronautical information is commonly supplied to the crew. This of course relates to weather information, but also to the other dynamic information likely to be encountered during the flight:\n\n","This aeronautical information is supplied to the crew in hardcopy form (manual, logs, charts, flight dossiers), or in electronic form by displaying on screens in the cockpit. This dynamic information is more difficult to manage than static information, since it is necessary to extrapolate and to correlate disparate pieces of information. Similarly, some of this information depends on the intended altitude of the aircraft throughout the flight, and here again requires a correlation. For example, the temperature, wind or cloud charts are provided by ranges of altitude; the predicted altitude of the aircraft at a location in its flight plan has to be estimated in order to be able to find the correct chart to be displayed.","In the current operations, the crew filters the information that does not apply and manages the applicable information manually. For example, they correlate the lateral and vertical flight plan information with the weather charts, by calculating at what time the aircraft is likely to enter into a weather area. This work is complex because several weather charts need to be crossed, and the predicted 3D position of the aircraft mentally visualized on these charts together with the time-dependent aspect.","Moreover, dynamic information such as the weather is subject to frequent updates: it needs to each time be mentally re-determined what the predicted weather will be at a given future time.","Similarly, the flight plan may be subject to modifications, here again requiring the calculations to be re-done.","A few initiatives are starting to emerge for managing these problems, either in the CDS (acronym for \u201cCockpit Display System\u201d), the FMS (acronym for \u201cFlight Management System\u201d) or the EFB (acronym for \u201cElectronic Flight Bag\u201d):","The document US2012\/0232785 \u201cMethods and Systems for dynamically providing contextual weather information\u201d discloses a method allowing the aircraft icon to be virtually moved via a marker along the flight plan, i.e. to run the film of the flight in advance. The system determines the corresponding time; it is displayed on the screens according to the method. The rest of the dynamic aeronautical information displayed on the chart corresponds to the information valid at the time in question. This allows coherent information to be displayed, but only in the neighbourhood of the icon being virtually displaced as illustrated in . It can be seen in the figure that the information presented is only exact in the neighbourhood of the aircraft icon which is on the WPT, since the static chart shown is that corresponding to the time closest to the time predicted for the aircraft icon. Thus, for example, the region Z which can in fact be traversed before 23:00 and after 06:00 is declared as accessible, whereas it will no longer be so at the time when the aircraft will arrive there. Similarly, it cannot be seen in the figure that a strong, turbulent, side wind will occur at the point WPT. This method does not allow:\n\n","The document U.S. Pat. No. 8,332,084 \u201cFour-dimensional weather predictor based on aircraft trajectory\u201d discloses a method for merging spatio-temporal weather information, used to predict the weather along a 3D+time trajectory, the time being predetermined. The system determines the weather in the vicinity of a 4D (3D+time) trajectory. Then, it allows either this trajectory to be refined (by taking into account the correct wind at each point, at the predicted time), or a more optimized trajectory to be found, in the neighbourhood of the initial trajectory, using the predicted wind in a volume around the initial trajectory. This method does not allow a developing situation around the 4D trajectory to be presented in an effective manner since it does not display anything; indeed, the display on the current screens in 2D of a weather \u201cvolume\u201d is not possible. It is just a method for calculating the FMS predictions. Moreover, it only takes into account the weather (wind, temperature, humidity, pressure).","The document US2011\/0102192 \u201cDisplaying weather forecast for own air vehicle\u201d provides a method for displaying the weather forecast on a screen on board the aircraft. The system allows a time period (or a time) to be selected via a input HMI. The display screen then displays the predicted position of the aircraft at the time in question and the weather situation corresponding to the time interval in which this time is situated. This does not allows the changes in dynamic aeronautical information with time to be seen at a given time; if this information changes and impacts the progress of the flight, the crew have to estimate at what time this will occur, to manually input the time in question in order to see both the predicted aircraft icon and the weather around this aircraft icon. There is no coherent display all along the flight path on a single screen.","The document US2011\/098871 \u201cMethod and apparatus for updating winds aloft display as aircraft altitude changes\u201d describes a method for displaying charts of winds as a function of the altitude, by selection of a rotary switch on the aircraft altitude. This allows the crew to choose altitudes on a display screen; the winds corresponding to the chosen level are then displayed. The time parameter is not integrated into this method. Moreover, the display takes place around the current aircraft and does not take into account the flight plan.","The document by the applicant US2009\/0204277 \u201cMethod of estimating atmospheric data at any point of a path of an aircraft\u201d) discloses a method for calculating the most likely weather model (wind, pressure, temperature, humidity) at a given point of the flight path, by using a grid of winds and atmospheric models. This allows discrete wind data values to be plotted against atmospheric models, section by section along the flight plan, in order to determine the most probable wind at any point. However, this does not solve the problem consisting in displaying in an effective manner a developing situation around the 4D trajectory, since it calculates the wind at a given point of the trajectory and does not display it elsewhere. It is just a method for calculating FMS predictions.","The document by the applicant US2007\/179703 \u201cProcess taking into account a local and favourable situation not conforming to a general meteorological forecast\u201d discloses a method for warning of predicted unfavourable wind along a flight plan. The wind is calculated in 4D (on a 3D flight path including the time parameter, in other words the spatio-temporal variation of the wind) allowing the weather (vent, pressure, temperature) to be determined and forecast at any point of a flight plan. This therefore allows the segments of the flight plan to be determined where an unfavourable wind will exist and a diversion to be proposed at these points. However, as before, this does not solve the problem consisting in displaying in an effective manner a developing situation around the 4D trajectory since it predicts the wind at a given 3D point of the trajectory and does not display it elsewhere. It is just a method for calculating FMS or ground predictions.","Other types of information are not shown, with a range of time variation correlated with the predictions along the flight path. The extrapolations of data concerning the flight and their correlation with the predicted flight path are carried out manually.","The methods described in the aforementioned documents allow a correlation to be performed manually and at a given time: the crew chooses a geographical region on their flight plan, and the predicted weather information at this location at this time is displayed. However, this does not give an overall view of the trajectory, and makes the crew perform trial and error operations in order to estimate if a potential problem could exist at a given point.","The aim of the invention is to overcome these drawbacks.","One subject of the invention is a method for correlation of spatio-temporal information with a 3D+time trajectory, incorporating mechanisms for automatic and manual filtering of the level of information and of the desired time range around the trajectory, and including an improved representation of the time variation of geographical information.","More precisely, the subject of the invention is a method for assisting the navigation of an aircraft equipped with\n\n","It is mainly characterized in that it comprises the following steps:\n\n","This method allows:\n\n","It allows spatio-temporal data to be determined that is coherent with the 3D trajectory displayed, by taking into account the time axis over forward time scales allowing the crew to capture on a single representation the predicted time variation of the situation, without however cluttering the displays, in order to preserve an optimum readability and appreciation of the situation.","Other advantages:\n\n","The choice of the families to be displayed may be predetermined or determined by the crew or automatically.","Priorities can be chosen for families and\/or sub-families.","According to one feature of the invention, a degree of reliability being associated with data, the formatting step is furthermore carried out by degree of reliability.","The families of data are typically: a family of meteorological data and\/or a family of geographical data and\/or a family of navigational data and\/or a family of data supplied by the crew.","Sub-families may be associated with data; the assembly step is then furthermore carried out by sub-families.","Another subject of the invention is a system for assisting the navigation of an aircraft which comprises:\n\n","From one figure to another, the same elements are identified by the same references.","The various steps of the method according to the invention are described with reference to the flow diagram in .","Step A: extraction of the data\u2014insertion into a database BDD by families of data and potentially sub-families of data.","This first step consists in acquiring the relevant data to be displayed, via the various sensors and systems available. The lists provided hereinbelow are not exhaustive, but allow the operation of the method to be understood. This data will form a database BDD within which they are assembled by families.","During this step, the meteorological data are extracted in the following manner:\n\n","The following geographical data are extracted in the same way via digital data uplinks and by using on-board charts:\n\n","The navigational data is extracted in the same way via digital data uplinks and by using on-board Notams:\n\n","This step also allows data to be displayed to be manually defined, either for replacing data that have not been digitized and are not therefore extractable for the other systems or available via datalink, or for inserting \u2018proprietary\u2019 data which do not belong to the list of data types expressed hereinabove.","In order to be exploitable by the following steps, and as illustrated in , the proprietary data are characterized by:\n\n","The non-proprietary data are also characterized in the same manner.","The set of these data values is integrated into a database BDD in which they are assembled by families examples of which are given in the step C.","Furthermore, for data of the same type, for example the wind data, coming at the same time from the radar weather, from the on-board charts and from updates via digital data uplinks, a \u201ctag\u201d (ex: WINDS) and a degree of reliability in time or distance is associated with these data, in order to allow the following steps to operate on this set of mutually coherent data, and the data of different types to be well separated.","Step B: formatting of the data.","During this step, the data values are formatted as a function of their type: events, scalars, vectors, surfaces and volumes, all associated with a time window of validity. For an one-off event, the time window is reduced to a date of occurrence.","The following operations are carried out:\n\n","These fields have a time window of validity.","Step C: Selection for the display.","In order to guarantee the correct understanding of the operational situation by the crew, and in order to allow them concentrate where necessary on the important parameters for the flight, a selection step (or filtering step) for the data to be displayed is carried out so as not to clutter the overall display. A parameter presetting may be provided or defined by the policy of the airline via a software configuration.","A selection of the information to be displayed is made, by family, then by sub-family, and where appropriate, by type of representation and\/or by priority of the information.","Amongst these families may be mentioned, as shown in the example in the \n\n","For each family and for each sub-family, examples of which are cited in the following part, a priority (not to be confused with the priority associated with each data value) may be chosen by the crew so as to only display the required information. An selection HMI allows the priorities to be chosen, for example P, P, P. In the example of choice of priority shown in , it has been chosen to only show the selected data (SEL is enabled) and with a priority P (i.e. strictly with a higher priority than P) from amongst the 3 families selected in the preceding HMI in . As shown in this example in , a geographical region (at 10 NM) and\/or a time window (\u221220 min-+40 min) can also be selected.","The method according to the invention allows various display parameters to be chosen.","For the data to be displayed \u201caround the trajectory\u201d or \u201cALOFT AREA\u201d which is the display option indicated with (and not in the latter), the method according to the invention allows the spatial corridor around the trajectory within which the data will be displayed to be chosen. This may be a corridor of the \u201clateral band\u201d type around the trajectory, or a corridor of the \u201ccircle around the trajectory\u201d type. By default, only one corridor is provided, but a different corridor by sub-family could be provided. The corridor is lateral for lateral data; a vertical corridor could also be defined for the displays on the vertical display screen.","The method also allows filtering of the data to be displayed according to the time window in which they occur, with respect to the predicted times along the trajectory. Thus, in the example hereinabove, it may be choen to only extract the data occurring 20 min before and 40 min after the predicted time at each point of the trajectory. A choice of 0 min before and 0 min after allows the data to be displayed that is exactly temporally correlated with the trajectory. This functionality is illustrated in . In the example in , the time window chosen is situated between \u221230 min and +30 min as indicated on the bottom right. However, two cloud banks are overlapping:\n\n","Thus, a bank of clouds intersecting the WPT may be masked by the bank of clouds intersecting the WPT. In , the display time windows situated between \u22125 min and +5 min have been limited. The overlapping is thus avoided the visibility is improved.","According to one variant, this selection of the time window for each family may also be carried out during the step E for correlation of the data with the trajectory.","Examples of sub-families potentially with associated priorities will now be given.","The family METEO, one example of which is shown in , comprises the display mode and the following sub-families:\n\n","The family CLOUDS, one example of which is shown in , comprises the display mode and the following sub-families:\n\n","The family NAVAIDS & GNSS, one example of which is shown in , comprises the display mode and the following sub-families:\n\n","The list is not exhaustive; it corresponds to the reception hardware capacities of the aircraft.","The category AREAS, one example of which is shown in , comprises the display mode and the following sub-families:\n\n","The family CUSTOMS one example of which is shown in , comprises the display mode and the sub-families defined by the pilot:\n\n","In the example in the figure, there are, for example, a contact reminder from the airline, the service hours of the PNC (flight personnel) for the main cabin meals, and a change of crew.","This list is not exhaustive.","The family DAY\/NIGHT does not have any sub-family. With a knowledge of the ephemerides, and hence for a country traversed the sunset and sunrise times (local time), the UTC time is calculated with the local time offset of the geographical region. For example, in a country where the time offset is +6 hrs (i.e. it is 18:00 hrs when it is noon UTC), and where the local sunrise time is equal to 07:45, the UTC time stored for sunrise will be 01:45.","Step D: Spatio-temporal discretization of the trajectory.","In order to assist with the trajectory spatio-temporal correlation and data for the following step, an intermediate step for processing of the predicted trajectory is carried out. From the trajectory (points en route, straight segments and bends, vertical profile in altitude and in speed, predicted times of passage at the various points), a characteristic point TRAJ(i) is saved, given by:\n\n","For segments that are too long (more than 3 minutes in length for example, but the value may be chosen to be different), the trajectory is discretized and characteristic points are added.","A succession of 3D geometrical elements characterized by a start time and an end time are therefore obtained.","The trajectory is composed of N elements TRAJ(i), for i=1 . . . N.","Step E: Trajectory spatio-temporal correlation and data for determining the objects that intersect the trajectory; the goal is to determine around each element TRAJ(i) of the trajectory, the data geographically present according to a given spatial window and within a given time window with respect to the predicted time at the said element (window=\u2212X minutes; +Y minutes). The data to be displayed is sorted by verification of their distance with respect to the trajectory, and by verifying their time of occurrence with respect to the predicted times along the trajectory.\n\n","Time(TRAJ(k))<=UTC sunrise time<=Time(TRAJ(k+1)). For example for the \u201cDist To Dest\u201d, in order to create the characteristic point \u201cDAY\u201d (of the same structure as the points TRAJ, with a tag corresponding to the event).","Thus, for the event \u201csunrise\u201d (or DAY), a point DAY (lat, long, alt, time, speed, dist to dest, tag=\u201cDAY\u201d) will have been created.","Its coordinates and parameters are interpolated. For example, for the \u201cDist to Dest\u201d:\n\nDist to Dest(DAY)=Dist to Dest(())\u2212[Dist to Dest(())\u2212Dist to Dest((1))]*(time(())\u2212sunrise time)\/(time(())\u2212time((1))\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0210"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Set i: ==1"},{"entry":"While i < N (N = last element of TRAJ), do:"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Get the element of TRAJ: TRAJ(i)"]},{"entry":[{},"Get the latitudes, longitudes and altitudes of TRAJ(i): LAT(TRAJ(i)),"]},{"entry":[{},"LONG(TRAJ(i)), ALT(TRAJ(i))"]},{"entry":[{},"For each data value TEMP (lat, long, alt, time)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Calculate the distance between the element TRAJ(i) and TEMP"]},{"entry":[{},"If the distance is less than the entry value of the corridor"]},{"entry":[{},"(ALOFT AREA) defined in the step C (where distance can be"]},{"entry":[{},"Euclidian i.e. within a ball of give radius, or projected onto the"]},{"entry":[{},"3D trajectory etc.),"]},{"entry":[{},"then"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"If the time of the data Time(TEMP) is such that"]},{"entry":[{},"Time(TRAJ(i)) + Start Time < Time(TEMP) <"]},{"entry":[{},"Time(TRAJ(i)) + End Time, then"]},{"entry":[{},"(Start Time and End Time are defined in the step C and"]},{"entry":[{},"Start Time is negative)"]},{"entry":[{},"Store the element TEMP in the elements to be displayed"]},{"entry":[{},"End If"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"End If"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Set i:= i+1"},{"entry":"End while."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0054","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0054-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0055","list-style":"none"},"li":["If the data is of the vector field type, the same operation as for the scalar fields may be carried out.","If the data is of the surface field type, it is then a case of determining whether a polygon representing an element of the surface type intersects the trajectory within the given time window."]}}}},"Take for example the surface defined by the atmospheric layer at 0\u00b0 where the risk of icing may arise in the case of traversing this layer within a wet region of the cloud type. This surface is composed of points called SURF (lat, long, alt, time) for the icing for example. The surface is composed of contiguous facets, each facet being a triplet of points SURF as shown in ; functions of the prior art are used such as Delaunay triangulation (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org.\/wiki\/Delaunay triangulation) used for digitizing mountainous areas by creation of a mesh which determines a matrix of facets approximating a surface.","In the example in , the idea is to determine if the facet defined by the triplet [SURF(lat,long,Alt); SURF(lat,long,Alt); SURF(lat,long,Alt)] intersects the point TRAJ(i) in the red corridor with a radius R (determined in the step C), and in the time window determined by [Time(TRAJ(i))+Start Time; Time(TRAJ(i))+End Time].","The Euclidian distances are therefore calculated for example between each of the 3 points of each facet, and the point TRAJ(i).","If at least one of the points of the facet is located at a distance from the point TRAJ(i) that is less than the limit of the corridor (here the radius of the ball of radius R centred on TRAJ(i)), then the candidate surface is retained, if the time of occurrence of the candidate points is in the time segment defined by [Time(TRAJ(i))+Start Time; Time(TRAJ(i))+End Time].","Thus, the whole surface is retained: a \u201cbit\u201d of cloud is not displayed, but the entire cloud.","If the data is of the volume fields type, the same operations are performed as for the surface fields by considering once again an approximation of the volume using polyhedra.","Step F: Display of the data with filtering for readability according to a predetermined symbology.","This is a graphical formatting step allowing an intuitive display of the data varying with time","The displays are filtered using the selection criteria of the step C.","The representation of the important data is customized, such as the priority data P intersecting the trajectory, with a particular scheme such as a colour for example.","A display scheme is also provided for the data varying over time, allowing its geographic displacement to be judged. For example, an arrow between the centres of gravity of the objects.","In the examples in , the trajectory traverses Iran (IR), Pakistan (PK) and India (IN) and information on various families are correlated over time. The figures respectively show:\n\n","The cloud development is highlighted with a coloured edge (red for example) at the moment where the storm cloud intersects the trajectory between WPT and WPT. Curved arrows allow the representations of the same cloud to be connected at different times; the time is also displayed in the shape of the cloud.","Similarly, the non-availability of the whole GNSS constellation between 19:00 hrs and 19:38, when the aircraft will be at the point WPT, is for example represented by a red pictogramme.","The same goes for the closing of the region Z, when the aircraft will be at WPT, and the maintenance of the beacon between 23:40 and 01:00 hrs for landing.","As indicated on the flow diagram in , adjustments are subsequently made when there is a modification of the lateral or vertical trajectory by the crew, or modification of the predicted data when the real conditions encountered by the aircraft result in a deviation from the predicted trajectory: for example a slower real speed will modify the predicted times of passage at the points and will require updating, a modification of the choice of the data to be displayed, or a modification of the data to be displayed (reception of a new chart, manual modification of a customized input, etc.).","The method according to the invention allows a representation to be made of the data connected with the 4D trajectory displayed, by taking into account the time axis on time scales allowing the crew to capture on a single display the development of the predicted situation, without however cluttering the displays, in order to keep an optimum readability and appreciation of the situation.","It also allows:\n\n","It may furthermore be applied to any type of trajectory, whether this be the trajectory followed by the flight or alternative trajectories, for example work-around alternative trajectories (\u201cWhat if\u201d scenario) with a presentation of the time-correlated information for:\n\n","The method can be implemented in a computer of the FMS type, or in an FM (\u201cFlight Management\u201d) function of a computer. shows an FMS disposing of the following modules described in the standard ARINC 702 (Advanced Flight Management Computer System, December 1996).
