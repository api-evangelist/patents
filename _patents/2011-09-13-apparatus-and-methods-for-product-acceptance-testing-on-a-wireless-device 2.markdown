{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present Application for Patent is a divisional of patent application Ser. No. 11\/080,228 entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE TESTING ON A WIRELESS DEVICE\u201d filed Mar. 14, 2005, pending, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The described embodiments generally relate to wireless communications devices and computer networks. More particularly, the described embodiments relate to apparatus and methods of product acceptance testing on a wireless device, and the collection and analysis of product acceptance data from the wireless device.","Wireless networking connects one or more wireless devices to other computer devices without a direct electrical connection, such as a copper wire or optical cable. Wireless devices communicate data, typically in the form of packets, across a wireless or partially wireless computer network and open a \u201cdata\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d channel on the network such that the device can send and receive data packets. The wireless devices often have wireless device resources, such as programs and hardware components, which individually use open communication connections to transmit and receive data on the network. In order for the wireless devices to operate on the wireless networks, the devices need to be set-up or configured and then tested, i.e. product acceptance testing. Such set-up or configuration typically includes installing or adjusting various hardware, software and\/or firmware and other associated parameters on the wireless device. Further, the set-up or configuration is typically analyzed by running the product acceptance tests on the wireless device to measure the performance and\/or operability of the wireless device on the wireless network. Each type of wireless device may have its own device-specific set-up, and each wireless network and\/or carrier may also have their network-specific and\/or carrier-specific set-ups. Thus, the initial set-up and configuration of a wireless device for operation on a given wireless network is typically very complicated and time consuming.","Another complicating factor in the initial set-up and testing of a wireless device is that typically external testing devices are required. For example, in a wireless device such as a cellular phone, various analyzers are serially connected to the phone and input and\/or measure various test parameters. In order to maximize throughput, such testing is typically performed in a batch mode on a plurality of wireless devices, resulting in a confusing mass of external testing devices, cables and wireless devices. Further, typically such tests involve mobile tests, such as driving the cellular phone around a predetermined area to test its receive and transmit capabilities in varying environmental conditions. For example, with a cellular phone, these tests involve an exchange of messaging communications between a base station and the cellular phone. These mobile tests can be very inefficient, as the environmental conditions may not be consistent, as in the case of a change in the weather, and as driving around with the wireless device can be very time-consuming. Further, such mobile testing and the moving around, connecting and disconnecting of the wireless device tend to increase the potential for damaging the wireless device.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide an apparatus and method that allows for less complicated, safer and more consistent product acceptance testing.","An aspect is directed to a wireless communications device, comprising: a computer platform having a simulation module operable to simulate network communications of the wireless communications device on a wireless network, wherein the simulated network communications are associated with a network communications test scenario; and a communications processing engine disposed on the wireless communications device for processing the simulated network communications and generating corresponding product acceptance data for determining compliance of the wireless communications device with a communications processing standard.","Another aspect is directed to an apparatus for analyzing data from a wireless communications device, comprising: a module for receiving product acceptance data corresponding to a processing of a simulated communications message on the wireless communications device, wherein the product acceptance data is associated with a network communications test scenario, wherein the simulated communications message is associated with a communication on a wireless network; and a product acceptance test application executable by the module and including an analysis engine operable to analyze the product acceptance data and generate a product acceptance decision.","Another aspect is directed to a method of performing product acceptance testing, comprising: transmitting at least a portion of a product acceptance test application across a wireless network to a wireless communications device having a communications processing engine, the product acceptance test application including a simulation module for simulating network communications with the communications processing engine, the simulated network communications corresponding to a network communications test scenario; receiving product acceptance data from the wireless communication device, the product acceptance data comprising test result data corresponding to the processing of the simulated network communications by the communications processing engine; and determining a product acceptance decision based on the product acceptance data.","Another aspect is directed to a non-transitory computer readable storage medium containing instructions stored thereon, which, when executed by a wireless device, cause the wireless device to perform operations, the instructions comprising: program code to transmit at least a portion of a product acceptance test application across a wireless network to a wireless communications device having a communications processing engine, the product acceptance test application including a simulation module for simulating network communications with the communications processing engine, the simulated network communications corresponding to a network communications test scenario; program code to receive product acceptance data from the wireless communication device, the product acceptance data comprising test result data corresponding to the processing of the simulated network communications by the communications processing engine; and program code to determine a product acceptance decision based on the product acceptance data.","Another aspect is directed to an apparatus for performing product acceptance testing, comprising: means for transmitting at least a portion of a product acceptance test application across a wireless network to a wireless communications device having a communications processing engine, the product acceptance test application including a simulation module for simulating network communications with the communications processing engine, the simulated network communications corresponding to a network communications test scenario; means for receiving product acceptance data from the wireless communication device, the product acceptance data comprising test result data corresponding to the processing of the simulated network communications by the communications processing engine; and means for determining a product acceptance decision based on the product acceptance data.","Another aspect is directed to an apparatus for product acceptance testing on a wireless device, comprising: means for simulating communications representative of actual communications with a wireless network; and means for processing the simulated communications and thereby generating product acceptance data associated with a product acceptance decision.","Referring to , one embodiment of a product acceptance testing apparatus  includes a plurality of wireless devices , , ,  that each include a product acceptance testing application  operable to simulate predetermined network communications test scenarios  on the respective device, and to determine if the device is configured and operable according to predetermined communications processing standards . For example, such predetermined network communications test scenarios  and predetermined communications processing standards  include protocols relating to the initiation, maintenance and termination of data communications on the wireless device, thereby establishing operability and performance levels of the device on a network. In one embodiment, wireless devices , , ,  are positioned within a wireless network area  and communicate across a wireless network  with each other, and\/or with a product acceptance data-gathering and\/or user manager server . User manager  may communicate with wireless devices , , ,  through a direct, wired connection or through a wireless connection, such as through a network interface  in communication with wireless network . The communications between user manager  and wireless devices , , ,  may include downloads of all, or selected portions (such as particular test suites), of product acceptance testing application . Other such communications include uploads from each wireless device , , ,  that supply product acceptance data , i.e. the test results, back to the user manager . Additionally, user manager  may include an analysis engine  for comparing the received product acceptance data  with predetermined communication performance standards  to generate a product acceptance decision . Alternatively, analysis engine  may be associated with product acceptance testing application  and may be executable on the respective wireless device , , , . It should be noted, however, that due to the simulation capabilities of product acceptance testing application , wireless devices , , ,  advantageously do not need to be in communication with wireless network  in order to execute this application and test communications processing ability of the device.","Product acceptance testing application  may be initiated at any time, and product acceptance data  may be stored on and obtained from the respective wireless device , , ,  at any time via a wired or wireless connection to the respective wireless device. Product acceptance testing application  simulates at least one of a wireless network, a wireless network component, or another device on wireless network and the associated communications\/messaging, such as by generating simulated wireless signaling messages. Further, product acceptance test application  logs the associated communications processing data, i.e. product acceptance data , relevant to determine compliance with predetermined communications processing standards . Such product acceptance data  is indicative of the wireless device set-up, performance and implementation of the device on the network. As mentioned above, the logged product acceptance data  may be stored within the respective wireless device , , ,  and later uploaded via a wired or wireless connection to user manager  for analysis. By eliminating the need during testing for interaction with a wireless network, and by eliminating the need for complicated external cabling and expensive external devices, this solution advantageously reduces the amount of time and resources necessary to run any predetermined network communications test scenario  and provide proof of compliance with any predetermined communications processing standard . Thus, in one embodiment, product acceptance testing application  provides each wireless device , , ,  with a resident or self-contained capability for simulating communications representative of actual communications with a wireless network and automatically performing product acceptance testing, while user manager  analyzes the test results and validates the configuration and operation of the device.","The wireless devices can include any type of computerized, wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , personal digital assistant , two-way text pager , and even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and which also may have a wired connection  to a network or the Internet. The wireless device can be a remote-slave, or other device that does not have an end-user thereof but simply communicates data across the wireless network , such as remote sensors, diagnostic tools, data relays, and the like. The apparatus and method of self-contained product acceptance testing on the wireless device can accordingly be performed on any form of wireless device or computer module including a wired or wireless communication portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, access terminals, personal computers, telephones, or any combination or sub-combination thereof.","Referring to , each wireless device , , , , such as cellular telephone  in this case, has a computer platform  that can transmit data across wireless network , and that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from user manager  or another computer device connected to wireless network . Computer platform  also includes an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) , or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. ASIC  or other processor may execute an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with any resident programs, such as product acceptance testing application , in a memory  of the wireless device. API  is a runtime environment executing on the respective wireless device , , , . One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless\u00ae (BREW\u00ae) software developed by Qualcomm, Inc., of San Diego, Calif. Other runtime environments may be utilized that, for example, operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices. Memory  may include read-only and\/or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. Computer platform  also includes a local database  that can hold the software applications, files, or data not actively used in memory , such as the software applications or data downloaded from user manager . Local database  typically includes one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. Additionally, local database  can ultimately hold a resident copy of product acceptance application  or agent, as is further described herein.","Referring to , in one embodiment, computer platform  includes product acceptance test application  that interfaces with API  and is executable by a communications processing engine . Communications processing engine  includes various processing subsystems  embodied in hardware, firmware, software, and combinations thereof, that enable the functionality of the respective wireless device , , ,  and the operability of the respective device on wireless network , such as for exchanging data\/communications with other devices. For example, communications processing engine  may include one or a combination of processing subsystems , such as: sound, non-volatile memory, file system, transmit, receive, searcher, physical layer, link layer, call processing layer, main control, remote procedure, handset, power management, diagnostic, digital signal processor, vocoder, messaging, call manager, Bluetooth\u00ae, Bluetooth\u00ae LPOS, position determination, position engine, user interface, sleep, data services, security, authentication, USIM\/SIM, voice services, graphics, USB, camera\/camcorder interface and associated display drivers, multimedia such as MPEG, GPRS, etc. In one embodiment, API  includes a class of software extensions that allow product acceptance test application  to access communications processing engine . These software extensions can communicate with processing subsystems  on the wireless device, which allows both data reads and commands. For example, this software extension can send commands, including register for log messages, on behalf of the applications that invoke it. The module can then forward the responses of the subsystems to product acceptance test application , or ultimately across wireless network  to user manager . Each resident application on wireless device can create an instance of this new software extension to communicate with the subsystems independently.","In one embodiment, such as a cellular telephone , processing subsystems  include at least a receive (\u201cRx\u201d) component  for receiving communications sent to the processor of the wireless device, at least one call processing (\u201cCP\u201d) component  and\/or system determination (\u201cSD\u201d) component  for handling the initiation, authentication, handoffs, data exchanges, messaging protocols, internal processing and decision-making, etc. associated with processing a message, and a transmit (\u201cTx\u201d) component  for sending communications from the processor of the wireless device, such as to handset components, wireless network , wireless network components, and other devices connected to the wireless network. In this embodiment, CP component  may handle the majority of the call processing tasks, while SD component  may handle tasks relating to selecting an appropriate system, from a plurality of systems, with which to communicate, as well as higher-level decision-making tasks referenced by CP component .","In one embodiment, product acceptance test application  further includes a network simulation module  and a wireless device handset simulation module , and one or both of these modules may receive the communications transmitted from Tx component  and simulate an appropriate response. During the testing of simulated communication scenarios, product acceptance test application  and API  provide calls to communications processing engine  that prevent Tx component  from transmitting over-the-air, and instead direct the transmission to product acceptance test application . Network simulation module  includes, but is not limited to, a plurality of messages, message protocols and parameters, network characteristics, etc., such as may be associated with predetermined test scenarios  and predetermined device\/network standards  (), in order to simulate a communication of a wireless network, a network component such as a mobile phone base station, or other devices such as a content provider server or a wired network connected to a wireless network, with the respective wireless device , , ,  and communications processing engine . Similarly, wireless device handset simulation module  replicates the message protocols and user interactions of a handset, such as sending an SMS message, taking a picture and\/or running an application. Wireless handset simulation module  includes a plurality of messages, message protocols, handset feature characteristics, etc., such as may be associated with predetermined test scenarios  and predetermined device\/network standards  (), in order to simulate a user interaction and\/or a communication of a handset feature and\/or component with communications processing engine  and\/or some other component of the respective wireless device. As such, network simulation module  and wireless device handset simulation module  may each send communications\/messages to Rx component , and\/or may each receive communications\/messages from Tx component , to simulate at least some portion of a predetermined network communications test scenario . Additionally, the resident product acceptance test application  monitors communications processing engine  and the various processing subsystems  during execution of test scenarios , and logs the various parameters, messages, messaging protocols, etc., which define product acceptance data . Product acceptance data  may then be analyzed, such as by a comparison with predetermined communications standards  (), to determine whether or not the wireless device is properly configured and suitably operable.","Predetermined test scenarios , which may include a wide range of operational tests, simulated by product acceptance test application  may be defined by predetermined communications processing standards  (), which may include industry-wide and\/or carrier-specific acceptance tests, parameters, messaging protocols, operational criteria and\/or associated parameter values indicative of an acceptable or compliant product. For example, in a cellular telephone embodiment, predetermined communications processing standards  may include parameters, messaging protocols and other characteristics associated with processing communications on the wireless device. Suitable examples of predetermined communications processing standards  include at least one of: CDMA Development Group (\u201cCDG\u201d) Stage 2 Interoperability Testing for CDMA2000\u00ae Mobiles; CDG Stage 3 Interoperability Testing for CDMA2000\u00ae Mobiles; GSM Certification Forum (\u201cGCF\u201d) standards; Telecommunication Industry Association (\u201cTIA\u201d) standards; 3Generation Partnership Project (\u201c3GPP\u201d) standards; 3GPP2 standards; etc each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Suitable examples of predetermined test scenarios  include at least one of: air interface tests; plain old telephone service (\u201cPOTS\u201d) tests; handoff tests; power control tests; registration tests; authentication tests, service redirection tests; short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d) tests; subscriber calling features tests; asynchronous data and fax services tests; low-, medium- and high-speed packet data services tests; voice quality tests; over-the-air services tests; system selection for preferred roaming tests; message driven indicator tests; forward compatibility tests; minimum performance testing; signaling conformance testing; application interface testing; field testing; and data performance testing; etc.","Further, for example, these test scenarios may test the operational performance of various functions, parameters, characteristics, messaging protocols, etc., such as: terminations, originations and maintenance in strong signal, weak signal and mixed signal environments; radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) performance parameters, such as: receive (Rx) parameters including sensitivity, isolated magnetic dipole (\u201cIMD\u201d) and self-jamming, transmit (Tx) parameters such as waveform quality (\u201cRho\u201d), power control and maximum power, and broadband (\u201cBB\u201d) and digital signal processing (\u201cDSP\u201d) parameters such as signal acquisition, soft handoff (\u201cSHO\u201d), searcher, and finger assignment; interoperability performance parameters such as: channel parameters including access channel (\u201cACH\u201d), dedicated paging channel (\u201cDPCH\u201d), forward traffic channel (\u201cFTCH\u201d) and reverse traffic channel (\u201cRTCH\u201d), messaging parameters dealing with layer  and layer , and handoff parameters including SHO, interband hard handoff (\u201cHHO\u201d) and interfrequency HHO. Further, for example, these test scenarios may test wireless device feature parameters such as system acquisition, high speed packet data (\u201cHSPD\u201d), location determination, call types (POTS, 3-way, call waiting, voice mail, authentication, etc.), provisioning (over-the-air service provisioning (\u201cOTASP\u201d), over-the-air parameter administration (\u201cOTAPA\u201d), IP over-the-air (\u201cIOTA\u201d), etc.), and other parameters dealing with features such as short message service (\u201cSMS\u201d), multimedia service (\u201cMMS\u201d), browser, Java software and BREWED\u00ae software.","Referring back to , wireless network  may include at least one, or any combination, of: a cellular telephone network; a terrestrial telephone network; a satellite telephone network; an infrared network such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA)-based network; a short-range wireless network; a Bluetooth\u00ae technology network; a home radio frequency (HomeRF) network; a shared wireless access protocol (SWAP) network; a wideband network, such as a wireless Ethernet compatibility alliance (WECA) network, a wireless fidelity alliance (Wi-Fi Alliance) network, and a 802.11 network; a public switched telephone network; a public heterogeneous communications network, such as the Internet; a private communications network; and land mobile radio network.

For example, network interface  may include a local area network that connects user manager  through an Internet Service Provider to the Internet, which in turn may be connected to a respective wireless device through a carrier network and a base station.","In one embodiment, apparatus  can \u201cpush\u201d at least one product acceptance test application  to be resident, at least temporarily, on the computer platform  of each wireless device , , , . For example, user manager  may \u201cpush\u201d product acceptance test application  across wireless network  to the respective device. Alternately, product acceptance test application  can be placed on the platform  at the time of manufacture or initial programming, or the wireless device , , ,  can \u201cpull\u201d the application from another computer device on the network, such as user manager , either with a request from the end-user, or automatically. Product acceptance data  can include, but is not limited to, messages, messaging protocols, and parameters, generated from communications processing engine  during the simulated operation of wireless device. Product acceptance data  can allow for specific troubleshooting of a device within the wireless network  based upon the gathered product acceptance data. As mentioned above, product acceptance application  or agent can be permanently stored in the local database  of the wireless device computer platform , or can only be temporarily held in memory  thereof for a one time (or n-time) execution to transmit product acceptance data .","Product acceptance test application  may cause the respective wireless device to selectively transmit product acceptance data  for that wireless device to another computer device, such as user manager , on the wireless network. In one embodiment, product acceptance test application  transmits product acceptance data  from that wireless device , , ,  to user manager  across the wireless network  when requested. Alternately, product acceptance test data  is transmitted over an open communication connection from the wireless device , , ,  to the wireless network , and thus \u201cpiggybacked\u201d across an open connection, such as a voice or data call at the cellular telephone . In a cellular network configuration, product acceptance data  can be transmitted to user manager  through short message service. In another embodiment, a remote user manager  reads product acceptance data  from the respective device through the resident product acceptance application , and in some instances, writes commands to computer platform  and alters the operation of the wireless device , , , . Accordingly, the access to product acceptance testing application  allows user manager  to remotely control product acceptance testing and set-up, perform customer interactions, remotely monitor the wireless device, and remotely gather specific product acceptance information.","Referring back to , user manager  may be at least one of any type of server, personal computer, mini-mainframes and the like. User manager  and its corresponding components can give a ready view of product acceptance data  collected from the wireless devices in any form, such as tables, maps, graphics views, plain text, interactive programs or web pages, or any other display or presentation of the data. User manager  (or plurality of servers) can send software agents or applications, such as product acceptance test application , to wireless devices , , ,  in the wireless network area  such that the wireless devices return data from their resident applications. Wireless devices , , ,  may transmit data, such as product acceptance data , to user manager  or some other computer device on the network. User manager  utilizes product acceptance data  for purposes such as product acceptance testing, product set-up, device diagnosis, and\/or data mining. Also, user manager  may change an operational parameter and\/or configuration of a respective wireless device, and\/or of a network component, based on the product acceptance test data  and\/or based on the analysis and product acceptance test decision  generated by analysis engine . Further, there can be a separate servers or computer devices associated with user manager  that work in concert to provide data in usable formats to parties and\/or a separate layer of control in the data flow between the wireless devices , , ,  and user manager .","Additionally, apparatus  includes analysis engine  that analyzes product acceptance data  and generates product acceptance decision  as to whether or not the respective wireless device , , ,  achieves predetermined communications processing standards  associated with predetermined network communications scenarios . For example, the analysis performed by analysis engine  may compare select portions of product acceptance data  with select portions of predetermined communications processing standards  to see whether or not the data falls within the standards. The selected predetermined communications processing standards  may be a minimum value, a maximum value, a range of values, a predetermined value, and combinations thereof. Further, after performing an initial analysis on an initial set of product acceptance test data , analysis engine  may initiate further communications with one or more wireless devices , , ,  to retrieve additional data related to product acceptance test data, or to initiate simulation of additional test scenarios  and generation of new product acceptance test data. Analysis engine  may repeat such a feedback loop until a predetermined solution is achieved, i.e. until a set number of tests are run and the results confirmed. Analysis engine  may include hardware, software, firmware, and combinations thereof for analyzing and processing product acceptance data . Additionally, analysis engine  may further include algorithms, decision-making routines, statistical programs, etc. for analyzing and interpreting product acceptance data . Analysis engine  may be located anywhere in communication with apparatus , such as on user manager  or on a respective wireless device , , , .","In another embodiment, referring to  for example, apparatus  () may include wireless network  connected to a wired network  via a carrier network . The use of cellular telecommunication pathways has been increasing because wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d), communicating packets including voice and data over the wireless network. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones have installed application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) onto their local computer platform that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the cellular telephone, and control certain functionality on the device.  is a representative diagram that more fully illustrates the components of a cellular wireless network and interrelation of the elements of one embodiment of the present apparatus. The cellular wireless network is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules, such as wireless devices , , , , communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components of a wireless network , including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and\/or servers. On a LAN network , user manager  can be in communication with a separate data repository  for storing the data gathered from the remote wireless devices , , , , such as device product acceptance data . Further, a data management server  may be in communication with user manager  to provide post-processing capabilities, data flow control, etc. Product acceptance data-gathering user manager  and, in this embodiment, product acceptance database , and data management server , may be present on the cellular data network with any other components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services. User manager , and\/or data management server  communicate with carrier network  through a data link , such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. Carrier network  controls messages (generally being data packets) sent to a mobile switching center (\u201cMSC\u201d) . Further, carrier network  communicates with MSC  by a network , such as the Internet, and\/or POTS. Typically, in network , a network or Internet portion transfers data, and the POTS portion transfers voice information. MSC  may be connected to multiple base stations (\u201cBTS\u201d)  by another network , such as a network and\/or Internet portion for data transfer and a POTS portion for voice information. BTS  ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods.","In operation, referring to , one embodiment of a method for product acceptance testing on a wireless device includes loading at least a portion of a product acceptance test application onto a computer platform of the wireless device (Block ). For example, the product acceptance test application may be embodied within the hardware and\/or firmware of the wireless device during the manufacture of the device. Alternatively, the product acceptance test application may be \u201cpushed\u201d by a user manager to the wireless device, or \u201cpulled\u201d from a user manager by the wireless device, across a wireless network. In another alternative, the loading of the product acceptance test application may be configurable in any manner, for example, being initiated by a predetermined event, such as failing an associated test.","Further, this embodiment of the method includes simulating communications between the wireless device and another device associated with a wireless communications network (Block ). For example, the product acceptance test application may include one or more simulation modules, such as a network simulator module and a handset simulator module. Each of these simulator modules may simulate network-specific or external communications and handset-specific or internal device communications, respectively, that are received by a communications processing engine of the wireless device. Further, these simulated communications may be associated with a predetermined network communications test scenario, which may correspond to a predetermined communications processing standard.","This embodiment of the method also includes collecting product acceptance data associated with processing of the simulated communications by the wireless device (Block ). For example, the product acceptance data is data generated by the communications processing engine of the wireless device during the processing of the simulated communications. The product acceptance test application may execute to cause the product acceptance data to be collected on a memory of the wireless device.","Additionally, the method includes forwarding the collected product acceptance data for analysis to determine a product acceptance decision (Block ). For example, the collected product acceptance data may be obtained from the communications processing engine and stored in a memory of the wireless device for analysis on the computer platform of the device, or for forwarding across the wireless network for analysis by another computer device, such as a user manger. Further, in one embodiment, the collected product acceptance data is uploaded from the wireless device through a standard HTTP, an FTP or some other data transfer protocol.","Further, this embodiment of the method includes determining the product acceptance decision (Block ). For example, the product acceptance data may be analyzed by an analysis engine associated with a user manager located across the wireless network from the wireless device. Alternatively, the analysis engine may reside on the wireless device. In one embodiment, the analysis engine may compare selected portions of the product acceptance data with selected portions the predetermined communications processing standards to decide whether or not the data achieves the standard. If the data does achieve the standard, then the product acceptance decision indicates a positive result, i.e. that the wireless device passes the corresponding test or standard. If the data does not achieve the standard, then the product acceptance decision indicates a negative result, i.e. that the wireless device fails the corresponding test or standard. Additionally, the product acceptance decision may be a summary decision based on more than one set of product test data, i.e. if there are a number of test scenarios that need to be run for a given standard. As such, the product acceptance decision may be based on an analysis of a plurality of test results, and a positive result may occur when each of the plurality of tests and\/or standards are achieved.","Additionally, it should be noted that the method may include granting access to the product acceptance data to other business or commercial systems. To ensure the security and\/or integrity of the collected product acceptance data, such access may be granted in a monitored fashion such as through a user manager. Further, other computer devices, including both storage and processing devices, can be located across the wireless network from the wireless device, and accordingly, the architecture associated with the user manager is readily scalable.","In summary, the apparatus can be implemented solely on the wireless device , , , . The wireless device can have at least one application or agent resident (either permanent or temporarily) on the computer platform  thereof which causes the gathering of product acceptance data  from communications processing engine , and which can effect selective transmission of the product acceptance data for that wireless device to another computer device (such as user manager ) on the wireless network . If the wireless device , , ,  is so embodied, product acceptance data  may be transmitted over an open communication connection from the wireless device , , ,  to the wireless network , such as an open voice or data call. If the wireless device is a cellular telephone  and the wireless network is a cellular telecommunication network, such as shown in , product acceptance data  can be transmitted through short message service or other wireless communication methods.","In view of the method being executable on computer platform  of a wireless device , , , , the method includes a program resident in a computer readable medium, where the program directs a wireless device , , ,  having a device platform  to perform the steps of the method. Such a program can be executed on any single computer platform, or can be executed in a distributed way among several computer platforms.
