title: Voice mail caller identification
abstract: A notification system for providing unified alerts about messages left for a user in a communication system is coupled to a voice mail service in an office. When voice mail messages are left for a user, the voice mail service sends header information about the new message to the notification system. The notification system sends a notification of the new messages to a wireless device configured and selected by the user for receiving message notifications. Depending on the type of wireless device, the notification may include a link to a dialer application with which the wireless device can be connected to the voice mail service for selectively listening to the messages of interest. From the new message, the notification system may further extract information about the message sender, and use it to attempt to retrieve the sender's name from the user's personal contact list, for example. This information can then be included in the message header information sent to the user.

Their capabilities for providing access to messages are, however, rigidly fixed and quite limited. For example, a typical PBX system may provide a user with a voice mail box and allow the user to access messages in the mail box by calling a number within the PBX. Some systems allow users to access messages in their mail box when they are away from the office by dialing a phone number through the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In either event, access to individual voice mail messages, if there are several, can be quite time-consuming as the user has to listen through each message from the first to the last, many of which may not be of much importance to the user. There is no way for the user to know ahead of time which message in a group of messages are important unless the user has already listened to all the messages. Further, unless the user deletes messages, they will accumulate in the user's mail box, thus making the process of finding important messages even more problematic and time-consuming.","Meanwhile, as workers become more mobile, remote access to voice mail becomes more important. However, the problems inherent in conventional voice mail systems, coupled with the demands of attending to business tasks while away from the office, make the experience of accessing messages even more unpleasant.","The present invention relates to a method and system for personalized and selective remote access to enterprise messages.","In one example of the invention, a notification system is coupled to a voice mail service in an office. When voice mail messages are left for a user, the voice mail service sends header information about the new message to the notification system (caller's phone number, time received, length of message, etc.). The notification system sends a notification of the new messages (or perhaps only a subset thereof, in accordance with preferences established by the user) to a wireless device configured and selected by the user for receiving message notifications. Because the user is provided header information concerning voice mail messages, the user can determine which messages may be of most interest. Depending on the type of wireless device, the notification may include a link to a dialer application with which the wireless device (e.g. WAP-enabled cell phone) can be connected to the voice mail service for selectively listening to the messages of interest. From the new message, the notification system may further extract information about the message sender, and use it to attempt to retrieve the sender's name from the user's personal contact list, for example. This information can then be included in the message header information sent to the user.","In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a method for managing messages provided to a user in an enterprise includes receiving header information concerning a new message associated with the user in the enterprise, updating a list of message information for the user based on the received header information, preparing a notification based on the updated list of message information, and sending the notification to a wireless device associated with the user.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, an apparatus for managing messages in an enterprise including a messaging system adapted to store voice mail messages of callers to a user includes a notification server adapted to be coupled to the messaging system for receiving header information regarding new voice mail messages associated with the user, the notification server being adapted to maintain a list of voice mail messages in accordance with the received header information and to send a notification based on the maintained list to a wireless device associated with the user.","The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings, which are provided as illustrative examples of the invention so as to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Notably, the implementation of certain elements of the present invention may be accomplished using software, hardware or any combination thereof, as would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and the figures and examples below are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. Moreover, where certain elements of the present invention can be partially or fully implemented using known components, only those portions of such known components that are necessary for an understanding of the present invention will be described, and detailed descriptions of other portions of such known components will be omitted so as not to obscure the invention. Further, the present invention encompasses present and future known equivalents to the known components referred to herein by way of illustration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As can be seen, an office  (i.e. an enterprise) includes a PBX  that connects a plurality of office phones  and a voice mail (VM) service . The PBX  can be, for example, a Meridian 1\u2122 PBX switch from Nortel Networks. The VM service  can be, for example, a CallPilot\u2122 messaging system from Nortel Networks. In one example, VM service  maintains voice mailboxes in folders  for each of the phones , which mailboxes may be identified with the same phone numbers associated with phones  (e.g. a 4 or 5 digit extension), and includes an Interactive Voice Response system (IVR) for interacting with, and thereby allowing callers to record and play messages to and from the mailboxes.","Office  further includes a local area network (LAN)  (such as an Ethernet LAN) that connects a plurality of office PCs  with a contacts server . Contacts server  can be implemented by a Microsoft Exchange Server, for example, and PCs  can include client functionality such as Microsoft Outlook for receiving, storing and manipulating information in contacts lists  via LAN . The VM service  is further coupled to the LAN . A notification system  in accordance with the present invention is further coupled to the PBX  and the LAN . The notification system  and VM service  both also communicate with PBX  to receive and handle phone calls from within and outside the office  via their respective IVRs.","The office  is coupled to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) via the PBX  and to the Internet via a firewall\/router  (both connections may be accomplished using a common collection of lines, for example, as should be apparent to those skilled in the art). The office  is connected to a plurality of PSTN phones  via the PSTN and a plurality of Internet appliances  (e.g. a PC, laptop, handheld or other wired device having browser functionality for communicating with remote devices using conventional protocols such as HTTP) via the Internet. The office  is also connected via the Internet for providing text messages to a plurality of wireless devices  (e.g. one-way and two-way pagers, WAP and\/or SMS-enabled cell phones and PDAs, etc.) via their wireless operators  (using protocols such as HTTP and SMTP, etc.). Preferably, the firewall\/router  includes security extensions for providing secure access between the notification system  and wireless operators  via the Internet.","Generally, the present invention allows a user having a voice mail box within the office environment to receive notification of new messages (or only filtered ones thereof) on their wireless device such as a WAP-enabled cell phone. The notification can include header information of new messages received (e.g. person from\/phone number from, time received, length of message) so that the user can determine which of the voice mails require more urgent attention. The present invention provides a wireless device interface (e.g. interface to a WAP-enabled PDA or a browser on a computer coupled to the notification server via a network such as the Internet) that allows the user to access and view the notification of messages received and to select only certain of the stored voice mails for listening. The notification can further include a link to a dialer application for automatically calling a light-weight voice mail interactive voice response (IVR) service of the notification system, which service allows the user to listen to only the certain stored voice mails that were previously selected by the user.","It should be noted that not all of the \u201coffice\u201d components shown in  need be included in the invention, nor need they be located at the same physical site. For example, the components may be located in different buildings. Other configurations may include shared or \u201cvirtual\u201d PBX functionality that is available to different customers, who may or may not be located in the same office space, or no PBX functionality need be included at all. Moreover, although the above describes an example implementation in which selective remote access to enterprise voice mails is provided, the invention is not so limited and selective remote access to other types of message feeds may be provided additionally and\/or alternatively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As shown in , a notification system  includes a notification server , a user information store , a message information store , a voice mail (VM) interface , an interactive voice response (IVR) interface  (e.g. including hardware and drivers such as that provided by Dialogic and software built on tools provided by Opus Maestro), a contacts interface , a network interface  (e.g. an Ethernet Interface) and a wireless interface .","In one example of the invention, the components of the notification system illustrated in  are commonly provided in a Windows NT server (e.g. a Compaq ProLiant series server computer running Windows NT 4.0), with certain of the components provided as add-in cards and certain other of the components provided as software modules, or combinations thereof. Although shown separately for clarity of the invention, it should be understood that the user information store  and the message information store  may be commonly provided in a relational database such as a Sybase SQL database. It should be further noted that other types of server platforms are possible.","It should be noted that the system can include administrator interface functionality and administrative information storage for providing underlying configurations that are used by the notification system, which configurations may or may not include information stored in user information store  (e.g. user names, associated desk phone numbers, associated mailbox numbers, desktop PC addresses, etc.) and wireless operator information (e.g. URLs to HTTP servers or e-mail servers associated with the operators, CLID unblocking information, etc.).","Generally, the notification server  continuously receives voice mail header information from VM service  via voice mail interface . When a new message for a user is received, notification server  causes the contacts interface  to look up contact information about the sender (e.g. the sender's name) from the user's personal contact list. The notification server  stores this message header information (including any additional sender information it could obtain) in message information store . Notification server  then, either spontaneously or in response to a request from the user, causes wireless interface  to send a notification to the user's wireless device (perhaps after verifying whether it is a priority message that the user is interested in knowing about) including a list of the messages received, which list also may be tailored depending on priorities and user preferences, and the header information associated with each message. Any additional content of the message notification may depend on what type of wireless device the user has configured and selected for receiving message notifications. For example, when a new voice mail is received for the user, and if the user has chosen to receive message notifications on a pager, the notification may only contain the name and phone number of the sender. On the other hand, if the chosen device is a WAP-enabled cell phone, notification server  may include URL links with which the user can automatically call the IVR interface .","User information in store  can include the user's office phone number and\/or mailbox number (e.g. a four or five digit extension), the paths to where the user's contacts information is stored in the office (e.g. the paths to the user's folders in contacts lists  maintained by the server ) the paths to where the user's voice mail messages are stored (e.g. the paths to the user's mailbox in VM folders  maintained by VM ), the phone numbers\/addresses of the user's devices and information concerning wireless operators for any of the devices that are wireless. It should be noted that the user may configure more than one device for receiving alerts, in which case the notification server  should include user interface functionality (e.g. an HTTP server for communicating with a user's browser via the LAN  or the Internet) for dynamically configuring or changing configurations of devices, and for allowing the user to select between the different devices, as well as the user's current indication of whether to receive alerts via any of the devices. The information in store  can further include an indication of the user's status and\/or whether or not the user is presently interested in receiving message notifications.","Moreover, the information in store  can include filters for determining what types of messages the user is interested in receiving notifications about. These filters can be based on the identity of the sender of the message and\/or the contents of the message (e.g. keywords in the subject line, or a priority flag in the message), for example. In this event, the notification server  can also include user interface functionality (e.g. an HTTP server for communicating with a user's browser via the LAN  or the Internet) for allowing the user to configure and\/or change their message notification filters and\/or preferences.","Message information in store  can include the header information (e.g. a unique identifier of the message, person from\/phone number from, time received, length of message) of new messages received for each user (and perhaps after filtering in accordance with user preferences from store ). Notification server  continually updates this information in response to voice mails received by the voice mail service  and forwarded to the notification server from VM interface . It should be noted that in addition to information about new messages received, the voice mail service  can provide information about voice mail messages that have been listened to and\/or deleted by the user, in response to which information the notification server can delete the header information associated with such messages.","Voice mail interface  communicates with VM service  via TCP and using a standard messaging interface such as Internet Messaging Application Protocol (IMAP), for example. In an example of the invention where the VM service  is a CallPilot unified messaging system, such a system can be configured to send voice mail header information for selected mailboxes to a networked or otherwise connected device such as notification server . The header information may include, for example, the phone number of the caller who left the message (which may only be available for in-office phone messages, or from phones with which caller ID information was available), the time the message was received, and the length of the message. The header information may further include an indication of whether the caller marked the voice mail message as urgent, and a unique identifier of the voice mail by which it is stored in voice mail folders . Notification server  can use this received header information to compare against filters established by the user to determine whether a notification about the associated voice mail should be sent.","Voice mail interface  is the component of the notification system that interfaces with the network or connection for receiving the voice mail header information and for forwarding the received information to the notification server . Voice mail interface  further communicates with VM service  to retrieve and play back stored voice mail messages in response to user selections via the IVR interface , as well as to request deletion or other handling of stored voice mail messages as will be explained in more detail below.","Contacts interface  communicates with contacts server  via the LAN  and an interface such as the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) from Microsoft or standard interfaces such as LDAP or IMAP to attempt to learn more information about persons who leave messages. For example, when a new message is received and forwarded to notification server  by VM interface , notification server  extracts the phone number associated with the sender of the message (if any is received from VM interface ) from the header information. Notification server  also gets the path information from user information store  to the user's contacts list maintained by the contacts server . The notification server  provides this path information, along with the phone number of the sender of the message (if any could be obtained) to the contacts interface . The contacts interface  then uses this information to query the contacts server  for any matching entries in the user's contacts list, and if there is a matching contact entry, it retrieves the name associated with that phone number from the contacts server  and returns this information to the notification server . Notification server  can then use this contact information to augment the voice mail header stored in message information store .","It should be noted that the contacts interface  needs to be configured with the address of the contacts server  in the LAN . Moreover, although in this example of the invention the contacts interface  communicates with a Microsoft Exchange Server using MAPI\/CDO, it should be apparent that the contacts interface  may be configured differently or additionally to communicate with other types of systems in which a user's contact lists are maintained (e.g. LDAP).","Network interface  includes server functionality for interacting with clients in PCs  (e.g. using TCP protocol) and Internet PCs or devices  (e.g. using HTTP protocol). Such server-client functionality can include the ability to request and display the user's voice mail header information from store  via server . Such server-client functionality can further include the ability to play back selected messages. For example, the list of voice mail headers may each have associated URLs that point to a script (e.g. CGI or servlet) application of notification server  that causes the notification server  to retrieve a .WAV file associated with the message from the VM service  (assuming the VM service can provide such files) via voice mail interface  and to stream it to the client via the network interface . It should be noted that the network interface can further include functionality for allowing the user to delete messages, and\/or perform other types of mailbox maintenance functionality, and the notification server can cause the selected actions to be requested from the VM service  via the voice mail interface .","Wireless interface  may include similar server functionality such as that discussed above for interacting with clients in wireless devices  (e.g. using WML pages exchanged over HTTP protocol between system  and wireless operators  via the Internet, and then exchanged over WTP protocol between the wireless operators  and the wireless devices ). Additionally or alternatively to the server-client functionality provided by network interface  for allowing a wireless user to request and display the user's voice mail header information, the server-client functionality provided by wireless interface  can include allowing a user to select which of the voice mail messages to be played back upon a subsequent phone call by the wireless device to the IVR interface . For example, when sending a list of voice mail headers to a wireless device such as an Internet-ready cell phone, the page sent by wireless interface  will cause the list to be displayed on the wireless device, as well as checkboxes next to each of the listed headers and a \u201cPlay Selected\u201d button (either simultaneously with the list of voice mails or after a user has check certain of the checkboxes). The \u201cPlay Selected\u201d button will cause a message to be sent back to wireless interface  containing an indication of the voice mail headers for which an associated checkbox was marked by the user on the wireless device, which indications will be forwarded to the notification server. The \u201cPlay Selected\u201d button will further cause a dialing application to be launched on the wireless device that will dial a number associated with the IVR interface . As will be described in more detail below, when the wireless device connects with the IVR interface , the notification server retrieves the user's voice mail selections and then retrieves the associated voice mails from VM service  via VM interface . The notification server then causes the selected voice mails to be played back to the user via the IVR interface .","Additionally or alternatively to providing server-client functionality for allowing a user to request notifications of their voice mail messages, notification server  can further causes message notifications to be spontaneously pushed via wireless interface  to the user's wireless device via an Internet gateway for the wireless operator associated with the specified wireless device. The wireless interface  pushes message notifications in a different manner based on the type of device on which they will be received. For example, where the wireless device is a WAP-enabled device (e.g. an Internet-ready cell phone), the wireless interface  may use the WAP Push protocol, in which the messages are posted as XML\/WML\/HDML documents using an HTTP protocol in accordance with a document type definition (DTD). Where the wireless device to receive the message is a one-way or two-way pager or PDA, the wireless interface may send the message to the wireless device gateway using the appropriate pager or wireless protocol.","As should be apparent, in order to access these devices for messaging, the system needs to be configured to recognize and communicate with the associated wireless operator for transferring text messages. For example, the system may be configured with the Internet address of the operator through which text messages are to be sent from the system using an HTTP or SMTP protocol. Users can be permitted to receive messages only with devices that are associated with these pre-configured operators. Additionally or alternatively, the wireless operator may need to provide functionality for understanding WAP Push feeds and for displaying them on the device.","As should be apparent from above, the content of the spontaneous notification message may depend on the type of wireless device the user has configured and selected for receiving message notifications. For example, if the user has chosen to receive message notifications on a pager, the message may only contain the name and phone number of the sender. On the other hand, if the chosen device is a WAP-enabled cell phone, notification server  may cause wireless interface  to include in the notification checkboxes and a \u201cPlay Selected\u201d button by which the user can launch an application to dial the IVR interface  and allow the user to listen to the messages selected on the cell phone.","IVR interface  is a lightweight IVR system that is programmed and configured in accordance with the present invention. A user can access the IVR interface  through a dialed phone number in the office  or through the PSTN. When the phone number is dialed through the \u201cPlay Selected\u201d button on a user's wireless device, the dialed sequence provided by the wireless interface  will preferably also include an \u201cunblock CLID\u201d prefix that causes the CLID information for the cell phone to be unblocked by the wireless operator if necessary. The \u201cunblock CLID\u201d prefix may vary per wireless operator and may be retrieved from user information store  by wireless interface . Accordingly, IVR interface  will be able to determine the phone number of the wireless device that has been connected to IVR interface  by the PBX . IVR interface  forwards the CLID information to notification server , which uses it to look up the user associated with the CLID. Once the user is known, the user's selections of voice mails to be played is also known (as determined from the message sent from the wireless device in accordance with the marked checkboxes via the wireless interface ). The notification server  then uses these selections to retrieve the corresponding voice mail messages from VM service  via VM interface . The selected messages are then played to the user via the VM interface .","It should be noted that the IVR interface can simply cause the selected voice mail messages to be sequentially played back, one after another, if more than one has been selected. Additionally or alternatively, the IVR interface may include basic playback functions such as fast forward, reverse, and skip. It should be further noted that the IVR interface can be further programmed to allow the user to delete messages, and\/or perform other types of mailbox maintenance functionality, and the notification server can cause the selected actions to be requested from the VM service  via the voice mail interface . Moreover, after the messages have been listened to by the user, IVR interface may inform notification server  such that the messages are deleted from the list of messages maintained for the user in message information store .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"As shown in , processing begins in block  where the system retrieves the user information from store , and configures VM interface  to determine whether information for any new voice mail messages associated with the user have been forwarded to the notification system by the VM service, for example by subscribing to voice mail events associated with the user's voice mailbox. This block can also include determining whether the user has selected to receive any message notifications at all in accordance with a current status, for example. If not, processing can pause at this block until the user has indicated that message notifications should be provided.","If a new message has been received (determined in block ), processing advances to block . Otherwise, processing returns to block . It should be noted that message events other than a new message received can occur, and that will require similar processing as described below. For example, if the user has deleted or listened to a voice mail, a message event will be triggered which may or may not cause the notification server  to update the list of voice mail messages pending for notification to the user.","In block , processing is performed to determine whether the new message is a type that the user is interested in receiving a notification about. There can be many ways that this determination is made. For example, the user may have configured his personal settings such that only messages marked urgent or only messages from certain priority contacts will result in a notice sent to the user. If the former, the notification system may need to compare the originating phone number with phone numbers associated with high priority callers that the user has configured. If the latter, the notification system may look at the header information to see if the caller marked the voice mail as urgent. It should be apparent that the user may also configured his settings so that a notice of all new messages is sent. If the new message is not a candidate for notification, processing returns to block . Otherwise, processing advances to block .","In block , an attempt is made to supplement the header information of the new message with as much identification of the sender as possible. This is done by extracting contact information associated with the sender from the user's personal contacts list or from other system directories. The received voice mail header information, whether or not supplemented, is then used to update the list of voice mail messages associated with the user in message information store .","Processing next advances to block  where it is determined whether a notification of the updated list of voice mail messages should be sent. This can be done by pre-configuration, by user preferences, or in response to user requests. For example, the system may be pre-configured to send notifications to all users immediately when a new message is received, or periodically after a predetermined period of time has elapsed (e.g. 15 minutes). Alternatively, such parameters can be changed for each user by user preference. Additionally or alternatively, notifications of received messages may be sent upon user request. If no notification is to be sent, processing returns to block . Otherwise, processing advances to block .","In block , it is further determined what type of wireless device the user has configured and selected for receiving message notifications. If the device is a type that can only display text (e.g. a one-way pager), then no further information will be added to the notification. Otherwise (e.g. the wireless device is a WAP-enabled cell phone), processing advances to block , where links for launching a dialer application is prepared for including in the message, which dialer application will automatically cause the wireless phone to be connected to the IVR service of the notification system, enabling a simple one-click response action on the user's part.","Processing advances to block , where the notification message is prepared with any additional information or links that the notification system was able to include in the message, and in block  the notification system forwards the notification to the user's wireless device. This block can include retrieving the user's device configuration and carrier settings from user information store  and providing this information to the wireless interface . The processing performed by wireless interface  can depend on the type of wireless device that the user has configured and selected for receiving notifications, and whether the notification is spontaneous or upon user request. In an example where the wireless device is a WAP-enabled cell phone, WAP push protocol may be used to send a spontaneous notification to the user's wireless device. This includes posting XML encoded documents using HTTP protocol. After the message alert is sent, processing returns to block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"As shown in , processing begins when a call to the phone number associated with the IVR interface  of the notification system is received (as determined in block ). When a user calls the system, the IVR interface gets the user's identification by, for example, associating the CLID information of the call with phone number information of each user stored in user information store  (block ). The notification system then checks to see whether the user previously submitted any message selections to the system, for example by marking checkboxes next to selected voice mail messages and sending the selections back to the notification server via the wireless interface  (block ). Processing continues to block  where the notification server retrieves the selected voice mail messages from VM service  (by requesting the message by its unique identifier provided in the voice mail header, for example), and then plays them back sequentially to the user via the IVR interface . When the user disconnects from the IVR interface , processing returns to block .","Although the present invention has been particularly described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it should be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that changes and modifications in the form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
