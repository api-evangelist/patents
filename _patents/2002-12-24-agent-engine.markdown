{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Other Embodiments"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/426,246, filed on Nov. 13, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The description relates to the field of computer science.","An agent (a \u201cproxy\u201d) refers to a set of code executable by a computer processor that may be used to perform one or more specific function(s) and also to learn from the agent's performance of those functions. Learning refers to a capability included in the agent that may be used to determine whether improvements may be made to the agent when performing subsequent actions.","Typically, the generation of an agent is performed manually, by a programmer. The programmer is given a set of input and output criteria and then creates the agent program to perform the specified functions (e.g. corresponding to the input\/output criteria).","According to an aspect of this invention, an agent engine includes a definition process, the definition process operable to define a data set associated with an objective, a library storing a set of components, the components comprising at least one of a pre-programmed application, object, algorithm, function, and data set definition, and an agent generator process, the agent generator process operable to define at least one agent that includes at least one component from the library, the at least one generated agent defined to perform a function related to the objective.","Described herein is an agent engine (AE) process and\/system that includes a configurable software architecture that may be used to achieve an objective. For example, the objective may be related to the analysis of data related to a function of a business entity, government entity, military entity, etc. The AE process may include one or more generated agents that are usable to perform different functions necessary to accomplish the business objective.","As used herein, the term \u201cKey Performance Indicator\u201d (KPI) refers to a performance indicator (e.g., a value, or range of values) of a data set. A KPI may also be used to determine performance of a generated agent(s) based upon an output of the generated agent, for example, to determine a possible modification to a generated agent to improve subsequent performance of the agent.","As used herein, the terms \u201cObjectives\u201d or \u201cBusiness Objectives\u201d may be used interchangeably. Objectives refer to a task or goal the AE is expected to achieve. \u201cDomain\u201d may refer to an objective or refer to a broader category of an objective. Exemplary objectives and domains include, but are not limited to, business, intelligence, decision-support, information needed and\/or performance objectives. At times, objectives are referred to as business objectives in order to facilitate the illustration of examples.","Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein may be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.","Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10","25","10","10"]},"In an embodiment, each generated agent is implemented such that the generated agent may be performed autonomously, e.g., without requiring intervention and\/or commands from another process or agent to start, stop and\/or control execution of the generated agent.","In one embodiment, agent engine  includes a multiple-layer architecture, where each layer may include one or more generated agent(s) to perform specific function(s) related to the business objective. Therefore, the multiple level architecture allows for multiple-level learning. Also, in an embodiment of the multiple-layer architecture, data and\/or a command may be passed from one level to the next level. The data and\/or the commands passed from a first level to a second level may be usable by the learning code included in the second level agent, etc.","In one general aspect, an agent engine refers to an architecture that may be customized to be domain specific through the definition of objectives, rules, KPIs, or using function calls that relate a generated agent to a single or distributed external system. In another general aspect, an AE may perform so-called intelligent (e.g., learning) performance monitoring of distributed information systems.","In yet another general aspect, an AE may be implemented as an application that is domain independent and may include intelligent analytical cognitive capabilities that are determined by recursive sensing and parameter and rule evolution. The AE may be used to provide a multi-purpose logic platform for local and\/or global business, organizational and\/or system performance monitoring, problem analysis, optimization and automated decision-making or decision support. The AE may cross-index operational, business process, tactical and strategic data for improvements, decision-making, and effecting operational rule changes or prompting action(s). The AE may learn cause and effect relationships through correlation and causal analysis for subsequent impact analysis and rule reinforcement or modification and\/or user alert. The AE may learn how to adapt rules (e.g., values or ranges of values) or the applicability (fitness) of certain rules. The AE may also be used to discover \u201chidden\u201d interdependencies that exist between information, thereby allowing the AE to make better associations, analyses and decisions. The AE may also include the capability to gauge the success of an evolved agent and\/or set of rules and may also include the capability of determining potential problems such as local optimization versus global optimization at discrete time intervals.","Exemplary uses of the AE include providing data outputs and\/or analysis to a user, monitoring performance of generated agents, issuing alerts and\/or effecting actions, and linking to other programs such as CRM, CRM Analytics, SCM, SCM Analytics, ERP systems, and BW systems.","Architecture of the AE",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","20","20","10","25","20","110","10","60"]},"In this embodiment agent engine  also includes three sub-processes, ,  and  that are used to execute, modify\/learn, and store results, respectively, from the agent(s) generated by wizard process . In more detail, main sub-process  may include a filter algorithm  to contextualize, route, filter, and\/or compare data inputs to KPIs and associated objectives. Main sub-process  may also include sensors (not shown) for sensing and translating data feeds to a generated agent. Main sub-process  may also include a data aggregator and association () for aggregating and correlating data. Main sub-process  may also include an analyzer  for analyzing data, and a modeler  for improving data and\/or rules. In more detail, main sub-process  may perform actions that improve (e.g., modify) rules performed by a generated agent. However, please realize that the AE may operate in a recursive and evolutionary manner, e.g., where rules and\/or data set definitions are modified at several levels of the AE architecture. Main sub-process  typically performs actions to evaluate (e.g., learn) rules and rule parameters that are predefined and\/or evolved such as certain action rules that are may change in reponse to detected data criteria. The modification capability of the AE system may perform actions to modify these defined rules based on an analysis of data outputs from previous iteration(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a ","b":["20","20","70","80","25","90","25","20","20","75"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b ","b":["60","20","60","61","61","62","64","66","68"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-3","i":["a ","b "],"b":["3","100","110","120","130","140","150","160","110","121","122","131","132","141","142","151","152","110","121","122","131","132","141","142","151","152"]},"In an embodiment, process  may generate and link multiple agents for an AE system. For example, process  may generate single agents for a first level in an AE architecture that interact with single or multiple agents at another functional level in the AE architecture. In this case, the AE architecture may implemented to generate and execute many agents (at least one agent at each level) that each interact with another agent in a defined and evolutionary relationship. In another embodiment, a single agent may be generated that incorporates the functions of at least two levels in an AE engine.","A first layer (or level)  of agent engine  is referred to as an Application Layer  (also referred to as a \u201cSystem Definition Layer\u201d). At this level, the business objective, i.e., the question to be answered, is received (and\/or defined). Also at this level, an initial set of parameters are received (and\/or determined) and the wizard process  is executed to define any KPIs, objects and rules for the generated agent(s). Application layer  may include a definition wizard sub-process  (see ), an interface wizard sub-process () that may relate data outputs from one agent to another agent in those cases where multiple agents are generated to achieve a business objective. Process Wizard process () may assist in definition of the objective and the customization of the KPIs, rules, and parameters. First layer  may also include a Rule and Optimization library .","A second layer  of agent engine  may be referred to as a Main System layer . Main system layer  may include sensors  for sensing and translating data feeds. Main system layer  may also include a data aggregator and associator  for aggregating and correlating data. Main system layer  may also include executable code to contextualize, route, filter, and\/or compare sensed data inputs to KPIs and objectives, an analyzer  to analyze data, and a modeler  to modify\/improve rules. Main system layer  may also include a planner\/decision component  to determine an execution action, and an executor  to cause execution of one or more generated agents. (Please realize that agent engine  is based, in part, or continued feedback and improvement to generated agent(s) based on the feedback). Therefore, generated agents produced by agent engine  may be performed multiple times so that feedback (e.g., results) are available to determine improvements to initial generated agents.","A third layer  of agent engine  is referred to as a Primary Rule and Parameter Layer . This layer typically includes code that is usable to perform rule and parameter maintenance. In more detail, third layer  may include code to determine after one or more iterations of agent engine  whether sensed and\/or aggregated data inputs result in performance and\/or business objective values that are within predefined or evolved limit ranges (the data inputs may be generated during processing in \u201creal-time, by batch, etc.) Third layer  may also include and use KPIs , rules , and\/or algorithms  to determine whether modifications to a generated agent (or generated rule) is required to improve agent engine . Agent engine  may also include determining an action to take based on the determined modification(s) to the generated agent. For example, a determined action may include creating a user alert, or verification of a variance between a data input and a KPI values, (e.g., determining a variance between an an expected value or value range associated with the KPI). The verification of a variance may be determined by using a program such as a fuzzy logic program , and\/or an Statistical Process Control (SPC) program  (SPC refers to a statistical evaluation mechanism using standard deviation that permits statistical process analysis, e.g., permitting monitoring of KPI value evolution over time).","A fourth layer  of agent engine  may be referred to as Rule and Parameter Modification\/Reinforcement Layer . Fourth layer  includes code to determine rule and parameter modifications and\/or reinforcements. Layer  may include a rule(s) , algorithm , and\/or optimization and utility functions  (for modification, reinforcement and\/or maintenance of a generated agent). Layer  essentially is intended to improve upon objects included in a generated agent, and\/or a KPI definition associated with a generated agent.","In an embodiment, one or more of the layers included in architecture  are executed in a repetitive fashion such that the functions of layer  may be performed using multiple sets of data outputs, thereby improving the business objective and their associated KPIs over time. Therefore, agent engine , and architecture , may be used to improve the modifications and\/or reinforcement determinations over time by adapting to additional information produced by one or more generated agents. One of the key premises of agent engine , and\/or architecture , is the recursive nature of the agent engine  process. Agent engine  may be considered \u201cdynamic\u201d, e.g., by considering the changing nature of its environment (hence the need to have the capability to maintain, reinforce, modify KPIs, rules and parameters) rather than making any static assumptions. Therefore, the agent engine process  allows an adaptive intelligent system that includes a capability to react (e.g., modify itself) to an environment as well learn from its environment.","Agent engine  includes a fifth layer  that may be referred to as Correlation and Learning System Layer . Layer  may include rules and algorithms  that may be used to analyze KPIs, rules, actions, cause and effect relationships and their relative effect over time. The primary purpose of layer  is to identify and evaluate patterns and interdependence between applications (e.g., generated agents) of certain rules and\/or actions with their associated parameters and the degree to which they are meeting initial or evolved KPI values (or value ranges). In more detail, layer  after identifying a correlation between applications, may pass  data and\/or a command to instruct layer  to reinforce, maintain and\/or modify a rule, action and\/or an associated parameter according to the identified correlation.","It is contemplated that there may be additional modification and learning system layers that would create several layers of meta-meta systems. With the addition of each layer, the engine would be able to affect a deeper level of analysis and self-instructed actions. Moreover, with additional meta-logic layers, one could analyze relationships and interdependencies between different business objectives, KPIs as well as rules and actions at the lower levels of the AE\u2014identify those and make those visible to the decision-maker and\/or feed lower level layers with action parameters for the optimization of rules and parameters. It could also validate the optimality\/relative fitness of lower level analysis, thus, providing an answer to the local versus global optimization problem.","Components of the AE","To effectuate the processes of the multi-layered architectural intelligent agent, the AE system may include one or more of the following, some of which are shown in , , , , , and : libraries , a definition Wizard , data feed connector\/translator , a main system  that may include a filter mechanism , data aggregation and association, analyzer , modeler for actions , and\/or actuator, a multi-level meta-logic layers , ,  for evolutionary rule maintenance and modification and learning, memory systems, and\/or journal.","Libraries, for these purposes, are sources of information. These libraries may be in the form of generic templates, industry generic templates, and template Wizards for use in the AE system. The generic templates may include objectives (e.g., business objective, compare contextual information, key words, scenarios, and analyze common features to previous instances such as replicate action based on common features), KPIs (e.g., hard definition, soft definition of conditions, and\/or quantitative limit range), standard rules\u2014domain specific rules, and standard action templates. Industry generic templates may include, business objectives, KPIs, standard rules, and standard action templates. Template Wizard with libraries may include business objectives, KPIs, rules (e.g., association rules, analytical rules, action rules, threshold rules, and fuzzy logic rules), data mapping rules, data association clustering rules, analysis templates, data correlation rules, algorithms, and standard Action templates. The templates of the library may be preprogrammed or programmable.","Definition Wizards are applications that may be used to assist the user in customizing any step of the AE process. The Definition Wizard, with commensurate User-interface, provides step-by-step domain application instructions to enable objective definition. In addition, Wizards may help in customizing objective to performance indicator definition, performance indicator to business object definitions, data feed definition, data association rule definition, data correlation rule definition, algorithm definition, analytical framework definition, threshold definitions (e.g., KPIs, evolutionary learning control degree handed over to AE, and threshold for automated actions and user alerts), Fuzzy Logic definitions, automated decision-making threshold definition, automated action definition, user alert definition, plain language intelligence topic definition that are mapped by way of a template down to data feeds and that are then correlated, contextualize and analyzed by the AE in order to provide alerts to user or at some stage an intelligence report with a summary as to how the AE analyzed the information so that the human reader may follow the information gathered and intelligence analysis conducted for him, and definition of information\/intelligence provision to the user defining how data analyzed by the AE is presented to the user which may include the presentation of different courses of actions with their associated analyzed comparative utilities.","Referring again to , Data Feed Connector\/Translator  may be implemented in a variety of ways depending on the AE's environment. For example, the Data Feed Connector\/Translator may include plug-ins, such as a table that translates the AE's information requirements to Remote Function Call, SQL query, or XML query requirements, or BAPIs.","Multi-level meta-logic layers , ,  (see and ), may be used for evolutionary rule maintenance, modification, and learning may be used to check on rule successes, validate, evolve or reinforce rules based on success and relative rule fitness.","Main System layer  (see and ) may include one or more processes. Each main system layer process may be domain specific and\/or use specific functions from a component in the library, or as defined by the wizard process . The Main System may include a filter mechanism (for functions such as simple KPI comparison, evolutionary KPI comparison, statistical process control, and Fuzzy Logic filtering and analysis); data aggregation and association (such as algorithms and hierarchical relational database); analyzer; modeler for actions (such as game theoretic analyzer, utility functions, and multiple course of action analysis with associated utility\/fitness' functions given an objective); and actuator (for functions such as user-alert, decision support analysis presented numerically and\/or plain language based on definitions, user defined automated action, automated action to other systems, automated action such as rule maintenance, reinforcement and\/or modification, and triggering other processes). An actuator may also identify performance enhancing opportunities, contextual information, and interdependencies; quantify earnings enhancement potential and\/or process improvements and the likely impact of decisions based on historic data and their interdependence; prioritize actions such as recommend and\/or issue resource allocation, alert, or action item, execute a decision automatically; effect change in execution rules or parameters; and prioritize according to service and\/or financial impact parameters.","Memory System layer (or subprocess , as shown in ) may include a process usable for short-term memory data storage, e.g., where information is held only between iterations of AE process . Short-term memory may include maintaining\/storing current system state data obtained through external data feed(s). This memory also maintains data, such as external feed and associated action rules applied, until the next iteration. Memory sub-process  may also include a capability to store so-called medium-term data, e.g., current applicable KPIs and rules subject to modification by the learning and modification layer. In an embodiment, associative memory may be used to store an audit trail of data association(s) between external data and system data such as rules applied to external data for action. This may be described as a requirement for learning, e.g., where a learning layer uses the associative memory to analyze the relative success rate of action rules. Memory sub-process  may include a capability to store so-called long-term data, e.g., an audit trail of data and\/or rules applied to data, and a relative success rate of a rule application after analysis by the learning system layer .","Different types of data may be stored in the various segments of a memory used by an AE, and for various durations, for example:\n\n","One possible approach to creating a memory system may be through Neural Networks.","The AE system may include a journal to keep a record of system states and analyses, as well as the modifications effected\u2014e.g., a track record of an AE system's history. The learning system may use the journal to look up data for longer-term data analysis, correlation, behavior and trend analysis. The AE may use the journal to notify the user of the reasons why it modified the system.","In addition to the embodiments of the logic and architectural components of the AE described herein, it should be noted that the AE could be implemented in different ways. For example, the AE may have a single database with different layers or a distributed architecture form, whereby the different modules described are stand-alone functional modules and interconnected by the logic as described. Moreover, all functional and logical modes are interdependent and may be linked through recursion over time.","General Attributes","An AE generated agent may be defined through the use of problem space specific rule, algorithm and optimization libraries and associated objective definitions facilitated by a preprogrammed standards (based on best practice OR, industry standard or competitive best practices methods, or performance indicators) and\/or through a user programmable wizard.","The AE may also include a primary application rule set that is recursively improved by a multi-hierarchical evolutionary modification and reinforcement learning system that represents meta-logic layers.","The AE may be customized or adapted by utilizing one or more of the following functions, properties, or actions:\n\n","Referring again to and , wizard process  includes receiving () a business objective from a user, and\/or determining () parameters so that an appropriate pre-programmed template may be used to define a data set and\/or executable code to achieve the business objective. Wizard process  may also include an inquiry (not shown) into sub-objectives, e.g., inquiring from a user or determining additional information that may be used to determine (e.g., define) the business objective and\/or supplement the objective.","In an exemplary situation, a user may input a specific business objective (it could also be a combination of business objectives that are processed in parallel, or the objective could be defined by an external system). In this case the user may want the AE to generate an agent(s) to achieve a business objective of \u201creducing capital bound in inventory\u201d. This is a common business objective (e.g., a problem), therefore \u201cReducing capital bound in inventory\u201d may correspond to an available business objective template component in library  and may be used by definition wizard  when generating an agent.","In another example, a user may input an objective of \u201creducing capital bound in finished goods inventory and checking an inventory level on a product\u201d (SKU level in connection with a single fulfillment warehouse site). In this case, the AE may generate an agent(s) that may use two types of inventory as data input: physical inventory days at a warehouse and logical inventory levels related to inventory ownership. In addition, the AE may generate an agent that may be used to detect slow moving inventory both in a business' warehouse as well as in a business' retail stores. If slow moving products are identified, the AE may include a promotional process to encourage sales of the slow moving products. Moreover, the AE may generate an agent that issues a \u201cpull\u201d order if it is determined the supply chain includes a fast moving item, in order to ensure that no stock-outs occur at retail stores and to ensure continuous revenue generation of products in demand.","The problem of minimizing capital bound in inventory has several sub-objectives and factors whose achievement determine the extent to which capital is bound in inventory. In this example, the sub-objectives related to the business objective may be characterized as follows:\n\n","The speed with which order are fulfilled by the supplier as well as by the fulfillment warehouse to the retailer and the speed with which the retailer is bringing products to the shelves; and","The degree of supply chain responsiveness (minima\/maxima range for suppliers to deliver as promised). The AE may establish the actual pattern of this responsiveness and could effect automatic reordering based on pre-defined and subsequently evolutionary supplier delivery performance criteria and patterns.","In order to improve a generated agent using an agent engine process (in this case minimizing capital bound in inventory), the AE may need to determine parameters during performance of wizard process :\n\n","Once the business objective (and any sub-objectives) is defined (), objects relating to the objective may be identified () and mapped into a relationship (e.g., using logic and\/or rules). The following objects are examples of the type of objects that would require mapping in the present example: supplier object, customer object, product object, sales order object, purchase order object, and invoice object.","Key performance indicators may be linked () to objectives. KPI's relate to information of business objects. KPIs may be defined by setting forth questions to the user. The users answers to those questions may relate to the business object for which data needs to be sourced. For example, in the present example, exemplary questions may be presented to the user:\n\n","The above questions may be translated into KPIs, which in turn may be related to a business object. Once the relationship to a business object is determined, data feeds  may be defined (), for example, by using a remote function call , an SQL query , or an XML document .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},"Once the KPIs are mapped by either the user or through the importation of a standard template (e.g., relating a standard KPI mapped to a specific business objective), the user may either confirm the standard KPI value definitions, if they have already been defined (e.g., standard value definitions could feature industry standard or competitive best-in-class KPI values), or modify existing and\/or enter new KPI value. The user may also choose whether to change a KPI value definition, for example, if the user is aware of existing value constraints or elect the value (or value range) as an initial KPI value, thereby, allowing for modification during performance of the AE. If the user chooses an initial definition of a KPI value, the AE may subsequently modify the KPI range based on detected data inputs with the aim of improving upon those initial KPI values, so that a business objective linked to the KPI may be improved.","KPIs are typically related to a business object . For example, a KPI that seeks to establish how fast products are moving may require combinatory information such as:\n\n","In the example of a KPI that is defined to determine how fast a company may fulfill in-time replenishment of stock at stores without ever running out of stock at the store (which might cause a loss of revenue) the objects needed to provide additional information may be:\n\n","These informational requirements may be mapped to specific business object information, and may be included in library .","Once the required business objects have been identified, the data sets required by each business object are identified . The data related to a business object may be obtained from an external application such as a CRM, an ERP, a BW, and\/or a SCM application by defining remote functions that call the information from the external application and import the data into the AE. This would define the data input into the AE from external application according to a defined objective.","Methods of importing external data include Remote Function Calls, SQL queries; XML queries; BAPIs (Business Application Programming Interface), business objects, any other type of query functions and formats, and defining plug-ins.","The Main System Layer ","In the main system layer , the AE may include code that may be used to perform multiple actions. For example, the main system layer may include sensing data based on defined objectives. The objectives may be user-defined objectives or they may be system objectives, for example, in cases where the AE is performing as an application layered between (or across) different applications and providing a service or a synchronizing and\/or intelligence function to those applications. In addition, the AE could be linked to other applications through BAPIs.","In the main system layer , the AE may translate and map the data so that it relates to the AE, for instance preparing external data feeds through aggregation and association between different tempo-spatial data sets. However, additional data translation and mapping may be required depending on the AE definition, the AE's data structure format, and the data structure format of external databases of external applications.","The AE may also perform functions of data association and correlation (for example, as part of main system layer , see and ). The goal of these functions is to detect relationships or associations between specific values of categorical variables in large datasets. This is a common task in many \u201cdata mining\u201d projects (and in a related subcategory referred to as \u201ctext mining\u201d.) Data mining and text mining refer to processes used by analysts and researchers to uncover hidden patterns in large data sets, such as \u201ccustomers who order product A, often also order product B or C\u201d or \u201cemployees who said positive things about initiative X, also frequently complain about issue Y but are happy with issue Z.\u201d The implementation of the so-called A-priori algorithm (see Agrawal and Swami, 1993; Agrawal and Srikant, 1994; Han and Lakshmanan, 2001; Witten and Frank, 2000) allows one to process rapidly huge data sets for such associations, based on pre-defined \u201cthreshold\u201d values for detection. In a given data set or data sets, the purpose of the analysis is to find associations between the data points, i.e., to derive association rules that identify the data points and co-occurrences of different data points that appear with the greatest (co-)frequencies or other such patterns.","Fuzzy Logic algorithms may also be applied to achieve Correlation Analysis, for example, employing fuzzy logic in conjunction with frequency analysis of correlation. In an embodiment, fuzzy logic may be applied in conjunction with frequency analysis, and\/or along with sensed condition analysis. In this case, the analysis may be applied to determine synpatic weight reinforcement (e.g, in a case of neural network employment) and\/or other types of reinforcement algorithms.","Cross-tabulation tables, and in particular Multiple Response tables may also be used to analyze data. However, in cases, such as unique data analysis, when the number of different items (categories) in the data is very large (and not known ahead of time), and when the \u201cfactorial degree\u201d of important association rules is not known ahead of time, then these tabulation facilities may be too cumbersome to use, or simply not applicable. The a priori algorithm implemented in Association Rules will not only automatically detect the relationships (\u201ccross-tabulation tables\u201d) that are important (i.e., cross-tabulation tables that are not sparse, not containing mostly zero's), but also determine the factorial degree of the tables that contain the important association rules.","The AE may be used to analyze simple categorical variables, dichotomous variables, and\/or multiple response variables. For example, the AE may use algorithms to determine association rules without requiring the user to specify the number of distinct categories present in the data, or any prior knowledge regarding the maximum factorial degree or complexity of the important associations. In a sense, the algorithm may be used to construct cross-tabulation tables without the need to specify the number of dimensions for the tables, or the number of categories for each dimension. Hence, this technique is particularly well suited for data and text mining of huge databases.","In addition, the AE may be used to generate agents usable to perform data association and correlation in a recursive and dynamic manner. The data aggregation, combination and correlation mechanism could take the form of algorithms that aggregate, combine and\/or correlate interdependent data. Logic for data aggregation, combination\/correlation could also be defined that uses indexable relational databases, in order to establish required data aggregation, combination and\/or correlation.","One purpose of data aggregation, combination and correlation is to identify data interrelationships and\/or interdependence that may be evaluated in their combination by the AE. This relationship between interdependent data is desirable in order to effectively analyze and improve an objective.","Data association and correlation may be driven by business objects that are linked to KPIs and ultimately to the business objective. For example, if the business objective and a resulting KPI indicates that a business object referred to as a \u201ccustomer account\u201d should be analyzed, the data association model may associate data related to a business object \u201ccustomer account\u201d. In more detail, an existing mechanism for a \u201ccustomer account\u201d used by an on-line web-site (e.g., served by a computer network) may check category of books are of interest to a particular customer or other customers fitting a similar customer profile. The association and correlation mechanism may include the capability for the following:\n\n","Main system layer  may also include a generated agent that may perform contextualization. In more detail, the AE may contextualize data in order to form a business objective optimization function. As in the case for data aggregation and correlation, this fixed definition, by way of a template definition, for example, may also be achieved through a data association and\/or contextualization algorithm that drives subsequently associated data mining actions or a relational database that indexes logical data association and\/or contextualization. Algorithms are known that may negotiate meanings to enable semantic interoperability between local overlapping and heterogeneous ontologies. The algorithms may reconcile differences between heterogeneous ontologies, or search for mappings between concepts of different ontologies. The latter algorithm is composed of three main steps: (i) computing the linguistic meaning of the label occurring in the ontologies via natural language processing, (ii) contextualization of such a linguistic meaning by considering the context, i.e., the ontologies, where a label occurs; (iii) comparing contextualized linguistic meaning of two ontologies in in order to find a possible match between them.","Main system layer  may also include code usable to perform routing functions to provide AE outputs such as analytical results, user role-generic alerts, automated action or any type of actionable intelligence to actors (which may be users or other information systems). The routing function is highly dependent on the domain in which the AE will be embedded, that is to say, to which use the AE is applied and with which other information systems the AE is to be associated or integrated. The routing function may require some mapping, for example, as to which input the AE will receive from which system, what actions the AE is required to perform, which outputs are required, and in which form to other actors (people and systems). For example, this routing could be achieved through systems integration or using a business connector type infrastructure. Another example of routing would require the domain specific definition of user interfaces, which presents the AE, sensed, analyzed information to users for action and\/or make the reasoning, as to the AE's decision-making, visible to the user.","Main system layer  may also include code usable to perform a filtering function. The filtering function may ensure that the AE acts only on data or datasets that fall outside either pre-defined, evolved or automatically analyzed range limits. This reduces the level of complexity of the data and may increase performance. However, if the data fall within any of these ranges, the higher level rule maintenance system will interpret data that fall within these KPI limits as a success (with a possibility of incorporating a rule as to the degree of success) based on its logic and rule to reinforce successful application of prior applied related rules when the observed result is that the KPIs fall within acceptable range limits. For example, in simple, pre-defined range comparison, the AE may check KPI range limits and interpret whether and\/or to which degree previous AE or external application actions have been successful. The pre-defined range definition may also serve as an initial training method as, for example, a business may wish to know the initial status of KPI after a first real data sensing, or a batch thereof. After the initial results, the KPIs may then be evolved.","In comparison to evolved KPI ranges, the AE may include code usable to evolve KPI range limits based on recursive analysis of data sets that have been linked to a KPI(s). The AE may check the relative success of prior AE or externally effected actions (by external systems or other actors) by comparing and relating prior action performed on data sets and linking these to the pertinent KPI parameters for validation. As a result, and depending on whether the KPI range has been met or not, the AE may reinforce prior decision-making and\/or action, and\/or reinforce or modify KPI range limits. Whether this reinforcement occurs may also be dependent on definitions in the AE's underlying rule system. Typically, however, if the data sensed after an action validates an existing KPI range both the KPI range as well as the decision-making is reinforced. If the KPI range limit is not met, the KPI limit may be modified, or if the user permits, the AE will mark and modify its decision-making model (such as modifying decision-making parameters) and\/or create a user-alert, depending on the AE's domain application.","Primary Rule and Parameter Maintenance Layer  (see and ) may include a Statistical Process Control (SPC), e.g., a statistical evaluation mechanism using standard deviation that permits statistical process analysis (e.g., permitting the monitoring of KPI value evolution over time), the AE may monitor the variance of KPI evolution over time as shown by Jeffery T. Luftig, Ph.D., in  (prior art), which depicts a graph showing SPC filter applied to and an AE acting on a KPI value falling outside a defined KPI range. This would largely automate the exception monitoring process as to KPI behavior. In this case, the AE would only act upon detected KPI values that fall either below the minimum or above the maximum limit of the SPC chart. This would be helpful for the AE as those KPI values that are above the upper SPC limit could immediately create reinforcement of rules that were responsible for the above average performance, whereby KPI values that fall below the lower limit could immediately create a user-alert or a required rule modification action. Of course, one could define whether in either case action will be affected upon a single occurrence of such nature or whether a number of SPC limit violations would be necessary to either reinforce or modify the rules.","Main system layer  may also utilize Fuzzy Logic filters. As an example, a website whose address one the world wide web (WWW) is \u201cprogramcpp.com\u201d and describes Fuzzy Logic as a tool used to \u201crepresent imprecise, ambiguous, or vague information. It is used to perform operations on concepts that are outside the definitions of Boolean logic. It is a superset of conventional Boolean logic that has been extended to handle intermediate values between \u2018completely true\u2019 and \u2018completely false.\u2019 It was introduced by Dr. Lotfi Zadeh, a professor at the University of California in Berkeley in 1965, as a means to model the uncertainty of the real world.\u201d","One example of the usefulness of Fuzzy Logic is in the situation of hierarchal KPIs (see for example ). A higher level KPI may have other KPIs as subsets. In order to satisfy the business objective, the critical KPI is the KPI that is logically closest to the business objective. The higher-level KPI value may still be optimal or within range even if one or more lower level KPIs fall below its range, indicating a potential problem; however, the still other lower level KPIs may perform above nominal values making the higher-level KPI actually perform above average and within its limits. The KPIs need not be hierarchically dependent as described above, as it could also be combinatory dependent.

Use of an AE system may more objectively evaluate such an objective. For example, an AE system may include a definition of what constitutes old (as well as different degrees of old) may be required with which the AE may be \u201ctrained\u201d using fuzzy logic definitions\/algorithms. In this case, fuzzy logic definitions may be necessary for \u201cintelligent\u201d evaluations of data sets.

In some embodiments, the modification layers  and  may comprise a single layer or more than two layers.","The modification layers  and  may be implemented as an intermediate process between the so-called learning system layer and the memory\/library layers. The modifications layer may be used to manage the modification of evolutionary KPIs and rules and the application of algorithms in the memory system once the learning system identifies a need for modification. The modifications layer may also be used to reinforce successful rules and maintain the SPC and the Fuzzy Logic filters. It may maintain and manage a rule set for rule evolution and application and\/or a rule set for KPI evolution, once they are triggered by the learning system. The modifications layer may be considered highly interactive with the learning system, e.g., the learning system layer may be \u201cadvised\u201d about any changes in the rules, KPIs and\/or parameters.","Rule Modification Layer  may include code (e.g., a generated agent) usable to apply a rule set and\/or KPI to data from Main System Layer . Rule Modification Layer  may also perform maintenance of SPC and Fuzzy Logic parameters. Rule Modification Layer  may also include a check as to whether the sensed associated and aggregated data inputs result in objective values that are within predefined or evolved limit ranges and then decide which action to take. Rule Modification Layer  may also reinforce rule sets of generated agents (e.g., application) that produced successful results (e.g., outputs). Rule Modification Layer  may also check with the secondary modification system layer as to which rules to apply if the previous rule application was unsuccessful. Rule Modification Layer  may also perform an action-effect analysis (i.e., what was the effect of a previous action?), on any modifications that have been made.","As depicted in , -, and - the AE may calculate  the degree to which data inputs falls inside or outside the KPI values. For example, a scenario might be that all KPI values  are met and the objective  is satisfied (which should logically follow if the KPIs are properly mapped to the objective). The AE may make observations  on the quality of the relationship between a PKI  and the objective  as well as between KPIs  for further reference. The layer using fuzzy logic may determine to what degree the objective has been met . If the objective has been met to a relatively high degree, the rules and the KPI range(s) that gave rise to this result may be reinforced with the option to narrow the KPI range either contemporaneously or after additional iterations that produce similar results. If the objective has been met to a medium-to-high degree of success, the AE may wait for subsequent iterations, in order to reinforce associated rules and the KPI limit range, before any modifications are made. If the objective has been met to a lower degree, the AE may observe this behavior over time and, at some stage, it may tweak a rule and\/or a KPI range. In certain situations, it may make a KPI more stringent. For example, if the KPI concerns supplier performance as to the lead-time of delivery of stock to a warehouse from the date an order is placed, the AE may make this KPI more stringent and, as an automated action, advise the supplier automatically (by e-mail and\/or electronic letter) that the lead-time requirement has been narrowed. This could also be achieved through an alert to the enterprise user, who would then manually effect this action and confirm this action to the AE.","In one embodiment, some KPIs may be met while other(s) are not, but the objective of the AE system is satisfied. For example, a layer using Fuzzy Logic may determine to what degree the objective has been met. The AE may investigate into the rules and data that are associated with the under-performing KPIs and determine whether the rules or KPI limits need to be revised and\/or what action should be effected. During this process, the AE may look up in its various memories whether any rules exist pertaining to this situation and what to do in cases where a particular KPI is under-performing. A response to the latter question could take the form of a user-alert, a request to the user to define a new rule for this purpose, or further instructions to itself and\/or peripheral systems.","In another example, the results output by a KPI may be determined as successful, while another is not, therefore, the objective is considered not satisfied. In this case, the AE may determine a degree by which the objective has not been satisfied. This degree may serve as a classification mechanism of what type of action the AE should take. If, for example, the objective has only marginally not been satisfied, then the AE may wait until after one or more iterations before taking any action. Alternatively, the objective may be classified as mission-critical, in which case the AE will act even on this marginal failure to meet the objective.","If some KPIs are met, but the objective is not satisfied due to the fact that the other KPIs that are linked to the objective are under-performing to a degree that the combinatory result of the KPIs linked to the objective give rise to the objective not being met, the AE may utilize the following actions (hard coded or soft coded or user-defined) options:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0201"},"figref":"FIGS. 7","i":["a ","b "],"b":["7","710","712","714","716","718","720","730","740","742","744","746","748","750","710"]},"Functions of the Rule and Parameter Layer  (see and ) may be distributed over more than a single layer, and may be used to manage multiple KPIs and different types of rule sets in an evolutionary and selective manner.

The secondary modification system may consider the relationships, interdependence and correlation between the objectives taking into account the information gathered from the recursive actions of the primary modification system.","The use of meta-logic layers may be used to improve objectives and KPIs over time. Because of this, the AE may improve actions, decision-making, and support information provisions by adapting to new information. In light of the role of the secondary modification system of the AE, new data maps, templates, KPI relationships, and rules that govern dataset interdependence and interrelationships may be defined, redefined and put into effect . Through this procedure, global optimization  may be achieved.","Correlation and Learning System layer  (see ), may include code to analyze an entire system after each iteration, or after multiple iterations. This permits dynamic global system analysis. The learning system layer may analyze the success of rule application after each iteration locally and globally. The learning system layer may apply Evolutionary Algorithms and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to ensure that rules applied by the modification system do not lead to rule and, subsequent, systemic canalization. The learning system layer may analyze cost-benefits of certain rules using utility functions and game theoretic approaches, analyzes SPC evolution over time, checks on the validity of Fuzzy Logic parameters, provide rule enforcement\/discarding after global analysis, and rate the success of rules and decide on their utility.","Correlation and Learning System layer  may be divided into two layers, one as the primary learning system and another as the secondary learning system. The primary learning system may compare, analyze, and retain the modeled action outcome with the actual data feedback on the next iteration(s). It may feed modification requirements based on learning system analysis to the primary\/secondary modification systems. It may also feed the secondary learning system as to pattern recognition.","Correlation and Learning System Layer , the relationships (hidden or otherwise), interdependencies and correlation analysis are explored between the various KPIs, filters, decision-making actions, actions, and\/or the objective. Moreover, at this level, the AE may consider relationships and interdependence between the instant objective and other objectives and domains and their possible effect on the instant objective. The AE may also learn cause and effect relationships, for example, through correlation analysis. As a process or action moves from one state to another, events at different levels (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.) impact the process flow. The AE adapts to its environment by learning to understand multi-layered cause and effect relationships that determine the effectiveness of a process to be performed. The AE system learns the options for influencing the process.","Correlation and Learning System layer  may be used to analyze pertinent successes of rule application by the system and guide the reinforcement of successful rules and the discarding of unsuccessful rules. Correlation and Learning System layer  may directly feed the secondary modification system with information. Correlation and Learning System layer  may perform utility and fitness analyses and may associate those with the use of algorithms. Since reinforcement may lead to undesired rule canalization, Correlation and Learning System layer  may also introduce genetic algorithms and provide those to the secondary modification system and check on their relative success. Effective learning may require a degree of experimentation to evolve successfully much like the human brain.","The AE system has the ability to modify rules and\/or generated agents and evaluate those modifications based on subsequent outputs (e.g., results). In addition, the AE system may learn over time which rules and\/or actions (with their associated parameters) will meet a defined KPI, as well as learn which KPIs (modified or otherwise) are best associated with a particular objective, and learn relationships\/associations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0210"},"figref":["FIGS. 9","FIGS. 11"],"i":["a","b","a","b","b","a","b","a ","b "],"b":["9","10","10","1","10","2","11","12","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0211"},"figref":"FIGS. 13","i":["a ","b "],"b":"13"},"Table 7 shows an exemplary map for an AE infrastructure, including resources that may be used in the construction of the AE system.","The AE's Exemplary Functions and Commensurate Resources Used:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0213"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Objective","Objective",{},{}]},{"entry":["definition","Evaluation","KPI definition","KPI evaluation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Templates","Fuzzy Logic","Templates","Fuzzy Logic"]},{"entry":["Wizard","SPC","Wizard","SPC"]},{"entry":["AE: evolved","Templates","AE: evolved KPI","Templates"]},{"entry":["objective",{},"(optional)"]},{"entry":"(optional)"},{"entry":["AE: establishing,","Wizard","AE:","Wizard"]},{"entry":["mapping and",{},"establishing,"]},{"entry":["analysis of",{},"mapping and"]},{"entry":["interdependent",{},"analysis of"]},{"entry":["objectives)",{},"interdependent"]},{"entry":[{},{},"KPIs)"]},{"entry":[{},"Rules (AE-",{},"Rules (AE-"]},{"entry":[{},"evolvable)",{},"evolvable)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Filter","Analysis","Decision-making","Actioning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["SPC","Utility","Utility","Templates"]},{"entry":[{},"Function","Functions"]},{"entry":["Fuzzy Logic","Fuzzy Logic","Game Theoretic","Wizard"]},{"entry":[{},"Analysis","Algorithm"]},{"entry":["Rules (AE-","Comparative","Behavioral","User alerts"]},{"entry":["evolvable)","Analysis","Learning"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Algorithm"]},{"entry":["On\/off switch for",{},"Anticipatory","Rule and"]},{"entry":["Fuzzy Logic",{},"Economic Agents","parameter"]},{"entry":["and\/or SPC",{},{},"maintenance,"]},{"entry":["and\/or other",{},{},"reinforcement,"]},{"entry":["rules",{},{},"modification"]},{"entry":["Templates","Templates","Linear","AE- evolvable"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Optimization","parameters"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Algorithms","and rules"]},{"entry":["Wizard","Wizard","Non-Linear"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Optimization"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Algorithm"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"First level meta"},{"entry":"Layer responsible"},{"entry":"for recursive"},{"entry":"success, rule,"},{"entry":"parameter"},{"entry":"evaluation and"},{"entry":"adaptation"},{"entry":["Reinforcement","Action Rules","Markov Decision","Adaptive"]},{"entry":["learning","(Thresholds,","Processes","Logic"]},{"entry":["algorithm","limits.
