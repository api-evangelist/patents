Many treatments exist but severe side effects and limited survival rate are pushing the research community into new approaches for treatments.","Cancer is a disease marked by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Cancer cells have overcome the barriers imposed on normal cells, which have a finite lifespan, to grow indefinitely. As the growth of cancer cells continue, genetic alterations may persist until the cancerous cell has manifested itself to pursue a more aggressive growth phenotype. If left untreated, metastasis, the spread of cancer cells to distant areas of the body by way of the lymph system or bloodstream, may ensue, destroying healthy tissue.","According to a recent American Cancer Society study, approximately 1,268,000 new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in the United States in the year 2001 alone. Lung cancer is the most common cancer-related cause of death among men and women, accounting for over 28% of all cancer-related deaths. It is the second most commonly occurring cancer among men and women; it has been estimated that there were more than 169,000 new cases of lung cancer in the U.S. in the year 2001, accounting for 13% of all new cancer diagnoses. While the rate of lung cancer cases is declining among men in the U.S., it continues to increase among women. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 157,400 Americans were expected to die due to lung cancer in 2001.","Cholesterol in Cell Membrane Activity","Cells require a flexible, permeable, fluid, active membrane. The cell membrane, which defines the cell and boundaries of cell organelles, is generally composed of lipid-cholesterol, phospholipids, sphingolipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Cholesterol plays an important role in the flexibility, the fluidity, and the permeability of the membrane and the maintenance of these properties across a range of temperatures.","Cholesterol Synthesis and Uptake","Mammalian cells receive cholesterol through uptake of exogenic cholesterol and endogenous synthesis.","Exogenic uptake is mediated by specific receptors on the membrane itself; cholesterol is adsorbed from body fluids in contact with the cell. This uptake occurs through endocytosis of lipoprotein particles that contain cholesterol. The isomerization process of the phosphatidylcholine () CC double bond cis\/trans allow phospholipids with low density lipoprotein to contain specific receptors for cholesterol adsorption. Most animal cells acquire cholesterol by receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoproteins that contain cholesterol to form endosomes which migrate to lysosomes for degradation and release of cholesterol into the cell.","By contrast, endogenous synthesis requires substantial energy. The synthesis of sterols (cholestane, vitamin D, and cholesterol) starts with squalene. Typically, cholesterol synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm of liver and intestinal cells through hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase).","During the last three decades, cancer treatment was mainly focused on using cytotoxic products attacking both tumor and normal cells. There is therefore a need to finding additional targeted therapies to treat cancer with fewer side effects as compared to conventional therapies.","The invention features a substantially pure preparation of a compound described by the formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"42.25mm","wi":"71.12mm","file":"US08293726-20121023-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In formula (I), each of R, R, and Ris, independently, selected from OH, SH, and NH; the stereochemistry at positions 3, 5, and 6 is either 3\u03b1, 5\u03b2, 6\u03b2 or 3\u03b2, 5\u03b1, 6\u03b1; each of R, R, R, R, R, R, and Ris, independently, selected from H, OH, SH, and NH.

There are many methods by which the sitosterol can be oxidized to prepare 24-ethyl cholestane 3,5,6 triol. In one such method, sitosterol is oxidized by reaction with periodate in the presence of osmium tetroxide.","If desirable, the compounds and compositions of the invention can be components of kits.

Either the commercially available enzyme can be used or the sitosterol or 24-ethyl-cholestane-3,5,6-triol can be incubated in liver microsomes or fermented in a microbial culture. See, for example, Ambrus et al., 60:621 (1995); Aringer L., 257:13720 (1982); Mahato et al., 196:629 (1981); Aringer et al., 17:263 (1976); and Aringer et al., 14:563 (1973).","The reaction of an olefin with osmium tetroxide, described above, is the most reliable method for cis-dihydroxylation of a double bond, particularly for preparation of cis-diols. Cis-dihydroxylation of olefins may also be achieved using permanganate or silver iodoacetate according to Woodward's procedure. A variety of synthetic conditions and oxidizing agents are known to be capable of cis-hydroxylation of an olefin and may be used in the synthesis of the compounds of the invention. See, for example, VanRheenen et al., 6:342 (1988); Vol. 58, p. 43 (1978).","Protection and Deprotection of Reactive Groups","The synthesis of compounds of the invention may include selective protection and deprotection of alcohols, amines, and\/or sulfhydryls functional groups. For example, commonly used protecting groups for amines include carbamates, such as tert-butyl, benzyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2-trimethylsilylethyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, allyl, and m-nitrophenyl. Other commonly used protecting groups for amines include amides, such as formamides, acetamides, trifluoroacetamides, sulfonamides, trifluoromethanesulfonyl amides, trimethylsilylethanesulfonamides, and tert-butylsulfonyl amides. Examples of commonly used protecting groups for alcohols include ethers, such as methyl, methoxymethyl, methoxyethoxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, benzyloxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, ethoxyethyl, benzyl, 2-napthylmethyl, O-nitrobenzyl, P-nitrobenzyl, P-methoxybenzyl, 9-phenylxanthyl, trityl (including methoxy-trityls), and silyl ethers. An acetal can be used to protect the 5-hydroxy and 6-hydroxy positions of an intermediate or compound of the invention Examples of commonly used protecting groups for sulfhydryls include many of the same protecting groups used for hydroxyls. In addition, sulfhydryls can be protected in a reduced form (e.g., as disulfides) or an oxidized form (e.g., as sulfonic acids, sulfonic esters, or sulfonic amides). Protecting groups can be chosen such that selective conditions (e.g., acidic conditions, basic conditions, catalysis by a nucleophile, catalysis by a lewis acid, or hydrogenation) are required to remove each, exclusive of other protecting groups in a molecule. The conditions required for the addition of protecting groups to amine, alcohol, and sulfhydryl functionalities and the conditions required for their removal are provided in detail in \u201cT. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts: Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d (2ed., 1991, John Wiley & Sons) and \u201cP. J. Kocienski: Protecting Groups\u201d (1994 Georg Thieme Verlag); each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Synthesis of Sulfhydryl and Amine Derivatives","An unprotected hydroxyl in a compound of the invention can be activated using standard techniques (e.g., conversion to a tosylate, brosylate, mesylate, triflate or other reactive leaving group see, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pp. 352-354, 1992). The conversion of the activated alcohol to a sulfhydryl group can be achieved by either addition of sulfide (e.g., NASH, NaS), addition of disulfide (e.g., NaS) followed by reduction of the disulfide to a sulfhydryl group, or transesterification of the activated alcohol with thioacetate followed by hydrolysis to the sulfhydryl with sodium acetate. The conversion of the activated alcohol to an amino group can be achieved by either addition of an amine or addition of azide followed by reduction to the amino group.","Formulation of Pharmaceutical Compositions","The compositions including a compound of formula (I) are formulated such that an effective amount of compound reaches the target region (e.g., a neoplasm). The compound may be contained in any appropriate amount in any suitable carrier substance, and is generally present in an amount of 1-95% by weight of the total weight of the composition. The composition may be provided in a dosage form that is suitable for oral, parenteral (e.g., intrathecally, intraarticularly, intratumorally, intravenously, intramuscularly), rectal, cutaneous, nasal, vaginal, inhalant, skin (patch), or ocular administration route.","Thus, the composition may be in the form of, e.g., tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granulates, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, gels including hydrogels, pastes, ointments, creams, plasters, drenches, osmotic delivery devices, suppositories, enemas, injectables, implants, sprays, or aerosols. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice (see, e.g., Remington: 20th edition, 2000, ed. A R Gennaro, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, and , eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York).","For compositions that include combinations of compounds, each compound of the combination may be formulated in any variety of ways that are known in the art. For example, the first and second agents may be formulated together or separately. Desirably, the first and second agents are formulated together for the simultaneous or near simultaneous administration of the agents. Such co-formulated compositions can include the compound of formula (I) and, for example, an antiproliferative agent formulated together in the same pill, capsule, liquid, etc.","The individually or separately formulated agents can be packaged together as in a kit. Non limiting examples include kits that contain, e.g., two pills, a pill and a powder, a suppository and a liquid in a vial, two topical creams, among others. The kit can include optional components that aid in the administration of the unit dose to patients, such as vials for reconstituting powder forms, syringes for injection, customized IV delivery systems, inhalers, among others. Additionally, the unit dose kit can contain instructions for preparation and administration of the compositions. The kit may be manufactured as a single use unit dose for one patient, multiple uses for a particular patient (at a constant dose or in which the individual compounds may vary in potency as therapy progresses); or the kit may contain multiple doses suitable for administration to multiple patients (\u201cbulk packaging\u201d). The kit components may be assembled in cartons, blister packs, bottles, tubes, and the like.","Dosages","Dosages of a compound of the invention may range from 0.005 mg\/kg to 2000 mg\/kg body weight per day (mg\/kg\/day). For example, a dose of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, or 1750 mg\/kg\/day may be provided to the patient. Typically, a patient suffering from a neoplasm is given 1 mg\/kg\/day initially. Once a 50% remission of the neoplasm is achieved, the dosage may be reduced to 0.5 mg\/kg\/day. Further six months following the 50% remission, the dose may be further decreased to 0.25 mg\/kg\/day. This treatment may be continued indefinitely, or may be discontinued if it appears the neoplasm has been successfully treated. If a patient does not achieve a 50% remission, or is at an advanced stage of disease, the initial dose may be doubled to 2 mg\/kg\/day until 50% remission is achieved. Dosages are typically given orally. In one embodiment, capsules each contain 10 mg of the compound. To achieve a 1 mg\/kg\/day dosing, a 60 kg individual may take 6 capsules each containing 10 mg of the compound each day, where one capsule is taken at time intervals spaced throughout the day.","The dosage of each compound or agent of the claimed compositions may additionally depend on other factors, including: the administration method, the disease (e.g., a neoplasm or other tumor, hypercholesterolemia, a viral infection, an autoimmune disease) to be treated, the severity of the disease, whether the disease is to be treated or prevented, site of the diseased tissue (e.g., a tumor), and the race, gender, age, weight, and health of the patient to be treated. Ultimately dosing will be determined by a physician or other prescriber of treatment based on these factors. Dosages may be altered (e.g., lowered) where a compound of the invention is administered in combination with a second therapeutic. For example, in the case of treating a patient with a neoplasm or other tumor, a lower dose of a compound of the invention may be provided when given in conjunction with a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., an antiproliferative described herein).","Therapy","Compounds of formula (I) and compositions including compounds of formula (I) are administered to a patient for the treatment of a neoplasm such as cancer. Other diseases that may be treated by the methods of the invention include hypercholesterolemia, a viral infection such as hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E) or HIV, an autoimmune disorder (e.g., psoriasis or other diseases described herein), and diabetes, in particular, type II diabetes.","Any composition or formulation including a compound of formula (I) and any mode of delivery may be used to provide treat the patient including oral, intrathecal, intraarticular, intratumoral, parenteral (e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly), rectal, cutaneous, nasal, vaginal, inhalant, skin (patch), or ocular administration. Therapeutic compositions may be administered to patients who exhibit at least one symptom of a disease, to prevent the development of disease, or to maintain a reduction of disease achieved by administration of a compound of the invention or another therapy.","Compounds of formula (I) or compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) and another therapeutic or therapeutics may be administered together. For example, treatment of a neoplasm, an autoimmune disorder, or a viral infection may include administration of a compound of formula (I) together with an antiproliferative agent, an antiinflammatory agent, or an antiviral agent respectively. The combination administered may include one or more compounds in a subtherapeutically effective amount as determined separately for each compound.","In one example, a compound of formula (I) with an additional therapeutic agent are administered to a patient. After symptoms of the disease have decreased, administration of the additional agent is discontinued. The administration of a compound of formula (I) is then used to maintain the improved state of the patient following successful treatment with the combination of therapies. Such an approach may be particularly advantageous in cases where the additional agent has undesired side effects.","Neoplasms and Other Tumors","A formula (I) compound may be administered to treat a patient who has, or has an increased propensity to develop, a cancer or other neoplasm. Administration of the compound may be performed alone or in combination with existing therapies for neoplasms, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a personalized vaccine.","Chemotherapy employs chemical agents to treat neoplasms. Exemplary chemotherapeutic (e.g., antiproliferative) agents are shown in Table 1. As with radiation therapy, chemotherapy typically targets rapidly dividing cells, which include neoplastic cells.","Radiation therapy uses isotopes (e.g., cesium (Cs) cobalt (Co) iodine (I), phosphorus (P) gold (Au) iridium (Ir) yttrium (Y, or palladium (Pd)) to treat cancer. The radioactivity selectively kills rapidly dividing cells that include neoplastic cells. Methods of administration include brachytherapy such as seed implants, where a radioactive substance in implanted in the body at or near the location of the neoplasm, radioactivity from external sources such as external beam radiation therapy.","A common approach used to treat cancer is surgery. Once a tumor has been identified, a surgeon can physically remove the tumor or a portion thereof from the patient.","Personalized vaccines employ antibodies directed toward a tumor found in the individual cancer patient. Such vaccines may be prepared as described in Hockertz, 214:151-161, 2005 and Morse et al., 2005 2:108-113, 2005 and references cited therein. To prepare such a vaccine, a sample containing either all or part of the tumor is removed from the patient using surgical techniques, and cells or proteins are isolated from the tumor. Isolated proteins are preferably expressed preferentially in tumor cells as compared to normal cells. These cells or proteins, in conjunction with an adjuvant that increases immune reactivity, are injected into the patient. This induces an immune response to the injected cells or proteins, a response which is targeted to the tumor composed of these cells or targeted to tumor cells that contain these proteins.","Hypercholesterolemia","A formula (I) compound may also be administered to a patient suffering from hypercholesterolemia. The compound can block synthesis of cholesterol through HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, thereby reducing cholesterol levels, thus decreasing the risk of diseases including arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and heart attacks. Formula (I) compounds may be combined with other antihypercholesterolemia agents.","Viral Infections","Administration of a formula (I) compound has been shown to be effective in treating a patient having a viral infection such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. As the mechanism of action appears to be inhibition of reverse transcription, a formula (I) compound the invention may be useful for treating many retroviral infections. Formula (I) compounds may be combined with other antivirals.","Autoimmune Disorders","A formula (I) compound may be administered to a patient suffering from an autoimmune disorder such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, or any other such disease listed herein. Administration of a compound of the invention may be further include administration of an antiinflammatory agent, such as those described herein.","Diabetes","A formula (I) compound may be administered to a patient suffering from diabetes. This administration may further include administration of an antidiabetic compound, such as those described herein.","Mode of Action\u2014Antineoplastic Activity","I believe that formula (I) compounds both inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reducatase, and competitively bind receptors involved in exogenous cholesterol adsorption. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase occurs in both normal cells and neoplastic cells; however, neoplastic cells are additionally rendered unable to adsorb exogenous cholesterol following administration of a formula (I) compound. This selectivity for neoplastic cells occurs for two reasons. First, tumors are poorly vascularized, which leads to a reduced supply of available exogenous cholesterol. Second, the reduced vascularization additionally leads to hypoxia, thereby increasing the concentration of anaerobic metabolic products, including lactic acid, pyruvic acid and carbon dioxide. Further, poor vascularization decreases the rate of carbon dioxide removal from the tumor tissue. Increased levels of carbon dioxide, in turn, leads to increased levels of carbonic acid, the formation of which is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. These factors reduce the pH of the environment surrounding the cells from a pH of 7.3-7.4 found in normal cells to pH 6.4-6.8.","The lower pH environment in neoplastic cells causes the administered formula (I) compound, e.g., 24-ethyl-cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b1-triol, to migrate towards intercellular interstitial acidic fluid, and also increases the affinity of 24-ethyl-cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b1-triol for the cholesterol receptors. This increased affinity, in combination with the reduced cholesterol concentration present in the fluid surrounding tumor cells, leads to specific, irreversible binding of the compound to the receptor. In the case of 24-ethyl-cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b1-triol, binding is mediated by the three highly hydrophilic hydroxyl groups interacting with carbonyl groups of the receptor. The positions 3\u03b2, 5\u03b1, 6\u03b1 hydroxides further provoke distortion of the membrane layers, and the ethyl group at position 24 plays the role of a \u201ccheck valve,\u201d fixing the hydrophobic tail between the two lipidic layers.","In addition to binding the receptors directly, 24-ethyl-cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b1-triol alters the three-dimensional structure of remaining unbound cholesterol receptors through distortion of the lipid bilayer. This alteration is sufficient to prevent adsorption of cholesterol molecules. The distortion of the lipid bilayer has other effects as well. The permeability and the fluidity of the bilayer membrane is also reduced, thus decreasing passive, mediated, and active diffusion across the membrane. This alteration can further decrease nutrition level of tumor cells.","Feedback Down-Regulation of Cholesterol Synthesis in Tumor Cells","Sterol feedback control, mediated by sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) exerts the primary regulation on HMG-CoA reductase activity at the transcriptional level. Secondary regulation and non sterol isoprenoid-mediated fine tuning of reductase activity occurs at the levels of reductase translation and degradation. Reductase activity in tumors is elevated and resistant to sterol feedback regulation to aberrant SREBPs activity. Tumor reductase remains sensitive to 24-ethyl-cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b1-triol post-transcriptional down-regulation.","Treating a Neoplasm by Inhibition of HMG-coA Reductase and Specific Inhibition of Cholesterol Uptake into Neoplastic Cells.","The invention also provides a method of treating a neoplasm by administering to a patient a compound or combination of compounds that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and prevents uptake of cholesterol into neoplastic cells. Compounds that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase are known in the art and include atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. An exemplary compound that inhibits cholesterol uptake is 7-ketocholesterol.","The following examples are intended to illustrate, rather than limit, the invention.","Investigations were carried out on immunocompromised laboratory mice with experimentally-induced large B-cell lymphoma using hematological, immunological, biochemical, anatomical, and cytological methods. Two groups of 15 mice were employed. In the first group, 24-ethyl-cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b1-triol was administered orally daily at a dosage of 5 mg\/kg. The second group served as the control. The following parameters of therapeutic efficacy were compared: dynamics of LDH activity in the blood plasma, content of total protein, and general clinical blood test results. As a reference, the results in mice having experimentally induced large B-cell lymphoma and healthy mice are shown in Table 2",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Student's"]},{"entry":[{},"Group of animals","coefficient"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","Lymphoma","Healthy","(P)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ErythrocyteslOO 12\/1","10.02 \u00b1 1.27\u2002","10.65 + 0.99\u2002","0.22"]},{"entry":["Leukocytes 10\/L","12.9 + 2.06","9.34 + 0.66","0.0003"]},{"entry":["Hematocrit, L\/L","\u20020.34 \u00b1 0.016","\u20020.34 + 0.011","0.67"]},{"entry":["Color","1.21 \u00b1 0.18","\u20021.4 + 0.11","0.0038"]},{"entry":["Hemoglobin g\/L","149.4 + 7.94\u2002","166.6 \u00b1 7.45\u2002","0.0001"]},{"entry":["Lymphocytes, 10\/L","9.03 + 1.45","6.54 + 0.46","0.00032"]},{"entry":["Total protein g\/L","52.9 \u00b1 1.96","56.2 + 2.36","0.0019"]},{"entry":["LDH, U\/L","1228.9 + 139.8\u2002","444.1 + 48.9\u2002","0.000000023"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As is seen from Table 2, statistically important differences (P<0.05) between animals with lymphoma and healthy animals were marked by the amount of leukocytes, hemoglobin, by color indication, the absolute number of lymphocytes in blood, as well as the content of total protein in the blood serum and the LDH activity in blood plasma.
