{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention is based on a priority application EP 03 290 601.8 which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to the field of remote monitoring systems and methods, and more particularly without limitation, to remote fire, smoke, motion and\/or sound detection.","Various remote premise-monitoring alarm systems are known from the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,745,849 shows a combination of a cordless telephone and a premise-monitoring alarm system which has a base unit, a cordless handset and one or more remote alarm detectors.","The alarm detectors can be generally either smoke detectors, motion detectors, or open-entry detectors. The base unit includes at least one interface for the public telephone network, and another interface for radio communication with the cordless handset. The base unit preferably also communicates with the remote alarm sensors across the same radio interface. The base unit includes telephone call circuitry to relay telephone calls between the public telephone network and the handset. The base unit also includes alarm processing circuitry to send an alarm warning to a central alarm-monitoring station in response to an alarm signal from a remote detector. The base unit has control circuitry that is configured such that if, during a telephone call, the base unit is given an alarm signal, the base unit will either (i) hang up the telephone call and call up the central alarm-monitoring station to give warning, or (ii) call up the central alarm-monitoring station on a second telephone line.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,752 shows a multi-access remote monitoring system for monitoring of a security surveillance area. The security surveillance area comprises a local computer system, a network interface, and a camera having a motion sensor. The local computer system is electronically connected via a camera adapter to the video camera so that video, sound, and motion sensor data can be transmitted from the camera to the local computer system, and instructions or other data can be transmitted from the local computer system to the camera. The local computer system is additionally connected to a computer network interface, which may be a modem, network card, or other communications hardware, used to connect to the communications network. The local computer system includes various components, including an audio\/video coder\/decoder, fixed storage means, operating system software, communications software, compression software, and application programming interface (API) software.","It is a common disadvantage of prior art remote monitoring systems that special, dedicated hardware is required at the site which is monitored. The present invention therefore aims to provide an improved remote monitoring method and system which enables to limit the hardware expenditure for the surveillance zone.","The present invention provides for a remote monitoring method which uses the wireless application protocol and the hypertext transfer protocol for transmitting a signal, such as an alarm, alert or warning signal, from the surveillance zone to at least one receiver. This requires only a sensor being coupled to a wireless module at the surveillance zone.","The occurrence of an event is communicated from the wireless module to a monitoring server by means of the wireless application protocol through a wireless application gateway. The server determines one or more receiver addresses for the signal and forwards the signal to the one or more receivers through a wireless application protocol gateway. For example, the wireless application protocol gateway sends a service loading message to the one or more receiving mobile terminals in order to transmit the signal.","The service loading (SL) content type has been defined in the wireless application protocol standard WAP-168-serviceload-20010731-a (http:\/\/www.wmlclub.com\/docs\/especwap2.0\/WAP-168-ServiceLoad-20010731-a.pdf). The SL content type provides a means to convey a uniform resource identifier (URI) to a user agent in a mobile client. The client itself automatically loads the content indicated by that URI and executes it in the addressed user agent without user intervention when appropriate. Thus, the end-user will experience the service indicated by the URI as if it was pushed to the client and executed. By basically conveying only the URI of the service to the client the over-the-air message will be small. Hence, very modest requirements are placed on the bearer and on the clients ability to receive and store a SL if it is busy with other activities.","Instead of executing the service, SL provides a means to instruct the client to pre-cache the content indicated by the URI so it becomes readily available to the user agent and the client. It is also possible to control whether the loading of the service is to be carried out in a user-intrusive manner or not.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the server instructs the gateway to push a SL to the mobile client using the push access protocol (PAP). The push initiator, i.e. the server, provides the SL with the URI to the wireless mark up language (WML) that is executed in the client's user agent. The gateway sends the SL to the mobile client using the push over-the-air protocol (OTA). Next the mobile client receives the push containing the SL. The service which is indicated by the SL's URI is retrieved (\u2018pulled\u2019) from the monitoring server via the gateway.","For example data which is indicative of the circumstances of an event which has been detected is signalled from the sensor to the wireless module. This data can include an identifier of the sensor, information on the kind of event, time information and\/or other information. This information is sent from the wireless module through the wireless application protocol gateway to the monitoring server. There the data is stored and an URI is assigned to the data. This URI is sent to the mobile client as part of the SL. This enables the mobile client to retrieve the data from the monitoring server by means of the URI. This is particularly advantageous as the user can get additional information on the circumstances of the event rather than just the warning or alert message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","104","106","108","108","108","102","104","106","108"]},"Wireless module  has program  which generates a WAP request , when wireless module  receives an alarm signal from at least one of the sensors.","Wireless module  uses a transport layer such as GSM, GPRS, UMTS or another wireless transport layer to send the WAP request  over wireless network  to wireless application protocol (WAP) gateway .","Gateway  is coupled to monitoring server . Gateway  converts WAP request  to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) request  which it forwards to monitoring server .","Monitoring server  has database  for storing one or more receiver addresses of mobile clients for each sender address, i.e. for each wireless module  or alternatively for each one of the sensors , , , . . . For example each one of the sensors has an Internet protocol (IP) address which serves as a sender address; alternatively an IP of the wireless module  serves as a sender address or a combination of the IP addresses of the sensor which issued the alarm signal and the wireless module which has sent the WAP request containing the alarm message.","Further, monitoring server  has program  for querying database  and for storing of data contained in the HTTP request  in storage . Further program  creates an uniform resource identifier (URI) for retrieval of the data which has been stored in storage .","Monitoring server  is coupled to WAP gateway . In response to receiving HTTP request  from monitoring server , gateway  sends SL  which contains the URI of the data of the alarm message.","SL  is sent to one or more receivers as retrieved from database , i.e. to one or more of the mobile clients , , , . . . over wireless network .","In operation sensors , , , . . . monitor a surveillance area for the occurrence of an event, such as a fire, smoke, motion and\/or sound. When an event is detected by one of the sensors, such as sensor , the sensor outputs a corresponding alarm signal which is received by wireless module . Sensor  can provide additional data, such as the sensor ID of sensor  or its IP address, information on the type of event, the detection time etc","In response to the alarm signal program  of wireless module  is invoked. Program  generates WAP request  which can contain the additional data which is delivered by sensor .","WAP request  is transmitted over wireless network  to gateway  where WAP request  is converted to a corresponding HTTP request . This HTTP request  is received by monitoring server . This invokes program  which queries database  in order to determine the receiver address or the receiver addresses which are pre-assigned to the sender address of HTTP request . Further, the data which is contained in HTTP request  is stored by program  in storage  and a URI is assigned to the data.","Monitoring server  outputs HTTP request  containing the URI and the receiver address or receiver addresses. This way monitoring server  instructs gateway  to send SL  containing the URI to the respective mobile clients over wireless network . By means of the URI the receiving mobile clients can retrieve the data from storage .","Preferably gateway  sets the \u2018execute-high\u2019 parameter for SL  such that the SL service is carried out in a user-intrusive manner. This ensures that the user's attention is immediately drawn to the alarm signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},"In addition to the embodiment of , remote monitoring system  of  contains wired system components, i.e. sensor , personal computer  and personal computer . Sensor  is wired to personal computer .","Personal computers  and  are connected to monitoring server  by means of wired connections, such as over the Internet. When sensor  detects an alarm situation it outputs a corresponding alarm signal which is received by personal computer  and transmitted to monitoring server .","In response monitoring server  determines the address of personal computer  and forwards the alarm message to this computer. In this instance a uniform resource locator (URL) is provided to personal computer  rather than a URI as HTTP is used as a transport protocol rather than WAP.","In order to identify the communication protocol which is to be used to send an alarm message to a receiver each receiver address which is stored in database  (cf. ) can have an attributive data field for specification of the protocol which is to be used such as WAP or alternatively HTTP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0034"},"b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0002","num":"0035"},"b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0003","num":"0036"},"b":"104"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0004","num":"0037"},"b":"106"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0005","num":"0038"},"b":"108"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0006","num":"0039"},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0007","num":"0040"},"b":"112"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0008","num":"0041"},"b":"114"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0009","num":"0042"},"b":"116"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0010","num":"0043"},"b":"118"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0011","num":"0044"},"b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0012","num":"0045"},"b":"122"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0013","num":"0046"},"b":"124"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0014","num":"0047"},"b":"126"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0015","num":"0048"},"b":"128"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0016","num":"0049"},"b":"130"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0017","num":"0050"},"b":"132"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0018","num":"0051"},"b":"134"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0019","num":"0052"},"b":"136"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0020","num":"0053"},"b":"138"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0021","num":"0054"},"b":"140"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0022","num":"0055"},"b":"142"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0023","num":"0056"},"b":"144"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0024","num":"0057"},"b":"146"}]}}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the following preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in greater detail by making references to the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
