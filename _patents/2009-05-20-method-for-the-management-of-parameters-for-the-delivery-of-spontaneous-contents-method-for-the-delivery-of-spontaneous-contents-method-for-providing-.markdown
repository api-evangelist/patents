title: Method for the management of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents, method for the delivery of spontaneous contents, method for providing spontaneous contents, associated terminal and remote systems
abstract: When managing of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents to a user of a terminal, at least one content is delivered to the user, a determination is made as to whether the user generates on his/her terminal a reaction that is favorable or otherwise to the content delivered. Within the set of parameters for delivery of the spontaneous contents, at least one parameter representing the said reaction on the part of the user, and at least one contextual parameter associated to the said content delivered are stored to memory so as to adapt the said set of parameters, and a schedule is established via the terminal to deliver at least one spontaneous content selected based on the said adapted set of parameters so as to determine an appropriate moment to deliver the said selected content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention concerns a method for the management of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents.","The invention further concerns a method for the delivery of spontaneous contents.","The invention also concerns a method for transmission or broadcast over a spontaneous contents network.","Moreover, the invention concerns a terminal and a remote system suitable to deliver spontaneous contents for the implementation of such methods.","\u201cNetwork\u201d shall mean any type of fixed or mobile network (e.g. of the GSM, GPRS, UMTS or WLANs, or even an Internet or cable network) capable of transmitting, by means of wires or wirelessly, contents to terminals which are coupled to said network, and to exchange data or messages with those same terminals.","Any content transmission mode may be considered, particularly peer-to-peer (or \u201cunicast\u201d) mode, point-to-multipoint (or \u201cmulticast\u201d) mode, or broadcast mode.","Furthermore, in this case \u201cterminal\u201d shall mean any type of equipment capable of receiving content from a network of the aforementioned type, and of exchanging data, messages and requests with said network.","It may, for example, be a land-line or mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (or PDA), an encrypted video or television program decoder, a set-top television program receiving device, a video or music program receiving device, a desktop or portable computer, or a vehicle on-board device (such as a car, truck, bus, train, or other).","Moreover, in this case \u201cspontaneous content\u201d shall mean sets of data that define a video, or audio (radio broadcast or musical) or multimedia program, or alternatively an electronic data file whose broadcast is not necessarily the result of a request by the terminal user.","Such spontaneous content may be delivered independently, in aggregate with another content or else in association with an application.","Spontaneous content transmission systems are known that use e.g. traditional means of communication such as TV, radio, or even newspapers or magazines.","Also known are content transmission systems with means of communication such as faxes, or else the SMS [for \u201cShort Message Service\u201d] technology in mobile telephony.","However, spontaneous content is transmitted to users in a random manner without answering a need expressed by the user, and this, regardless of timing.","Moreover, in order to reach a great number of users, spontaneous content providers transmit contents assumed to match the greatest user subset both in terms of the content format used and of the information itself.","Indeed, the user does not always have the option to indicate preferences concerning spontaneous contents to be received.","Besides, spontaneous content can be transmitted to a user without his\/her prior agreement.","Therefore, users may not be receptive to the spontaneous contents transmitted, thus reducing the efficacy of such transmission of spontaneous contents.","The purpose of the invention is therefore to improve known spontaneous content services, by making it possible, at a favorable moment, to present content to the users, said content being personalized and adapted to each user.","For this purpose, the invention has as its objective a method for the management of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents to a user of a terminal comprising the following stages:\n\n","Advantageously, the method comprises a stage at which at least one quantitative information concerning the user's reactions is generated so as to establish an activity report for the user.","The invention also concerns a method for the delivery of spontaneous contents to a user of a terminal, implemented by the terminal and comprising the following stages:\n\n","Preferably, the method comprises a stage at which information concerning the identification of a moment to deliver a spontaneous content is transmitted, so as to receive spontaneous contents to be delivered.","In a preferred embodiment, a moment is identified to deliver a spontaneous content based on a schedule to deliver at least one spontaneous content, and wherein the information concerning the identification of the said moment is transmitted before the identified moment.","In an advantageous variant, powering up of the terminal is monitored, in order to identify at least one moment to deliver a spontaneous content.","Alternatively, a terminal's telecommunication activity is monitored, in order to identify at least one moment to deliver a spontaneous content.","The invention further concerns a method for the transmission over a network of spontaneous contents, comprising the following stages:\n\n","The invention also concerns a communication terminal comprising at least one processing means for:\n\n","The invention also concerns a communication terminal of a network comprising at least one processing means for:\n\n","Furthermore, the invention also concerns a remote system suitable to deliver spontaneous contents comprising at least one processing means

management of a set of parameters to deliver spontaneous contents, of a method for the delivery of spontaneous contents, and of a method for the provision of spontaneous contents, while references  to  refer to the stages of the said different methods.","In order to illustrate the general context of the invention,  represents a fixed or mobile telecommunications network  (for example of the GSM, GPRS, UMTS, or WLAN type, or an Internet or a cable network).","Network  can be any type of network capable of transmitting content, by means of wires or wirelessly, to terminals which are coupled to said network, and to exchange data or messages with those same terminals.","Any content transmission mode may be considered, particularly peer-to-peer (or \u201cunicast\u201d) mode, point-to-multipoint (or \u201cmulticast\u201d) mode, or broadcast mode.","A remote System  capable of supplying spontaneous contents is linked to Network  and through it transmits spontaneous contents e.g. under the form of flows addressed at Terminals  capable of receiving and displaying, e.g. on a screen, the spontaneous contents transmitted.","The spontaneous content transmitted via Network  may be a video, or audio (radio broadcast or musical) or multimedia program, or alternatively an electronic data file whose broadcast is not necessarily the result of a request by the user of Terminal .","The spontaneous content is e.g. an advertising or else informational content.","Such spontaneous content may be delivered independently, in aggregate with another content or else in association with an application.","Terminal  may be e.g. a fixed or mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (or PDA), equipment for the reception of audio or video programs, or a fixed or laptop PC, or even equipment built into a vehicle (car, truck, bus, train, and similar).","Generally speaking, Terminal  can be any type of terminal that is personal to a user or capable of identifying a user among a set of users.","Terminal  is in any event capable of exchanging data, messages and requests with Network  and, in particular, with System .","Within that general context it is proposed, with a view to improving the pertinence of spontaneous contents presented to a user:\n\n","First, the procedures according to the invention will be described, followed by the means enabling their implementation.","Method for the Management of a Set of Parameters for the Delivery of Spontaneous Contents:","In regard to , the method for the management of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents according to the invention will now be described.","The set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents may comprise the following:\n\n","Moreover, such parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents may be enriched with information concerning the technical characteristics of Terminal , so that the spontaneous contents presented to the user take full advantage of the technical characteristics of Terminal .","\u201cTechnical characteristics\u201d shall mean hardware characteristics such as a screen, its size, its resolution or number of colors, or else loudspeakers, but also software characteristics such as applications or even the operating system.","In fact, some of these technical hardware or software characteristics may enable the Terminal  to receive spontaneous contents in a particular format that may not be compatible with all terminals.","Consequently, the formats of the spontaneous contents are no longer limited and common to all terminals, but adapted to each terminal, e.g. by adjusting the size of the spontaneous content and by choosing a format the terminal is capable of utilizing.","The said set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents shall preferentially be configured by the user or even imported, and can be adapted so as to enable better to target the spontaneous contents to be delivered to the user.","For this purpose, and as will be seen further on in this description, the user's reaction in regard to a content proposed to him\/her is taken into account. The proposed content may be an audiovisual content, e.g. television or radio programs, or even games.","Moreover, the said set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents is recorded in means of memorization that comprise a ROM so as to be preserved over the long term.","In a first Stage , at least one content is delivered to the user of a Terminal  in order to examine his\/her reaction in regard to such content.","For this purpose, a detection is performed at Stage  as to whether the user generates on his\/her terminal a reaction that is favorable or otherwise to the content delivered,","The user's reaction is then translated to a representative parameter at Stage .","A favorable reaction is considered to be a reaction that translates an interest of the user in regard to the content delivered.","Such favorable reaction may e.g. be the authorization to display the content delivered.","In addition, an unfavorable reaction is considered to be an absence of reaction or a reaction prohibiting or deleting the display of the content delivered by means of a voluntary action on the part of the user.","Advantageously, further to the user's reaction, at least one contextual parameter is associated to the content delivered, to determine, for example, a new interest on the part of the user.","The contextual parameters may comprise information concerning the description of the content delivered, data concerning the classification of the content delivered, the geographic location of Terminal , or even at least one temporal information such as the season, the day or time when the content was delivered.","The parameters representing reactions of the users that are favorable or otherwise and the contextual parameters are then recorded in the set of parameters to deliver spontaneous contact so as to adapt the set of parameters to the user's discovered interests. The set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents thus regularly evolves so as always to be adapted and customized to the user over time.","In fact, it can be imagined that the user's interests vary for example between the early winter and the end of spring, but also as a function of the user's activities.","By means of that set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous content, whether configured by the user or adapted as set forth above, at Stage  a schedule is established to deliver at least one selected spontaneous content.","As a variant, it is possible to provide that the schedule would be established based on the observation of exchanges on the network and the utilization of radio resources, e.g. over a period of one day.","The schedule thus enables determination of propitious moments for the delivery of spontaneous contents to the user.","Such scheduling is internal to the terminal, which enables better respect of the user's private life. In addition, the user can configure the parameters of such scheduling to maintain a certain degree of control over the contents delivered to him\/her.","It has proven to be advantageous to provide for a Stage , wherein at least one quantitative information concerning the user's favorable reactions in regard to a content delivered to him\/her is generated.","This can be e.g. the number of times the user has accepted that a content be delivered to him\/her, which makes it possible to know the number of contents delivered to the user and that have generated an interest in him\/her.","Such quantitative information can be synthesized in the form of an activity report of Terminal , e.g. based on a predetermined time interval.","The activity report of Terminal  is then sent to the System , e.g. on a periodic basis.","The said activity report makes it possible to report the user's reactions and the actual presentation of the contents, which in turn renders it possible to bill the content providers.","It will therefore be understood that with a method of this kind the management set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents is adapted in an evolutionary manner, so as always best to correspond to the user.","Thus, the parameters of that set of parameter can act as criteria to select spontaneous contents to be delivered that are personalized and adapted to the user, and at a favorable moment in time.","Of course, it will easily be understood that the order of implementation of the stages of this method for the management of a set of parameters to deliver spontaneous contents can, for certain stages, be inverted without departing from\/running counter to\/defeating the purpose of the spirit of the present invention.","Method for the Delivery of Spontaneous Contents:","The method for the management of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents being a necessary preliminary, this description will now address, by reference to , the method for the delivery of spontaneous contents according to the invention, which takes full advantage of the dynamic adaptation of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents as described above.","This method implemented by the user's terminal enables delivery of a spontaneous content personalized and adapted to the user, and this at a moment that is suitable to catch the user's attention, thus increasing the efficacy of the spontaneous content delivered.","For this purpose, for the implementation of a method of this kind, access is available to any parameter of a set of parameters to deliver spontaneous contents configured by the user, imported, or adapted, e.g. according to a method for the management of a set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents as described above.","In a first Stage , a moment is identified to deliver a spontaneous content.","To do so, advantageously a schedule to deliver at least one spontaneous content, defined as specified above, is analyzed.","In that case, when a propitious moment is anticipated on the basis of the schedule, a stage can be provided for wherein before the identified moment information concerning the identification of a moment to deliver a spontaneous content intended for the System  is transmitted. Such information can be transmitted in the form of a slot availability event.","Advantageously, any useful parameter out of the set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents is transmitted to the System  to select and send a spontaneous content to the user.","Thereafter, a spontaneous content sent by the System  is received, then the spontaneous content received is recorded, e.g. in memorization means  of Terminal , so as to be able rapidly to deliver such content at the anticipated propitious moment.","As a variant, the software or hardware activity of Terminal  is monitored, in order to identify a moment to deliver a spontaneous content,","For example, it would be possible to monitor the powering up of the Terminal . In that case, the identification of the moment for the delivery of a spontaneous content is advantageously inhibited during a predefined time interval, preferably over rest periods, for example at night, so as not to disturb the user during his\/her sleep.","According to another embodiment, the telecommunication activity of the Terminal  is monitored, in order to identify a moment to deliver a spontaneous content.","Preferably, such telecommunication activity will be an uplink or downlink transmission activity enabling detection of an incoming or outgoing call, a peer-to-peer communication session established, or indeed the beginning and\/or the end of a call or communication session of this type.","At the moment identified to deliver a spontaneous content according to one of the methods presented above, an available spontaneous content is selected at Stage .","For this purpose, any useful parameter out of the set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous content that is pertinent in order to select a personalized content adapted to the user is taken into consideration.","Alternatively, it is also possible to take into account the utilization data of Terminal . In fact, when an incoming or outgoing call is made, the spontaneous content must be selected with a specific format.","Then, at Stage , the selected content is delivered at the identified moment.","According to a first embodiment, the available spontaneous content is selected from among contents recorded in the Memorization Means  at Terminal , for example further to the anticipation of a propitious moment for the deliver of the spontaneous content, and therefore further to advance receipt of spontaneous contents sent by the System .","According to a second embodiment, when there are no recorded spontaneous contents, information concerning the identification of a moment to deliver a spontaneous content is transmitted to the System ; this is Stage . Such information can be transmitted in the form of a slot availability event.","Provision can also be made for transmission of one or several parameters out of the set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents to the System  to select a spontaneous content adapted to the user.","At Stage , System :\n\n","Following the said Stage , the said spontaneous content is received, and the available spontaneous content received at Stage  is delivered.","Thus, the spontaneous contents are personalized and delivered to the user at the right moment, so that the contents delivered will be likely to be of interest to the user.","Furthermore, in order to produce a rapid reaction when the user is interested by a spontaneous content delivered to him\/her, an interaction on the part of the user is detected by means of the spontaneous content that has been delivered, and then information concerning the user's interaction is transmitted to the System ; this is Stage .","System  then receives and analyses the said information in order to provide the appropriate service.","Such interaction may e.g. be the activation of a key on a keyboard of Terminal  whose number corresponds to a number of a proposed choice, or indeed the selection of an active element of the content delivered when it is displayed.","It is thus possible to imagine that the user may select an active key denominated e.g. \u201cMore information\u201d that would enable reception of additional data in connection with the spontaneous content delivered, or else that the user may select an active key enabling the establishment of a communication with the advertiser of the spontaneous content, e.g. by e-mail or by means of a telephone call. In the following example, it is considered that the user selects a key denominated \u201cMore information\u201d.","In that case, the information sent may be a request for the transmission of at least one additional data item in relation to a spontaneous content that has been delivered, and associated to the selection of the \u201cMore information\u201d key.","Thanks to this transmitted information, the System  selects at least one supplementary data item, and then sends such additional data item to the Terminal .","Such supplementary data item may be selected from the list comprising an image, characters, a link towards a website, or even a multimedia content, for example by using the streaming technology.","In order to enable the user to control the reception of incoming data, a supplementary incoming data item is detected at Terminal ; this is Stage .","It is then possible, at Stage , to inform the user to enable him\/her to accept or refuse receipt of such supplementary incoming data item.","When reception is accepted, the supplementary data item is delivered at Stage .","Thus, at each interaction of the user with a spontaneous content delivered to him\/her, a method of this kind enables sequential transmission of contents to meet the user's expectations.","It will also be understood that with a method of this kind, the spontaneous contents to be delivered to the user are selected so as to be appropriate for that user, and the interactions between the user of Terminal  and the System  are managed at the Terminal  in a manner such as to enable the user to have a certain degree of control over the contents and data proposed to him\/her.","Of course, it will easily be understood that the order of implementation of certain stages of this method for the delivery of spontaneous contents can also be inverted without running counter to the purpose of the spirit of the present invention.","Method for Transmission of Spontaneous Contents Over a Network:","In order to be able to deliver spontaneous content according to the method described above, such content must be available, e.g. at Terminal .","In order for Terminal  to be always sufficiently supplied with personalized spontaneous contents adapted to the user, hereafter a method for the transmission of spontaneous contents over a Network  according to the invention is proposed by reference to .","A method of this kind enables System  regularly to update the parameters related to a given user in order to be able to transmit personalized and adapted spontaneous content to the said user.","For this purpose, at a Stage , information is received concerning the identification of a moment to deliver a spontaneous content, transmitted by Terminal , e.g. in the form of a slot availability event. Preferably, such information is transmitted before the identified moment.","Furthermore, such information is accompanied by at least one parameter out of the set of parameters for the delivery of spontaneous contents that is appropriate to select a spontaneous content adapted to a given user of Terminal .","Thanks to the parameters received, the System  can define or update the parameters related to the said user enabling selection of spontaneous content that is personalized and adapted to the said user.","The System  can then, at a Stage , select at least one spontaneous content personalized and adapted to the user, and at Stage , send the selected spontaneous content(s) to Terminal .","It will therefore be understood that with a method of this kind, the spontaneous contents sent by the System  to the Terminal  are regularly adapted so as best to meet the needs and interests of the user of the Terminal , while taking into account for example specific characteristics of that user's terminal.","In regard to , an example (given by way of illustration and not of limitation) of a terminal and a remote system for the implementation of a method for the management of a set of parameters to deliver spontaneous content, of a method for the delivery of spontaneous contents, and of a method for the provision of spontaneous contents according to the invention will be presented below.","As can be seen on , Terminal  advantageously comprises at least one Main Management Means .","Preferably, such Main Management Means  is suitable for transmission of information concerning powering up of the Terminal  to the System , thus signaling to the System  that the Terminal  is ready to receive spontaneous contents.","System  judiciously comprises at least one processing means for reception of the said powering up information for Terminal , and to set up a authentication procedure for Terminal , in order to securitize the exchanges.","Once the authentication is finished and validated, Terminal  is ready to receive spontaneous content.","For the implementation of a method for the management of a set of parameters for the delivery of a spontaneous content according to the invention and that comprises Stages  to , the said Main Management Means  is able to memorize the set of parameters.","Furthermore, the said Main Management Means  is advantageously connected to at least one Readout Means  of Terminal  able to deliver, at Stage , a content to the user, e.g. by using an Application Programming Interface (API).","Judiciously, the Main Management Means  is also connected to at least one Interaction Management Means  able to:\n\n","When a reaction on the part of the user is detected, the Main Management Means  is then able to:\n\n","Besides, the Main Management Means  is advantageously connected to at least one Scheduling Means  capable of setting up, at Stage , a schedule to deliver at least one selected spontaneous content so as to determine at least one appropriate moment to deliver the said content.","Furthermore, for the implementation of a method for the delivery of spontaneous content according to the invention and comprising Stages  to , the Scheduling Means  is able to identify, at Stage , a moment to deliver a spontaneous content.","As a variant, the Main Management Means  is connected to at least one Monitoring Means  capable of monitoring an activity of Terminal , e.g. a hardware or software activity, in order to identify a moment to deliver a spontaneous content.","Preferably, the Monitoring Means  are suitable for monitoring the powering up of the Terminal .
