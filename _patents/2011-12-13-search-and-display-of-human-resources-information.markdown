No. 61\/517,431, filed on Apr. 19, 2011, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In various embodiments, the invention provides enhanced processes, methods, tools, strategies, and techniques for processing, managing, analyzing, or communicating human resources information within a computing environment.","Many large organizations, such as financial institutions, must process a significant volume of human resources information for their employees and other personnel. In general, the human resources area is a broad and diverse environment that deals with situations ranging from straightforward problems to very complex and emotional issues for employees. To promote success of the organization, it is critical to bridge the gulf between the voluminous amount of human resources information available and the nature of the issues for which the information is needed.","However, many human resource servicing models are inconsistent in their delivery and content, often possessing multiple entry points and creating various process inefficiencies. Managers and employees may unnecessarily spend a substantial amount of time navigating human resource processes, and escalations of even simple issues can occur with undesired frequency. Among other negative consequences, ineffective management of human resources information can lead to reduced employee productivity, misapplication of valuable benefits, and overall dissatisfaction with the organization.","In view of these issues, enhanced processes, methods, tools, strategies, and techniques are needed for processing, managing, analyzing, and communicating human resources information within an organization.","In various embodiments, the invention offers an innovative design interface with tools that cater to the way that many employees and other personnel desire to view their human resources data. These tools can be configured to provide appropriate, distilled contextual information and transparency to the employment situation of the employee. In addition, these tools can reduce uncertainty for the employee, increase a sense of control, increase a depth of satisfaction with benefits management, and foster healthy employer-employee relationships. As described below, various embodiments of the invention provide a content model including modules and tools for notifications (e.g., communications regarding human resource related events); compensation (e.g., at-a-glance information about monetary ways that the organization compensates an employee); benefits (e.g., information about non-salary ways in which the organization compensates employees); career development (e.g., resources to help employees manage their careers, skills, and educational opportunities); retirement (e.g., information to help employees manage 401(k) accounts and prepare for retirement); and, user profile (e.g., including user information such as basic information, contact information, communication preferences, and\/or job information).","The inventors have recognized the need to develop a business model for human resources that invites employee interaction, drives usage of applicable employee benefits and information, and supports the profitability goals of an organization. In various embodiments, the invention may offer employees a differentiated experience through a unique human resource solution focused on consolidated online tools. A consistent and reliable human resource experience can be created that addresses the needs of employees and managers.  schematically illustrates how the inventors have recognized the problem of addressing human resource related issues on the basis of both the complexity of the issues as well as the emotional component attached to the issues by employees.","Benefits that can be realized by various embodiments of the invention include reducing costs through improved employee and management productivity, increasing employee engagement and satisfaction, improving employee engagement to reduce absenteeism and turnover, and enhancing quality of services delivered to customers. By using various embodiments of the invention, an organization can gain trust and confidence as a partner in helping employees achieve their goals. More efficient and effective human resources transactions can be executed, including providing managers with additional tools to support the workforce. Escalation of unresolved issues can be reduced, further increasing efficiency and first inquiry resolution. Also, the organization may experience increased employee awareness and utilization of benefits, offerings, and services.","In addition, embodiments of the invention can facilitate setting clear boundaries around employees' personal lives to enhance trust between the employees and the organization. The impact on employees can be brought to the forefront by distinguishing between those benefits to which employees are automatically entitled versus those benefits that require employee contributions or active enrollment. In utilizing various aspects of the invention, the organization can actively highlight educational opportunities. Also, transparency around potential surprises or issues can be created. Logistical support can be provided to employees, and opportunities to reach out to other employees and supportive services inside and outside of the organization can be promoted (e.g., call center assistance). In various embodiments, the invention can help employees to identify appropriate subject matter experts, enabling the employees to obtain help on their own terms (i.e. timing and channel) with a consistent specialist. In other aspects, complex policies and procedures can be translated into actionable steps for employees by previewing the process and focusing on actions needed and expectations for all parties. Also, progress reports can be generated that highlight important milestones and next steps. In addition, various situations can be personalized for employees to demonstrate the bottom-line impact of various options.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","201","202","202","204"]},"The transaction processor  may be operatively associated with one or more modules A-I that perform various functions within the management system .

The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.","The computer network may be characterized based on functional relationships among the elements or components of the network, such as active networking, client-server, or peer-to-peer functional architecture. The computer network may be classified according to network topology, such as bus network, star network, ring network, mesh network, star-bus network, or hierarchical topology network, for example. The computer network may also be classified based on the method employed for data communication, such as digital and analog networks.","Embodiments of the methods, systems, and tools described herein may employ internetworking for connecting two or more distinct electronic computer networks or network segments through a common routing technology. The type of internetwork employed may depend on administration and\/or participation in the internetwork. Non-limiting examples of internetworks include intranet, extranet, and Internet. Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet may be protected with appropriate authentication technology or other security measures. As applied herein, an intranet can be a group of networks which employ Internet Protocol, web browsers and\/or file transfer applications, under common control by an administrative entity. Such an administrative entity could restrict access to the intranet to only authorized users, for example, or another internal network of an organization or commercial entity. As applied herein, an extranet may include a network or internetwork generally limited to a primary organization or entity, but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other trusted organizations or entities (e.g., customers of an entity may be given access an intranet of the entity thereby creating an extranet).","Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes, such as network interface cards (NICs) or Ethernet cards, repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches, routers, and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and\/or data connections may be provided with microwave links (e.g., IEEE 802.12) or fiber optics, for example. A network card, network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses, for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network, the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments, local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks (LANs); remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs; and\/or, wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and\/or to connect remote stations to LANs.","In various embodiments, a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example, when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub, the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports, such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch, or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term \u201cswitch\u201d can also include routers and bridges, as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content (e.g., a Web URL identifier). Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers, including physical, data link, network, or transport (i.e., end-to-end). A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments, routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.","As employed herein, an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server. Other examples include WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (IBM), Sybase Enterprise Application Server (Sybase Inc), WebLogic Server (BEA), JBoss (Red Hat), JRun (Adobe Systems), Apache Geronimo (Apache Software Foundation), Oracle OC4J (Oracle Corporation), Sun Java System Application Server (Sun Microsystems), and SAP Netweaver AS (ABAP\/Java). Also, application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework, including the Windows Communication Foundation, .NET Remoting, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET among several other components. For example, a Java Server Page (JSP) is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web-based applications, while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers, for instance, or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service-oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface, Web Services Interoperability, and Java EE Connector Architecture.","In various embodiments, computers and computer systems described herein may have the following main components: arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, and input and output devices (I\/O devices). These components can be interconnected by busses, often comprising groups of wires or cables. The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I\/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these sections) can be collectively considered a central processing unit (CPU) for the computer system. The CPU may be constructed on a single integrated circuit or microprocessor.","The control unit (control system or central controller) directs the various components of a computer system. The control system decodes each instruction in a computer program and turns it into a series of control signals that operate other components of the computer system. To enhance performance or efficiency of operation, the control system may alter the order of instructions. One component of the control unit is the program counter, a memory register that tracks the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read.","The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations. The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing, trigonometry functions (sine, cosine, etc.) and square roots. Some may be programmed to operate on whole numbers (integers), while others use floating point to represent real numbers, for example. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (e.g., true or false). Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs to facilitate processing multiple instructions at the same time. For example, graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often possess ALUs that can perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Certain computer systems may include one or more RAM cache memories configured to move more frequently needed data into the cache automatically.","Examples of peripherals that may be used in connection with certain embodiments of the invention include input\/output devices such as keyboards, mice, screen displays, touch screens, pens, monitors, printers, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, joysticks, and image scanners.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may divide functions between or among separate CPUs, creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example, multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) computer systems with co-processing capabilities may be employed. Also, multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.","In various embodiments, the computer systems, data storage media, or modules described herein may be configured and\/or programmed to include one or more of the above-described electronic, computer-based elements and components, or computer architecture. In addition, these elements and components may be particularly configured to execute the various rules, algorithms, programs, processes, and method steps described herein.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it should be apparent, however, that various modifications, alterations and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to persons skilled in the art with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the present invention. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to include all such modifications, alterations and adaptations without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["The utility of the embodiments of the invention will be readily appreciated and understood from consideration of the following description of the embodiments of the invention when viewed in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A through 6D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A through 8E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A through 10E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A and 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A through 17E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 20A and 20B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
