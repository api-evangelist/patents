{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to application platforms, and more particularly, to methods and systems for providing flexible permissioning for application platforms.","2. Related Art","Existing application platforms allow an application developer to develop applications that may be used for various purposes in various contexts. In this regard, an application programming interface (API) is made available to application developers to develop applications for a specific application platform. The applications may be developed or sold by the manufacturer of a mobile device or by third party application developers. A consumer may load applications on the mobile device, which may run the applications after the mobile device has been manufactured and purchased.","An API is an interface that a software program implements to allow other software to interact with it. APIs may be implemented by applications, libraries and operating systems to define how other software can make calls to or request services from them. An API determines the vocabulary and calling conventions the application developer should employ to use the services. It may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and protocols used to communicate between the application developer and the provider of the API.","Some companies make their APIs and related features freely available. For example, Microsoft makes the Microsoft Windows API public and Apple releases APIs such as Carbon and Cocoa so that software can be written for their platform. Other companies may protect information on their APIs from the general public. For example, Sony used to make its official PlayStation 2 API available only to licensed PlayStation developers. This enabled Sony to control who wrote PlayStation 2 games. Such control can have quality control benefits and potential license revenue.","However, making API features available to application developers may have a number of shortcomings related to security or confidentiality. For example, application developers may have different resources, preferences or policies for different types of security mechanisms, some preferring security mechanisms that are low in cost or easier to implement but not as reliable.","As such, providing application developers (licensed or not) with full access and use of all features of APIs may pose a risk that may be due at least in part, for example, to substandard security policies or practices of application developers using the APIs.","As will be further described herein in relation to various embodiments, systems and methods are provided for an application platform with flexible permissioning so that full access and use of all features of APIs may be controlled to allow only those API features that a particular application developer may need based on the application developer's profile.","According to an embodiment, an application platform with flexible permissioning comprises a service provider server adapted to interact with an application development server and a client device over a network, wherein the service provider server is adapted to implement at least one application programming interface (API). The application platform with flexible permissioning also comprises one or more processors and one or more memories adapted to store a plurality of machine-readable instructions which when executed by the one or more processors are adapted to cause the application platform with flexible permissioning to: maintain, at the service provider server, a profile associated with at least one application developer using the application development server; receive an API call from the application developer; authenticate the application developer and authorize the API call; assign an access level to the application developer based on the profile associated with the application developer; and control permissions given to the application developer to perform operations available based on the assigned access level.","According to another embodiment, a computer-implemented method for providing an application platform with flexible permissioning comprises maintaining, at a service provider server, a profile associated with at least one application developer using an application programming interface (API) provided by the service provider server. The method also comprises receiving an API call from the application developer. The method also comprises authenticating the application developer and authorizing the API call. The method also comprises assigning an access level to the application developer based on the profile associated with the application developer; and controlling permissions given to the application developer to perform operations available based on the assigned access level.","According to another embodiment, an infrastructure for an application platform with flexible permissioning comprises a service provider server comprising an application platform that includes a plurality of application programming interfaces (APIs), wherein the APIs are adapted to be provided to at least one application developer using an application development server for developing applications operable on a client device. The infrastructure also comprises one or more processors; and one or more memories adapted to store a plurality of machine-readable instructions which when executed by the one or more processors are adapted to cause the infrastructure to: maintain, at the service provider server, a profile associated with the at least one application developer; receive an API call from the application developer; authenticate the application developer and authorize the API call; assign an access level to the application developer based on the profile associated with the application developer; and control permissions given to the application developer for operating functional capabilities of the APIs based on the assigned access level.","These and other features and advantages of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Like element numbers in different figures represent the same or similar elements.","As will be further described herein in relation to various embodiments, systems and methods are provided for an application platform with flexible permissioning so that full access and use of all features of application programming interfaces (APIs) may be controlled so that an application developer is allowed to access and\/or use only those API features that the particular application developer may need based on the application developer's profile.","In this regard, features or functional capabilities of APIs may be catalogued into tiers or levels associated with a degree of risk for a particular application developer. An application developer is given permission to use or access only the features or functional capabilities in the tier or level to which the application developer has been granted permission. Furthermore, limits related to the functional capabilities may be configurable based on the degree of risk associated with the application developer's profile.","Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure only, and not for purposes of limiting the same,  illustrates a system for providing an application platform with flexible permissioning according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.","A service provider  is adapted to interact, communicate or exchange data with an application development server  and a client device  via a network . Data connections between service provider  and application development server  and client device  may take place, for example, via SMS or a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) over network . In addition, according to one or more embodiments, service provider  may have other data connections (not shown), for example, with subscriber Internet companies, Internet financial companies, Internet brokers or other Internet companies. In one embodiment, service provider  may be implemented by a payment service provider such as PayPal\u2122, Inc., or eBay\u2122, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.","Application development server  includes an application development application  that may be configured to process the creation and\/or deployment of applications by application developers to be downloaded by one or more users of client device . The application developer may be an entity, for example an individual or a corporation, which develops one or more portions of an application, for example a software application, operable on different types of client devices. Examples of application developers include iTunes\u2122, Sprint\u2122, mFoundry\u2122, Tivo\u2122, Wii\u2122, Playstation\u2122, RIM\u2122 application store, or the like. The application developer may be known or unknown to the manufacturer of client device .","Service provider  includes an application platform  that may be configured to interact with application developer server  so that an application developer is enabled to call APIs  in order to develop one or more applications. In this regard, service provider  may provide information to application development server  to assist the application developer in creating and\/or deploying an application in a manner which is compatible with client device . Service provider  may assign application identifiers  for both internal and external identification.","Service provider  may maintain a plurality of application developer accounts , each of which may include account information  associated with specific application developers. For example, in one embodiment, account information  may include private or confidential information of an application developer such as account numbers, passwords, credit\/debit card information, bank information, or other information that may be used to facilitate online or other types of transactions between service provider  and application developers using application development server .","The application developer may first register, prepare or otherwise sign up to use application platform  implemented by service provider . An application is externally developed software that may use APIs  of application platform . An application developer may also be referred to as an \u201cApp caller,\u201d which is an entity making an API call. Applications may be composed of one or more API calls and are run by App callers. An API call is an operation being called by the application developer, for example, to use a specific operation of service provider . In an embodiment where service provider  is a payment service provider such as PayPal, an operation may be called for the purpose of, for example, splitting payments between recipients. Application platform  may provide one or more specific capabilities referred to as a \u201cfunctional capability.\u201d For example, in an embodiment where service provider  is implemented by a payment service provider, a functional capability may include a split payment. It should be noted that a functional capability may not be necessarily tied to a single API call.","Service provider  may further include a risk processing application  configurable to evaluate received information from application development server  over network  and store the information in a plurality of records that are associated with application developer accounts  so that a profile may be created for each application developer. It will be appreciated that by performing a plurality of transactions by an application developer with application development server , a plurality of records may be stored by service provider  and associated with an appropriate application developer account . Authorization information based on the plurality of records may be stored in an application developer authorization processing application .","The centralized storage of information or data of service provider  may be combined and enhanced with data obtained from business partners of service provider  including subscriber acquirers, brands, Internet companies, or other entities. In one embodiment where service provider  is PayPal\u2122, Inc., the centralized stored information or data may be combined with data obtained from PayPal's business partners such as eBay\u2122, thus resulting in even richer and more extensive data.","Client device  may be configured to download, install, and run applications created and\/or deployed by application development server . Client device  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over a network. For example, in one embodiment, client device  may be implemented as a mobile device in communication with network  such as the Internet or another network. In other embodiments, client device  may be implemented as a personal computer, wireless telephone, personal digital assistant (FDA), key fob, smart phone, smart card, notebook computer, game console, digital video recorder (DVR), and\/or other types of computing devices. Furthermore, client device  may be enabled for NFC, Bluetooth, online, infrared communications and\/or other types of communications.","Application development server  may include various other applications  as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to application developers using application development server . For example, in various embodiments, other applications  may include security applications for implementing security features or any other types of applications.","Application development server  may provide information to service provider  to open an application developer account . In this regard, it will be appreciated that the application developer may provide account information to service provider  over network  through, for example, a secure connection between application development server  and service provider . For example, service provider  may provide a webpage that may be viewed by an application developer through a browser application.","The information provided to service provider  may be used to assign a specific application developer identifier , which application development server  may store, and may be used to identify the particular application developer as having an application developer account  maintained by service provider . Application developer identifiers may be implemented, for example, as one or more cookies, operating system registry entries, hardware identifiers, or other types of identifiers. Other data specific to the application developer may be created and stored by service provider , including for example, signature information and an application developer profile . Signature information is a way to identify the application developer. Furthermore, application developer profile  may be created, for example, based on an application developer's typical behavior in transactions.","Client device , application developer server , and service provider  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and methods described herein. For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and\/or external to various components of the system, and\/or accessible over a network, which may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, network  may include the Internet or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"In block , service provider  may receive an API call from an application developer or App caller using application development server . The App caller may wish to create an application and access features of an API  of application platform . App callers may also be known as Actors with existing authorization and authorization credentials such as username, password or passcode, and a 3-token signature or certificate.","In block , service provider  authenticates the App caller and authorizes the API call. For example, service provider  may first verify the App caller's credentials such as username, password or passcode so that the credentials match information maintained by service provider . For example, information in connection with application developer identifier  of application development server  is verified. Other data maintained at service provider  such as signature information and application developer profile information maintained for example in application developer profile , may also be used to correlate and authenticate the application developer. If particular information provided by the App caller appears to be out of line with the App caller's typical profile as maintained in application developer profile , the App caller may not be authenticated. For instance, if the application developer generally only deals with transactions over the telephone for a particular technology, a transaction related to a different odd technology may raise a fraud alert. Other data that may raise fraud alerts include the number of transactions, the time of day or the time of year when the transaction takes place. Finally, transactions made over application development server  may also provide geo-location information using for example a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) to identify the location of the application development server  (and correspondingly the application developer). The location of application developers as well as other credentials may be helpful in establishing risk models for transactions.","In addition, an API may be checked to ensure that the API is valid and active. If the App caller is allowed to use the particular API, then the API call may be authorized. If the App caller is not allowed to use the particular API, then the API call is rejected.","In block , once an App caller is authenticated and the API call is authorized, an \u201cAccess Level\u201d is assigned to the App caller based on the App caller's profile. When an entity applies to be an application developer or App caller (caller of APIs of application platform ), the entity may be vetted using a risk analysis or technique used by Risk Processing Application  of service provider . The App caller may be vetted, for example, on its financial and identity trustworthiness. Based on such vetting, application developer account  for the particular App caller may be assigned an Access Level with respect to APIs  in application platform .","In block , controlled permissions are given to the App caller to perforin operations available based on its assigned Access Level. That is, all functional capabilities in the assigned Access Level may be allowed when the App caller makes a call. APIs  may be called only within the context of an application. Each application may be identified by application identifier .","Application platform  of service provider  exposes services to external application developers or App callers using application development server  to create applications. As such, risk analysis may be used to classify an App caller into a tier. A tier (also known as a \u201clevel\u201d) is a level of risk associated with a given App caller, and may also be used to provide an initial set of functional capabilities to a particular App caller. Tiers may be created for the services built into application platform . Functional capabilities may also be placed into several tiers based on a risk factor of a functional capability.","In an embodiment where service provider  is a payment service provider such as PayPal, API calls may be placed in connection with, for example, different adaptive payments such as splitting payments to different receivers in series or parallel, creating accounts, or the like. Examples of functional capabilities are shown in Table 1 below, and include:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Examples of functional capabilities"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Associated API Call","Functional Capability"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"AdaptivePayment.Pay","Make Parallel Payment"]},{"entry":[{},"AdaptiveAccount.CreateAccount","Create Personal Account"]},{"entry":[{},"AdaptiveDispute.CreateDispute","Can Create US Account"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As discussed above, functional capabilities may be placed into several tiers based on a risk factor of a functional capability.

Examples of a tier (or a level) may include a \u201cStandard\u201d tier and an \u201cAdvanced\u201d tier. As shown in Table 2, for example, an API call for Adaptive Payments.Pay in connection with a functional capability \u201cSimple Send Money\u201d is placed in a Standard tier. An API call for Adaptive Payments.Pay in connection with a functional capability to \u201cMake Preapproved Payment\u201d is placed in an Advanced tier.

It should be understood that functional capabilities are not necessarily tied to one specific API call.","Permissions in either the standard tier or the advanced tier may be given to an application developer or App Caller based on the profile or vetting of the application developer. The application developer with a qualifying profile or vetting may be classified in the advanced tier and have access to corresponding functional capabilities therein. Such granular process allows for general access as a whole within a tier or may be broken into smaller usable segments. For example, a billing agreement may be given only to certain levels of access depending on the tier thus allowing for a level of flexibility based on risk factors that limit access to certain provisions. Only vetted application developers may use or access certain or all features of an API as needed, whereas application developers that are not qualified may only have limited or no use or access to such features.","By way of example and not of limitation, an analogy may be made with respect to fine tuning or turning of a knob wherein access to certain API features or functions is granted upon tweaking of the knob to increase or decrease limits, feedback and\/or access as will be described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306","308","102"]},"In block , with respect to App callers exercising functional capabilities as discussed above, all App callers may be vetted and assigned a corresponding Access Level in connection with an application developer or App caller account . All functional capabilities in the assigned Access Level are allowed when an App caller makes a call. However, if an App caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is in a level higher than what the App caller is vetted for, then the call is rejected in block , for example, with an error code or message.","The relationship between an App caller's account  and its Access Level may be stored in a domain for Risk Processing Application  of service provider . The relationship between functional capabilities and Access Levels may also be stored in a domain in Risk Processing Application . Application Developer Authorization Processing Application (also referred to as \u201cUserauthserv\u201d)  may use the list of functional capabilities available to an application developer or App caller account based on the Access Level for granting or rejecting permissions.","In block , after an App caller is vetted and correspondingly assigned to an Access Level, additional controls, limits or restrictions may be imposed on the App caller's account , for example, by turning off certain functional capabilities for the particular App caller. If the App caller tries to exercise a functional capability that has been turned off, the call is rejected in block , for example, with an error code or message.","The relationship between an App caller account and the list of functional capabilities that are turned off, may be stored, for example, in an application developer domain in Userauthserv , which reconciles the list of functional capabilities provided at Risk Processing Application  with the functional capabilities that are turned off.","In block , in addition to risk-controlled functional capabilities, there may be an additional category of functional capabilities that may be managed or controlled. For example, additional Business Unit (BU)-level functional capabilities may be managed. This allows a Business Unit to enable additional functionality for an App Caller's account without having to go through risk vetting.","Default settings for each control may be applied to each application developer account, that is, no special policy or rule is necessary that determines whether or not a particular functional capability is allowed. That is, a BU, for example, may turn on additional functional capabilities for a particular application developer account. If an App Caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is not turned on for the particular App Caller's account, the call may be rejected in block , for example, with an error code or error message.","The relationship between an App Caller account and selected functional capabilities, for example, BU-level functional capabilities may be stored, for example, in an application developer domain in Userauthserv , which adds BU-level controls with respective answers (e.g., granted or rejected) to the list of functional capabilities.","In block , one or more functional capabilities may have specified limits associated with them. If an App caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is not within the specified limits for the particular App caller's account, the call may be rejected in block , for example, with an error code or error message. Specified limits and examples will be described in more detail below.","In block , permissions are granted to App Callers exercising functional capabilities of APIs when the functional capability is within an assigned Access Level, the functional capability is not turned \u201cOFF\u201d, the functional capability is included as an additional functional capability, and a specified limit for the functional capability is met.","With respect to specified limits, limits normally may represent some numeric values that refine the functional capability or control. For example, an application developer account  may be allowed to exercise chained-payments, but only up to 4 legs (or transactions). Limits may be configurable for each application developer account such that two different accounts with the same functional capability turned on may exercise that functional capability up to the different limits, respectively.","In some embodiments, there may be two types of limits: numeric rates and geographic.
