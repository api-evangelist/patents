title: Systems and methods for switching between computer and presenter audio transmission during conference call
abstract: A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to support switching between computer audio and presenter audio during a conference call so that one and only one, not both, of the two audio streams is being transmitted to the rest of the conference at any time. More specifically, a switch engine is adopted, which separately takes one or more audio streams captured by a sound mixing component of the hosting device of a presenter and by a microphone attached to the hosting device as its two inputs, and outputs only one of the two inputs at any time. The selected audio output is then processed and transmitted to the rest of the conference with feedback from other audio sources canceled.

No. 12\/423,467 filed Apr. 14, 2009, and entitled \u201cSystem and methods for computer and voice conference audio transmission during conference call via PSTN phone,\u201d by Albert Alexandrov and Florian Winterstein, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/423,451 filed Apr. 14, 2009 and entitled \u201cSystem and methods for computer and voice conference audio transmission during conference call via VoIP Device,\u201d by Albert Alexandrov and Florian Winterstein, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","A conference call is a telephone call between two or more callers or users (referred to herein as a group of participants) at geographically distributed locations, which allows each participant to be able to speak to, and listen to, other participant(s) simultaneously. A conference call among a plurality of participants can be conducted via a voice conference bridge or centralized server, which connects numerous endpoint devices (VoIP devices or PSTN telephones) associated with the participants using appropriate communication protocols and mixes the various incoming voice streams from the plurality of participants either at the endpoint devices or at the conference bridge.","A Web conferencing tool enables the group of participants to organize and attend meetings online during a conference call by allowing a presenter in the group of the participants at the conference call to run a computer software application (also referred to herein as the application) or to present a material via a hosting device and share the application or material with the rest of the group (the viewers) to view in real time. For non-limiting examples, such Web conferencing tool enables the presenter to perform live demonstrations in real time, collaborate documents with colleagues, and provide training to customers and employees.","During the Web conferencing, an outgoing audio stream (or audio) of the material being presented and\/or the application being run via the hosting device of the presenter (also referred to herein as the computer audio stream) may often need to be transmitted to the conference in addition to, and in separation from, an outgoing voice conference audio stream of the presenter or viewer speaking at the conference call (also referred to herein as the presenter or viewer audio stream, respectively). In the meantime, an incoming voice audio stream needs to be received from the rest of the group speaking at the conference call (also referred to herein as the voice conference audio stream). When there are more than one person who need to listen to and\/or to speak at the conference call at the same location as the presenter or the viewer, the presenter or viewer may have to \u201copen up\u201d the conference call by using a separate speaker and a microphone associated with the hosting device to allow other people at the location to listen to the conference. Consequently, the computer audio stream and the conference audio stream played back through the speakers may get (partly) picked up by the microphone together with the presenter or viewer audio stream, causing deterioration in the audio quality of the conference call. Conversely, it is important to make sure that the two outgoing audio streams, the computer audio stream and the presenter audio stream, are transmitted \u201ccleanly\u201d by the hosting device without interfering with one another. Although some echo \u201ccanceling\u201d or \u201ccancellation\u201d approaches target at suppressing and removing from one audio stream the echo, noise, and feedback of another, such approaches require capturing both of the audio streams independently at the same time, which is not always feasible due to hardware\/software\/OS limitations of the hosting device.","The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent upon a reading of the specification and a study of the drawings.","The approach is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to \u201can\u201d or \u201cone\u201d or \u201csome\u201d embodiment(s) in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.","A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to support switching between computer audio and presenter audio during a conference call so that one and only one, not both, of the two audio streams is being transmitted to the rest of the conference at any time. More specifically, a switch engine is adopted, which separately takes one or more audio streams captured by a hosting device of a presenter and a microphone attached to the hosting device as its two audio inputs, and outputs only one of the two audio inputs to a voice audio engine of the hosting device at any time. The selected audio output is then processed and transmitted to the rest of the conference with feedback from other audio sources canceled. Such audio switching approach cuts off at least one of the feedback path(s) among multiple audio streams and requires only one of the computer audio and audio streams from the microphone to be captured. It enables \u201cclean\u201d transmission of either the computer audio stream or the presenter audio stream with any mixing of echoes or feedbacks from other sources canceled during the conference at which open speakers and microphones are used and\/or multiple audio streams are possibly captured, leaked into, or mixed with one another. Here, cancellation means reducing the echo or noise with the \u201cbest effort\u201d, while certain residue of the echo and feedback may still remain in the resulting audio stream after such cancellation. Although only one of the computer audio stream and the presenter audio stream is being transmitted at any time during the conference call, it does not affect usability of the conference system for all practical purposes since presenters rarely need to speak and show a computer presentation\/application with audio at the same time. Although a conference call involving two or more persons is used as a non-limiting example in the discussion of the proposed approach hereinafter, the same approach can also be applied to at least one of the following scenarios where a) there is only an one-on-one call\/communication between a presenter and a viewer; b) the viewer may only listen to but is not allowed to speak during the communication; or c) where the viewer is absent (e.g., the presenter is making a solo sound recording of his\/her presentation and an audio-producing computer application).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"In the example of , the system  includes hosts (hosting devices)  deployed for each of a presenter and a viewer at a conference call, wherein various components running on each host  include at least a voice audio engine , an optional display component , as well as a sound mixing component  and a switch engine  on the host associated with the presenter; and an optional voice conference bridge  running on a separate host.","As used herein, the term \u201cengine\u201d, \u201ccomponent\u201d, or \u201cbridge\u201d refers to a software, firmware, hardware, or other component that is used to effectuate a purpose. The engine, component, or bridge will typically include software instructions that are stored in non-volatile memory (also referred to as secondary memory). When the software instructions are executed, at least a subset of the software instructions is loaded into memory (also referred to as primary memory) by a processor. The processor then executes the software instructions in memory. The processor may be a shared processor, a dedicated processor, or a combination of shared or dedicated processors. A typical program will include calls to hardware components (such as I\/O devices), which typically requires the execution of drivers. The drivers may or may not be considered part of the engine, but the distinction is not critical.","In the example of , the host  can be a computing device, a communication device, a storage device, or any electronic device capable of running a software component. For non-limiting examples, a computing device can be but is not limited to, a laptop PC, a desktop PC, a tablet PC, an iPod, a PDA, or a server machine. A storage device can be but is not limited to a hard disk drive, a flash memory drive, or any portable storage device. A communication device can be but is not limited to a mobile phone.","In the example of , the voice audio engine  is a software subsystem for bidirectional communication of audio streams of data instead\/in place of a (PSTN) telephone. The voice audio engine  is typically used as an embedded system on the host  using voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology. The voice audio engine  can be an optimized software subsystems with mathematically complex signal processing required for voice filtering and speech coding as understood by one ordinarily skilled in the relevant art.","In the example of , the optional display component  enables the presenter to display, manipulate, and share an application he\/she runs or a material he\/she presents at the conference call and the viewer to hear or view the application run or material presented by the presenter. Here, the display component  can be a monitor, a screen, or any other displaying device associated with the host  known to one skilled in the art. The application or material can be any type of digital document, application, or program that produces sound and\/or displayable on the display component  of the host , including the entire displayable desktop of the host .","In the example of , the sound mixing component  is a software component that utilizes one or more sound capturing devices of the host , such as a sound card of the host , a separate physical device of a microphone and\/or a speaker, to capture and\/or to playback audio streams by invoking Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the sound capturing devices, such as the operating system APIs. More specifically, the sound mixing component  mixes all audio streams that have been either originated or accepted by an application, program, or interface running on the host , such as the computer audio stream from the computer presentation\/application and\/or the conference audio stream received by the voice audio engine , and outputs the mixed audio streams to other components running on the host , such as the speakers and\/or switch engine  discussed below via respective APIs.","In the example of , the switch engine  of the host  associated with the presenter captures audio streams from two sources as its inputs: Audio Input One from the microphone associated with the host , wherein Audio Input One includes the presenter audio as well as possible leak or feedback from one or more other audio streams such as a mix of computer audio stream and conference audio stream, wherein Audio Input Two from the sound mixing component  includes the mix of the computer audio stream and the conference audio stream. The switch engine  functions as a 2-to-1 switch, which only selects and outputs one of the two audio inputs to an audio switch component  of the switch engine  as its audio output to other component\/engine running on the host , such as voice audio engine , at anytime upon an event or signal triggering the switch as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"114","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Manual switching mode, where the user switch component  of the switch engine  presents the user (presenter) with options and enables the presenter to choose if he\/she wants to share his\/her own voice audio stream (the presenter audio stream) of Audio Input One or the audio stream from the presentation or application running on the host  (the computer audio stream) of Audio Input Two. The user switch component  then provides the choice of the presenter as a triggering signal to the audio switch component , which will then output the corresponding audio stream.","Automatic switching mode, where the audio detection component  of the switch engine  checks whether the presenter is talking under a presenter-dominant scenario, e.g., whether there is active presenter audio stream captured by the microphone. If so, the audio detection component  automatically sends a triggering signal to the audio switch component  to output the Audio Input One captured from the microphone instead of the computer audio stream of Audio Input Two. Once the presenter stops talking, the audio detection component  may send another triggering signal to the audio switch component  to output the computer audio stream of Audio Input Two instead. Here, the audio detection component  may check the presence of the presenter audio stream by, for a non-limiting example, by recording and monitoring the activity\/volume of the Audio Input One captured from the microphone for a certain period of time, e.g., 20 milliseconds. If one second of active presenter audio stream is detected, the audio detection component  switches to Audio Input One captured from the microphone and plays back one second of recorded and buffered presenter audio stream. Alternatively, under a computer audio-dominant scenario, the audio detection component  checks whether an audio-producing computer presentation\/application is actively running on the host . If so, the audio detection component  automatically sends a triggering signal to the audio switch component  to output the computer audio of Audio Input Two instead of the Audio Input One captured from the microphone. Once the presentation\/application stops producing the sound, the audio detection component  may send another triggering signal to the audio switch component  to output the computer audio stream of Audio Input One captured from the microphone instead. Here, the audio detection component  may check the presence of the computer audio stream, for a non-limiting example, monitoring whether a media player actively running on the host , such as Windows Media Player or QuickTime or a YouTube video, starts playing back audio\/video.","Semi-automatic switching, where the audio detection component  functions similarly to under the automatic switching mode. But instead of sending a triggering signal to the audio switch component  immediately upon detection of the presenter or computer audio stream, however, the audio detection component  sends an signal to the user switch component  to alert the presenter and\/or ask the presenter whether he\/she would like to make the switch from the computer audio stream to the presenter audio stream or vise versa via the user switch component ."]}}}},"In the example of , the optional voice conference bridge  is operable to provide conferencing services over a communication network by establishing a conference call among a group of participants including at least a presenter and one or more viewers, receiving and optionally processing audio streams generated by each of the group of participants, such as presenter and viewer audio and computer audio, and providing the audio streams to the rest of the group of participants. Here, each of the group of participants is able to both simultaneously speak to the rest of the participants and watch the application run or material presented on the display component  of the host  while listening to the voice audio or computer audio during the conference call. Here, each of the group of participants may represent a group of people gathering at the same geographical location, such as a conference room or office, where everyone in the group can listen to or speak to the conference call via a telephony endpoint device. Note that the voice conference bridge  is optional under the scenarios discussed above where only the presenter and the viewer communicate with each other directly over a network or when the viewer is absent.","In the example of , the hosts  and the voice conference bridge  can communicate and interact with each other via communication interfaces (not shown) following certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol, over a network (not shown). Here, the network can be a communication network based on certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol. Such network can be but is not limited to, internet, intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), wireless network, Bluetooth, WiFi, and mobile communication network. The physical connections of the network and the communication protocols are well known to those of skill in the art.","While the system  depicted in  is in operation, the first host  is associated with a presenter during a conference call, where the optional display component  of the first host enables the presenter to display, manipulate, and share an application or a presentation material, which can be but is not limited to, a video, a slide, a graph, a piece of data, and a document at a conference call. While the application is being run and\/or the material is being presented, the sound mixing component  captures and mixes both the computer audio stream of the application or material being presented and the conference audio stream from the rest of the conference. The switch engine  captures as its audio inputs the one or more audio streams (e.g., presenter audio plus any potential feedback or leakage noise) from the microphone associated with the first host  as Audio Input One, and the mixed audio streams from the sound mixing component  as its Audio Input Two. The switch engine  then selects, based on user input or automatic detection, and outputs one and only one of the two audio inputs as its Audio Output to voice audio engine . During the conference call, the voice audio engine  running on the first host enables the presenter to listen to the conference call hosted by the voice conference bridge  via a speaker (so that other people at the same location can listen in) and speaks to the conference call via a microphone. More specifically, the voice audio engine  accepts the conference audio stream from the rest of the conference for the presenter to listen to, as well as provides a \u201cclean\u201d computer audio stream or presenter audio stream from the switch engine  to the voice conference bridge  with echo or feedbacks from other audio sources canceled. Correspondingly, the second host  is associated with a viewer during the conference call, where an optional display component  of the second host receives and displays the presentation material or application originated by the presenter to the viewer at the conference call. While the application is being run or the material is being presented to the viewer, a voice audio engine  running on the second host enables the viewer to listen to a conference audio stream (including the presenter audio stream) and\/or the computer audio stream of the application being run or the material being presented by feeding the audio streams to the speakers, and optionally to speak a voice audio stream of him\/herself at the conference call via a microphone associated with the second host . The voice audio engine  on the second host also transmits a clean outgoing viewer audio stream to the voice conference bridge  hosting the conference call with all other audio streams (e.g., echoes and noises leaked through the microphone) canceled. During the conference call, the voice conference bridge  accepts, transmits, and optionally processes the voice audio streams between the presenter and the viewer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In the example of , the flowchart  starts at block  where a presenter is enabled to display, manipulate, and share a presentation material or application at a conference call.
