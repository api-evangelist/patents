No. 11\/650,758 filed Dec. 15, 2006, now abandoned.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention generally relates to pyrotechnic delay compositions that burn slowly to allow for a time lapse before ignition of a primary charge and, more particularly, to novel non-toxic pyrotechnic delay compositions in which no ingredients pose any environmental hazard.","A delay fuse is a known pyrotechnic device designed to give a delay before ignition of a primary charge, or between ignitions of successive charges in an explosive train. Pyrotechnic delay fuses are widely employed in fireworks exhibitions, mining, quarrying and other blasting operations in order to permit sequential initiation of the explosive charges in a pattern. They are also commonly used in artillery applications to afford a number of seconds for the operator to retire from the artillery before it functions, or to time the explosion of an artillery shell.","Existing delay detonator cartridges comprise a metallic shell closed at both ends and containing in sequence a percussion cap, pyrotechnic delay composition, and igniter. The delay composition imposes an ignition delay between the percussion cap and igniter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["13","13","20","13","12","13","10","12","14","22","24","22","24","26","26","14","16","13","18","12","22","24","24","26","16"]},"A large number of burning pyrotechnic delay compositions are known in the art, and generally include mixtures of fuels and oxidizers. There are certain requirements for these compositions. They must burn without creating large amounts of gaseous by-products which would interfere with the functioning of the delay detonator. Moreover, pyrotechnic delay compositions should be safe to handle, from both an explosive and health perspective, and they must be resistant to moisture and degradation over periods of time. They are also subject to volume constraints as they must operate in a wide range of delay detonators within the confines of space available inside existing detonator shells.","A large number of delay compositions consisting of mixtures of fuel and oxidizers are known, e.g. Manganese Delay (MIL-M-21383: Mn\u2014PbCra\u2014BaCrO), Tungsten Delay (MIL-T-23132: W\u2014BaCrO\u2014KClO\u2014SiO2), T-10 (B\u2014BaCrO,), etc. See, e.g., M. E. Brown, S. J. Tylor, and M. J. Tribelhorn, -, Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics 23, 320-327 (1998). Unfortunately, these existing ignition delay mixtures are not environmentally friendly due to the toxicity of individual components. For example, Manganese Delay (MIL-M-21383) or Tungsten Delay (MIL-T-23132) and other similar pyrotechnic delay compositions contain carcinogenic hexavalent chromates. Silicon and barium sulphate delay compositions include a proportion of red lead oxide, also carcinogenic. There is a significant desire in the explosives industry to eliminate all use of lead or other toxins and carcinogenics as compounds in delay compositions.","Recently it was found that Si\u2014Al\u2014FeOcould be considered as a potential replacement for commercial formulations. This mixture appears to be very safe when tested by impact or friction and it is rather insensitive to electrostatic discharge. Ignition temperatures are close to 1000\u00b0 C. The advantages of Si\u2014Al\u2014FeOare its insolubility in water and resistance to moisture and that it is environmentally benign. Thus, it would be greatly advantageous to provide a non-toxic pyrotechnic delay composition based principally on Si\u2014Al\u2014FeOthat burns substantially gas-free, is safe to handle, is resistant to moisture and degradation over time, can be incorporated within the confines of existing detonator shells, and that poses no environmental hazard.","An aspect of the invention is to provide a non-toxic environmentally-friendly pyrotechnic delay composition blended principally from Si\u2014Al\u2014FeOthat burns substantially gas-free, is safe to handle, resistant to moisture and degradation over time, can be incorporated within the confines of existing fuse explosive trains, and that poses no environmental hazards.","In accordance with the stated aspects, a novel pyrotechnic delay composition is provided for use in conventional metal delay fuse cartridges, each including a burnable delay composition for providing a progressive burning zone. The burnable delay composition includes as its primary constituent Si\u2014Al\u2014FeO. More specifically, the pyrotechnic delay composition includes Si\u2014Al\u2014FeOin a range of from about 15 wt % Si and about 85 wt % FeOto about 35 wt % Si and about 65 wt % FeO, and more particularly at least about 1 wt % Al, about 29 wt % Si and about 70 wt % FeO.","The composition burns substantially gas-free, is safe to handle, resistant to moisture and degradation over time, can be incorporated within the confines of existing detonator shells, and poses no environmental hazards.","The present invention includes s a non-toxic pyrotechnic delay composition based principally on a silicon-aluminum-iron oxides mixture and, more specifically, a blend comprising powdered or acicular powdered Silicon, Ferric Oxide powder and Fine Grain Aluminum. The pyrotechnic delay composition of the present invention generally includes powdered or acicular powdered Silicon, Ferric Oxide powder or Ferrosoferric Oxide powder, and Fine Grain Aluminum and, more particularly, Si\u2014Al\u2014FeO. The blend is formulated to provide an ignition delay system with an average inverse burn rate in the range of 0.0046182-0.005644 m\/s. The blend described herein has a consistent burn rate in the range between 0.005 and 0.02 m\/s, an activation energy of approximately 227 kJ\/mol, is nontoxic and none of the ingredients pose an environmental hazard. This makes an excellent candidate for replacement of conventional pyrotechnic delay compositions. Experimental and modeling studies confirm their performance as herein described.

When 15 wt % Si and 85 wt % FeOare used propagation starts in Si\u2014FeOsystem at 70 degrees F., however Aluminum is used to increase propagation. Below the value of that composition there is no propagation. Propagation continued in Si\u2014FeOsystem up to 35 wt % Si and 65 wt % Fe3O. Beyond that range there is no propagation. To prepare the blend, wet mixing of the two reactants takes place in acetone. After mixing for 2 hours, the mixture is sieved three times using a 140-size mesh. The reactant mixture is loaded into aluminum capsules having a diameter of 0.204 inches at a predetermined pressure (for example, 30,000 psi).","All the foregoing reactants are obtained in powder form from commercial suppliers: Silicon (Elkem Metals Company, mean particle diameter 3.6 micron); FeO(Columbian Chemicals Company, mean particle diameter 2.9 micron, Aluminum (Valimet, Inc. Grade H-2 aluminum weight average particle diameter about 2-3 microns).","Composition Variables that Effect Burn Rate","Combustion front velocity measurements in a metal cavity (see ) (a non-adiabatic condition) in the silicon, aluminum, and iron oxide system have been found to vary between 0.005 and 0.02 m\/s depending on the composition of reactants. For example, the combustion front velocity increases with increasing silicon content in the range between 20 and 40 wt % regardless which iron oxide powder was used. Thus, burn velocity is a direct function of composition. In addition, burn velocity is also a function of relative packing density, average particle size of reactants, initial temperature, diameter of the cavity, gas pressure gradients, and capsule design. The specific effects of these variables have been ascertained by experimentation as detailed below:","1. Gas Pressure Gradients","In an actual close column cartridge, pressure is rapidly built up in the ignition cavity, which causes hot gases to flow through the porous reactant mixture. These hot gases preheat reactants causing faster combustion front propagation. The source of the pressure may be gas output from the ignition source, temperature increase, or desorption of volatile species. In an attempt to better understand the effect of pressure on the burning time, experiments were conducted under uni-axial gas pressure gradients in an Al\u2014Si\u2014FeOsystem. Propagation velocities under uni-axial gas pressure gradients were measured using the experimental setup shown in . A laser source  such as an Nd Yag Pulse Laser sends a laser pulse to ignite the above-described pyrotechnic delay mixture , which has been pre-mixed and pressed into a steel test capsule . The test capsule  is also loaded with an igniter charge  such as an AlA igniter mixture. The laser first passes through an aluminum test chamber  equipped with a photodiode  for data acquisition. The laser then passes through a glass window  and into a four-way coupling , which includes a fluid inlet  and pressure relief valve  for pressurizing the delay column using argon gas. The laser beam ignites the igniter charge , initiating the reaction and sends a first test signal to data acquisition via photodiode . The pyrotechnic delay composition  burns and upon completion a second photodiode  for data acquisition emits a second test signal. The time difference between two test signals allows calculation of the burn rate. Actual results for the Al\u2014Si\u2014FeOcomposition were shown in . It can be seen from  that gas pressure gradient has a significant effect on burn rate (sec\/inch).","2. Composition","Composition has an effect on the burning time, and the weight percent of Silicon in the Al\u2014Si\u2014FeOsystem was varied to optimize the burn rate at approximately 4.5 sec\/inch. It was found that the lowest limit for Si\u2014FeOat 70\u00b0 F. was 15 wt % of Si. The upper limit was 35 wt % Si. This data resulted in an embodiment of the composition of 30 wt % Si and 70 wt % FeO, within a range of from 15 wt % Si and 85 wt % FeOto 35 wt % Si and 65 wt % FeO. Addition of aluminum is required in order to increase the velocity of propagation and to ensure propagation of that system at low temperatures as indicated by the test data. More aluminum may be added to the mixture to yield a higher propagation velocity.","3. Loading Pressure","One of the factors to be considered in the performance of ignition delay devices is the loading pressure of the delay mixture. Thus, for comparative testing it is essential to keep loading conditions the same for all samples.","4. Activation Energy","To determine activation energy, a test reactor shown in  was built. The test reactor included an aluminum cylinder , with exemplary dimensions of 0.55 m in length, 0.33 m in diameter, with flanges at either ends. Cylinder  is generally equipped with radiation shields  for safety. The reactor was equipped with ports for a molybdenum ignition coil , three thermocouples -, an inert gas inlet  for argon pressurization, a vacuum inlet , and pressure relief safety valve , a pressure valve  for measurement. The ignition coil  may be connected to a variable voltage regulator (not shown) for initiating ignition. Thermocouples - may be connected to a conventional data acquisition system (not shown) such as is commercially available from IOtech, Inc. The effect of activation energy was tested for the Al\u2014Si\u2014FeOignition delay mixture, which is packed at 2 beneath the igniter  (described above). The Al\u2014Si\u2014FeOignition delay mixture of the present invention has an activation energy of approximately 227 kJ\/mol, which is suitable for replacement of conventional pyrotechnic delay compositions.","5. Capsule Design","Apparent burn rates can be affected by geometrical factors specific for the cartridge design. Compositions loaded into a small diameter tube burn slower than the same material placed in a cavity with larger diameter. In addition, the heat loss to the wall of the container is less significant for a wide bore tube, relative the heat retained by the composition. The inverse burn rates were measured at room temperature in 0.20 inch and 0.26 inch diameter aluminum capsules are shown in Table 1 (Si\u2014FeO) and in 0.26 inch diameter aluminum capsules in Table 2 (Al\u2014Si\u2014FeO).

dimensionless variables and parameters used in Equations 15 through 31 are well-defined in the related art nomenclature. For simulation purposes, the first and second order spatial derivates were approximated by an upwind and a central finite different scheme, respectively [11, 12].","Using the foregoing models, the reaction between the delay composition powders can be considered using the kinetic and physico-chemical data taken from the above empirical results. Numerically calculated dynamic profiles of dimensionless velocity, temperature, pressure, density, and conversion profiles were derived, and a good qualitative agreement between the experimental results and numerical calculations was found regarding the effect of gas pressure gradient on the propagation velocity. It was observed that as gas pressure increases the propagation becomes faster.","Actual Experimental Testing Data","Experimental (actual) data was collected on combustion front propagation characteristics in Si\u2014Al\u2014FeOdelay columns. These propagation characteristics were investigated at 70\u00b0 F., \u221265\u00b0 F., and 200\u00b0 F. The major measurement effort was on the following compositions (70 wt % FeO\u2014this composition was kept constant, Si (20\u221230 wt %), and Al (0\u221210 wt %).","Silicon burns well with Fe3O4 in a wide range of concentrations as specified above. However, when the temperature was significantly lower e.g. \u221265F the range of concentration was significantly narrowed and the Si\u2014Fe3O4 mixture without the addition of aluminum had the tendency not to propagate or propagate in so called oscillatory regime (unstable). The addition of small amount aluminum significantly widened the concentration range for propagation at very low temperatures, which were as important as room or elevated conditions. Therefore, aluminum was used as an additional fuel to allow tunability of combustion front propagation characteristics, especially propagation velocity. The capability of tuning the propagation velocity was very important for design of different delay columns. In studies, aluminum content was varied from 0 to 10 wt %. At higher aluminum concentrations (above 10%) the propagation velocity was much higher than that desired for delay columns. In addition, the combustion temperature increased significantly causing some additional product gasification and therefore possibilities of disintegration of a column prior to the completion of the combustion process. Accordingly, this behavior would be catastrophic from the point of view of the performance of such delay columns. Therefore, the use of aluminum concentrations above 10 wt % is ineffective.","An extra benefit of the addition of Al was the improvement of a structural strength and column pressability and integrity when exposed to vibration or during the combustion process. Based on the tests as indicated below, the use of aluminum in an exemplary range between 0 to about 10 wt % is feasible, and in another exemplary embodiment, aluminum in a range of about 1-about 7 wt % may be used to produce a stable combustion front propagation, and in another exemplary embodiment, aluminum in a range between about 1- about 5 wt % may be used to obtain a more effective tunability range for Si\u2014Al\u2014Fe3O4 delay columns, and in a further exemplary embodiment, aluminum in a range between about 1- about 2.5 wt % may be used for meeting propagation velocities of specific applications.","Specifically, in Tables 3-10 and , the results indicated that no addition of aluminum into the Si\u2014FeOmixture made this system less reliable at low temperatures (e.g. \u221265F), which was unacceptable (possible no fires). Accordingly, the effect was investigated with the addition of the aluminum powder. The testing indicated that the performance was very reliable when the composition of aluminum was approximately (about) above 1 wt %. The best performance for specific application, which satisfied inverse burn requirements, was between 1 wt % Al and 2.5 wt % Al. Further, the combustion front propagation was still stable up to 5 wt %. The combustion from propagation was still stable up to 7 wt % aluminum but the inverse burn rate was too small, which means that the combustion front propagated quite fast. At higher aluminum (Al) concentrations, the combustion front was very fast and, due to much higher temperatures generated by the system, the performance of the delay column was by far less stable resulting in expulsion of a part of reacted and unreacted material from the aluminum body and its partial melting. Therefore, the range above 7 wt % was not studied extensively. The results of inverse burn rate as the function of Al composition (wt %) in the mixture consisting of 70 wt % FeOand the balance of silicon are presented in .","Below in Tables 3\u2014X are selected
