{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Conventional managed information environments, such as a Storage Area Network (SAN), typically employ an interconnection of storage arrays operable for storing large quantities of data, in which the storage arrays are responsive to a management application such as an SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) based application. The SAN includes a plurality of host computers coupled to users for storage and retrieval of the data in the storage array devices. The SAN, therefore, supports an enterprise such as a corporation or business entity with conventional information storage and retrieval services via the SAN. The SAN management application allows administration activities, such as monitoring and maintenance of the storage arrays, for ensuring maximum throughput and efficiency of the data to and from users via the SAN.","In a conventional storage area network, periodic backups of data to a reliable long term storage medium remain a desirable, if not mandatory, aspect of SAN maintenance. Such backups allow retrieval and recreation of SAN entrusted data in the event of human error, such as accidental deletions, hardware failure, such as individual disk drive failure, and catastrophic events such as fire, natural disaster, or other site wide neutralizing scenario. Accordingly, regular backup operations and verification of adequate completion thereof are an integral component of SAN hygiene.","Frequently, conventional backup operations are provided by or facilitated by a vendor supplied backup application specific to each type and vendor of storage arrays. Often, however, a customer site maintains a heterogeneous combination of such storage arrays. Accordingly, SAN backup tends to evolve into a repertoire of backup applications, executed according to a predetermined schedule adapted for enabling subsequent recovery of the data stored thereby. Further, such backup operations typically alternate between incremental and full backups, as a means of optimizing backup duration, utilization of backup media volume, and performance intrusions, while nonetheless enabling timely retrieval when called for. Therefore, management of backup operations in a large, heterogeneous network of storage arrays is a formidable task.","A conventional SAN, therefore, employs a plurality of hosts, each connected to one or more storage arrays. The storage arrays each include a plurality of individual storage array devices, also known as storage units, disk drives or spindles, operating as an integrated storage medium. In a configured SAN, each of the storage arrays may have different numbers, types, and arrangements of the storage units, and are often from multiple vendors. Further, the storage within a storage array may be partitioned or designated according to data redundancy or protection schemes, such as shadowing, journaling, and RAID arrangements, and may also be partitioned for usage by certain subsets of users. Accordingly, tracking consumption of available storage and identifying areas of excessive or sparse consumption becomes a formidable task.","In a storage area network, backup resources typically include different applications from different vendors. Accordingly, SAN operators employ multiple backup operations and must therefore assimilate the corresponding status reports. Often, the backup status reports are distributed depending on the operation of the individual, vendor specific backup application, and also on the type of storage array being backed up. SAN system operators or managers typically correlate multiple status reports to attempt to synthesize an overall indication of backup sufficiency, and to pinpoint operational problems or inconsistencies. Such correlation is typically manual inspection and observation of conventional backup status reports, such as text file output, and reading or searching for error codes and\/or successful completion indicators. Accordingly, conventional backup status verification confirmation is a cumbersome brute-force analysis, which tends to be prone to oversights and misinterpretation resulting in varying and possibly suspect levels of validation and verification of sufficient backup activities.","Configurations of the invention substantially overcome the shortcomings associated with conventional backup status gathering and reporting by performing an integration of backup status reports to provide a uniform presentation of status from among multiple heterogeneous backup applications. Each of the backup applications typically corresponds to a particular vendor and\/or type of storage array. Such conventional backup applications are accessible via a vendor supplied application programming interface (API). The backup management application discussed further below is operable with each of the APIs of the target backup applications, and gathers raw backup data in a set of backup data files, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. The backup management application coalesces the raw backup data, such as via a markup language parser or other processing, to generate an integrated report of overall backup status. The integrated backup status is adaptable for display via a graphical user interface (GUI) on an operator console, and includes hyperlinks back to the source backup applications for pinpointed clarification and refinement of the status reporting in a drill-down manner.","The integrated backup data gathering, coalescing, and interactive GUI reporting includes normalizing the raw backup status data from each of a plurality of individual vendor specific backup applications. In the exemplary configuration, the raw backup data is gathered as a set of six backup data collections pertaining to the backup server, client, data sets, job errors, job details, job errors and schedule. The backup management application identifies and extracts the raw data corresponding to each of the backup data collections. The backup management application identifies the various status information according to common denominators of backup status, and normalizes differences by interpreting data items such as error codes and status messages uniformly. The backup management application, therefore, stores the normalized raw data in the markup form operable for subsequent processing including processing the raw data and linking to the source applications, therefore providing an enterprise view of the overall backup and providing uniformity across backup vendors, enabling backup verification and validation to ensure compliance with applicable requirements, such as coverage, recovery times, and other quality of service (QOS) criteria.","Accordingly, configurations discussed herein provide a uniform integrated backup reporting and verification mechanism which displays backup reporting information at an enterprise level while showing uniformity among backup applications of different vendors. Further storage array specific aspects, information, or commands are attainable via the linkages to the native backup applications specific to the individual storage arrays. Therefore, in the exemplary configuration operative in conjunction with a SAN management application, the backup management application provides uniform reporting and verification of satisfactory backup completion across the SAN, or otherwise pinpoints and clarifies problems or other anomalies associated with the backup. Further, filtering and focused report layouts allow customization and refinement of the output data providing a multitude of integrated report formats to facilitate operations including troubleshooting, charge back and service provisioning.","In further detail, the method of reporting backup operational status in the storage area network includes gathering status information from a plurality of heterogeneous backup applications on one or more backup servers into a common repository, and receiving a layout indicative of requested status reports from a user or operator requesting the backup report. The backup management application scans the common repository for status data corresponding to requested status reports, and coalesces the scanned data to identify the requested status information, in which coalescing includes identifying corresponding status fields from different backup applications. The backup management application then generates a backup status report indicative of the coalesced data from each of the status fields in the layout to provide an integrated report covering each of the dissimilar backup applications performing the backup, however in a normalized form which identifies common fields and groups accordingly.","The backup management application employs a responsive API for interrogating each of the plurality of backup applications, in which each of the backup applications is independent of the other backup applications. Each of the backup applications corresponds to one of a plurality of different venders, and each of the vendors employs a set of status parameters independent of the status parameters corresponding to other vendors. The backup management application retrieving backup status parameters from each of the respective vendor specific APIs, in which the backup status parameters include the requested status information. In a particular configuration, the backup status parameters further comprise a plurality of sets of backup data, in which each of the sets includes backup status parameters corresponding to a particular report, the reports further including at least one of server data, client data, data sets, job errors, job details and schedule.","The backup management application coalesces the backup data of the different backup applications by scanning data corresponding to the plurality of data gathering applications, and identifying data corresponding to output fields in the received layout. The backup management application then determines corresponding status information in the repository for each of the output fields from each of the data gathering applications. Further, identifying data may further include filtering based on a user based filter selection, in which the layout is indicative of the filter selection, and the filtering is operable to selectively include a subset of available fields.","In particular configurations, the backup management application distinguishes status indicative of substandard performance, and identifies the particular vendor type of the application generating the substandard performance. The application maps the status to a diagnostic explanation of the cause of the substandard performance, displays the mapped diagnostic explanation to a user.","In alternate arrangements, the backup management application employs the GUI for establishing a link from the report display to the corresponding backup server. The GUI receives a user request for additional information related to the report display, and the backup management application traverses the link to the corresponding backup server for further in-depth query and analysis by a user or operator.","The backup management application, in further configurations, is adaptable for administrative tasks and accounting, such as quality of service and usage projections. The backup management application correlates the coalesced data with quality of service quantums, and comparing the correlated data with QOS data indicative of sufficient backup coverage according to predetermined QOS terms. The backup management application determines from the comparison if sufficient coverage of backup data and corresponding restoring ability exists. Further, the backup management application is operable to extrapolate backup data corresponding to a particular manageable entity, and project exhaustion of current capacity of the manageable entity for facilitating future acquisitions, for example.","The invention as disclosed above is described as implemented on a computer having a processor, memory, and interface operable for performing the steps and methods as disclosed herein. Other embodiments of the invention include a computerized device such as a computer system, central processing unit, microprocessor, controller, electronic circuit, application-specific integrated circuit, or other hardware device configured to process all of the method operations disclosed herein as embodiments of the invention.

Based on the selected layout , the backup management application  identifies data corresponding to the output fields in the received layout , as depicted at step , and determines corresponding status information in the repository  for each of the output fields from each of the data gathering backup applications , as disclosed at step . Therefore, the backup management application  identifies corresponding fields across each of the backup applications , from the stored backup data , and retrieves the requested fields by parsing the repository  XML files including the requested backup data . The backup management application  then generates a backup report  indicative of the coalesced data from each of the status fields in the layout , as depicted at step . The backup report  typically takes the form of an HTML file for display on the report display  via the console  GUI, but may also be alternate output forms such as text files, PDF files or any suitable output medium.","In addition to selecting the layout  indicative of the desired output, the method for reporting backup operational status also includes a user selection of output analysis, which may be either automated or manual correlation of the backup report . The method includes receiving user selection of further analysis of report output, as depicted at step . Responsive to the user input, the backup management application  may extrapolate backup data corresponding to a particular manageable entity, such as a storage array , as depicted at step . Extrapolation in this manner projects exhaustion of the current capacity of the manageable entity, such as storage array devices  therein, as disclosed at step . A SAN manager may find such analysis useful for projecting growth over time for particular projects and\/or groups, for example, as an aid in recommending or deferring acquisition of new equipment.","The backup report  may be employed to correlate the coalesced data with quality of service quantums, as shown at step . Often, a backup service provider may associate service levels with backups. Such quality of service (QOS) provisions may specify, for example, maximum time requirements for fulfilling a retrieval request, or maximum time limits for completing a full or incremental backup (i.e. between midnight and 6 AM).
