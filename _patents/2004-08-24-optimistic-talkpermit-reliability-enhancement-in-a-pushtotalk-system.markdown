Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communications systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a greater reliability for permitting direct-communication, such as a push-to-talk communication, between members of a communicating group of wireless telecommunication devices.","2. Description of the Related Art","In wireless telecommunication devices, such as cellular phones, PDAs, mini-laptops, and advanced pagers, the devices typically communicate over long distances by bridging telephone calls through existing cellular telephone networks and passing data packets across the network. These wireless devices often have limited to significant data processing and computing capability, and can accordingly send and receive software programs, in addition to voice, across the telephone network.","There exists a wireless telecommunication service that provides a quick one-to-one or one-to-many communication that is generically referred to as \u201cPush-To-Talk\u201d (PTT) capability. The specific PTT group of recipient devices for the communicating wireless device is commonly set up by the carrier and the wireless devices themselves do not allow the modification of the group, i.e. to include or drop individuals from the group, or to purposely direct a communication to be received by any fewer members than the entire group.","A PTT communication connection is typically initiated by a single button-push on the wireless device that activates a half-duplex link between the speaker and each member device of the group and once the button is released, the device can receive incoming PTT transmissions once the button is released. In some arrangements, the PTT speaker will have the \u201cfloor\u201d where no other group member can speak while the speaker is speaking. Once the speaker releases the PTT button, any other individual member of the group can engage their PTT button and they will have the floor.","In existing PTT systems, a person desiring to talk, i.e. have the floor, will press the PTT button and the wireless device will only indicate the availability of the PTT channel with an affirmative or negative audible signal. If an affirmative signal is indicated, then the person starts to talk over the PTT channel, but there is no way for the person to know if his or her communication was received by any member of the group. There accordingly is a need for a system to increase the reliability of the PTT communication being received by member devices of the designated PTT group.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for a wireless device member of a group to have a reliable PTT communication channel that at least is very likely to reach at least one member of the target group. The system and method should indicate to the person desiring to engage in a PTT communication if no group members are available on the wireless network to receive the PTT communication, or otherwise not permit talking on the PPT channel unless the required number of receiving devices is present on the wireless network. Further, such system and method should allow the member wireless devices of the PTT group to easily inform the system of their presence on the wireless network. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method to optimize the talk-permit reliability among wireless devices in a PTT group that the present invention is primarily directed.","The present invention includes a system, method, and computer program for providing a greater reliability for a direct-communication, such as PTT communication, being bridged between members of a communicating group of wireless telecommunication devices. Each wireless telecommunication device, such as a cellular telephone or PDA, of a designated PTT group periodically informs a group communication server of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device on the wireless telecommunication network such that upon receipt of a request from a wireless telecommunication device to talk, the group communication server will attempt to bridge the requested communication channel with the target set of wireless telecommunication devices only if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set has indicated its presence on the wireless telecommunication network.","The system for increasing successful direct communications between a group of wireless telecommunication devices on a wireless communication network includes the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices that are each capable of selectively directly communicating across the wireless communication network with the target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices within the plurality. The group communication server selectively receives the requests to bridge direct communications between the communicating wireless telecommunication device and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices of the target set for the communicating wireless telecommunication device and then selectively bridges the requested direct communication, and the identity of the target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices is selectively available to the group communication server, either resident thereat or otherwise accessible. Each of the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices periodically informs the group communication server of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device on the wireless telecommunication network such that upon receiving a request from a wireless telecommunication device to bridge a direct communication, the group communication server will attempt to bridge the requested direct communication with the target set of wireless telecommunication devices only if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set has informed the group communication server of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device on the wireless network. The group communication server can alternately inform the communicating wireless device if there is no member device present on the wireless network and a direct communication will not be attempted.","The method for increasing successful direct communications between a group of wireless telecommunication devices on a wireless communication network include the steps of establishing a connection to the wireless network from the wireless telecommunication device that is capable of selectively directly communicating across the wireless communication network with the target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices, and then periodically informing the group communication server from the wireless telecommunication device of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device on the wireless telecommunication network, where the group communication server selectively receives requests to bridge direct communications between the communicating wireless telecommunication device and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices in the target set for that communicating wireless telecommunication device.","The method then includes the steps of receiving a request at the group communication server from the wireless telecommunication device to bridge a direct communication to the target set of other wireless telecommunication devices on the wireless network, determining the identity of the target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices at the group communication server, and if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set has informed the group communication server of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device on the wireless network, then bridging the requested direct communication between the communicating wireless telecommunication device and the target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices. Alternately, a greater number of predetermined wireless devices having indicated their presence on the network can be required in order for the group communication server to allow the direct communication to be attempted.","Accordingly, the present system and method are advantageous in that a wireless device member of a group will have a reliable PTT communication channel that is very likely to reach at least one member of the target group because the member devices of the group periodically inform the group communication server of their presence on the wireless network, thus indicating their ability to receive a communication. The system and method can indicate to the person desiring to engage in a PTT communication if no group members are available on the wireless network to receive the PTT communication, and will not use the valuable communication channel if a direct communication cannot be bridged. Further, the system and method can be easily implemented on the member wireless devices of the PTT group to inform the system of their presence on the wireless network either through short direct communication or through piggybacking a signal on existing communication channels already established, such as an ongoing voice or data call.","Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after review of the Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and Claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates the system  for optimizing the talk-permit reliability for one or more wireless telecommunication devices in a PTT group, such as the wireless telephone , smart pager  and personal digital assistant (PDA) , with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network . In the system , each wireless telecommunication device ,, is capable of selectively directly communicating across the wireless communication network  with a target set  of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices with the plurality. For example, the target set for cellular telephone  can all devices in the target set  or a subset thereof, such as pager  and PDA .","A group communication server  selectively receives requests to bridge direct communications between the communicating wireless telecommunication device ,, and the one or more other wireless telecommunication device in the target set  for the communicating wireless telecommunication device, and then selectively bridges the requested direct communication, such as PTT communication. The identity of the target set  is selectively available to the group communication server , such as being resident on the group communication server  or in a connected database , or possibly on another computer device, such as server .","As used herein, the term \u201cbridging\u201d the direct communication is intended to be separate from \u201cregistration\u201d with the group communication server  as exists in current PTT systems. In the existing systems, each PTT wireless device \u201crefreshes\u201d a registration with the group communication server  on a periodic schedule for overall communication purposes, such as locating the wireless device for an incoming voice call. In the present system, each wireless telecommunication device ,, registers with the group communication server  independently of communication registration, such as making the wireless device available to receive voice calls. Thus, when a direct communication, such as a PTT call, is attempted, the bridge is established based on the presence information in the group communication server , as opposed to registration status.","Preferably, each of the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices ,, in the target set  periodically inform the group communication server  of their presence of the wireless telecommunication device on the wireless network , and upon receiving a request from a wireless telecommunication device ,, to bridge a direct communication, the group communication server  will only attempt to bridge the requested direct communication, such as permitting the communication device to talk, if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set  has informed the group communication server  of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device ,, on the wireless network . All of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set  do not need to periodically inform the group communications server  of their presence on the wireless network , but the greater the number of participating wireless telecommunication devices, the greater the optimization of the communication, or talk-permit, reliability.","Furthermore, even if only one wireless device of the target set  is present on the wireless network , the group communication server  preferably still attempts to bridge the direct communication to all wireless devices of the target set  even though some of them may not have indicated their presence. Also, if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices ,, of the target set  has not informed the group communication server  of the presence of that wireless telecommunication device on the wireless network , the group communication server  can poll the target set  of wireless telecommunication devices ,, to determine if at least one of the wireless telecommunication devices are present on the wireless network , prior to sending an error to the communicating wireless device indicating the failure to bridge the connection.","In this embodiment, the wireless telecommunication device (such as cellular telephone ) sends a flag to at least the group communication server , which is present on a server-side LAN  across the wireless network, to indicate that the wireless device is present, i.e. accessible, on the wireless network . The group communication server  can share this information with the set  of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device, or can also share is with other computer devices resident on the server-side LAN  or accessible across the wireless network . The group communication server  can have an attached or accessible database  to store the group identification data for the wireless devices that another server  controls group communications for. It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server-side LAN , or across the wireless network , or Internet generally, are not limited.","The direct communication, such as a PTT communication, can be established through a half-duplex channel between the communicating wireless telecommunication device ,, and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices of the target set . It should be noted that the group communication server  does not have to contact any specific wireless device ,, of the target set  before half of the \u201cbridge\u201d between the communicating wireless telecommunication device and group communication server  is established. That is, the communicating wireless device will send the incoming communication to the group communication server  and the initial half-duplex channel can be opened to the group communication server , which will then determine if members of the target set  of wireless telecommunication devices are available for receiving the direct communication prior to opening communication channels to the members of the target set .","Also, the group communication server  can attempt to bridge the requested direct communication with the target set  if at least a predetermined number of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set have informed the group communication server  of their presence on the wireless network . Such preference can be indicated in the communicating wireless device either in a general set up of the target set  group communications, or at the time the group communication request is made, i.e. 3 PTT button pushes indicates that the group communication server  is to bridge the direct communication only if three members of the target set  have indicated their presence on the wireless network .","In one embodiment, the wireless telecommunication device ,, informs the group communication server  of the presence of the wireless telecommunication device on the wireless network  with a short data burst message in order to minimize bandwidth and communication time over the expensive telecommunication bandwidth. In another embodiment, the wireless telecommunication device ,, can inform the group communication server  of the presence of the wireless telecommunication device on the wireless network  with a message piggybacked on an existing wire communication channel of the wireless telecommunication device on the wireless communication network. Thus, if the wireless device ,, has an open voice or data call, the wireless device can place a flag or other message in the data stream that will ultimately be routed to the group communication server  to inform it of the wireless network  presence of the wireless device ,,. In such embodiment, the period for informing the group communications server  can then be waiting for an open communication channel if desired.","The group communication sever  can also inform the wireless telecommunication device ,, of the inability to bridge a direct communication to the target set  upon a predetermined number of the wireless telecommunication devices (or at least one) of the target set  not having informed the group communication server  of their presence on the wireless network . An example of such embodiment is the 3 times depression of the PTT button at the communicating wireless device  to request group communication if at least 3 persons are on the wireless network , and the group communication server  responding with a data message, such as one that causes an audible error at the communicating wireless device, to indicate that the requested direct communication cannot be bridged. Further, while the group communication server  is shown here as having the attached database  of group identification data, the group communication server  can have group identity data resident thereupon.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["32","70","72","74","76","20","32","50","32"]},"The group communication server(s)  are connected to a wireless service providers packet data service node (PDSN) such as PSDN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PSDN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  is typically located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (\u201cMSC\u201d) . The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the branch-to-source (BTS)  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones ,,,, by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the","Cellular telephones and telecommunication devices, such as wireless telephone , are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held PDAs. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor of the wireless device. The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , can download many types of applications, such as web pages, applets, MIDlets, games and stock monitors, or simply data such as news and sports-related data. In wireless devices that have designated a set  of group members, the wireless device can directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However, all such direct communications will occur through, or at the control of, the group communication server . All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the group communication server  itself, but the server  must be able to ultimately control the communication because it will typically be the only server-side  component that is aware of and\/or can retrieve the identity of the members of the set , or direct the identity of the members of the set  to another computer device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","78","12","14","80","14","14","82","20","80","84","84","84","86","84","88"]},"As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , with a graphics display, but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display, or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","In this embodiment of the wireless device , the computer platform  also includes a direct communication interface  that can open the direct communication channel from the wireless device.

If the group member identity has not been received at decision , then an error  is output to the communicating wireless device requesting the direct communication. The error can indicate to the user of the communication device that the group members of the target set  could not be identified. If the group member identity of the target set  have been received at decision , or if the group member identity was identified at decision , the process then makes a determination as to whether at least one flag (or data message or other indication of network presence) has been received for at least one member device (or the predetermined number of group member devices required to be present) as shown at decision .","If at least one flag (or the predetermined number of flags) has not been received by the group communication server  at decision , then an error  is output to the communication wireless device indicating that the require number of member devices of the target set  were not present on the wireless network  to bridge the requested direct communication.
