No. 12\/661,433, filed Mar. 17, 2010, which is a Continuation-In-Part claiming priority benefit to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/028,958, filed Feb. 11, 2008. The '433 application further claims priority benefit to Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/260,382 filed Nov. 11, 2009. The entire contents and disclosures of each of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention was made with government support under contract numbers N65538-08-M-0049 and N00024-09-C-4140 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Government support also includes matching funds from the Commonwealth of Kentucky (KSTC-184-512-08-038 and KSTC-184-512-09-067).","This invention relates to arc welding, and more particularly to gas metal arc welding and its variants.","Welding is the last operation during fabrication of many high value added products. Manufacturers of such products need welding processes\/technologies to join metals with acceptable quality at as low as possible costs in order to be competitive. To this end, gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and its variants such as submerged arc welding (SAW) and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) have become the most widely used processes for mechanized and automated joining of metals especially in heavy industry where the cost of welding is critical. They are selected over other possible processes for joining metals such as gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), laser and electron beam welding, friction welding, resistive welding, etc. because they are cost effective for vast majority of applications in terms of fast melting of filler metal, easy operation and maintenance, relatively low requirement on joint preparation and working conditions, applicability for many joint designs, relatively low requirement on labor skills, tolerance on process variations, robustness and consistence in weld quality, relatively low equipment and capital investment, etc.","Despite the overall advantage of GMAW and its variants over other processes, there are areas where modifications are needed to further reduce costs. For many applications, the welding time may need to be as small as possible in order to reduce the overall production cycle. First, modifications are needed for GMAW and its variants to further improve the welding productivity by further increasing the welding speed and reducing the number of passes. To this end, the wire needs to be melted at as high as possible speed. Second, for conventional GMAW and its variants which melt wires by the arc established between the wire and work-piece, the arc also heats the work-piece in addition to the wire. The arc heat which directly heats the work-piece, referred to as excessive heat hereinafter, is proportional to the arc heat which melts the wire, referred to as effective heat hereinafter. While the effective heat is always desirable for melting the wire, the excessive heat needs to be controlled at desirable level to achieve desirable level of fusion and control the material properties of the resultant welds; the excessive heat input accumulated over all passes, referred to as accumulative excessive heat input hereinafter, is desired to be as low as possible to control the distortion which is generally considered to increase as the accumulative heat input. Hence, modifications are also needed to control the excessive heat input at desired level and reduce the accumulative excessive heat input as much as permitted.","What are desired are methods to modify the GMAW and its variants such that the modified process can reduce the accumulative heat input and distortion; control the heat input at the level in a particular pass to produce acceptable materials properties; increase the melting speed with only minimal excessive heat input increase; and be incorporated easily with existing GMAW equipment\/investment because of the massive use of GMAW and its variants.","Before a solution can be discussed, some problems in GMAW and its variants need to be analyzed. In conventional GMAW shown in , an arc  is established between the wire  and base metal  and the current  which heats the wire is exactly the same as the current  which heats the base metal (like in all conventional arc welding processes). This fundamental characteristic of conventional arc welding produces unwanted side-effects to all arc welding processes including the GMAW and its variants.","First, in GMAW and its variants, the wire  is primarily melted by the anode heat IVbut the cathode heat IVis imposed totally on the base metal  (workpiece). The effective and excessive heat in conventional GMAW are thus IVand IVrespectively. Because Vis greater than Vin GMAW and its variants, IV>IV. Moreover, the excessive heat IVproportionally increases with the effective heat IVand increasing the current to increase the effective heat for melting the wire  faster will proportionally increase the excessive heat contributing to enlarging the weld pool , degrading the materials properties of the weld and the heat-affected zone (HAZ).","Second, the arc pressure is given as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","arc"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"IJ"},{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03c0"}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"0 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"J","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}},{"mfrac":{"mi":"I","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":"\u03c0","msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","j"],"mn":"2"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"r","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","j"],"mn":"2"}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":"j ","sup":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","arc"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}},{"mn":"8","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","j"],"mn":"2"}}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"r","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","j"],"mn":"2"}}}}}},"mo":"."}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":["arc","max"],"mo":","}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}},{"mn":"8","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","j"],"mn":"2"}}]},"mo":"."}}}},"br":{},"b":["16","13","16","14","13","16"]},"Conventional GMAW and its variants do not have the capabilities to reduce the accumulative heat input and distortion because (1) the needed accumulative effective heat is determined by the weld size or the metal which needs to be melted which are both fixed for a given application; (2) the accumulative excessive heat is proportional to the accumulative effective heat in GMAW and its variants and is also fixed; (3) the sum of the accumulative effective heat and excessive heat is thus also fixed and the accumulative heat input is thus fixed. It is possible to control the heat input at the level in a particular pass to produce acceptable materials properties but the side effect is that the deposition rate will be fixed because (1) the heat input consists of the effective and excessive heat; (2) when the heat input is fixed, the effective heat is also fixed because the excessive heat and effective maintains a fixed proportion; (3) when the effective heat is fixed, the melting speed of the wire  is also fixed. As a result, controlling the heat input at a desired level (typically relatively low) would result in a low deposition rate each pass and the needed number of passes would be large resulting in a low productivity. It is not possible to increase the melting speed without or only with minimal excessive heat input increase because (1) the melting speed is approximately proportional to the effective heat and (2) the excessive heat input is proportional to the effective heat. In short, increasing the melting speed will proportionally increase the excessive heat Finally, increasing melting speed will increase the current  and the arc pressure will increase rapidly causing additional problems.","It can be easily appreciated that the fundamental characteristic of the GMAW and its variants, (i.e., the melting current  which determines the effective heat and melting speed equals the base metal current  which determines the excessive heat and arc pressure) is a significant reason for the root of the problems listed above. Modifications need to be taken to differentiate those two currents but the modifications should be easily incorporated with existing GMAW and its variants' equipment\/investment because of the massive use of GMAW and its variants in addition to being cost effective.","It should be pointed out that several other technologies have been developed to modify GMAW process from different aspects. Among these technologies, two have received attention: tandem GMAW and Variable-Polarity GMAW (VP-GMAW). In Tandem GMAW, two torches have been integrated into one bigger torch, and two close parallel arcs are adjusted by two GMAW power supplies independently. In essence, Tandem GMAW is still considered two parallel GMAW processes, but it can alternate the maximum welding current to each torch. As a result, the arc pressure remains unchanged, and the wire feed speed can be doubled. Hence, if arc pressure is the major concern, Tandem GMAW can double the deposition rate. However, this modification does not reduce the heat input. The ratio between the excessive heat and effective heat remains unchanged from the conventional GMAW. For VP-GMAW, liquid droplets are still detached during the reverse polarity (wire positive) period, but the welding wire can be melted faster during the straight polarity (wire negative) period. It was found that to melt the welding wire at the same rate, the base metal heat input could be \u201cup to 47 percent less\u201d than the conventional pulsed GMAW. The principle is that in conventional GMAW, it is always true that the effective heat is VI and the excessive heat is VI; however, in VP-GMAW, VI and VI alternate its role as the effective and excessive heat. Because VI>VI, this alternation reduces the excessive heat input and increases the effective heat. However, because the current is the same for the generation of the effective heat and excessive heat, it does not appear to be a process which can freely control them to reduce the excessive heat as much as desired.","A welding system and method includes a main torch including a main electrode configured to form a first arc with a base metal; a first bypass torch including a first bypass electrode configured to form a second arc with the main electrode; and a second bypass torch including a second bypass electrode configured to form a third arc with the main electrode.","It is understood that other embodiments of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein it is shown and described only various embodiments of the invention by way of illustration. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the invention.","Regardless of the benefits of the welding systems previously described, no existing technologies or other modifications to GMAW and its variants have the following capabilities at the same time: (1) the capability to reduce the accumulative heat input and reduce the distortion through reducing the accumulative heat input; (2) the capability to control the heat input at the level in a particular pass to produce acceptable materials properties; (3) the capability to increase the melting speed without and only with minimal excessive heat input increase; and (4) the capability to be incorporated easily with existing GMAW equipment\/investment without replacing the existing equipment. While current DE-GMAW techniques and modification come closest to providing all these needed capabilities, improvements to achieve high welding deposition and productivity remain desirable benefits to be achieved by embodiments of the present invention.","As discussed previously  illustrates a conventional, prior art GMAW system. In particular, the system includes a GMAW torch that is in communication with a wire feeder  and a constant voltage (CV) power supply . The power supply  provides a current to the torch , so that the wire  being fed from the wire feeder  may function as a consumable electrode as it is directed to a base metal  to be welded. In this configuration, a current  is provided to the wire . When the wire  completes the welding \u201ccircuit\u201d (e.g., during the process of welding), the current  flows through the base metal . Due to the arrangement of this circuit, the melting current  is equal to the base metal current . Accordingly, an increase in the melting current  results in an equivalent increase in the base metal current  through the base metal . A user desiring to increase the welding speed (e.g., the melting speed of the wire  and deposition of the same) by increasing the melting current , simultaneously increases the base metal current  through the base metal . This increase in current through the base metal  increases heat and distortion of the base metal . Hence, the user must compromise between the speed of the welding, quality of the weld, and the heat and distortion to the base metal .","To overcome some of the limitations of conventional welding systems, an arc welder and related system for welding has been previously disclosed (US Patent Application Publication No. 20080190900). As noted, the present application claims priority to and incorporates by reference this previous patent application. In its most general form, it includes two electrodes for use in and control of the welding process. The welder and system enable increased welding productivity while allowing the current input in a base metal being welded to be independently controlled. Specifically, the welder and system allow for the decoupling of the current used to melt the welding wire from the current through the base metal being welded. This allows for a user to increase the melting current for the welding wire, which increases the deposition rate of the melted welding wire, without increasing the current to the base metal. Accordingly, the base metal current may be controlled at certain levels, while the current used to melt the welding wire is increased.  and  show two examples of such a system.","Thus, referring to  and , a double-electrode gas metal arc welding (DE-GMAW) has been proposed as a possible modification to conventional GMAW process and its variants which differentiates the two currents ,  in a way which can be easily incorporated into existing GMAW equipment\/investment at a low cost. It differentiates the base metal current  from the melting current  by adding a bypass torch  and bypassing part of melting current  through the bypass torch . Two versions of DE-GMAW process have been proposed as adaptations of existing GMAW system consisting of a constant voltage (CV) power supply , a wire feeder , and a GMAW torch .","One version is shown in  where a GTAW torch  is added as the bypass torch. The current supplied by the power source  is broken into two branches at the end (tip) of the wire  one into the bypass torch then to the resistor R  toward the negative terminal of the power source , another into the base metal  toward the negative terminal of the power supply . They are referred to as the bypass current I and base metal current I, respectively. It can be seen, while in conventional GMAW there is no bypass channel so that I=0 and I=I is all the current supplied by the power source , in DE-GMAW I in general is smaller than the current I  which melts the wire . In this case, the effective heat is VI and the excessive heat is VI. It has been found, when the resistance R  of the adjustable resistor is zero, the majority of the current  supplied by the power source  flows through the bypass torch  so that I is large and I is small. One explanation is that the tungsten electrode  of the bypass torch  is much easier than the base metal  to emit electrons. By adjusting the resistance of the adjustable resistor , the distribution of the current I  among I and I and the excessive heat VIcan be freely changed and feedback controlled using a current sensor  to monitor the base metal current I. In previous operations using this process, for example, approximately 370 A of current can be supplied to melt the wire and make a lap joint on 2 mm thick sheet metal with the wire feed speed approximately 550 inch per minute and a diameter of the wire of about 1.2 mm. As a result, sufficient metal was deposited at a high welding speed of 1.5 meter per minute. The base metal heat input was controlled at the needed level by controlling the base metal current  at 200 A approximately. However, after the process was switched to conventional GMAW, all 370 A of current was imposed on the base metal . The excessive heat increased from 200Vto 370Vand the base metal  was thus burnt through. This version of DE-GMAW has been referred to as non-consumable DE-GMAW. It has also been proposed that two GTAW torches are added to provide two bypass channels and it has been named dual-bypass GMAW. This modification should still be a non-consumable DE-GMAW.","Another modification that has been proposed includes adding a second GMAW torch  to an existing GMAW system as shown in . The GMAW torch  is used to replace the GTAW torch because the energy absorbed by the tungsten electrode  is eventually wasted in the cooling water. By replacing the non-consumable tungsten (GTAW torch)  with a consumable wire (GMAW torch) , this part of energy becomes effective heat to melt the bypass wire , rather than to be wasted. As a result, the melting speed is increased. However, the bypass arc  is beneficially controlled in order to be stable. This version of modification has been referred to as consumable DE-GMAW process and an additional constant current (CV) power supply has been added to power the added bypass channel .","Whereas the non-consumable DE-GMAW turns part of the excessive heat from being harmful to being wasted, the consumable DE-GMAW changes it into part of the effective heat. In both versions, the excessive heat is VIand can be controlled by controlling the base metal current Iat the desired level needed for sufficient fusion. The effective heat is V(I+I) in non-consumable DE-GMAW and V(I+I)+VIin consumable DE-GMAW, and it can be controlled in both cases by changing Iafter Ihas been determined based on the control on the excessive heat. Hence, the excessive heat and effective heat can be separately controlled for both cases.","However, the existing DE-GMAW systems shown in  and  have some drawbacks such as: (1) the original system is limited to GMAW; (2) the accessibility is affected by the addition of the bypass torch and the way in which the bypass torch is added; (3) use of bypass torches and water cooling restrict the practicability of using multiple bypass channels to further increase the deposition speed and welding\/cladding productivity; (4) use of one main power supply and main wire restricts the further increase in deposition speed and welding\/cladding productivity; (5) use of single bypass channel method (either consumable or non-consumable) can restrict the capability to either further improve the productivity in certain degree with relatively high process stability, current distribution control range and liquid metal detaching process controllability with non-consumable bypass channel or to improve the productivity significantly but with less controllability of the process stability, relatively limited current distribution range, and less controllability on the liquid metal detaching process; (6) an additional power supply has to be added to the consumable bypass channel and the type of the additional power supply is constant voltage (CC) while the end users may prefer a CV power supply; (7) the power resistors used to control the bypass current in non-consumable DE-GMAW with an additional power supply for the bypass channel consume and waste energy; (8) the torch set is not weaved when traveling along the weld seam and the controllability on the weld bead geometry is weak and strongly coupled with the base metal heat input. These issues can affect the use of the bypass method for higher productivity, for being used in other widely used processes such as SAW and FCAW, for better, more effective, and simpler process control and equipment without adding additional power supplies, without wasting significant amount of energy, and without the need and complexity for adding additional power supplies, for use in applications where the deposition speed, deposition bead geometry, and base metal melting minimization and control are key concerns such as very high speed and cladding.","To overcome some of issues identified above, an improved system, referred to as the Extended Metal Arc Welding System, its various embodiments, its various control implementation methods, and its possible application methods are described herein. In its most general form, the system is formed by attaching bypass channels to one or multiple parallel metal arc systems (referred to as \u201cbase systems\u201d hereafter) including all processes where a consumable is melted by an arc established on it as either a cathode or an anode including but not limited to the conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux cored arc welding (FCAW), submerged arc welding (SAW). The parallel base systems may be arranged in different ways such as the axes of their consumables remain parallel with appropriate distances or they form certain angles. The system may have one or multiple bypass channels while each bypass channel may be powered by its own power supply or by one of the power supplies in the base systems. Further, the system may use one or simultaneously two of the existing bypass methods (consumable wire and non-consumable electrodes). Its realization can be formed using any number of base systems, any combination of different types of base systems, any number of bypass channels or any combinations of the bypass methods.","In its most general form, each particular extended metal arc welding system may have one or multiple, and different kinds, of bypass channels in order to increase the productivity and improve the process stability at the same time. Attaching multiple consumable or non-consumable bypass electrodes to the torch of a base system is important in embodiments of the present invention as are innovative bypass electrode designs. Thus, innovative designs of consumable and non-consumable bypass electrodes to facilitate the attachment of multiple consumable and non-consumable bypass electrodes to a conventional torch in a base system are herein disclosed, as well.","In its most general form, the entire control system has two major types of elements and three major types of variables. The two major types of elements include: (1) the extended system to be controlled which includes the appropriately arranged base systems and the appropriate arranged bypass channels and their components; and (2) the control system, which includes the control algorithm and its implementation hardware and program, sensors and their processing software, and human-machine interface, that controls the extended system. The three major types of variables include (1) the desired objective parameters the extended system is supposed to output; (2) process conditional parameters that describe the given environment and application; and (3) control variables that are adjusted by the control system and are sent as inputs to the extended system. The control variables also include output variables that describe how the system actually processes the material. The objective of the control system is to use the control algorithm to determine how to adjust the control variables such that the output variables approach their desired values as set through the desired objective parameters. For different realizations, the control system and control will take particular and appropriate forms.","When a particular extended metal arc welding system is formed by attaching selected\/arranged bypass channels and associated components to selected\/arranged base systems, the system may or may not have been formed with a sufficient or effective ways to adjust its output variables for some reasons. If it has been formed with sufficient and effective ways to adjust its outputs variables, the input parameters which are used to change the output variables will be identified. Alternatively, if without sufficient and effective ways to adjust output variables, additional hardware\/devices may be added to introduce new input parameters. This control\/implementation method is adaptable based on particular extended metal arc welding systems.","For different applications, the requirements may be different and the extended system may be realized and controlled in particular preferred ways to meet specific requirements. The requirements on the extended metal arc welding system and their realizations and control implementation methods to meet these requirements for different welding and cladding application are described in more detail below. For example, the total heat input and excessive heat input can be conveniently controlled to control the distortion and weld penetration by adjusting the feed speeds of main and bypass wires using a CV power supply as the bypass channel power supply or by adjusting the electronic switch in the bypass channel without adjusting the travel speed.","Beginning with one embodiment shown in , the number of the bypass channels increases from one (either consumable or non-consumable) in the prior art shown in  and  to two consumable ,  and two and non-consumable bypass channels , . For illustration purposes, the number of the base systems is one and the base system  is a conventional GMAW system, although more than one and one types of base systems may also been used. Because of the use of multiple channels, the current bypassing through a particular bypass channel is reduced. If the reduction is sufficient, the undesired water cooling or shield gas cooling may be eliminated. This elimination can reduce the added size to the torch due to the addition of the bypass channels. Further, while a non-consumable bypass channel provides a mean to stabilize the bypass arcing process and control the metal transfer process and a consumable bypass channel provides a means to increase the melting speed of deposited metal, the combination of non-consumable and consumable bypass channels - provides a means to maximize the productivity with improved process and quality controllability.","For illustration purpose, one base system  (referred to as main system) is used; the main current  flowing through the wire  of the main system power supply (referred to as main wire) is approximately 600 A and the base metal current  needs to be controlled at 200 A. If a single non-consumable electrode is used to bypass 400 A, it must be water cooled and overall size of the torch set is large. Using four electrodes -, each electrode only bypasses 100 A and undesired water cooling will be unnecessary. As a result, the non-consumable electrodes ,  may be attached to the main system  with neither water cooling nor shield gas cooling The accessories to supply such cooling will not be necessary.","Also for illustration purpose, one main system is used along with two sets of consumable and non-consumable bypass electrode groups. Each group of bypass electrodes consists of one non-consumable bypass electrode and one consumable bypass wire. The bypass wire  or  is fed into the vicinity of the non-consumable electrode  or  in its group. Because of the non-consumable characteristic, the position of the non-consumable ,  is stationary. The bypass arc established between the main wire  and the non-consumable bypass electrode  or  is stable and stationary. Because of the presence of this stable bypass arc, the bypass wire  or  in the vicinity of the tip of the non-consumable bypass electrode  or  can easily establish its bypass arc with the main wire . The non-consumable bypass arc will play a stabilizer role in stabilizing the consumable bypass arc established between the main wire  and the bypass wire  or . Hence, while the use of consumable bypass wire ,  improves the metal melting speed, the use of the non-consumable bypass electrode ,  stabilizes the arcing process. Their combination provides a unique way to enhance both the productivity and the quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["51","52","53","54","51","58","55","56","52","57","54","58","59","510","56","510","59","57","53","511","59","59","55","55"]},"In another embodiment where a CC power supply powered non-consumable bypass channel is absent, the voltage setting for the consumable bypass arc can be adjusted to change the bypass current. For example, when the voltage setting is increased, the CV power supply will increase the current to achieve the larger voltage. Because the length of the bypass arc is also increased, the stability of the bypass arc may be affected if the voltage setting changes from its optimal range. To use this method to adjust the bypass current, an appropriate range for this bypass voltage setting can be obtained through experiments, theoretical analysis or their combination. Or, an on-line measurement for the bypass arc stability may be formed using such as current waveforms. This measurement can be on-line calculated to determine if the bypass voltage can be further adjusted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["62","63","61","62","64","65","66","67","69","61"]},"There are different ways to introduce additional voltage drops. In one embodiment, additional voltage drops are introduced by adding diodes in series with the corresponding arc. The additional voltage drop in a channel is determined by the sum of voltage drops on each diode in series in the channel and each diode typically does not have exactly the same voltage drop with any another diode. Another method to introduce additional voltage drops is to add power resistors in appropriate channels. Another embodiment is to introduce an additional arc in the series with the bypass arc in the channel to achieve relatively large additional voltage drops. For example, if the voltage setting for the CV power supply is 35V, many diodes would have to be added into the non-consumable channel in order to avoid the majority of the current be bypassed through this channel. Instead, an additional tungsten arc can be formed between a tungsten electrode and water cooling copper block and be added into this channel in series with the bypass arc. By adjusting the distance between the tungsten and the water cooled copper, i.e., the length of the added additional arc, the additional voltage drop can be adjusted to control the bypass current through this channel. It has to be pointed out that for the additional arc, it is not established in the vicinity of the main arc with the main wire. Its effect on the accessibility of the torch set is thus non-existing. In still another embodiment, a network of the added additional tungsten arcs, power resistors, and\/or diodes can be formed through parallel and\/or serial connection. Electronically controllable switch devices such as IGBTs can be appropriately added in parallel with one, multiple, and\/or a combination of the additional voltage drop elements to form flexible network whose effective voltage drops are electronically controllable. In still another embodiment, an electronically controllable switch device such as an IGBT is placed in series with a bypass arc. The close-open of each IGBT is controlled through a high frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) signal from a micro-processor or a circuit such that the bypass current in the channel changes at a high frequency. The effect of this high frequency change is that the effective bypass current is controlled by the duty ratio of the PWM signal.","There are methods to effectively adjust the distribution among the base current and different bypass currents other than the use of additional voltage drops. In one embodiment, the demands from the bypass channels on the needed currents are changed to maintain a stable arc system which includes the main arc and bypass arcs. For the non-consumable channel, the distance between the non-consumable bypass electrode and the main wire can be adjusted in a certain range to increase\/reduce the bypass current of this channel without affecting the stability of the bypass arc and the quality of the welds. For the consumable bypass channel, one effective method is to change its wire feed speed. When the bypass wire speed is reduced, the distance between the main wire and the tip of the bypass wire will tend to increase. The length of the bypass arc column will increase. Based on the current-voltage characteristics, the relationship between the current  and voltage  is approximately a set of parallel straight lines  with approximately the same positive slopes as illustrated in . When the length of the arc column increases, the governing line jumps from a lower one  to a higher one . On the other hand, the voltage between the two terminals (main wire tip and the bypass wire tip) is maintained at the given constant V through the voltage setting. Hence, the voltage before and after the jump remains unchanged. As a result, the operating position changes from A to B as illustrated in  and the current  is reduced.","The methods disclosed for using a single power supply to power an extended metal arc welding system and control the currents also work for any extended metal arc welding system (including the consumable and non-consumable DE-GMAW systems disclosed previously) which has only one bypass channel or just one type of bypass channel.","For certain embodiments of the present invention, with multiple and different types of bypass channels, it is beneficial for both the consumable and non-consumable bypass electrodes to be conveniently attached to the main torch with minimized effect on the torch set. To reduce the cost, it is beneficial that an existing main system is used as the base system and additional parts are added to form an extended system. To this end, bypass electrodes also can be attached to the main torch. An issue, therefore, is how to attach bypass electrodes to the main torch conveniently and with minimal effect on the accessibility. Various methods are discussed below.","A method to attach bypass electrodes ,  to the main torch  conveniently is disclosed first in which the fixture  has slots - which have substantially the same shape as the existing main torch  outer contour and the outer contours of the bypass electrode ,  and its accessories of our selections. In one embodiment shown in , the bypass electrodes ,  are still installed in conventional torches , . Use of substantially the same shape of the contours helps fix\/attach the bypass torches ,  to the main  firmly with the desired relative positions and angles.","Another method is also disclosed which uses curved contact tubes for consumable bypass wires and curved non-consumable electrodes with no accessories for water cooling or force air cooling. In one embodiment shown in , one curved contact tube  for consumable bypass wire  and one non-consumable electrode  are used. They are placed on the opposite sides of the nozzle of the main torch . However, use of one for each type of bypass channel and their locations are for illustration purpose. The method disclosed works for attaching multiple curved contact tubes for multiple consumable bypass wires and multiple curved non-consumable electrodes to the main torch. Their locations around the circumference of the main torch can be arbitrary although it is typically preferred that one curved contact tube for consumable wire and one non-consumable electrode are formed a group and arranged close with each other. Also, the number of the curved contact tubes and the number of the non-consumable electrodes may not be the same.","Elimination of the undesired water cooling and forced air cooling allows the use of the curved contact tubes for consumable wires and curved electrode to bypass currents with no accessories. Use of multiple bypass channels disclosed earlier reduces the bypass current in each channel and allowing the elimination of water cooling and forced air cooling. Use of contact tubes and non-consumable electrodes with no accessories disclosed here makes it possible to use multiple bypass channels. Hence, use of multiple bypass channels and elimination of accessories together form the extended metal arc welding system disclosed. The use of curved contact tubes and non-consumable electrodes has little affect on the accessibility of the extended metal arc welding system as compared with the original base system and the extended metal arc welding system can thus be more practical, because the curving can allow the wire and non-consumable electrode access in the vicinity of the main wire at the desired locations and angles with only minimal effect on the accessibility of the torch set, which is primarily determined by the space occupied by the end of the torch facing the work-piece.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["101","102","101","102","103","102"]},"A method to make a curved contact tube for the bypass wire is also disclosed. While other materials may also be suitable, the curved contact tube  for the bypass wire  may be made of copper. The contact tube should be relatively long, for example, but not limited to, about at least 4 inches, to allow an easy attachment to the main torch. In general, it is preferred that the outer diameter of the contact tube is small to achieve maximal torch accessibility. The inner wall of the contact wall must be smooth like a conventional contact tube in a base system to allow the wire  be fed smoothly. The curvature design needs to be done to allow a smooth feeding of the wire and provide the needed wire position and feeding angle while the torch accessibility is preserved or the effect on the torch accessibility is minimized In one embodiment, a particular contact tube made by Bortech Corporation for being used in a 180 A GMAW torch without water cooling as shown in  is used. In this embodiment, the outer diameter of the contact tube is substantially constant along the length. However, variable outer diameter can also be used. A relatively small diameter at the end (facing the work-piece) and a relatively large diameter at another end can increase the mass of the contact tube to allow a larger bypass current without affecting the torch accessibility. In addition, the outer geometry of the contact tube may be non-round for easy attachment to the main torch.","Still other method is also disclosed to minimize the effect of attached bypass channel to the torch accessibility through \u201coverlapping\u201d with the main torch's nozzle.","In one embodiment shown in , bypass torches are attached to the main torch and their nozzles are removed. For illustration purpose, one consumable torch  and one non-consumable torch  are used and they are placed on the opposite sides of the main torch  as shown in  although more bypass torches can be used and be placed differently. To facilitate the overlapping, the nozzle  of the main GMAW torch is partially opened to accept the insertion of the bypass wire (or bypass wire contact tube) and bypass electrode (or bypass electrode contact tube). The insertion of the wire, non-contact consumable electrode and\/or the contact tubes into the openings on the main torch nozzle beneficially may fill the opening as much as possible so that possible gas leakage is minimal In addition, the openings can be made on the lower part of the main torch nozzle or be made as low as possible as long as the desired distance and angle of the bypass wire and non-consumable electrode with the main wire are achieved.","In another embodiment shown in , the overlapping is used together with the curved contact tubes\/electrodes without accessories to minimize the effect on the accessibility of the torch set. For illustration purposes, one contact tube  and one non-consumable electrode  are used and they are placed on the opposite sides of the main torch  although multiple tubes and\/or multiple non-consumable electrodes can be used and be placed differently. To install the contact tube  and non-consumable electrode \u2033 on the main torch , two non-conductive holders ,  can be used. Each holder can have an inner ring and an outer ring. The OD (outside diameter) of the inner rings and ID (inside diameter) of the outer rings are made with slots with substantially the same shapes of the contact tube  and non-consumable electrode  when the outer rings are screwed on to the inner rings. The inner rings for both holders ,  can be installed onto the main torch  first. Then the contact tube  and non-consumable electrode \u2033 are placed on the ODs of the inner rings and aimed to insert in to the torch openings. Adjustments are made so that the contact tube  and electrode  are both placed at the positions for the desired distances and angles with the main wire . Then the outer rings are placed and fastened\/screwed on to the inner rings. The openings on the main torch are made approximately the same size and shape of the contact tube and\/or electrode to be inserted.","In still another embodiment illustrated in , a composite nozzle  is used so that the main wire, bypass wires, and non-consumable electrodes are all shielded by the shield gas supplied into the composite nozzle. (Although only one bypass electrode\/wire is explicitly shown in , multiple bypass electrodes\/wires can be easily added into the composite torch.) As a result, not only the tips of the bypass wires and non-consumable electrodes can be shielded, their contact tubes are shielded and cooled by the shield gas. This may help improve the shield of the weld pool and help improve the stability of the arcs and facilitate an easier attachment and easier and better overlapping. In addition, the size and shape of the composite nozzle can be designed and made to provide shielding to a relatively large area on the weld pool for being suitable for application where the deposition speed of melted metal is large and the torch moves quickly. The shield gas can be supplied from the upper portion of the composite nozzle to assure the shield gas is provided everywhere without turbulence. Because of the relatively large volume of the nozzle, the flow rate can be relatively high to achieve the needed shield on the weld pool.","In still another embodiment illustrated in , curved bypass contact tubes  and non-consumable electrodes  without accessories are inserted from upper into a composite nozzle . Relatively long segments of the curved bypass contact tubes  and non-consumable bypass electrodes  are shielded and cooled by the shield gas. Because of the use of curved tubes  and electrodes , the effect of added bypass channels on the accessibility can be minimized. The composite nozzle  can thus be made relatively compact while the whole extended bypass wires (out of the contact tubes), relatively long segments of curved bypass wire contact tubes and of non-consumable electrodes ,  are still shielded and cooled.","The various described embodiments to minimize the effect on torch accessibility, work for any extended metal arc welding system (including the consumable and non-consumable DE-GMAW systems disclosed previously) which has only one bypass channel or just one type of bypass channel. In particular, bypass electrodes and channels can be added to a submerged arc welding (SAW) system and a flux cored arc welding (FCAW) system in addition to a gas metal arc welding (GMAW) system. For SAW, the bypass arc is established between the main wire and the bypass electrode (tungsten or wire) in the submerged arc welding flux without a shield gas supplied for the bypass electrode or wire. For FCAW, the bypass arc can be established between the main wire and the bypass electrode (tungsten or wire) with or without a shield gas supplied for the bypass electrode or wire; however, a shield gas is needed for the main torch.","It is also apparent some methods disclosed to minimize the effect on the torch accessibility such as those using curved contact tube and curved non-consumable bypass electrode with no accessories, no water-cooling, and no forced air cooling also may reduce the torch set to a weight which can be comfortably carried by a man. Hence, methods which enable the extended GMAW system to be manually used are also disclosed.","While the \u201chardware\u201d aspects of the extended metal arc welding system have been disclosed, the aspects on how the \u201chardware\u201d can be used are still to be disclosed. Thus, a description is provided below of example uses and performance of various embodiments of the contemplated extended metal arc welding system.","The unique capabilities of an extended metal arc welding system include (1) it can accurately control the excessive heat input, total heat input, total mass input, and weld geometry freely and easily; and (2) it can greatly improve the productivity (metal deposition speed) and improve weld quality at the same time. For the consumable DE-GMAW disclosed previously (US Patent Application Publication No. 20080190900), the main power is CV and the bypass power supply can be either CV or CC. When this system is used, the main wire feed speed and voltage setting are pre-specified and are constant during the welding. The main current which melts the main wire is thus approximately fixed but it is still subject to change due to the variations such as in the contact tube to work distance. Typically it is preferred that the bypass wire speed is fixed and is not adjusted on-line. Now the voltage of the bypass arc which measures the distance between the tip of the main wire and the tip of the bypass wire needs to be controlled as a preferred value to maintain the bypass arc stability by adjusting the bypass current. Because the total current is approximately fixed, an increase\/decrease in the bypass current will decrease\/increase the base metal current accordingly. Hence, the control of the base metal current is coupled with the control of the bypass arc stability. The bypass wire feed speed may be added as an additional variable to achieve a simultaneous control of the bypass arc stability and base metal current but the metal deposition speed would be changed. The excessive heat and total mass input (as well as the total heat input) are thus not controlled freely. For non-consumable DE-GMAW, the excessive heat, total heat input and total mass input can be freely control easily. However, it is less productive than a consumable DE-GMAW.","To control an extended metal arc welding system to achieve the desired objectives including (1) free and convenient control of excessive heat input, total heat input, total mass input, and weld geometry; and (2) improvement of productivity with assured weld quality, several methods can be used.","First, a method with the non-consumable bypass current as the online adjusting variable is disclosed. In one embodiment shown in , the main power supply, consumable bypass power supply, and non-consumable power supply are CV, CV, and CC respectively and there are only one consumable and one non-consumable bypass channel. However, this is only for illustration purpose and the numbers of the consumable and non-consumable bypass channels can both be greater than one and be different. The types of the power supplies may also differ. In this embodiment, the total mass input is first used to determine the sum of the wire feed speeds. Hence,\n\n=1\n","where constant 1 is a constant determined based on the required total mass input (speed), and Wand Ware the feed speeds for the main wire and bypass wire respectively.

The two methods discussed above can control (1) the excessive heat input and arc pressure by controlling the base metal current at a given level; (2) the mass input; and (3) the total heat input. For conventional welding applications, these controls can meet almost all major expectations\/requirements. However, the extremely high productivity of an extended metal arc welding system can allow it be used in non-conventional applications. One example is for example to weld\/fill \u00bd inch thick V-groove in a single pass with the desired heat input, mass input, weld penetration, and weld bead shape. Another example is to clad at a high speed with controlled base metal dilution. To do the latter, the weld bead are made as flat as possible and the weld penetration is minimized to just assure the fusion of the deposited liquid metal with the base metal. For those types of extremely high speed applications, the torch set needs to be weaved to control the weld bead geometry to be as flat and possible and the heat input is approximately evenly distributed in a relatively large area.","In one embodiment, a linear weaver can be used to scan the torch set transversely while it travels longitudinally. For cladding application, this type of torch set weaving is desirable because the surface being cladded is relatively flat in comparison with welding where grooves are typically present. However, this type of weaving can also be used in welding to achieve the desired weld bead with reduced base metal heat input. In another embodiment, a pendulum weaver is used to scan the torch set transversely while it travels longitudinally.","In still another embodiment, a man carries a minimized torch set with curved contact tubes and non-consumable bypass electrodes to weave the torch. The man can adjust the weaving amplitude and frequency to achieve the desired weld bead or desired cladding layer.","Two \u00bd inch thick DH-36 plates are V-grooved. The included angle is 50 degree.

In this realization\/example, the excessive heat input and total heat input serve as a guideline to help us to optimize\/determine the welding parameters in correct directions: i.e., whether to increase or decrease the excessive heat input and\/or the total heat input. For example, if the penetration is larger than needed, then the excessive heat input may be reduced. This would imply a decrease in Ibecause the travel speed v is constant in the present realization. If the total heat input is to remain at the same level, the bypass Iwill be increased accordingly such that the total current reminds unchanged. After the appropriate penetration is achieved, the mass input can be examined. If the mass input is larger than desired, reduce the total current can be reduced by reducing the bypass current while still maintaining the base metal current (thus the penetration capability) unchanged. In this way, the desired mass input and penetration can be achieved and the needed total and excessive heat input are determined to achieve these desired results.","During the implementation phase, the desired excessive heat input and total heat input are known and they will dictate the weld penetration and distortion. However, to maintain these two parameters, the wire feed speeds will subject to change so that the mass input may change from the desired level. Fortunately, the adjustment of the wire feed speeds will be in small ranges such that the mass input is still in the range (the requirement on the mass input is not very accurate).","In the above process, if the cathode voltage and anode voltage are constant, it is unnecessary to know their exact values in order to implement the advanced control system to achieve the desired results mentioned above. Further, even though they may increase with the current, the desired results mentioned above can still be achieved. This is possible because (1) the nominal values calculated and used map one-to-one to their corresponding actual values and (2) the nominal values increase proportionally with their corresponding actual values. As a result, the nominal heat inputs are used hereafter in the advanced system.","In the present realization, the travel speed v is a constant and the cathode and anode voltages (Vand V) are considered constant.
