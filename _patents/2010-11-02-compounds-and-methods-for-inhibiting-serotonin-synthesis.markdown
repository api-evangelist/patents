Genetic and molecular studies have shown that local effectors (cytokines and growth factors) and systemic effectors (hormones and neuromediators) modulate both phases of bone remodeling.","One of the most intensively studied genes regulating bone remodeling is LDL-receptor related protein 5 (LRP5). Loss-of-function mutations in LRP5 result in osteoporosis pseudoglioma (OPPG), a disease characterized by severe bone loss due to a decrease in bone formation and by the persistence of embryonic vascularization of the eyes, causing blindness. By contrast, gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 cause another bone disease, high bone mass syndrome. The involvement of Lrp5 in two human diseases of opposite nature underscores the importance of the pathways controlled by this gene in the regulation of bone formation. However, the mechanism by which LRP5 affects bone development is not known.","Mice genetically deficient for the TPH1 gene (\u201cknockout mice\u201d) have been reported. In one case, the mice reportedly expressed normal amounts of serotonin in classical serotonergic brain regions, but largely lacked serotonin in the periphery. In another, the knockout mice exhibited abnormal cardiac activity, which was attributed to a lack of peripheral serotonin (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:13525-13530).","International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/038817, published as WO 2009\/123978, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety, is directed to methods of diagnosing, preventing, and treating bone mass diseases using therapeutic agents for lowering or increasing serum serotonin levels. International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/064383, published as WO 2010\/056992, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety, is also directed to methods of diagnosing, preventing, and treating bone mass diseases using therapeutic agents for lowering or increasing serum serotonin levels.","The present invention provides compounds that are inhibitors of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the enzyme responsible for the first step of serotonin synthesis in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds are useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of conditions where it is beneficial to inhibit TPH1 and thus lower serum serotonin levels.","It has been discovered that elevated levels of serum serotonin due to overexpression of TPH1 causes decreased bone mass in LRP5 loss of function mutants. Thus, certain embodiments of the invention are directed to methods for treating or preventing low bone mass diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoporosis pseudoglioma (OPPG) by administering compounds that inhibit serotonin synthesis or inhibit TPH1, the enzyme necessary for serotonin synthesis in duodenum. In certain embodiments, the methods may also include administering antagonists of the serotonin receptor HT1B, a receptor mediating the effect of serotonin on osteoblasts.","The compounds disclosed herein that are inhibitors of TPH1 are useful for treating diseases or disorders mediated by peripheral serotonin. In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein that are inhibitors of TPH1 may be used to affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, e.g., by slowing gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying. In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein that are inhibitors of TPH1 may be useful in the treatment or prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis or irritable bowel syndrome.","Certain other embodiments of the invention are directed to pharmaceutical compositions for increasing bone mass that include compounds disclosed herein that decrease serum serotonin levels, optionally together with one or more serotonin receptor antagonists, for use in treating or preventing low bone mass diseases. In some embodiments, the present invention includes a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing anxiety or depression where the pharmaceutical composition includes both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a compound disclosed herein that reduces the level of serum serotonin, in order to prevent patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors from developing osteoporosis or to treat osteoporosis in patients taking SSRIs.","In other embodiments, the present invention provides methods of treating patients for anxiety or depression where an SSRI and a compound disclosed herein that reduces the level of serum serotonin are administered to a patient via separate pharmaceutical compositions.","U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/976,403, filed Sep. 28, 2007, and International Patent Application PCT\/US08\/77870, filed Sep. 26, 2008 and published Apr. 9, 2009 as WO 2009\/045900, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, disclose that brain-derived serotonin (hereafter abbreviated BDS) has the opposite effect as peripheral serotonin. Elevated BDS increases bone mass by acting through HT2C receptors on target neurons in the hypothalamus. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention include administering a combination of therapeutic agents that includes one or more compounds disclosed herein that decrease peripheral serotonin and one or more agents that increase BDS. BDS can be increased by increasing the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the enzyme responsible for the first step of serotonin synthesis in neurons of the brain stem, and by administering agonists of the HT2C serotonin receptor in the brain.","Other methods disclosed herein include steps relating to identifying or diagnosing a person at risk of developing a low bone mass disease such as osteoporosis by determining if the serum level of serotonin in the periphery is abnormally high (about 25% or more) compared to normal individuals, taking into account the age, gender, or other factors that affect serum serotonin levels. Such a person at risk may be treated with one or more compounds disclosed herein that decrease serum serotonin to prevent the low bone mass disease from developing or from progressing. Those of skill in the art will understand that serum serotonin levels may vary among individuals depending on certain factors and will be able to take those factors into account to determine whether a person has abnormally high serum serotonin levels. One range which those skilled in the art may consider to be normal serum serotonin levels is 101-283 ng\/ml (nanograms per milliliter).","Since elevated serum serotonin may not be the only cause of diseases associated with low bone mass, methods other than those measuring serum serotonin levels may also be used to determine if a person having or suspected of having a low bone mass disease such as osteoporosis should be treated with drugs that decrease serum serotonin.","The present invention provides a method of lowering serum serotonin levels in a patient known or suspected to be in need of lowering of serum serotonin levels comprising administering to the patient known or suspected to be in need of lowering of serum serotonin levels a TPH1 inhibitor disclosed herein, optionally with a serotonin receptor antagonist.","The present invention also provides a method of treating or preventing a low bone mass disease in a patient known or suspected to be in need of such treatment or prevention comprising administering to the patient known or suspected to be in need of such treatment or prevention a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds disclosed herein that lower the level of serum serotonin.","In preferred embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein that are TPH1 inhibitors do not cross the blood brain barrier. In other embodiments, compounds disclosed herein that are TPH1 inhibitors do not significantly inhibit TPH2.","In certain embodiments, the compound of the present invention is a TPH1 inhibitor that is a sulfonic acid or a sulfonamide selected from the following or from pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"18.80mm","wi":"51.65mm","file":"US08815883-20140826-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["2","1","1 ","2","2","2"]},"In some compounds, R is hydroxyl or NH, X is \u2014CH\u2014, Y is NH, and Z is CH.

Although gene inactivation experiments in mice or molecular cloning of disease genes in humans were designed initially to identify genes important during embryonic development, results of these studies went further than this initial goal by also shedding new light on the molecular bases of skeletal biology after birth. Among the genes identified either through gene deletion experiments or through human genetic studies that turned out to be important for the maintenance of bone mass in adults, one can cite the vitamin D receptor, Interleukin 6, Estrogen receptor \u03b1 and LDL receptor related protein 5 (Lrp5) (Gong et al., 2001, Cell 107: 513-523; Boyden et al., 2002, N. Engl. J. Med. 346:1513-1521; Yoshizawa et al., 1997, Nat. Genet. 16: 391-396; Ohshima et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:8222822-6; Windahl et al., 2002, Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 13:195-200).","The identification of Lrp5 as a regulator of post-natal bone formation is one of the most vivid examples of how developmental studies can profoundly affect the understanding of physiology because this receptor is expressed during development but its function only becomes apparent post-natally. Indeed, loss-of-function mutations in Lrp5 cause osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) in humans, a pediatric disease, and gain-of-function mutations in Lrp5 cause high bone mass, a phenotype most often appearing only in adolescents and persisting into adulthood (Gong et al., 2001, Cell 107: 513-523; Boyden et al., 2002, N. Engl. J. Med. 346:1513-1521; Johnson et al., 1997, Am. J. Hum. Genet. 60:1326-1332). Likewise, skeletogenesis is normal in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice and their low bone mass phenotype only develops post-natally (Kato et al., 2002, J. Cell. Biol. 157: 303-314).","The LDL receptor related protein 5 (LRP5) is required for normal bone mass, and a low bone mass phenotype is caused by Lrp5 inactivation in humans and mice (Gong et al., 2001, Cell 107:513-523; Kato et al., 2002, J. Cell. Biol. 157: 303-314). Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice have low bone mass with no change in osteoclast surface but decreased osteoblast numbers. Real-time PCR analysis of Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 molecular signature shows that Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 osteoblasts do not show changes in osteoblast-specific gene expression but have decreased expression of cyclin genes ().","Lrp5 and its closest relative Lrp6 are the vertebrate homologues of the gene arrow that encodes a surface receptor functioning as a co-receptor for Wingless, the homologue of the Wnt proteins (Wehrli et al., 2000, Nature 407:527-530; Tamai et al., 2000, Nature 407:530-535). In vertebrate cells, Wnt signaling is mainly mediated by \u03b2-catenin. Upon binding of a Wnt ligand to its receptor, \u03b2-catenin is translocated to the nucleus where it cooperates with Lef\/Tcf transcription factors to activate gene expression (Logan et al., 2004, Annu Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 20:781-810; Mao et al., 2001, Mol. Cell, 7:801-809). According to this canonical model, co-transfection of Lrp5 increases the ability of Wnt proteins to enhance the activity of a Tcf-dependent promoter such as the TopFlash promoter (Gong et al., 2001, Cell 107: 513-523; Boyden et al., 2002, N. Engl. J. Med. 346:1513-1521; Mao et al., 2001, Mol. Cell, 7:801-809). Together, the homology of sequence between arrow and Lrp5 and the ability of Lrp5 to favor Wnt signaling through its canonical pathway have led to a model whereby Wnt signaling would regulate bone mass post natally and during adulthood by regulating osteoblast proliferation and function. There is no reason to question the notion that Lrp5 may be a co-receptor for Wnts and that Wnt signaling is involved in the regulation of bone formation (Glass et al., 2005, Dev. Cell 8:751-764; Holmen et al., 2005, J. Biol. Chem. 280:21162-21168; Day et al., 2005, Dev. Cell, 8:739-750; Hu et al., 2005, Development 132:49-60). Nevertheless, there may be additional mechanisms that explain the bone abnormalities observed in either Lrp5 loss- or gain-of-function models.","Lrp5 Regulates Bone Mass in the Periphery Through Serotonin","TPH1 encodes the first enzyme in the biochemical pathway resulting in serotonin synthesis outside the central nervous system. It is viewed as a cell-specific gene mostly expressed in the enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum (Gershon & Tack, 2007, Gastroenterology, 132:397-414). By contrast, serotonin synthesis in the brain relies on TPH2, which is encoded by a different gene expressed in the central nervous system (CNS).","In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby Lrp5 inactivation affects bone formation, a microarray analysis in WT and Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones was performed. Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) was identified as the gene most highly over expressed in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones having low bone mass disease. This result was surprising since it is the opposite of what would be expected given the role of serotonin in the brain, where it increases bone mass. Remarkably, TPH1 expression was normal in mice lacking \u03b2-catenin in osteoblasts only (Glass et al., 2005, Dev. Cell 8:751-764).","It was shown that TPH1 is overexpressed not only in bone, but also in the duodenum in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice, where TPH1 expression is more than 1300-fold higher than in osteoblasts. It was further discovered that serum serotonin levels are normal in newborn Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice but increase steadily with age as their bone phenotype develops. This is consistent with the fact that the low bone mass phenotype in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice is not present at birth but appears later during development. Further discoveries showed that treating Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice with an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis called pCPA corrects their low bone phenotype (). Finally, it was discovered that TPH1 expression is increased in aging animals, i.e., when bone mass is well-known to decrease. Based on these and additional data described below, it can be conclude that LRP5, through yet unknown mechanisms, is a negative regulator of serotonin synthesis in the duodenum, and that increasing serum serotonin signaling negatively impacts osteoblast proliferation and function.","Serotonin, a Multifaceted Molecule","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biogenic amine that functions both as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and as a hormone in the periphery, where most of it is produced (Gershon et al., 1990, Neuropsychopharmacology, 3:385-395.). Serotonin is generated through an enzymatic cascade in which L-tryptophan is converted into L-5-hydroxytryptophan by an enzyme called tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). This intermediate product is then converted to serotonin by an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. There are two TPH encoding genes, TPH1 and TPH2, which are 71% identical in amino acid sequence and about 90% similar in the catalytic domain. While TPH1 controls serotonin synthesis in the periphery, TPH2 is responsible for serotonin synthesis in the brain (Walther et al., 2003, Science 299:76). Given that serotonin cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, these two genes are therefore solely responsible for regulating the level of this molecule in the periphery and in the brain, respectively. As a consequence, designing TPH1 inhibiting compounds that cannot cross the blood brain barrier is one of the ways to achieve selective inhibition of TPH1 in the periphery and decrease serotonin levels in this physiologic compartment.","TPH1 is expressed almost exclusively in cells of the duodenum, and it is responsible for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin, which represents 95% of total serotonin (Gershon & Tack, 2007, 132:397-414). TPH1 expression in any tissues other than duodenum is at least 100-1000 fold lower. Thus, TPH1 can be viewed as a duodenum-specific gene and peripheral serotonin production as a duodenum-specific process.","Besides its role as a neuromediator, and because of its abundance in the general circulation, serotonin has been implicated in a variety of developmental and physiological processes in peripheral tissues, including heart development, gastrointestinal movement, liver regeneration and mammary gland development (Lesurtel et al., 2006, Science, 312:104-107; Matsuda et al., 2004, Dev. Cell, 6:193-203; Nebigil et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:9508-9513). To carry out its functions, serotonin can bind to at least 14 receptors, most of them being G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). One or several serotonin receptors are present in most cell types, including osteoblasts (Westbroek et al., 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:28961-28968).","Type 1 Collagen, Osteocalcin, Regulatory Genes Affecting Osteoblast Differentiation and\/or Extracellular Matrix Protein Synthesis (Runx2 and Osterix and Atf4) and Osteoclast Differentiation (RankL and Osteoprotegrin) are Normal in Lrp5-Deficient Mice","Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice are indistinguishable by all accounts from WT mice at birth, but afterward progressively develop a significant low bone mass phenotype (Kato et al., 2002, J. Cell. Biol. 157: 303-314). Histological and histomorphometric analyses established that this low bone mass phenotype is due to a decrease in bone formation while bone resorption is unaffected. Importantly, osteoblast differentiation is not affected in the mutant mice while osteoblast proliferation is decreased two fold in the absence of Lrp5. See , which shows that Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice have low bone mass (A) with no change in osteoclast surface (B) but have decreased osteoblast numbers (C).","Real-Time PCR Analysis of Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 Molecular Signature.","To delineate the molecular signature of the disruption of Lrp5 signaling, the expression of multiple genes characterizing either the osteoblast lineage or determining cell proliferation was studied using Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice (Kato et al., 2002, J. Cell. Biol. 157: 303-314). The expression of genes particularly relevant to bone formation was first analyzed. Expression of type I collagen and Osteocalcin, two genes highly expressed in osteoblasts, is normal in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones (data not shown). This finding is important as it establishes that the bone phenotype of the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice is not caused by a defect in type I collagen synthesis, the main constituent of the bone extracellular matrix (ECM). Expression of regulatory genes affecting osteoblast differentiation and\/or extracellular matrix protein synthesis was also studied. Expression of Runx2 and Osterix and Atf4, the three known osteoblast-specific transcription factors, was unaltered in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones (). Likewise, expression of RankL and Osteoprotegerin (OPG), two regulators of osteoclast differentiation expressed by osteoblasts is unaffected by Lrp5 deletion (). This latter feature distinguishes Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 from \u03b2-catenin osteoblast-specific deficient (\u03b2catob\u2212\/\u2212) bones (Glass et al., 2005, Dev. Cell 8:751-764; Holmen et al., 2005, J. Biol. Chem. 280:21162-21168).","Given the decrease in osteoblast proliferation characterizing Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones, the expression of marker genes of cell cycle progression was also studied. Expression of Cyclin D1, D2 and E1, three genes necessary for the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, was decreased in the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones (). Based on these results, it appears that at the molecular level the low bone mass phenotype caused by the absence of Lrp5 is purely a cell proliferation defect while expression of type I collagen, the main protein constituent of the bone extracellular matrix (ECM), and of all 3 known osteoblast-specific transcription factors is normal.","Low Bone Phenotype in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 Mice is not Due to Abnormal Wnt Signaling","Given the sequence homology and convincing experimental arguments suggesting that Lrp5 could be a co-receptor for Wnt and may be part of the Wnt canonical signaling pathway, whether the bone phenotype of Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice was due to abnormal Wnt signaling was investigated. To that end, mice lacking \u03b2-catenin in osteoblasts only were analyzed (Glass et al., 2005, Dev. Cell 8:751-764). It had been shown earlier that mice lacking \u03b2-catenin only in osteoblasts developed a low bone mass phenotype and that this phenotype was caused by a totally different mechanism than the one operating in the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice. Indeed, \u03b2-cat\u2212\/\u2212 mice have a normal number of osteoblasts, an increase of the number of osteoclasts and an increase in elimination of deoxypyridinoline, abnormalities that are secondary to a decrease in OPG expression (Glass et al., 2005, Dev. Cell 8:751-764). In addition, unlike in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones, expression of the cell cycle markers Cyclin D1, D2 and E1 normal in the in \u03b2-cat\u2212\/\u2212 bones (). Thus, the cellular and molecular bases of the \u03b2-cat\u2212\/\u2212 and Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice bone phenotype appear to be quite different. Although these unexpected results do not rule out that Lrp5 could act as a Wnt co-receptor, there was still a possibility that other mechanisms could explain how the loss of Lrp5 could affect bone formation so specifically. To that end, a micro-array analysis looking for genes abnormally expressed in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 compared to WT bones was performed.","TPH1 is Overexpressed in Bone and Duodenum in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 Mice","A microarray analysis of Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 bones surprisingly showed that one of the genes most highly over expressed was TPH1 (). It is important to emphasize that TPH1 expression is normal in \u03b2-cat\u2212\/\u2212 bones and osteoblasts, further underscoring the molecular differences that exist between these two mutant mouse strains. Given the rather confined pattern of expression of TPH1 in WT mice, where it is restricted to the duodenum, its overexpression in Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 bones was surprising and raised the question whether it was an osteoblast-specific feature.","To answer this question, TPH1 expression in all tissues of WT and Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 mice was analyzed by qPCR. It was found that TPH1 expression was also increased 3 fold in duodenum of Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 compared to WT mice (). However, TPH1 expression remained more than 1300 fold higher in duodenum than in osteoblasts in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice (). These latter data suggested for the first time that the bone phenotype observed in Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 mice may primarily have a gut origin. The increase in expression of TPH1 was also observed, albeit as expected to a lower level, in Lrp5 +\/\u2212 mice (). This is an important observation since heterozygous Lrp5+\/\u2212 mice also have a low bone mass phenotype. Importantly, in agreement with the absence of a bone phenotype in newborn Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice, TPH1 expression was not elevated in newborn mice (). The changes in TPH1 expression were reflected in increased serum serotonin levels in both Lrp5 +\/\u2212 and Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 mice (); which were absent at birth but present at 2, 4 and 8 weeks of age. Moreover these changes preceded the appearance of the bone phenotype in Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 mice.","By contrast, the expression of TPH2 in the brain was not affected in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice and serotonin content in the brain was similar in WT and Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 mice (). This observation is consistent with the fact that serotonin does not cross the blood brain barrier (Mann et al., 1992, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 49:442-446) and indicates that the link between Lrp5 function and serotonin biology has to be with peripheral serotonin.","Expression of the TPH1 gene was decreased compared to wild type (WT) in mice engineered with a mutation causing high bone mass in humans in one allele (Lrp5 +\/act duo) or both alleles (Lrp5 act duo) of the mouse Lrp5 gene specifically in cells of the duodenum. RNA was extracted from duodenum of one-month-old mice and expression of the TPH1 gene quantified by real-time PCR ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0329","num":"0327"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"WT","Lrp5 +\/ act duo","Lrp5 act duo"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Relative Tph1","1","0.77 \u00b1 0.000","0.54 \u00b1 0.005"]},{"entry":"expression"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Mice engineered with a mutation causing high bone mass in human in the Lrp5 gene specifically in cells of the duodenum (Lrp5 act duo) show a higher bone mass than wild type mice ().","Taken together, the results of these analyses indicated that the increase in TPH expression caused by Lrp5 deficiency was restricted to TPH1 (and therefore to peripheral serotonin) and that it occurs both in osteoblasts and duodenal cells although its expression is at least 1300-fold higher in duodenum. This result raises two questions: is the increase in serum serotonin the cause of the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice bone phenotype and is this an endocrine effect mediated by the production of serotonin by duodenal cells and\/or an autocrine effect related to the local production of serotonin by osteoblasts?","Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 and 5Htt\u2212\/\u2212 Mice have Identical Bone Phenotypes","If the bone phenotype of the Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 mice is secondary to an increase in the level of serum serotonin, then a mouse model characterized by an increase in serum serotonin should have not only the same histological bone phenotype as the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice but also the same molecular signature defined previously, i.e., decreased cyclin gene expression and normal type I collagen expression (). This is what was observed.","The Serotonin Synthesis Inhibitor (pCPA) Rescues the Bone Phenotype of Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 Mice","Consistent with the conclusion that the increase in serum serotonin level is responsible fully or partly for the bone phenotype of the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice is the discovery that pCPA, a serotonin synthesis inhibitor (Eldridge et al., 1981, Ann. Rev. Physiol. 43:121-135), prevented the appearance of the Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bone phenotype by decreasing serotonin production. WT and Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice were treated with 300 mg\/kg pCPA intraperitoneally three times per week, from 3 weeks to 12 weeks of age () and the changes in serum serotonin levels, TPH1 expression in gut and TPH2 expression in brain stem were analyzed. Bone histomorphometry was also performed. As shown in , pCPA treatment corrected the bone abnormalities observed in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 mice without overtly affecting bone mass in WT mice. This rescue of the Lrp5 \u2212\/\u2212 phenotype was achieved by normalization of the gut TPH1 mRNA and of serum serotonin levels (). Brain TPH2 mRNA levels were not affected in the treated mice, further demonstrating that the phenotype observed in Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 bones is directly caused by changes in serum, not brain, serotonin levels.","Serotonin Binds to Specific Serotonin Receptors in Osteoblasts","From the working hypothesis that Lrp5 acts on bone formation through serum serotonin, a third inference was tested: osteoblasts should express some serotonin receptors, and serotonin treatment of osteoblasts should blunt the expression of Cyclin D1, D2 and E1 without affecting the expression of \u03b1(I) collagen, Runx2 or Osteocalcin. To address the first part of this point, the expression of each of the known serotonin receptors was analyzed by qPCR in WT osteoblasts. The expression of three different serotonin receptors in osteoblasts, all belonging to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily was detected (Noda et al., 2004, Mol. Neurobiol. 29:31-39). HT1B was the most highly expressed receptor. It is coupled to G-type G proteins and inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. HT2B is the second most abundant receptor and is coupled to the G proteins that activate a phosphatidyl-inositolcalcium second messenger system. Lastly, HT2A is the third receptor significantly expressed in osteoblasts. Like HT2B, it is coupled to the G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Remarkably, HT1B, the most highly expressed serotonin receptor in osteoblasts, is also more highly expressed in these cells than in any other cells. Thus, there is at least a partially cell-specific signaling pathway occurring in osteoblasts that could be able to specifically transduce serotonin signaling in these cells. See  which shows real-time PCR analysis of the expression of known serotonin receptors expression in WT osteoblasts (A) and of the expression of cyclins and osteoblast-specific genes in primary osteoblasts treated with serotonin or vehicle (B).","To test whether serotonin regulates the expression of cyclins in osteoblasts, a real-time PCR analysis of cyclin expression in primary osteoblasts treated with serotonin or vehicle was performed. As shown in , expression of Cyclin D1 and D2 was decreased in the presence of serotonin. In contrast, expression of Runx2, Osteocalcin and Type I collagen was not modified (). That the molecular signature of serotonin treatment of osteoblasts is similar to the one displayed in absence of Lrp5 further strengthens the hypothesis of a functional link between Lrp5 and serotonin signaling in osteoblasts.","Decreased expression of Cyclin D1 is a major feature of both Lrp5 deficiency and serotonin treatment of osteoblasts (). One transcription factor that is known to modulate the expression of cyclin genes and is expressed in osteoblasts is CREB (Fu et al., 2005, Cell 122:803-815). Therefore, whether serotonin could decrease CREB activity in these cells was tested. As shown in , serotonin treatment significantly decreased CREB phosphorylation in primary osteoblasts. Furthermore, a CREB binding site in the Cyclin D1 mouse promoter was identified and it was shown using ChIP assays that serotonin decreased binding of CREB to this promoter (). These two observations raise the hypothesis that CREB could be mediating serotonin action on osteoblasts.","TPH1 Expression is Increased in Aging Animals","It has been shown in that TPH1 expression increases with age (Murakami et al., 2007 Feb. 28 [Epub ahead of print], Neurobiol Aging). To test if this was also the case in mammals, TPH1 expression in aging mice was analyzed. Using real time PCT, it was shown that, while expression of Lrp5 remained stable with age, expression of TPH1 doubled in 1 year-old compared to 2 month-old mice (). Since serum serotonin acts as a negative regulator of bone formation, such an increase in TPH1 expression with age exacerbates the bone loss associated with aging and therefore is a target for therapeutic intervention for age-related bone loss.","Methods of Diagnosis and Treatment","The results disclosed herein show that elevated serum serotonin decreases bone mass and low serum serotonin increases it.

If the patient's level of serum serotonin is significantly higher (e.g., more than about 25% higher) than the level in a normal subject, then the patient is at risk of developing abnormally low bone mass and TPH1 inhibitors that reduce serotonin synthesis, optionally with serotonin receptor antagonists (that target HT1B, HT2A and\/or HT2B), can be administered to reduce (and preferably normalize) serum serotonin levels and, optionally, block the effect of serotonin on serotonin receptors, thereby preventing low bone mass from developing or minimizing the extent of bone loss, should such loss develop. Patient monitoring will determine if an abnormal serum serotonin profile is chronic.

For example, prodrugs of the TPH1 inhibitors could be produced by esterifying the carboxylic or other acid functions of the TPH1 inhibitors with a lower alcohol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, etc. The use of prodrugs of the TPH1 inhibitors that are not esters is also contemplated. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters of the TPH1 inhibitors are also contemplated. In some embodiments, the prodrugs will contain a biohydrolyzable moiety (e.g., a biohydrolyzable amide, biohydrolyzable carbamate, biohydrolyzable carbonate, biohydrolyzable ester, biohydrolyzable phosphate, or biohydrolyzable ureide analog). Guidance for the preparation of prodrugs of the TPH1 inhibitors disclosed herein can be found in publications such as , Bundgaard, A. Ed., Elsevier, 1985; , Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, pages 113-191; and Bundgaard, H., Advanced Drug Delivery Review, 1992, 8, pages 1-38.","In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein inhibit TPH1 without significantly affecting the level of brain-derived serotonin. Methods of obtaining such inhibitors include: (1) screening for compounds that inhibit TPH1 to a much greater extent than TPH2; and (2) screening for compounds that, while they inhibit both TPH1 and TPH2, cannot cross the blood brain barrier and thus are effectively specific for TPH1 when administered to the patient outside the central nervous system. Of course, compounds that both inhibit TPH1 to a much greater extent than TPH2 and cannot cross the blood brain barrier are also suitable. Preferably, compounds that inhibit TPH1 to a much greater extent than TPH2 have an ICfor TPH2 that is at least about 10-fold greater than their ICfor TPH1.","In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein are TPH1 inhibitors that do not significantly affect the level of expression of Type 1 collagen, osteocalcin, Runx2, Osterix, or Atf4 in osteoblasts. In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein are TPH1 inhibitors that decrease the expression of Cyclin D1, D2 and E1 in osteoblasts.","Unless otherwise indicated, one or more adjectives immediately preceding a series of nouns is to be construed as applying to each of the nouns. For example, the phrase \u201coptionally substituted alky, aryl, or heteroaryl\u201d has the same meaning as \u201coptionally substituted alky, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl.\u201d","A chemical moiety that forms part of a larger compound may be described herein using a name commonly accorded it when it exists as a single molecule or a name commonly accorded its radical. For example, the terms \u201cpyridine\u201d and \u201cpyridyl\u201d are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridyl\u201d and \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridine\u201d are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol and pyridin-4-ol.","If the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it, unless the chemical name associated with the structure indicates otherwise. Similarly, names of compounds having one or more chiral centers that do not specify the stereochemistry of those centers encompass pure stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, any atom shown with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences. When the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is indicated with, for example, a bold or dashed line, the use of that structure in the methods describe herein encompasses the use of the indicated stereochemistry substantially free of any of the non-indicated structure. For example, such use includes the use of the indicated structure where the indicated structure is present in an enantiomeric excess of 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 99.5%.","In certain embodiments of the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds described herein is administered in combination with other compounds that are known to increase bone mass to a subject who has or is at risk of developing a low bone mass disease in order to treat or prevent such disease. In certain embodiments, the other compound is a bisphosphonate.","The efficacy of low bone density therapy by administering TPH1 inhibitors can be monitored by measuring bone density or bone mass changes before and over time after treatment to determine drug efficacy. Techniques for measuring bone mass include those techniques well known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, skeletal X-rays, which show the lucent level of bone (the lower the lucent level, the higher the bone mass); classical bone histology (e.g., bone volume, number and aspects of trabiculi\/trabiculations, numbers of osteoblast relative to controls and\/or relative to osteoclasts); and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Levis & Altman, 1998, Arthritis and Rheumatism, 41:577-587) which measures bone mass and is commonly used in osteoporosis. BFR means bone formation rate. Any method known in the art can be used to diagnose a person as having, or being at risk of developing, a low bone mass diseases, or to determine the efficacy of therapy using the compounds disclosed herein.","The present invention provides methods of preventing or treating a low bone mass disease in a patient known or suspected to be in need of such prevention or treatment comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound disclosed herein that is a TPH1 inhibitor together with a therapeutically effective amount of a serotonin receptor antagonist.","In certain embodiments, the serotonin receptor antagonist is an HT1B, HT2A or HT2B receptor antagonist. In preferred embodiments, the serotonin receptor antagonist is an HT1B antagonist.","The serotonin receptor antagonist may be one of the many known antagonists of peripheral serotonin receptors HT1B, HT2A or HT2B that are present on osteoblasts.

appropriate value for each patient by monitoring the compound's effect on serum serotonin levels, which can be frequently and easily monitored. The agent can be administered once or multiple times per day. Serum serotonin levels can be monitored before and during therapy to determine the appropriate amount of TPH1 inhibitor to administer to lower serum serotonin levels or bring serum serotonin levels to normal and to maintain normal levels over extended periods of time. In a preferred embodiment, a patient is tested to determine if his\/her serum serotonin levels are significantly elevated above normal levels (about 25% above) before administering treatment with TPH1 inhibitors and, optionally, HT1B, HT2A or HT2B receptor antagonists. The frequency of administration may vary from a single dose per day to multiple doses per day.","Preferred routes of administration include oral, intravenous and intraperitoneal, but other forms of administration may be chosen as well.","Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to pharmaceutical formulations of compounds disclosed herein that are TPH1 inhibitors combined with SSRIs for administration to a patient undergoing long term SSRI administration, in order to prevent the bone loss that may occur during long term SSRI administration or to maintain or increase normal bone mass.","In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein act selectively on peripheral serotonin or are administered in an amount that decreases serum serotonin without decreasing brain-derived serotonin.","In other embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein, optionally with serotonin receptor antagonists, are formulated and administered together with bisphosphonates such as FOSAMAX\u00ae (alendronate sodium), FOSAMAX PLUS D\u00ae (alendronate sodium\/cholecalciferol), BONIVA\u00ae (ibandronate sodium) or other bone building drugs, vitamins or minerals to potentiate their effects on increasing bone mass.","Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of TPH1 inhibitors is straightforward, as one can administer the inhibitors in an amount and for a duration that reduces peripheral serum serotonin levels, and over time increases bone mass. Both serum serotonin and bone mass can be easily measured. Example 1 provides the details of one immunoassay for monitoring the level of serum serotonin. Example 3 provides further assays for serum serotonin that may be used. Monitoring serum serotonin is simple and can be done frequently during the course of therapy to establish the appropriate dose for each patient. Any method known in the art for assaying serum serotonin can be used. Increased bone mass can be measured as described herein using various means of measuring bone density and markers of bone growth or can be measured by other methods known in the art.","U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/976,403, filed Sep. 28, 2007, and International Patent Application PCT\/US08\/77870, filed Sep. 26, 2008 and published Apr. 9, 2009 as WO 2009\/045900, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, disclose that brain-derived serotonin increases bone mass and decreases sympathetic tone. Another embodiment of the present invention for treating or preventing low bone mass diseases is directed to methods for treating or preventing low bone mass by administering agents that decrease sympathetic tone, such as beta blockers, together with a compound disclosed herein that is a TPH 1 inhibitor, either in a single formulation or separately. The use of any agent that decreases sympathetic tone together with a compound disclosed herein that is a TPH 1 inhibitor comes within the scope of the invention. Preferably, the agent that decreases sympathetic tone is a beta-2 receptor antagonist, many of which are described in the art. Among the beta blockers that can be used are three beta-2 specific blockers that can be used to reduce sympathetic tone and increase bone mass, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents described herein: IPS339, ICI118,551, and Sandoz L1 32-468 (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1984 April; 68(4): 245-247). Butaxamine is also a beta-2 blocker that may be used in the present invention. Non-selective beta blockers include: metipranolol, nadol (a beta-specific sympatholytic which non-selectively blocks beta-2 adrenergic receptors); oxprenolol (a lipophilic beta blocker which passes the blood-brain barrier more easily than water soluble beta blockers), penbutolol, pindolol (a beta blocker that acts on serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in the brain, resulting in increased postsynaptic serotonin concentrations), and propranolol (known to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, timolol and sotalol. The beta blockers and compounds disclosed herein that are TPH1 inhibitors can be administered together with agents that directly or indirectly increase brain-derived serotonin, including HT2C receptor agonists, agents that increase TPH2 activity or expression, and agents that specifically decrease reuptake of BDS.","Certain other embodiments of the invention are directed to a pharmaceutical composition that includes a TPH1 inhibitor and an HT1B, HT2A or HT2B antagonist, individually or in combination. More than one type of TPH1 inhibitor or HT1B, HT2A or HT2B antagonist can be administered together for treating diseases associated with low bone mass, and certain embodiments include corresponding pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. In other embodiments, the different types of agents are administered separately at one or more times on the same day, or over a period of days, sometimes alternating administration of the various respective agents.","Some embodiments are directed to pharmaceutical compositions for treating or preventing anxiety or depression that include both SSRIs and drugs that reduce the level of serum serotonin (e.g., TPH1 inhibitors and, optionally, HT1B antagonists) in order to prevent patients who take serotonin reuptake inhibitors from developing osteoporosis. These preparations would permit the SSRIs to elevate brain-derived serotonin to treat anxiety without increasing peripheral serotonin, which can cause low bone mass diseases like osteoporosis.","Elevated brain-derived serotonin increases bone mass by acting through HT2C receptors on target neurons in the hypothalamus. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention include administering combination drug therapy using pharmaceuticals that decrease peripheral serotonin and increase brain-derived serotonin. For example, an HT2C agonist may be combined with a TPH1 inhibitor.","In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method comprising:","(a) identifying a patient in need of therapy for a low bone mass disease;","(b) administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound disclosed herein that decreases serum serotonin levels.","In certain embodiments, \u201cidentifying\u201d in step (a) above may be done by measuring the patient's level of serum serotonin, e.g., by forming a detectable complex of serum serotonin and a reagent that binds to serum serotonin in order to determine the patient's level of serum serotonin, where an elevated level of serum serotonin identifies the patient as being in need of therapy for hyperlipidemia or atherosclerosis. In certain embodiments, the reagent is an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to serotonin. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment that binds to serotonin is labeled (e.g., radioactively, antigenically, fluorescently, with peroxidase etc.) and measuring the patient's level of serum serotonin includes the step of detecting a physical transformation in the label (e.g., radioactive decay of the label) or in a substance acted upon by the label (oxidation of a substrate by a peroxidase label).","In certain embodiments, \u201cidentifying\u201d in step (a) above includes transforming serotonin from a bodily sample from the patient into a derivative of serotonin, e.g., N-acylserotonin. In certain embodiments, \u201cidentifying\u201d in step (a) above includes subjecting serotonin or a serotonin derivative from a bodily sample from the patient to chromatography where the serotonin is separated from the components of the blood with which it is normally found and interacts with the stationary phase used in the chromatographic process.","In certain embodiments, the patient's level of serum serotonin is determined to be elevated in comparison to a standard level of serum serotonin that has previously been determined to be a normal level. In other embodiments, the patient's level of serum serotonin is determined to be elevated in comparison to a level of serum serotonin measured in a person who is known not to be in need of therapy for a low bone mass disease. In other embodiments, the patient's level of serum serotonin is determined to be elevated in comparison to a level of serum serotonin measured in the patient at a time when the patient was known not to be in need of therapy for a low bone mass disease.","The present invention encompasses the use of a TPH1 inhibitor and, optionally, a serotonin receptor antagonist (e.g., an HT1B antagonist) for the manufacture of a medicament for preventing or treating a bone disease (e.g., a low bone mass disease such as osteoporosis). The present invention encompasses the use of a TPH1 inhibitor and, optionally, a serotonin receptor antagonist (e.g., an HT1B antagonist) for preventing or treating a bone disease (e.g., a low bone mass disease such as osteoporosis).","The compounds disclosed herein that are TPH1 inhibitors may be useful for treating or preventing various diseases or disorders mediated by peripheral serotonin. Particular diseases or disorders include carcinoid syndrome and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. Examples of specific diseases and disorders include abdominal pain (e.g., associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid), anxiety, carcinoid syndrome, celiac disease, constipation (e.g., constipation having an iatrogenic cause, and idiopathic constipation), Crohn's disease, depression, diabetes, diarrhea (e.g., bile acid diarrhea, enterotoxin-induced secretory diarrhea, diarrhea having an iatrogenic cause, idiopathic diarrhea (e.g., idiopathic secretory diarrhea), and traveler's diarrhea), emesis (e.g., chemotherapy-induced emesis), functional abdominal pain, anorectal disorders, bloating, dyspepsia, gallbladder disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; including IBD-d, IBS-c and IBS-a), lactose intolerance, MEN types I and II, nausea, Ogilvie's syndrome, Pancreatic Cholera Syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency, pheochromacytoma, scleroderma, somatization disorder, sphincter of Oddi disorders, ulcerative colitis, and Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.","Additional diseases and disorders for which the compounds disclosed herein that are TPH1 inhibitors may be useful include cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and disorders, such as acute and chronic hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (e.g., bronchoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension following pulmonary embolism), pulmonary hypertension (e.g., pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension), and radiation pneumonitis (including that giving rise to or contributing to pulmonary hypertension). Others include abdominal migraine, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), carcinoid crisis, CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyl), telangiectasia), serotonin syndrome, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","Therapeutic agents such as TPH1 inhibitors, serotonin receptor antagonists, serotonin receptor agonists, SSRIs, and beta blockers described herein may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions. The therapeutic agents may be present in the pharmaceutical compositions in the form of salts of pharmaceutically acceptable acids or in the form of bases. The therapeutic agents may be present in amorphous form or in crystalline forms, including hydrates and solvates. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a TPH1 inhibitor or serotonin receptor antagonist.","Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of any of the TPH1 inhibitors, serotonin receptor antagonists, or serotonin receptor agonists described herein come within the scope of the invention. A \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable derivative\u201d of a TPH1 inhibitor, serotonin receptor antagonist, or serotonin receptor agonist means any non-toxic derivative of a TPH1 inhibitor, serotonin receptor antagonist, or serotonin receptor agonist described herein that, upon administration to a recipient, exhibits that same or similar biological activity with respect to reducing serum serotonin expression or modulating serotonin receptor activity as the TPH1 inhibitors, serotonin receptor antagonists, or serotonin receptor agonists described herein.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein for use in treating or preventing diseases associated with abnormally low bone mass, include those salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate salts. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.","Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N(Calkyl)salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the therapeutic agents disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.","Unless indicated otherwise, the compounds disclosed herein are also meant to include all stereochemical forms of the compounds disclosed herein (i.e., the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center). Single enantiomers, racemic mixtures, and diastereomers of the compounds disclosed herein are within the scope of the invention. Also within the scope of the invention are steric isomers and positional isomers of the compounds disclosed herein. The compounds disclosed herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds disclosed herein in which a molecule of hydrogen is replaced by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon molecule by C- or C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.","In a preferred embodiment, the compounds disclosed herein are administered in a pharmaceutical composition that includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle\u201d refers to a non-toxic carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle that does not destroy or significantly diminish the pharmacological activity of the compound with which it is formulated. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that may be used in the compositions of this invention encompass any of the standard pharmaceutically accepted liquid carriers, such as a phosphate-buffered saline solution, water, as well as emulsions such as an oil\/water emulsion or a triglyceride emulsion. An example of an acceptable triglyceride emulsion useful in the intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of the compounds is the triglyceride emulsion commercially known as INTRALIPID\u00ae. Solid carriers may include excipients such as starch, milk, sugar, certain types of clay, stearic acid, talc, gums, glycols, or other known excipients. Carriers may also include flavor and color additives or other ingredients.","In the practice of the invention, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably administered orally. However, the pharmaceutical compositions may be administered parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the pharmaceutical compositions may be aqueous or oleaginous suspensions. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.","For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.","The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, solid forms such as capsules and tablets. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used include microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient may be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.","The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such pharmaceutical compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and\/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.","Should topical administration be desired, it can be accomplished using any method commonly known to those skilled in the art and includes but is not limited to incorporation of the pharmaceutical composition into creams, ointments, or transdermal patches.","Where the pharmaceutical compositions contain both agents that act peripherally like HT1B antagonists or TPH1 inhibitors and agents that act centrally like HT2C agonists, the compositions can be formulated to increase delivery of the centrally acting therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. If a compound having therapeutic utility does not easily cross the blood brain barrier, it can be modified using various methods in medicinal chemistry known in the art that attach various side groups to improve permeability through the blood brain barrier.","Serotonin receptor antagonists (e.g., HT1B receptor antagonists) can be derivatized or otherwise designed to enhance uptake by bone, using medicinal chemistry methods known in the art.","The TPH1 inhibitors and HT1B antagonists can be derivatized by the formation of a reversible linkage with one or more suitable groups to yield \u201cpro-drugs,\u201d i.e., chemical derivatives that, after absorption by the host, are converted into the parent compound. Liberation of the parent compound may be by chemical hydrolysis or enzymatic attack. A derivative or pro-drug can have enhanced permeability for the target organ. In the case of TPH1 inhibitors, the target organ is the duodenum where 95% of peripheral serotonin is made. HT1B antagonists could be formulated to have enhanced penetration of bone to reach the osteoblast target. The prodrug has an enhanced permeability according to the present invention if, after administration of the pro-drug or derivative thereof to a living organism, a higher amount of the compound reaches the target organ, resulting in a higher level of effective agent, as compared to administration of the base compound without derivatization.","The amount of the therapeutic agents of the present invention that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a pharmaceutical composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It should be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician as well as the severity of the particular disease being treated. Despite their variety, accounting for these factors in order to select an appropriate dosage or treatment regimen would require no more than routine experimentation.","Additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat bone diseases associated with abnormally high or abnormally low bone mass, may also be present in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat a particular disease, or condition, are known as \u201cappropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated.\u201d Examples of appropriate agents for osteoporosis include FOSAMAX\u00ae, other bisphosphonates, FORTEO\u00ae (parathyroid hormone) and beta-blockers.

It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.","One month old C57Bl\/6 inbred male mice, weighing 15-16 g were used in the experiments. Animals were housed under 12 h light\/12 h dark conditions in a room with controlled temperature (22\u00b0 C.) and humidity (60%). Mice had ad libitum access to food and water, and were used after a minimum of 4 days of acclimatization to the housing conditions. All experiments were conducted following Columbia University Guidelines for the Animal Use and Care of laboratory mice.","Experimental Protocol","Before the experiments, animals were separated into individual cages one day prior to the experiment. Compounds were fed orally (gavage) to the mouse, calculated according to the weight of the mouse, twice a day at 1700 h and at 1100 h. Oral feeding was selected over intravenous or intraperitoneal infusion of the compound for better inhibition of Tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) present in the gut vs TPH2 that synthesizes serotonin and is present in the brain, TPH2. This route created two potential barriers for the compound to reach the brain. First, the intestinal blood barrier that may have poor permeability and hence may not allow all the amount given orally to be absorbed in the circulation. The second barrier is the blood-brain barrier that shows poor permeability to a large number of compounds. Control animals received the same volume of vehicle. Blood was collected through heart puncture on isofluorane-anaesthesized animals and allowed to clot for 5 minutes on ice. The serum was separated, snap chilled in liquid nitrogen and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. till analyzed. Brainstems from all the animals were collected and processed for brain serotonin measurement through HPLC. Mice were observed for any physical or behavioral abnormality during the course of investigation.","Serotonin Measurements in Serum","The Serotonin ELISA kit obtained from the Fitzgerald company was used to measure derivatized serotonin from serum. Derivatization is part of the sample preparation. Serotonin present in the serum was first quantitatively acylated into N-Acylserotonin using the acylation reagent. The principle of the assay is based on competitive ELISA, wherein serotonin that is bound to the solid phase of the plate and the N-acylserotonin compete for the fixed number of antiserum binding sites. When the reaction is in equilibrium, free antigen and free antigen-antiserum complexes are removed by washing.","The antibody bound to the solid phase serotonin is then detected using antirabbit\/peroxidase. The substrate TMB\/Peroxidase reaction is read at 450 nm. The amount of antibody bound to the solid phase serotonin is inversely proportional to the concentration of serotonin in the sample.","Drugs Used in the Study","para-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) obtained from Sigma Aldrich Corp. was used. pCPA was dissolved in a twice molar solution of NaHCOin water and given to mice orally at a dose of 250 mg\/kg and 500 mg\/kg.","The structure of pCPA is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0446","num":"0444"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00053","num":"00053"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00053","he":"13.72mm","wi":"34.46mm","file":"US08815883-20140826-C00053.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Two possible methods of measuring serum serotonin levels are as follows:","(1) Initial steps are performed at room temperature using polypropylene tubes and pipettes. Establishing free flow by venipuncture, blood is collected from an antecubital vein with a 19-gauge, thin-walled butterfly needle into EDTA-containing vacuum tubes. The tubes are centrifuged (Sorvall GLC-2B) at 800 rpm (100\u00d7g) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The upper layer of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), about 0.3 cm from the interface layer (buffy coat), is removed with a plastic pipette and transferred to a new polypropylene test tube. The tube containing the platelet-poor plasma (PRP) is iced for 10 min before being centrifuged at 11,000 rpm (14,500\u00d7g) in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 6 min at 4\u00b0 C. to yield the platelet pellet and platelet poor plasma (PPP). The supernate containing PPP is removed and placed into a new polypropylene test tube in a volume of 500 microliters in Eppendorf tubes. The platelet-rich pellets are resuspended in 1 ml saline. Mixing or vortexing, before transfer to an Eppendorf tube, is sometimes required to maintain a homogenous suspension without clumps. The aliquoted plasma supernate (PPP) and the resuspended pellet (PRP) are kept at \u221220. For the serotonin assay, the samples are resuspended in saline. The \u2018hormonal\u2019 element of serotonin that is of most interest is the circulating level in PPP but the PRP fraction will also be measured. The method is an ELISA obtained from Fitzgerald Industries International (Concord, Mass.). It measures the derivatized serotonin from serum or plasma samples or urine samples. Derivatization is part of the sample preparation. Serotonin present in the biological fluids (e.g., serum) is first quantitatively acylated using the acylation reagent into N-acylserotonin. The assay is based on the competitive ELISA principle wherein serotonin that is bound to the solid phase of the plate and the N-acylserotonin competes for the fixed number of antiserum binding sites. When the reaction is in equilibrium, free antigen and free antigen-antiserum complexes are removed by washing. The antibody bound to the solid phase serotonin is then detected by the anti-rabbit\/peroxidase. The substrate TMB\/Peroxidase reaction is read at 450 nm. The amount of antibody bound to the solid phase serotonin is inversely proportional to the concentration of serotonin in the sample. Although the ELISA assay is useful, we will have the opportunity to apply an even more precise assay namely HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection.","(2) Another method relies on HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection. Samples obtained in the manner described above are precipitated with 1N HClO(1:1), diluted and aliquoted into HPLC vials containing 32.5 \u03bcl of 0.02 M acetic acid. The fractions are injected via a Gilson 223 XL autoinjector onto the column. 20 \u03bcl of the microdialysis sample are injected onto a 100\u00d72 mm C18 Hypersil 3 \u03bcm column and separated with a mobile phase consisting of 4.1 g\/l sodium acetate, 500 mg\/l Na-EDTA, 50 mg\/l heptane sulfonic acid, 4.5% methanol v\/v, and 30 \u03bcl\/l of triethylamine, pH 4.75 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min using a Shimadzu LC-10 AD pump. Serotonin is detected amperometrically at a glassy carbon electrode at 500 mV vs Ag\/AgCl. The detection limit, 0.5 fmol serotonin per 20 \u03bcl sample or 10 pM, is well within the circulating concentrations of serotonin. Since serotonin measured in PPP is not bound to any appreciable degree by plasma proteins, these measurements can be regarded as equivalent to free serotonin levels.","Generation of Lrp5\u2212\/\u2212 (Kato et al., 2002, J.

Total RNA were extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA were generated using the ABI Reverse transcriptase system and random hexanucleotide primers. Real-time PCR was performed using superarray primers on a Stratagene real time PCR cycler and Actin expression was used as endogenous control. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) were performed by standard procedures using primary osteoblasts. Microarray analysis was performed as described previously (Glass et al., 2005, Dev. Cell 8:751-764).","Osteoblasts were treated in serum-free medium with vehicle or Serotonin (50 to 100 \u03bcM, Sigma) for 24 hr. Lysates from primary osteoblasts or crushed frozen bones were prepared in RIPA buffer in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Twenty to 60 \u03bcg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies including total or anti-Phospho CREB (Cell Signaling Technology).","Serotonin serum levels were quantified using immunoassay kits from Fitzgerald (Serotonin) and serotonin levels in the different regions of the brain were quantified by HPLC method as described previously (Mann et al., 1992, Arch.
