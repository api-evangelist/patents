{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/715,587, filed Mar. 8, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,539,644 the content of which is incorporated by reference.","The invention relates to on-line fraud analysis and fraud prevention.","Credit card transactions are utilized in a variety of environments. In a conventional shopping environment, a user provides a merchant with a credit card during check-out, and the merchant through various means (such as through a driver's license or other picture identification cards) verifies that the card actually belongs to the user.","In another environment, due to the widespread adoption of electronic commerce (eCommerce), more merchants, institutions, and\/or government agencies are putting products\/services on their websites for customers to purchase online. In addition to physical products, the Internet is used to sell non-physical products such as software and content or related information and\/or service over the Internet. Products such as Internet calling, online gaming, digital contents such as music and movie, online advertising, online information provisioning, for example, are sold as a privilege to obtain information or to consume service, or to consume a virtual experience such as gaming. In these types of transactions, the \u201cshipping\u201d of the product simply transmits information and\/or usage credit to an email address, a user account with the merchant, or any suitable mechanism to make the product\/service available to the purchaser.","Typically, a customer selects a number of products\/services from an online catalog into a shopping cart. During check-out, the customer provides payment information such as credit card, debit card, PayPal account, for example, and shipping information to the merchant. The shipping information can be provided directly in the form of a physical address or indirectly in the form of an email address, or a user identification (UserID) from which the merchant can obtain the address.","Due to the anonymity of online customers and increased activities of online identity theft, online purchases represent a big risk for merchants. Unlike conventional purchases where customers are physically present for their purchases, online purchases can be made by people who don't own the credit card\/debit card they use.","To counter fraudulent transactions, the credit card industry devised two verification procedures: Extra Security Check (ESC) and Address Verification Service (AVS). ESC is a mechanism that prints an extra verification code on using credit cards online. In evaluating online purchases, those who enter the correct verification code are considered to be safe, and their transactions are approved. PayPal has a similar mechanism \u201cverified PayPal account\u201d that PayPal gives high priority of transaction approval in evaluating online purchases. The drawback of ESC is the overhead associate with implementing such extra verification code. Additionally, organized hackers who can hack the credit card database would actually have access to the root information needed to execute extra verification process, thus rendering ESC meaningless.","AVS is designed to detect fraud by comparing the various addresses such as card owner's address, shipping address, mailing address, billing address a customer entered online with addresses stored in the database of credit card issuers. If they match the transaction is more likely to be authentic. AVS is another type of \u201cextra security check\u201d that can inevitably be hacked in the root; and can be too \u201cshallow\u201d to overcome hackers who can hack the entire database. In addition, AVS is often not available for international cards. AVS is not useful for checking the purchase of non-physical goods because the goods are not shipped to the buyer's physical address.","The ESC and AVS systems work well in a credit card transaction in which either the customer has a face-to-face meeting with the merchant or the merchant is actually shipping a package or the like to the address of a customer. The verification procedure typically includes receiving at the AVS system address information and identity information. However, for online service providers or merchants, address and identity information are generally insufficient to verify that the purchaser is actually the owner of the credit card. Many fraudulent transactions pass the strictest security measures such as \u201cverified account\u201d or \u201cverified cards,\u201d but, in many occasions, the information on the credit\/debit cards\/any credit accounts has been \u201ccompletely\u201d stolen so the thieves can easily pass any security check imposed on the cards.","For the foregoing reasons, many online purchases are fraudulent, and these fraudulent transactions can only be detected months later when the merchant receives charge back requests well after the thieves have consumed the service at the expense of the merchant. Worst of all, the actual owners of the cards cast suspicion on the merchant as the potential thief who stole their credit information for creating fraudulent transactions that benefit the merchant.","Since arrangements between credit card issuers and merchants typically place liability directly on merchants when online fraudulent transactions take place, these merchants suffer loss of customer (or at least customer goodwill), incur charge-back fees from the credit card issuers, and may even loose their online payment privilege.","In one aspect, systems and methods are disclosed to detect fraud in electronic payments by displaying a high value item next to commonly purchased items; and analyzing purchasing behavior on the high value item for an indication of fraud.","In another aspect, systems and methods are disclosed to detect fraud by displaying on a buyer's computer a high value item next to one or more commonly purchased items to attract a fraudster; analyzing customer purchasing behavior on the high value item for an indication of fraud; and indicating fraud if the buyer buys the high value item without prior history.","Implementations of the above aspect may include one or more of the following. The system can collect payment information and check the payment information against an address verification system (AVS) to detect fraud. The fraud ranking engine can check one of: bank identification number, geographic location, domain lookup, proxy list, virtual private networking list, local computer settings, payment information for an address verification system (AVS), customer behavioral information, password sharing between two accounts, unique identification for a hardware component of a client computer used to purchase items on line, administrative information associated with a customer account; and Internet Protocol (IP) address.","Fraud can be based on customer behavioral information. For example, the system can analyze page browsing behavior including each page viewed and time spent on each page; or by observing customer reaction or response to a credit card authorization failure. If the customer provides different cards with different names, the probability is high that the transaction is fraudulent. Fraud can also be determined by analyzing customer reaction to one of: a promotion, a give-away, a test credit, a gift. The system can determine fraud by checking if two separate accounts share the same password, particularly if the password is a strong password. The system can collect unique identification for a component of a client computer used to purchase items on line. The unique identification can be collected using client software. The system can determine fraud based on administrative information associated with a customer account. The system can capture a unique hardware identification (ID) from a client computer and using the unique Hardware ID to detect fraud. Fraud can also be detected by checking IP address nationality. The system's fraud analysis can include collecting payment information and checking the payment information against an address verification system (AVS) to detect fraud; determining fraud based on customer behavioral information; determining fraud by checking if two separate accounts share the same password; collecting unique identification for a component of a client computer used to purchase items on line; determining fraud based on administrative information associated with a customer account; and capturing a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address from a client computer and using the unique IP address to detect fraud.","Systems and methods are disclosed to detect fraud by analyzing customer purchasing behavior for a high value item intentionally placed next to commonly purchased items, payment information for an address verification system (AVS), customer behavioral information, password sharing between two accounts, unique identification for a hardware component of a client computer used to purchase items on line, administrative information associated with a customer account; and Internet Protocol (IP) address.","In another aspect, a system to detect fraud includes a transactional database to capture customer purchasing behavior for a high value item intentionally placed next to commonly purchased items, payment information for an address verification system (AVS), customer behavioral information, password sharing between two accounts, unique identification for a hardware component of a client computer used to purchase items on line, administrative information associated with a customer account; and Internet Protocol (IP) address; a fraud ranking engine coupled to the transactional database to generate a fraud likelihood assessment; and a rule engine coupled to the fraud ranking engine and the transactional database to approve an on-line transaction. Implementations of the above aspect may include one or more of the following. An administrative panel can be used with the fraud ranking engine to control customer accounts. A channelized transaction pool can operate with the rule engine. An action control engine can be connected with the channelized transaction pool and\/or an online shopping cart. A payment gateway can communicate with the online shopping cart.","Advantages of the system may include one or more of the following. The system provides an effective, intelligent, and flexible transaction processor with fraud analysis and management function for online merchants. The system is effective in that that the system will reliably do its due job, e.g. prevent and control fraudulent transactions to a tolerable level. The system reduces threats arising from identify thieves and hackers who can hack into the root information of credit card\/debit card\/bank account owners. The system can effectively identify most frauds and prevent them over time. The system has intelligence in that the system can record new tactics generated by fraudsters on daily basis and can adjust to deal with new tactics, as well as to prevent known fraud tactics. The system provides flexibility in that the system can be adjusted quickly, if necessary in minutes, to combat against new fraud tactics. The system can also be customizable to fit the specific needs of various kinds of merchants. The fraud analysis and management system can be situated stand-alone on the merchant's website, without the need to rely on a remote, third party system that is generalized for all merchants at the expense of not being optimal for a particular merchant's need. The fraud analysis and management system helps merchants identify frauds and provide additional protection to the authentication system of the credit card issuers or payment processors and minimizes losses should the credit card issuers or payment processors fail to detect and prevent fraud.","The present invention is described herein with respect to one preferred embodiment for purpose of reference and explanation. It is understood that the present invention may be embodied in other forms and configurations than the exact specifications and configurations described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["130","100","130","120","100","130","160"]},"To reduce frauds on the merchant at the check-out page, a Fraud Analysis and Management System (FAMS)  is placed between the merchant's Online Shopping Cart System (OSCS) at the website  and the Payment Processor's Online Payment Gateway or API (OPG) . The FAMS  interfaces and interacts with the OSCS of the site  and the OPG  to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions from passing through to the OPG , and sometimes reverses (refunds) passed-through transactions after acquiring more information from OPG  in case fraud is detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"201"},"While some information such as the visitor's IP Address is readily available, other crucial information needs to be collected by intentionally devised mechanisms. All information collected is entered into a central database Transaction Database  as historical records that can be searched and compared with each new incoming transaction for fraud analysis.","The transactional database  collects product information data structure or block . The product information can be used for selling the product\/service as well as for fraud detection. In one embodiment, special product items, especially high value, expensive items that merchants don't intend to sell on a regular basis, are placed together with regular items that merchants want to sell. The items purchased by the customer, when combined with other information, can provide a fairly accurate indication of the authenticity of the transaction. For example, an Internet telephony service provider to consumers may intend to sell calling credits at $10 and $20 value, but may place the following items for customers to choose:\n\n","A customer who purchases a $10 or $20 calling credit is within the norm. A $50 calling credit selection is somewhat suspicious, and a $200 selection is highly suspicious, particularly when combined with other information such as if the customer only visits the website for ten seconds and goes straight for a $200 calling credit. However, if other information shows that the $200 pick is the 10purchase within a month after purchasing value of $10, $10, $20, $20, $50, $50, $100, $200, for example, then the likelihood increases that the purchase is real after consecutive consumption of service. Hence, the system places a few special items, typically high value items, together with regular items to provide useful and effective indicator for fraud analysis.","The system includes a User Information data structure or block  captures customer information typically through forms for customer to fill at the time submitting their purchases. In one embodiment, the information includes:\n\n","The information is commonly required to complete an online purchase and is still helpful, although not extraordinarily so, in assessing fraud.","The system includes a Payment Information data structure or block  that collects payment information which is mandatory to submit an online purchase. One embodiment includes:\n\n","The information is sent into the Online Payment Gateway for AVS authentication and authorization, and can be compared with Customer Information block  to provide incremental fraud detection.","The system also includes a Behavioral Information data structure or block  which collects behavioral information of online visitors and customers. In one embodiment, behavioral information includes:\n\n","The system also includes an Account Information data structure or block , which is an optional mechanism to create and capture customer account information. Many Internet merchants do not require customers to set up accounts on the websites, customers pick product items in open environments (not inside their accounts) and pay with credit\/debit\/bank cards, the relation is tied only on the transactions made. Although not mandatory, the present invention preferably prompts customers to set up accounts and make purchases after customers have logged into their accounts. The reason for the preference is that the username and password can be quite effective for identification of users. For example, if there are two users in the system with the following sets of username and password:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0060"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"User 1: username: abc","password: bghyutc87e"]},{"entry":[{},"User 2: usename: xyz","password: bghyutc87e"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In this example, the likelihood that both accounts were created by the same person, despite the vastly different user names, is very high. This observation is particularly true if the merchant has a large customer base. Many fraudsters diligently change their user names but not the password since changing passwords increases their workload to maintain matching pairs of user names and passwords. To effectively identify such relationship, a password strength detection system is used in one embodiment that prevents customers from inputting weak passwords (such as 123456) that are not effective in identifying relationship between passwords and users.","The system also provides a Hardware Information data structure or block  to collect information on the computer hardware that customers use to make the purchase. In one embodiment, client software is downloaded into the customers' computer for instant messaging and internet telephony. The client software, after being downloaded into customers' computers, has the ability to capture the computer hardware identification information (IDs) such as motherboard ID, microprocessor ID, network card ID, and Hard Disk Drive ID, among others. The client software can send the hardware information to the merchant's Hardware Information block . When a new account is created by a customer on a computer, the hardware information of the computer is sent together with the username, password etc, for example, as follows:\n\n","The HWID is the hardware identification fetched and stored in the database table for additional processing. Hence, if there are many sets of usernames and passwords sharing one HWID, the system knows that they were all created from one computer and would set a fraud indication or alert. Once a transaction is proven to be fraudulent, the username and corresponding hardware information can be used to block all transactions generated from one hardware ID. Unless the fraudster changes his or her computer, he or she is blocked from committing fraud on that merchant.","The system can also collect data for an Administration Information data structure or block . In one embodiment, the Administrative Information includes the date the account was created; the account status (active, on watch, or suspended, among others) and the frequency of payment In one embodiment relating to calling cards, the phone numbers called including the country codes, area codes, and carrier codes. Certain indicators such as the longevity of the account (through the date of creation), and how frequently the account payments being made, can be highly effective indicators of the type of customer. The account status indicator can allow human intervention of the automated analysis.","The system also collects Network Information in block . The Network Information is usually the IP address from which the web visit is made. If IPV6 is deployed, every online device will be assigned a unique IP address and the Network Information data structure or block  can capture and use the unique IP address as another indicator of fraud.","In another embodiment that works with IPV4 protocol, the Network Information data structure or block  can record the visitor's IP address and the actual IP address of the computer. The client computer captures the computer ID by the software download, and the server captures the visitor's IP on its website, and because system has access to both the software running on the client computer and the server, the system can compare the 2 IP addresses. The embodiment can provide additional identification of the type of users. For example, if a user having a US IP address on his computer visits a US website through a non-US IP address, the likelihood of a fraudulent purchase is quite high.","Information collected by the above data structures or blocks - is entered into the Transaction Database  () as data in tables stored in a transactional database  () that can be a relational database so the tables are related to each other. The mechanisms set to acquire product information, behavioral information, account information, hardware information, and network information, together with other information acquiring mechanisms, and the calculation based on the information acquired, enable the merchants to independently analyze fraudulent transactions without the need to resort to any external data and external help.","Turning now to , an exemplary system diagram illustrating the architecture and building block of Fraud Analysis and Management System is shown. The system of  contains several sub systems, each dedicated for one major task and the sub systems collectively work together to analyze the likelihood of each transaction being fraudulent and process it accordingly. Whenever a transaction takes place, a transaction data interface collect all customer related information, and send the information to a transaction database. The information includes product information such as which products the customer choose to purchase; of user information such as the first name, last name, addresses, phone number, fax number, email address, etc; of payment information such as types of credit cards, information on the credit cards, security rating (verified\/unverified, EC15\/EC16\/EC17 from cards processors (Moneris); of behavioral information such as how quickly the customers make purchases after login, how often the purchases are made over a period of time, how they react to some intentionally designed options and mechanisms etc; of account information such as username, password; of hardware information such as the ID of computer hard disk drive, ID of microprocessor, ID of network card, ID of motherboard etc; of administrative information such as the time of account being created, account activities etc; of network information such as the IP address where the visitor is coming from.","The transaction database  stores all the information in forms of keys in the database for then Index Engine  to build indexes based on them. Multiple indexes, as many as needed are created using one or more columns of tables in the database and are optimized for quick searching via a balanced tree. The indexes are copies of parts of tables structured in a specific format to help extract the key features of tracking\/analyzing fraudulent transactions. The data collected is tagged to identify the attributors to transactions which subsequently proved to have been fraudulent, and the tagged data are used by the Index Engine to build necessary indexes to identify existing fraud attributes and learn new tactics of frauds. The indices are built and customized to the business needs of merchants. An important index for one merchant is probably not important or not needed at all for another.","The transaction database  provides transaction information and history to an index engine . A lexicon engine  communicates with the database  and index engine . The transaction indices from the index engine  are provided to a rule engine . The transaction indices are provided to a fraud rank engine , whose output is provided to the rule engine . The output of the rule engine  is provided to a channelized transaction pool , which in turn drives an action control engine . The action control engine  sends actions to the online shopping cart . The shopping cart  also receives transaction requests and transaction results from the payment gateway or API . The shopping cart  can add transactions to a transaction data interface , which in turn communicates with the action control engine . The transaction data interface  can retrieve transactions from an administrative panel  or mark transactions therefrom. The administrative panel  can post account operations to a customer account file . The accounts are helpful in establishing customer profiles of their online purchases, and password information can be highly reliable in determining relations between customers. It also brings advantage of relating payments to accounts instead of merely relating payments to discrete purchasing events.","The Transaction Data Interface  dispatches information it is given by the Action Control Engine , Online Shopping Cart , and Administration Panel . The data interface  also adds each new incoming transaction into Transaction Database . The data interface  stores information collected by various mechanisms about the customer account and the transaction, the information entered into the database  will be further processed through the subsequent steps. Once a transaction goes through all the process and be sent to OPG , OPG  will return additional information about the payer, the information will be received by  Transaction Data Interface and be added into  to go through the same process. The Rule Engine  and the Action Control Engine  may maintain or reverse its previous decision, in latter event a refund will be given to OPG  in order to avoid any charge back fees.","Based on the same transaction database, the FraudRank Calculator  is set forth to calculate the likelihood of a transaction being a fraud, the result of the calculation with brief notes of the key suspicious attributes of a transaction is sent to human administrators to decide how to process a transaction that is already pre-processed by the system automatically.","The Rule Engine  processes the indexes in form of tables, matrix, or database produced by the Index Engine. For example, the indexes table can be organized in the logics of data in a row represent \u201cAND\u201d, and rows represent \u201cOR\u201d; the Rule Engine run through all the rows in a index table, and approve the transactions that comply with the indexes in row , or in row , or in row , or in row  and so on . . . hold transactions that comply with row  for human review, and disapprove transaction that do not comply with any row it scanned through. This is a very high level, exemplary introduction which will be discussed in details. Due to the ease of building indices by the Index Engine , the Rule Engine  can be complex, sensitive, flexible, quickly adjustable and scalable to deal with complex fraud situations.","The Administration Panel  is designed for the display, search, and review of all transactions and processing related information as well as all customer related information, human administrators can be authorized to alter the decisions the system made and\/or made additional decisions, for example, put a payment that the system has approved on hold for a predetermined number of hours or days for further investigation. The Administration Panel  enables the merchant to administrate its business, customer accounts, transactions etc. The panel  administers the Customer Accounts  and can perform actions such as block account, suspend account, unblock account, load money to account, unload money to account. A payment is loaded into customer account by the Admin Panel  as a result of successfully going through the FAMS system. The Administration Panel  also carries administrative function of managing the merchant's accounts at OPG . Often, on a daily basis the OPG  sends charge back requests, disputes, among others to the Administrative Panel , as well as transfer funds to the merchant that it earned through customers' payments. In the event of receiving charge back requests, the Administration Panel  marks the transaction accordingly and send it to Transaction Data Interface , which will in turn send the request to the Transaction Database .","Other functions the Admin Panel  carries include managing the merchant's business activities, receiving and replying emails, checking status of customer accounts, tracking billings etc. In managing frauds, it also receives the FraudRank from The FraudRank Calculator  and it is subject to a human administrator's review to decide\/re-decide what to do on a specific transaction based on its FraudRank.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In block , the system receives a new transaction from Online Shopping Cart  with information about the customer, its account, its computer hardware ID, and its payment itself. In block , Transaction Data Interface  sends the information about the transaction request into Transaction Database . This step is called \u201cadd a transaction\u201d. In block , based on the information added to Transaction Database , Index Engine  builds indexes on the transaction accordingly to reflect the important factors for fraud analysis. This step is called \u201cbuild indexes\u201d. In block , the Rule Engine  applies its rule matrix\/table on the indexes built in the previous step. This step is called \u201capply rules\u201d. In block , according to the result of step , the transaction is sorted and placed in an appropriate channel of Channelized Transaction Pool . This step is called \u201cchannelize transactions\u201d. In block , the Action Control Engine  make decisions on transactions sorted out in different channels. The decisions can be \u201capproved\u201d, \u201cconditional approved\u2014on hold\u201d, \u201cdenied\u201d, \u201ctrapped\u201d, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["350","360"]},"In block , if the decision is yes, the transaction request is forwarded to OPG  where it will be authenticated and processed. In block , if the transaction is accepted by OPG , the payment will be loaded into the Merchant Account that the merchant has with OPG . In block , the Administration Panel  loads the paid amount to the Customer Account  accordingly. The customer will be able to see the money in the account and wait for the next steps, such as shipping, etc, or in some circumstances, consume the service.","The process of  provides merchants with fraud detection, analysis, and management for online purchases. The process also provides transaction processing system that processes incoming payments accordingly. The online purchases are the payments people made over public networks such as the Internet with credit cards, debit cards, PayPal accounts, bank transfer, or any type of remote payment methods without the card\/account holders being physically present.","The system provides merchants with setting up online product items on the website, collecting information about customer's computer hardware ID, online shopping account ID and password, and setting up traps and loop traps to certain suspicious transactions.","In addition, the system provides a systematic method of detecting fraudulent online transactions on and within merchants' websites, even including extreme circumstances including, but not limited to, the circumstances that the information of account holders is stolen by unauthorized people, and products for sale are digital contents that are not shipped to physical addresses, and that there is no other centralized resource for the online merchants to resort to, and the combination of circumstances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["301","301","310","301","310","310","310","310","310","310","310"]},"The data in the Index Engine  is explained and synchronized by a Lexicon .  shows typical rows in a table of the Index Engine . From the table, the Lexicon  is created and maintained to help understand the meaning of data in each column. The Rule Engine  contains rule sets in forms of data in tables, or table matrix. Rule Engine can be understood as a big matrix of \u201cif; then\u201d logics as illustrated in .

The channels can be tagged with xxx yyy zzz as shown in the example of .","The Action Control Engine  calls actions to transactions in the Channelized Transaction Pool . The actions in this embodiment are a just a few decisions that have to be made on each transaction, e.g. what to do with each incoming transaction. They are \u201capproved\u201d, \u201ctrapped\u201d, \u201cdenied\u201d, \u201con hold\u201d, \u201capproved but on watch\u201d and \u201crefund\u201d. If needed, many actions can be put in place to reflect specific business situation of each merchant. The action \u201capproved\u201d means the transaction is trusted and will be sent to the Online Payment Gateway\/API  to load the payment into the merchant's account with OPG .","For each transaction that is \u201capproved\u201d and sent to OPG, the system  receives additional information about the payer from OPG, the information will be processed through the same routes explained above, and if it failed to be tagged as safe transaction in the Pool , the Action Control Engine  will be triggered the action \u201crefund\u201d, in this event the system will refund the payment already approved and loaded into merchant's account at OPG. By action \u201crefund\u201d merchant can avoid charge back and\/or other disputes and the penalties resulted.","The action \u201ctrapped\u201d means the transaction is trapped by the system  and will not be sent to OPG . A new web page will be displayed to the payer that the payment attempt failed. Once a transaction is trapped, all the subsequent attempts made from the same computer will be all trapped until a human administrator review them and remove the trap to that computer. Certain rules are set to trigger the action \u201ctrap\u201d to reflect the high likelihood that the purchase is fraudulent. For example, if a customer uses a US credit card to purchase the most expensive product item listed, from a non-US IP address within 15 seconds of his first visit to the website, the purchase is most likely to be trapped.","The customer's subsequent actions after the failure of the first payment attempt usually provide additional and valuable information about his type, his relationship with other accounts, credit cards, computer hardware ID. Hence, such information is collected into the system for further \u201ctrapping\u201d, and this is called \u201cloop trap\u201d. For example, within 10 minutes of the failure of the first payment attempt, the customer submits a number of different credit cards from a number of different IP addresses, the system would infer that the customer trying to defraud the merchant. The credit cards are most probably not his, and the IP addresses changes are most probably his attempts to use different proxy servers available on the public Internet. In many occasions a \u201ctrapped\u201d user uses many different user accounts to try more payments, this gives the merchant an excellent chance to review the relationship between the used accounts, and block accounts that were previously believed legitimate.","An action \u201cdenied\u201d means that a transaction is denied, a \u201cdenied\u201d transaction will not be sent to the OPG  for processing\u2014it is denied within the merchant's website. Usually the action is based on the known frauds, such as known fraudulent accounts; known computer hardware ID that fraudulent payments have been made from.","In one implementation, the system tracks the relationship between a user account and a computer hardware ID as follows:\n\n","Since customers can only register accounts using the client software, the relationship between a particular computer hardware and a customer account is known. For example, the following table indicates that account  and account  are registered from the same computer.\n\n","Since it's more difficult to change the computer and\/or major computer components than to change other parameters like IP address, username, credit card used to purchase, among others, once a computer hardware ID has been captured, the fraudster will have to replace his computer if he wants to cheat the same merchant. This makes the continuation of his frauds almost prohibitive because of the money and time in acquiring another computer and\/or computer component.","A table of blacklisted hardware ID is established based on the known fraudulent accounts (through charge back requests or through \u201ctrapped\u201d transactions, or through human review), each new transaction that occurs, the hardware ID of it transaction maker will be collected and compared with this table, and if the ID is in the table, the transaction will be denied; if the ID is clean, other rules will kick in to decide how to process this transaction.","Account password is another strongly weighted parameter. The present invention sets password strength detection on the client software to ensure the password entered by the customer is sufficiently strong and if not prompts the customer to create another password. In a system that uses strong passwords where. the string is long and unique, and the likelihood of two random customers using the same password is low. Using this logic, the transaction will be denied if the customer has a password that is the same as the one used by a blacklisted customer.","\u201cOn Hold\u201d is the action that a transaction is sent to the OPG  for processing and is loaded into the customer's account, but the customer is required to provide further information or talk to the merchant's administrator before the product can be delivered. Examples include some payments made by a US credit card but from an international IP address, in such circumstances further contacts for explanations will be required.","\u201cApproved but on watch\u201d is the action to approve a transaction and send it to OPG  for processing, the money is loaded into customer's account without any conditions. However, the customer account will be tagged as \u201con watch\u201d by a human administrator, usually this action reflects the merchant's belief that the transaction is safe but there are still something remained to watch, such as, in some rare situations, two customers may use the same password, and human review didn't find anything abnormal, so upon customer's request the system approves the transaction but additionally puts a tag on the account to further watch his behavior. Upon the merchant's request, more actions or logics can be added into the Action Control Engine .  shows an example of a table in Action Control Engine .","One job for the data interface  is to add\/retrieve transactions to\/from the Administration Panel . Each transaction, regardless of the action taken on it, is entered using the Admin Panel , and in some cases the human administrator may alter the decision made by the System, in which case the request to alter will be sent to  for dispatching the request through Merchant Website  to OPG .  shows an example of new transactions that the Transaction Data Interface  added into Transaction Database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"360"},"In the example of , Row  is a trapped transaction marked in dark red, and the notes indicate the reason is: the hardware ID has made fraudulent payments before, while Row  is a approved transaction marked in white color, and the last column indicates that the transaction is approved and the money is loaded into the customer's account.","In one implementation to detect fraud, the system verifies bank identification number (BIN) on the credit card. The BIN is the first 6 digits of a credit card that represent the issuing bank of the card. The system parses the BIN and gets a country code of the issuing bank, and compares it with the country that the purchaser self-claimed. Both countries can be indexed into the index engine, and a rule can be set that if the information does not match, the system will reject the payment.","In one implementation to detect fraud, the system verifies IP Geographic Location. The computer's IP address contains its geographic location from country, state\/provide, down to city, when an IP address is detected by the system, the system look up the geographic location, and compares the geographic location with the address claimed by the customer, and both parameters can be processed by the index engine. Rules can be set accordingly, for example, if the information does not match, the system will reject the payment.","In another implementation to detect fraud, the system verifies the phone number to the location lookup\u2014when a customer provides his\/her phone number, the system will look up the geo location of the phone number, its area and city etc., this geo location information goes to the index engine, so the engine can apply a rule to handle the consistency or discrepancy between this geo location and other geo locations looked up.","In yet another implementation to detect fraud, the system performs domain lookup: when a customer provides his\/her email address, the system can look up the domain of the email server, and send the result information to the index engine, so the engine can apply rules to this data with others. For example, the result can be that the domain is non-existing, or the domain is a private registration, which indicates higher risk of fraud. The index engine can apply a rule to reject a payment by a customer with such a domain entry. Another example of the use of domain lookup information, if the domain belongs to a large ISP in Canada, but the customer's entry of country is Chile, this can indicate a high risk of fraud and the system can reject the payment.","In one implementation to detect fraud, the system verifies the Proxy list and VPN list through a lookup: when a user's IP address is detected by the system, the system will look up a database of available proxy IP list, and a database of virtual private network service. The result of the lookup will be provided to the index engine for it to apply rules to handle the information combined with other information in the index engine. For example, if the user's IP matches one of the proxy IP or VPN IP, the rule engine can reject the transaction.","In another implementation to detect fraud, the system verifies the computer local setting information. The client software downloaded into the user's computer further reports local setting information to the system, such as the local language setting, time zone setting, location setting, among others. The information is provided to the index engine for rules to be applied. For example, a user may use a US IP address to make a payment, but his local computer setting is Vietnam, GMT+8 local time, a rule can be made to reject such payments since the user is most probably a Vietnam local computer user trying to make a payment via a US proxy IP address.","The invention may be implemented in hardware, firmware or software, or a combination of the three. Preferably the invention is implemented in a computer program executed on a programmable computer having a processor, a data storage system, volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements, at least one input device and at least one output device.","By way of example, a block diagram of a computer to support the merchant web site  is discussed next. The computer preferably includes a processor, random access memory (RAM), a program memory (preferably a writable read-only memory (ROM) such as a flash ROM) and an input\/output (I\/O) controller coupled by a CPU bus. The computer may optionally include a hard drive controller which is coupled to a hard disk and CPU bus. Hard disk may be used for storing application programs, such as the present invention, and data. Alternatively, application programs may be stored in RAM or ROM. I\/O controller is coupled by means of an I\/O bus to an I\/O interface. I\/O interface receives and transmits data in analog or digital form over communication links such as a serial link, local area network, wireless link, and parallel link. Optionally, a display, a keyboard and a pointing device (mouse) may also be connected to I\/O bus. Alternatively, separate connections (separate buses) may be used for I\/O interface, display, keyboard and pointing device. Programmable processing system may be preprogrammed or it may be programmed (and reprogrammed) by downloading a program from another source (e.g., a floppy disk, CD-ROM, or another computer).","Each computer program is tangibly stored in a machine-readable storage media or device (e.g., program memory or magnetic disk) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer, for configuring and controlling operation of a computer when the storage media or device is read by the computer to perform the procedures described herein. The inventive system may also be considered to be embodied in a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.","The invention has been described herein in considerable detail in order to comply with the patent Statutes and to provide those skilled in the art with the information needed to apply the novel principles and to construct and use such specialized components as are required. However, it is to be understood that the invention can be carried out by specifically different equipment and devices, and that various modifications, both as to the equipment details and operating procedures, can be accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention itself."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
