A principal concern prior to the acceptance of nuclear energy is the safe management of radioactive waste during reprocessing and storage.","This concern is addressed is by utilizing nuclear reprocessing techniques, such as pyroprocessing, to extract nuclear components from the spent fuel discharged from reactors. Pyroprocessing involves dissolving spent fuel at high temperatures in a molten salt to create a molten salt electrolyte. Then the spent fuel is electrorefined in the molten salt, which essentially electroplates most or all of the actinides elements for extraction. Typically, a solid metal cathode is used to extract uranium and a liquid cadmium cathode is used to extract all actinides, including plutonium. Plutonium and uranium are focused upon because the other transuranic elements exist at much lower concentrations in the molten salt electrolyte.","In pyroprocessing, the electrorefining process must be carefully monitored to ensure that the electrochemical operation is proceeding efficiently. Specifically, monitoring the concentration ratio of Pu to U in the molten salt electrolyte is particularly important because electrorefining operators need to know which extraction technique is optimal. For example, the solid metal cathode is operated; uranium is extracted from the molten salt electrolyte and the Pu to U ratio increases. The solid metal cathode becomes increasingly inefficient as the Pu to U ratio increases, at which point it may become preferable to switch from operating the solid metal cathode to operating a liquid cadmium cathode. Similarly, as the liquid cadmium cathode is used, plutonium is extracted from the molten salt electrolyte. The continued use of the liquid cadmium cathode becomes increasingly inefficient as the Pu to U ratio decreases.","As a result, monitoring the Pu and U concentrations in the molten salt electrolyte is important to ensure that the refining process is efficient at collecting actinides. The current method for measuring actinides in molten salt electrolytes involves taking a sample of the highly radioactive molten salt electrolyte, transferring that radioactive sample to a laboratory, and analyzing the sample using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Sadly, the entire process generally requires a few weeks before results are obtained. Therefore, there exists a need for in-situ, real-time monitoring of actinide ion concentrations in molten salt electrolyte for pyroprocessing.","An apparatus for real-time, in-situ monitoring of actinide ion concentrations which comprises a working electrode, a reference electrode, a container, a working electrolyte, a separator, a reference electrolyte, and a voltmeter. The container holds the working electrolyte. The voltmeter is electrically connected to the working electrode and the reference electrode and measures the voltage between those electrodes. The working electrode contacts the working electrolyte. The working electrolyte comprises an actinide ion of interest. The reference electrode contacts the reference electrolyte.","The reference electrolyte is separated from the working electrolyte by the separator. The separator contacts both the working electrolyte and the reference electrolyte. The separator is ionically conductive to the actinide ion of interest. The reference electrolyte comprises the actinide ion of interest with fixed concentration. The separator comprises a beta double prime alumina exchanged with the actinide ion of interest.","An apparatus for real-time, in-situ monitoring of actinide ion concentrations which comprises a working electrode, a reference electrode, a container, a working electrolyte, a separator, a reference electrolyte, and a voltmeter.
