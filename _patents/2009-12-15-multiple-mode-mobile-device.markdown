{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates generally to the field of separating applications of a mobile device and, more specifically, this disclosure pertains to the field of executing separating applications of a mobile device such that an execution of one application is isolated from another application.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the past, users of mobile devices (e.g., mobile telephones, laptops, etc.) typically had separate devices for their personal computing activities and their business computing activities. By a user using separate devices, a business could protect its business devices, for example, against malicious applications. However, users today are more frequently using a single device for both their personal and business computing activities. This leads to conflicts that can affect the security of the business' operation or data stored on the single device. For example, a user may download an interesting consumer or personal application that may crash the single device, or worse, download malicious software (e.g., a Trojan horse, a virus, a worm, etc.) that compromises the business' data, since personal and business computing activities are not isolated.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the disclosure to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the disclosure is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of an invention as defined by appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1010","1015","1020","1025","1025","1010","1020","1015"]},"As shown, a third level can include virtual machines -.

In one or more embodiments, the memory medium can be and\/or include an article of manufacture and\/or a software product. In addition, the memory medium can be located in a first computer in which the programs are executed, or can be located in a second different computer and\/or hardware memory device that connects to the first computer over a network. In one or more embodiments, the second computer provides the program instructions to the first computer for execution. The memory medium can also be a distributed memory medium, e.g., for security reasons, where a portion of the data is stored on one memory medium and the remaining portion of the data can be stored on a different memory medium. Also, the memory medium can include one of the networks to which the current network is coupled, e.g., a SAN (Storage Area Network).","In one or more embodiments, each of the systems described herein may take various forms, including a personal computer system, server computer system, workstation, network appliance, Internet appliance, wearable computing device, personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop, mobile telephone, mobile multimedia device, embedded computer system, television system, and\/or other device. In general, the terms \u201ccomputing device\u201d, \u201ccomputer\u201d, and\/or \u201ccomputer system\u201d can be broadly defined to encompass any device having a processor which executes instructions from a memory medium.","The memory medium in one or more systems thus can store a software program and\/or data for performing and\/or enabling automatic sound level control. A CPU or processing unit in one or more systems executing code and data from a memory medium includes a means for executing one or more software program according to the methods and\/or flowcharts described herein.","It is noted that, in one or more embodiments, one or more of the method elements described herein and\/or one or more portions of an implementation of a method element may be performed in varying orders, can be performed concurrently with one or more of the other method elements and\/or one or more portions of an implementation of a method element, or can be omitted. Additional method elements can be performed as desired. In one or more embodiments, concurrently can mean simultaneously. In one or more embodiments, concurrently can mean apparently simultaneously according to some metric. For example, two or more method elements and\/or two or more portions of an implementation of a method element can be performed such that they appear to be simultaneous to a human. It is also noted that, in one or more embodiments, one or more of the system elements described herein may be omitted and additional system elements can be added as desired.","Further modifications and alternative embodiments of various aspects of the invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the general manner of carrying out the invention. It is to be understood that the forms of the invention shown and described herein are to be taken as embodiments. Elements and materials may be substituted for those illustrated and described herein, parts and processes may be reversed, and certain features of the invention may be utilized independently, all as would be apparent to one skilled in the art after having the benefit of this description of the invention. Changes may be made in the elements described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The preferred embodiments will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
