title: Displaying content associated with electronic mapping systems
abstract: Various methods, systems and apparatus for displaying alternate content in a digital mapping system, are disclosed. One such method may include detecting a change in a zoom level of an electronic map displaying geographic content (e.g. tile-based digital map, satellite image, etc.) on a computing device (e,g. desktop/laptop, smart phone, etc, running Windows®, Linux®, Mac OS®, iOS®. Android®, etc.); determining a predetermined (eg. maximum) zoom level has been reached; retrieving alternate content, and displaying the alternate content in addition to, or in place of, some-or-all of the geographic content. The method may further include detecting a zoom-out command while the alternate content is being displayed, and in response, restoring the display of the geographic content (e.g. at the maximum zoom level and/or last state of the geographic content display prior to displaying the alternate content.) Alternate content may be associated with any portion of geographic content displayed (e.g. the portion of the geographic content visible at the maximum zoom level) and may be selected via various algorithms and be manipulate-able via map display application controls.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED U.S. APPLICATION DATA","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Continuation-in-Part of application Ser. No. 12\/012,353, filed on Feb. 1, 2008.","The present invention generally relates to mapping on electronic devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to associating content pertaining to a point-of-interest, or to a visible portion of an electronic map, and displaying the content in response to a change in the electronic map's zoom level.","Popular mapping services include Google Maps\u00ae, Yahoo! Maps\u00ae, Windows Live Search Maps\u00ae, MapQuest\u00ae and others. Mapping services are typically available to a user through a web browser, running on a computer or a portable electronic device, such a cellular phone, personal digital assistant, etc. Mapping services allow a user to view a map in various formats (e.g. 2D, 3D, aerial, road, etc.). Functionality provided includes \u201czoom in\u201d and \u201czoom out\u201d, which allows the user to see a smaller region at a greater level of detail, and larger region in less detail, respectively. Zooming in and out is often accomplished with the help of a control (e.g. a graphic control) which the user can manipulate with an input device such as a mouse, keyboard, stylus, by touch, etc. Zooming-in may be limited by settings defining minimum\/maximum zoom levels, and\/or by the physical limitation of zoom data available. For example, urban areas are often available for zoom up to the maximum \u201cstreet level\u201d (i.e. one or more streets with individual buildings are clearly visible) whereas remote areas may be available for zooming at a lower maximum level. An attempt to zoom-in past the maximum zoom level may either generate no new geographic data and\/or display text alerting the user that no map data is available at the current zoom level.","The present invention provides various methods, systems and apparatus for displaying content associated with a point-of-interest (\u201cPOI\u201d) in a digital mapping system. In response to a \u201czoom in\u201d command received by a map-display application, displaying a selected area of the map at a magnification beyond a predetermined zoom level, content associated with a POI on the map (\u201cPOI content\u201d) may be retrieved and displayed. In one embodiment, POI content may be retrieved from a data store containing various POI content for multiple POIs. In another embodiment, POI content may be derived from a website associated with the POI, through an automated process. POI content may be in the form of media (a photograph, audio, video, etc.). POI content may be associated with a region of a displayed-area of a map, the region collectively being considered a POI.","In one embodiment, POI content may be displayed overlaying a portion of the map allowing some parts of the map to remain visible. In another embodiment the POI content may replace the map or overlay its entirety. In response to various commands (e.g. zoom out, pan, etc.) the POI content may be hidden from view, restoring the map to its visual state prior to the POI content having been displayed. POI content may include images, media, web content, KML (for Keyhole Markup Language) files, documents, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","100"]},"Map  may be generated and displayed by computer code (e.g. using technologies such as AJAX, javascript, http requests, DHTML, XML, VML, Flash\u00ae, etc.) in a map-display application (e.g. a browser application.) Map  may be composed of graphical images, known as \u201cmap tiles\u201d, that may be received by the client device  from the mapping service, and assembled and displayed as a map . Images (e.g. a location marker , pictures, icons, Flash\u00ae media files, etc.) may be generated by the mapping service as graphics (e.g. \u201cPNG\u201d or \u201cGIF\u201d files) and transmitted to the electronic device  to be displayed on map .","Map  may display points of interest. A point-of-interest (\u201cPOI\u201d) may be designated by a location marker . A POI may be generated in multiple ways. A POI may be selected by the user (e.g. by touching the screen, using a pointing device, etc.) A POI may correspond to a physical address or landmark. In yet another possible embodiment, a POI may comprise an area of a map. For example, in a case where a map at the highest zoom level displaying one or more houses, the houses\u2014or a visible segment of a street where the houses are\u2014may be collectively considered a POI. A POI may be designated by the mapping service providing map . For example, the mapping service may generate\/designate a POI in response to a user query (e.g. the user may enter a search query such as \u201cshopping mall\u201d and the mapping service may mark one or more shopping malls on map  as POIs.)","In the presently-preferred embodiment, a POI may also be designated implicitly\u2014for example, when a map  is displayed in the highest zoom level, a landmark most prominent (e.g. occupying largest area of the map) may automatically be designated a POI. In an alternate embodiment, a landmark closest to the center of the map  may be automatically designated a POI. In yet another embodiment, a landmark closest to the center of the map \u2014with which the mapping service has associated information, may automatically be designated a POI.","Map  may be manipulated by the user of electronic device . For example, the user may use a control and\/or pointing device (e.g. stylus, fingers touching the screen, mechanical\/electronic controls, etc.) to pan across or zoom into a map .","A map is commonly capable of being displayed in various zoom levels. In response to a user's selecting a zoom level, the map-display application may determine the new region to be displayed, request the corresponding map tiles from the mapping service, and display the received map tiles over the previous map tiles, which were displayed at the previous zoom level.","Zooming is generally supported within limits. A zoom-level may be designated by a number\u2014for example, in the range of \u201c0\u201c\u2212\u201d20\u201d, where \u201c20\u201d may represent the highest-supported zoom level and \u201c0\u201d may be the lowest supported zoom level. For example, zoom level \u201c0\u201d may show a view of Planet Earth, while zoom-level \u201c10\u201d may show a map view of the area equivalent to an average State; zoom-level \u201c15\u201d may show a map of a city and the highest zoom level, \u201c20\u201d, may show one or more streets and\/or a large building.","At present, integers denoting a zoom level may be arbitrary and change over time. Zoom levels may be correlated to a physical scale. For example, a zoom level of 0 may correspond to a map scale of 1 inch=20,000 miles. A zoom level of 10 might be 1 inch=200 miles, 15 can correspond to 1 inch=20 miles, 20 might be 1 inch=200 yards, etc.","In the most common implementations of mapping technology, at present, a user attempting to zoom-in past the highest zoom-level (i.e. the map is displayed at the highest zoom-level, example \u201c20\u201d, and the user attempts to further zoom in), may be displayed one of two things: in some cases, the display may remain unchanged (with an occasional accompaniment of an audible signal, e.g. a \u201cbeep\u201d sound) to indicate to the user no further zooming is available. In another common implementation, new map tiles are displayed indicating to the user no map image is available in the current zoom level. (e.g. the map is replaced with blank tiles, i.e. non-descript map tiles bearing text such as \u201cNo information is available at this zoom level. Please try zooming out.\u201d)","In the presently-preferred embodiment, content  (\u201cPOI content\u201d) associated with a POI on the map  (e.g. a POI demarked by location marker ), may be displayed in electronic device  in response to a request to zoom-in while the current zoom-level is at maximum (i.e. no map data may exist at the requested zoom level, past the current 100% zoom level.)","In an alternate embodiment, POI content  may be displayed in response to a request to zoom to the highest zoom level (i.e. in this alternate embodiment, POI content may be displayed at a zoom level where map data may still be available.)","In yet another alternate embodiment, POI content  may be displayed in response to a request to zoom to a pre-determined zoom level. Pre-determined zoom levels may be set by a user, may be default settings, may be set dynamically based on POI-content provider preferences, etc.","POI content  may include various information, including, but not limited to, information pertaining to the POI determined, to be of relevance to the user. In this example, The POI in map  is a shopping mall titled \u201cGreat Mall\u201d, Hence POI content  may be a schematic diagram showing the store layout of the shopping mall \u201cGreat Mall\u201d. In alternate embodiments, POI content  may include hyperlinks to additional information pertaining to the POI. In this example, hyperlinks \u201cNordstrom 702.555.1211 website\u201d  and \u201cMacy's 702.555.1210 website\u201d  may display to the user, phone numbers of stores in the shopping mall, and provide hyperlinks to the websites of stores. In alternate embodiments, as we shall discuss in later figures, other types of POI content may be displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIGS. 2A-2D"],"b":["2","2","2","200"]},"Electronic device  may include a map-display application  (e.g. a browser, an application capable of displaying a map generated by a remote mapping service, etc.) In the presently-preferred embodiment, map-display application  may support the display of various map types and images, including graphical images extraneous to maps generated by a mapping service.","Referring to , a map  may be displayed in map-display application . Map  may be displayed at various zoom levels. For example, zoom-level indicator  may indicate a zoom level of \u201c20%\u201d In this example, map  is displayed in a satellite image\/hybrid map format, for illustrative purposes only\u2014the present invention supports any type of map format (e.g. a 2D map, a 3D map, an aerial map, a hybrid map, a road map, etc.)","Referring now to , map-display application  displays a map on device . In this example, zoom-level indicator  may display \u201cZoom Level 70%\u201d. Accordingly, the reader will notice that map  is displayed at a higher zoom level than map  in . (i.e. the word \u201cocean\u201d, an entire airport perimeter and the word \u201cairport\u201d are visible in map , whereas only a portion of the airport, appearing larger, is visible in map .) The user may have used various controls to issue a command to increase the zoom level (e.g. controls such as keyboard, touch screen, mouse, stylus, voice command, etc.)","Referring now to , zoom-level indicator  may read \u201cZoom level 100%\u201d. Accordingly, map , displayed in map-display application  on device , may be displayed at the highest-possible zoom level (i.e. a small portion of the airport image in map  is displayed over the same screen area as map , allowing for a greater level of detail to show.)","In map-display application , illustrated in , a zoom level may change in response to a user's input (e.g. via an input device such as a mouse, stylus, touching a touch-screen, mechanical control, keyboard, etc.), in accordance with the common operation of mapping systems in the prior art domain. Sequential user input, interpreted as a commands to increase the zoom level, may cause the zoom level to increase in a sequence, as illustrated in , B and C ( illustrates map  at zoom level 20%,  illustrates a map  at zoom level 70%,  illustrates a map at zoom level 100%.)","In all presently-existing prior art, a user's input command to increase the zoom level of the map beyond the maximum-supported zoom level (i.e. map-zoom level is 100% prior to user's invoking a command to zoom-in), does not display additional mapping information or content associated with POIs on the map.","Referring now to , in the presently-preferred embodiment, additional content may be displayed in response to the user's invoking a zoom-in command past the highest-supported zoom level. Map-display application , on electronic device , may display content associated with a POI on the map (\u201cPOI content\u201d) .","In the presently-preferred embodiment, POI content  may be content associated with a POI most prominent on the map which is displayed at the highest-zoom level (e.g. map  in ) In alternate embodiments, as will be shown in later figures, various other methods may be used to determine a POI whose associated POI content may be displayed.","In this example, POI content , displayed in map-display application , may be a layout diagram of the airport in maps ,  and  in , B and C, respectively. While maps ,  and  may be satellite images of an airport\u2014with map , labeled \u201cZoom level 100%\u201d \u2014displaying the highest-resolution map (e.g. image of the airport terminal), POI content , at a zoom level labeled \u201cZoom level\u2014Layout\u201d , may display the layout of the airport's terminal(s).","As will be discussed in later figures, POI content , which may be displayed when the user invokes a zoom-in command past the highest-available zoom level, may be an image, a website, Flash\u00ae content, PDF\u00ae content, any form of active content, etc.","In the presently-preferred embodiment, in a case where the area of map-display application  is relatively small (e.g. on the screen of a smart phone or PDA) POI content  may display in the entire display area of map-display application  (i.e. entirely obscuring the map  in .) In alternate embodiments, as shown in other figures, POI content  may display overlaying map  (i.e. displayed \u201con top\u201d of map  obscuring a portion of map .)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"]},"Please note that, both in , map-display applications and represent the same map-display application, in two different states: the map-display application is denoted as when displaying a map, and as when displaying POI content.","Referring to both , a user's electronic device  may communicate with a mapping server  over a network  (e.g. the world-wide web.) A map-display application , running on user's electronic device , may receive mapping data from mapping server  and display the mapping data as a map . The mapping data may generally include mapping tiles\u2014or images\u2014which map-display application may then display stitched together to form a map.","Map-display application may receive input from the user (e.g. pan, zoom, new locations\/coordinate to display, etc.) In response to the user input, map-display application may request mapping information from mapping server  and display the received mapping information.","Please note that it is common practice for map-display applications to use caching to store various mapping data. Once mapping data is received from the mapping server for the first time, it may be stored in local cache. Subsequent request for the same data may receive the data from local cache and not from the mapping server. Since caching is out of scope for this discussion, we describe all data as transmitted from a server, disregarding the fact that in an actual implementation, some of the data may be retrieved from a local cache.","Referring now to , in one presently-preferred embodiment, a map-display application on the client device may receive data (i.e. mapping data and various other data) from various sources and display the received data. For example, data used for rendering a map may be received from a mapping server, whereas other data, such as POI content, may be received from other offline and online sources. The map-display application may determine the sources from which to receive various types of data.","A map-display application may obtain and display mapping data as map , from mapping server . POI content  may be obtained and displayed by the map-display application , from other data sources  (e.g. an on-line database of POI content, world-wide web pages and content, etc.) In this example, map-display application may display mapping data as a map , showing a shopping center titled \u201cGreat Mall\u201d. In response to input requesting zooming-in past the highest-allowed zoom level, map-display application may retrieve POI content from various sources , and display the POI content  (in this example a layout diagram of the \u201cGreat Mall\u201d shopping center.)","Referring now to , in another embodiment, a map-display application may obtain all data\u2014mapping data and POI content data\u2014from a mapping server. In this embodiment, user input (e.g. pan, zoom, inputted location name, etc.) may be transmitted by the map-display application to a mapping server . Mapping server  may retrieve POI content, as needed, from various sources  (e.g. an online POI content DB) and transmit back to map-display application images containing POI content .","A map-display application may obtain and display mapping data as map , from mapping server , as discussed previously. Map-display application may transmit user input to mapping server , in response to which mapping server  may construct and transmit back new display images. Mapping server , upon receiving from map-display application a user request to zoom-in past the highest-allowed zoom level, may (1) obtain POI content from external POI content sources , and (2) construct new display images containing POI content and (3) transmit the new images for display by the map-display application as POI content .","In this example, mapping server  may transmit to map-display application mapping data forming map , showing a shopping center titled \u201cGreat Mall\u201d. In response to input requesting zooming-in past the highest-allowed zoom level, mapping server  may obtain POI content from other sources  and transmit images containing the POI content to map-display application for display as POI content  (e.g. a layout diagram of the \u201cGreat Mall\u201d shopping center.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 12A-12D"]},"Referring to , the logic in flow diagram  may be invoked by a zoom-in event (e.g. the map-display application receives user input invoking a zoom-in command.)","At step , it may be determined whether the highest-allowed zoom level has been reached prior to the zoom-in event. If it is determined that the highest-allowed zoom level has not been reached prior to the zoom-in event, at step  other logic (not depicted in this flow diagram as it is out-of-scope for this discussion) may be invoked.","If it is determined at step  that the highest-allowed zoom level has been reached prior to the zoom-in event, at step  the center of the map may be determined. A map is commonly displayed as tiled images representing a range of longitude\/latitude values. The center of the map may be determined mathematically by calculating the mean horizontal display coordinate and mean vertical display coordinate.","At step , the center of the map, determined in display-coordinates at step , may be transformed into longitude\/latitude coordinates.","Please note that the process of determining the center of a displayed map, in screen coordinates, and translating the screen coordinates into longitude\/latitude values, is well established and is commonly used in prior art.","At step , a database of POIs may be scanned to determine if a POI matching the longitude\/latitude coordinates determined at step , exists. For example, a POI database may include a list of POIs (e.g. shopping centers, airports, amusement parks, etc.), including the longitude\/latitude coordinates of the POI.","At step , a list of all POIs within the coordinate range displayed on the map may be retrieved and, in the event more than one POI is determined to be within the coordinate range, the POI closest to the center coordinates, determined at step , may be selected.","If at step  it is determined that at least one matching POI has been found at step , at step  content associated with the POI found at step , may be retrieved. In an alternate embodiment, if it is determined at step  that either not even one POI has been found; or a setting has been set to treat the entire visible portion of a map as a collective POI, at step  content associated with the entire portion of the map may be retrieved.","At step , the content associated with the POI (\u201cPOI content\u201d), retrieved at step , may be displayed by the map-display application. In the presently-preferred embodiment, the POI content may be displayed overlapping a part of\u2014or the entirety of\u2014the map displayed by the map-display application. In an alternate embodiment, the POI content may be displayed replacing the map previously displayed by the map-display application. In another embodiment, the POI content may be displayed externally to the map displayed by the map-display application.","If at step  it is determined that no POI has been found at step , at step  the flow may terminate. In alternate embodiments, at step  the user may be notified no POI has been found, for example audibly as in a \u201cbeep\u201d sound, or via a message indicating no POI content is available, etc.","Referring now to , flow diagram  may be invoked when a zoom event is received by the map-display application. If at step  it is determined that a \u201czoom-out\u201d function has been invoked, at step  the POI content may be removed or hidden (depending on the POI content display-method used at step  in .)","At step , the map ordinarily displayed at the highest-allowed zoom level, may be displayed to the user, unobstructed by POI content.","In alternate embodiments, as discussed in other figures, the logic of flow diagram  may be used in response to other events, such as a user panning the map, inputting a different geographic region to map, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},"Flow diagram A illustrates an embodiment in which content associated with a specific POI on a map is retrieved and displayed. In response to a zoom-in event at step  (e.g. a user invoking a zoom-in command on their map-displaying electronic device), at step  it may be determined whether the highest-allowable zoom level has been reached. In alternate embodiments, it may be determined whether the highest-allowable zoom level has been surpassed (i.e. in one embodiment zooming to the highest-allowable zoom level may display POI content, whereas in another embodiment attempting to zoom-in, once at the highest-allowable zoom level, may display POI content.)","If at step  it is determined the highest-allowable zoom level has been reached\/surpassed (see discussion in earlier section), at step , the POI in focus may be determined (see example logic for determining POI in focus in flow diagram  in .)","At step , a data store (e.g. an online database containing content related to POIs) may be searched for content associated with the POI in focus, identified at step . In one embodiment, a database may contain various types of content associated with various types of POIs. For example, POIs representing shopping malls may have associated POI content including store layout diagrams and hyperlinks to stores. The database may be compiled automatically by crawling the internet, finding and saving information associated with POIs. In another embodiment, the database may also contain information submitted by various third-parties\u2014for example, a theme park may submit specific POI content, such as park layout and pricing information, to be associated with the POI designating the theme park.","A data store containing POI content may comprise one or more sources, such as on-line servers, locally-cached data, data CDs\/DVDs, etc.","If at step  it is determined that, at step , POI content associated with the POI in focus has been found in the data store, at step  the POI content may be retrieved. At step  the POI content may be displayed.","If at step  it is determined that no POI content has been found at step , at step  a website associated with POI content , may be sough. At step , the website found at step , may be crawled to obtain content relevant to the POI. (Please see  for discussion on automatically identifying and retrieving POI content from the internet.)","At step , POI content retrieved at step  may be displayed.","Referring now to , flow diagram  illustrates an alternate embodiment in which POI content applies to an entire visible portion of a map. For example, POIs may not be displayed on a zoomed-in portion of a map for various reasons: no POIs may exist for that portion of the map; and\/or the user may have turned off an option to display POIs; and\/or mapping settings\/preferences may have been set to treat a zoomed-in portion of a map as a single POI. In such embodiment, POI content (e.g. street photograph) which applies to the entire visible zoomed-in region, may be displayed.","At step , a user command to zoom in a map may be received. For example, on a hand-held device such as the iPhone\u00ae, the user may perform a \u201cpinching-out\u201d movement indicating a zoom-in command. In response, at step , it may be determined whether a maximum zoom level has been reached (i.e. no further map tiles with mapping\/satellite data are available at the newly-requested zoom level). In an alternate embodiment, a logical \u201cmaximum zoom level\u201d may be defined as an alternative to a physical zoom-in limitation defined by the lack of new map tiles\/data to represent the newly-desired zoom level.","If at step  it is determined that the maximum zoom level has been reached, at step  it may be determined that content associated with the entire visible section of the map\u2014as opposed to content associated with a specific POI on the map\u2014should be retrieved.","At step , the visible section of the map may be identified. For example, in a map showing city streets, an entire city street (or visible portion thereof) may be identified as a collective POI.

In one embodiment, a database engine associated with the POI data store may execute a query to return all POIs whose coordinates are within the range submitted at step . In alternate embodiments, the returned list may include other data associated with the POIs, such as thumb-nail photos, etc.","At step , all POIs on the list at step  may be flagged on the map. For example, a location marker (such as a pushpin icon) may be displayed on the map at the coordinates corresponding with every POI on the list at step .","At step , flow  may end. In alternate embodiments, the POIs flagged on a map, based on the availability of POI content for these POIs, may be grouped by\u2014or delimited by\u2014an association among the POIs. For example, POIs flagged on a map may represent POIs that have associated POI content and that have been defined by a social networking group (Please see  for further discussion.) For example, a dozen bars in a city block may have POI content associated with them, but only five of them may be flagged on a map that is being used by the members of a social network frequenting only these five bars.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},"Another advantage of displaying POI content as a separate image superimposed on a map, may be the increased speed for redrawing the map once the POI content is removed. When POI content needs to be removed or hidden (for example, when a user pans the map or zooms out) it may be faster to hide\/remove an overlay showing POI content, as discussed in this embodiment, than to redraw the map, as may be required in an embodiment where map content is replaced with POI content.","Referring to , map-display application  may display a map . In response to a zoom-in event past the highest-allowable zoom level (for example, as indicated by the zoom-indication bar labeled \u201cLayout\u201d ) POI content  may be displayed over map  in map-display application .","In the presently-preferred embodiment, POI content  may be displayed centered over the POI location it is associated with (i.e. the center of the POI content may be at the coordinates as the center of the POI location.) In alternate embodiments, POI content  may be displayed at other locations on the map, for example in a corner of the map, in an attempt to keep the POI location associated with POI content , un-obscured from the user's view. In another embodiment the user may be able to set preferences for the default placement of POI content. In yet another possible embodiment, the user may be able to use a pointing device to move the POI content on the map.","Referring now to , in commonly-used mapping technologies (e.g. used by mapping services such as Google Maps\u00ae, Yahoo! Maps\u00ae, Windows Live Search Maps\u00ae, etc.) a map  is composed of map tiles (e.g. map tile \u201cx1, y1, z\u201d , which is part of a matrix of twenty map tiles, x1,y1,z1-x5,y4,z1) In response to user requests such as zoom, pan and selecting new locations, new map tiles may be loaded and displayed by mapping application . Technologies such as AJAX, HTML, DHTML, Javascript, etc. may be used to render a map from map tiles generated by a mapping server.","In the presently-preferred embodiment, POI content may be displayed as a map overlay object. An overlay object is an object on the map that is tied to latitude\/longitude coordinates, so it can move when the map is dragged (i.e. panned) or zoomed. An overlay object may display content\u2014for example an image\u2014whose source is different from the source of the map. Various types of overlays may be used in the implementation of the present invention; for example, custom overlays, layer overlays, etc.","According to the present invention, map  may be constructed from map tiles transmitted to map-display application  from a mapping server, while overlay object  may display POI content as an image (or in the form of other media) transmitted to map-display application  from a different source than the mapping server.","Various styles and methods may be used to construct, present and hide POI content to the user. Overlay object , displaying POI content, may be constructed (i.e. rendered with POI content) in the device's memory, invisible to the user. Overlay object  may become visible to the user only once all POI content has been retrieved and rendered on the memory-resident overlay object.","An overlay object may be removed from the user's view using various methods, including but not limited to, invoking the \u201chide\u201d (or similar) method of the overlay object , invoking the \u201cremove\u201d (or similar) method of overlay object , by unloading the overlay object  from memory, etc.","A shadow effect graphic  may be displayed in proximity of overlay object . Shadow effect graphic  may comprise a graphics displayed as translucent, such that map tiles obscured by shadow effect graphic  (e.g. map tile x5,y2,z ) may be partially visible. Shadow effects may be used both for aesthetics and to help delineate for the user POI content from the map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Map-display application  may display a selected area of a map . Map  may display a pushpin , indicating the existence of information associated with a POI (in this example \u201cGreat Mall\u201d). In response to a user command to zoom-in to\/past the highest-allowed zoom level, an automatic process may search the internet for content associated with the POI in focus (in this example, the POI associated with the pushpin ) and display the content to the user.","Map-display application  may perform electronic searches on the internet . Various searches may be conducted to identify a website associated with the POI in focus (e.g. marked by pushpin ) For example, online versions of yellow pages, search engines such as Google\u00ae and online directories mashing search engine information with geographic locations, may be searched to identify a website associated with a POI.","A website associated with a POI is likely to have a main landing page  (usually named \u201cindex.htm\u201d, \u201cindex.htm\u201d, etc.) containing un-compiled computer code (e.g. HTML, DHTML, Javascript, XML, etc.) The code of the landing page may be scanned for terms associated with content.

In an alternate embodiment illustrated in , a user may choose a function from the context menu to display POI content.","For example, the function \u201cZoom to layout\u201d  may display on context menu , associated with map-display application . In response to a user's selection of the \u201cZoom to layout\u201d  function, map-display application  may retrieve and display POI content (e.g. associated with a location  marked on the map )","Similarly, keyboard shortcuts may be used to invoke a function to display POI content associated with a location on the map. Keyboard shortcuts are commonly used on computing devices, allowing a user to send a command to an application with a simple keystroke. For example, the key combination \u201ccontrol-c\u201d is commonly used as a \u201ccopy\u201d function.

As zoom technology improves, it may be possible to obtain very detailed maps and it may be more useful to display the POI content at a zoom level lower than the maximum zoom. For example, the POI content may be displayed when a predetermined zoom level has been exceeded, which the user can set. In one embodiment, the user may wish to have POI information at all zoom levels. Alternatively, the user may set the POI content to only be displayed when a predetermined zoom level is met such as: street level or a predetermined viewing scale. The scale of the display is a ratio of physical size to displayed size. Thus, a map of a city street may be displayed at a scale of 1:10,000 or 1 inch=1,000 feet or any other ratio.","As discussed above, the zoom level can correspond to a specific scale and in an embodiment, the POI information can be set to any zoom level by the user.
