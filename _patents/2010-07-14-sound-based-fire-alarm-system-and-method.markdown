title: Sound based fire alarm system and method
abstract: Stovetop fires are among the more prevalent of resident fire hazards and smoke detectors are among the most prevalent and economical forms of residential fire alarms. Automatic stovetop fire extinguishers can prevent property damage and even personal injury; however, these stovetop fire extinguishers may also limit smoke emissions and the subsequent detection of smoke. While an initial fire may be efficiently subdued by an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher, it is often desirable to alert present and future occupants of a fire hazardous condition. A sound based fire alarm system and method are described herein, which detects a sound burst emitted upon deployment of an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher and triggers a continuous fire alarm to alert occupants of a potentially fire hazardous condition. Alarm signals can be audible, visual, or both. The system may be a stand alone system and use battery power for affordability and ease of installation. The method described herein enables the ready and automatic extinguishment of a stovetop fire, while alerting those in the surrounding area or those in adjacent dwellings of a fire situation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","REFERENCE LIST"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/240,081, filed Sep. 29, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to a fire alarm system and method, and more particularly to a sound based fire detection and fire alarm system.","Conventional fire alarm systems are frequently part of a conventional home security system. Security sensors include motion detectors, while conventional fire sensors include smoke detectors and heat detectors. The home security system typically has a control panel, which receives sensor input and sends sensor commands. In addition to sensors, the home security system may comprise various warning lights, horns, bells and the like. These home fire and security systems add significant costs to the home and may be found in large homes or higher priced homes. Surveillance and monitoring service may also be incorporated into a fire and security system at an additional recurring service expense.","Conventional self contained smoke detectors are less expensive the systems referenced supra and are common in residential dwellings and may be required for insurance purposes. These battery operated units detect smoke via various means and provide a loud alert for occupants when smoke is detected. Smoke detectors are often positioned away from the cooking area to avoid nuisance alarms. Other conventional fire detectors sense heat but are less common. Commercial buildings may use self contained smoke detectors, a fire and security system, or a combination of both.","Stovetop fires, in particular, are a well known residential and commercial hazard. An unattended stovetop fire, for example a grease fire, can cause damage to nearby appliances and cabinets. Worse, stovetop fires can lead to structural damage or personal injury. Because the propensity for stovetop fires is so pervasive, an efficient means of automatic fire suppression is desired. Even if a stovetop fire is attended, an automatic extinguishing method may be more effective and expedient compared to manual means.","There are a number of conventional fire extinguishing systems, to include automatic stovetop fire extinguishers. Conventional fire extinguishers include, for example, the automatic stovetop fire extinguisher taught by Williams, U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,075. The unit can be readily mounted over a stovetop and upon detection of flames, the extinguisher releases a fire suppressant. While release of fire suppressant may extinguish a current fire, a smoke alarm, as a consequence, may not be triggered to alert occupants of the present deployment of fire suppressant and any potential for subsequent additional fires. To avoid an unwarranted smoke alarm trigger, the conventional smoke alarm in a typical residence is not placed near the cooking area. This typical proximity may decrease the likelihood of the smoke detector triggering upon activation of a distant automatic stovetop fire extinguisher.","It would be desirable to provide an automatic fire extinguisher and fire alarm system which suppressed any present flames while alerting building occupants of the hazardous situation. Depending on the applicable fire code, the building environment, and building residents themselves, a fire system may be required to have both extinguishment and alert functions. As, an example, it may desirable or required by fire codes to alert the neighboring apartments or dorm rooms of a fire hazard condition in an adjacent dwelling. For a multitude of situations, it would be desirable to provide an efficient and economical stovetop fire extinguisher and fire alert system.","The present invention provides an audible fire alarm upon deployment of an automatic fire extinguisher. Aspects of the present invention provide below are neither exhaustive nor exclusive.","An aspect of the present invention is to provide a continuing alarm in conjunction with automatic stovetop fire suppression system. Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a continuous audible alert for occupants of a dwelling or commercial building upon the automatic release of a fire suppressant and\/or to provide a continuing audio signal warning those present or those subsequently entering a building of a possible fire hazardous condition.","Another aspect of the present invention is to forward the alert signal to neighbor UL rated smoke detectors, which in turn sound an alarm.","Another aspect of the present invention is to trigger a fire alarm upon sensing of a brief high decibel signal.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a continuous audible alarm upon activation of a STOVETOP FIRESTOP\u00ae fire suppressor (Williams-Pyro, Inc., Fort Worth, Tex., USA).","Another aspect of the present invention is upon extinguishing of a local fire, to visually notify remote occupants of the hazardous situation in the building.","Another aspect of the present invention is to interface with self-contained fire extinguishers and self-contained smoke detectors to provide a continuing audible alarm to occupants throughout a building upon the deployment of a local automatic fire extinguisher.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a continuous audible signal to residents of a stovetop fire condition, to include residents who are remote from the stovetop or sleeping.","Another aspect of the present invention is that it enables a sound based fire detector to be incorporated into an existing fire control system.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a continuing audio signal warning those present or those entering a building of a possible fire hazardous condition.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an affordable sound based fire alarm system, which provides a continuous audible alarm signal to alert residents of a stovetop fire condition and which operates via a self-contained power supply.","Embodiments of the present invention may employ any or all of the exemplary aspects above. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate the above-noted features and advantages of the invention together with other important aspects thereof upon reading the detailed description that follows in conjunction with the drawings.","The invention, as defined by the claims, may be better understood by reference to the following detailed description. The description is meant to be read with reference to the figures contained herein. This detailed description relates to examples of the claimed subject matter for illustrative purposes, and is in no way meant to limit the scope of the invention. The specific aspects and embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 3"],"b":["102","105","110","110","110","112","120","140","160","180","180","112","102","110","102","112"]},"In an alternate embodiment a diffuse field measurement microphone, which measures sound waves from all directions, is employed as the sound sensor . A desirable diffuse field microphone, for use in the present invention, has a dynamic range comparable to the signature power spectral density of the fire suppressor's sound emission. According to an exemplary embodiment, the microphone has a maximum sound pressure level of at least 150 decibels and a frequency response spanning the narrow bandwidth of the fire suppressor's sound emission frequency, as shown for example in . In yet another embodiment, a near field microphone is employed in a sound based fire alarm system. Near field microphones are particularly suited for embodiments which enable mounting of the sound based alarm , or just the sensor , near the stovetop area , and more particularly, near the stovetop fire extinguisher .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["212","220","220","222","220","224","223","220","212","212","240"]},"Control circuitry  determines the presence of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher from the output of the sensor circuitry . In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, logic circuitry , a microcontroller , or a combination of both can be used to detect the sound emission of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher. Any of a number of signal characteristics may be assessed and compared to a threshold value corresponding to the audio signal generated upon deployment of an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a condenser instrument microphone is mounted beneath an over the stovetop microwave , as shown in , near an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher . A decibel reading in excess of 110 decibels at a frequency greater than 2.5 kHz meets threshold requirements for determination of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher. In still another embodiment, a sound pressure level in excess of 125 decibels at any frequency for a duration of at least 5 milliseconds will exceed threshold requirements and determine the presence of a sonic signal from an activated stovetop fire extinguisher. The above sonic characteristics for determination of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher are exemplary. These sound characteristic quantities described above, as measured near a stovetop, may avoid false determinations of an activated stovetop fire extinguisher as compared to sounds sensed from background noises.A microphone signal picked up during activation of an automatic stovetop fire suppressor is shown in  and is further described below with reference to the same.","Referring to , in still other embodiments, when a control panel for a fire and security system is present, the output of the control circuitry may interface directly with an existing control panel . Communication  may be conducted, for example, by an RS485 cable. In still other embodiments, the control circuitry  comprises a transceiver , and a wireless radio frequency trigger signal is transmitted via a transceiver in the control circuitry and received at the control panel via a receiver , as shown for example, in . Control circuitry  can be housed within a sensor circuitry housing and may be driven from a common battery supply  or from its own battery supply .","Control circuitry  connects to alarm circuitry , which in turn drives a fire alarm to generate a continuous alarm signal.  shows a block diagram of a sound based fire alarm with a number of alarm circuitries , in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Sound sensor  is electrically connected to sensor circuitry , which connects to control circuitry . The output of the control circuitry  is electrically coupled  to an alarm circuitry -, which in turn drives an alarm . Each of the circuitries, , ,  may be housed in a same housing, in individual housings, or in some combination. Similarly the sensor  and alarm, for example , may be housed with its respective circuitry or separately, as needed or as desired. In still other embodiments at least one alarm circuitry and alarm device are remote from the control circuitry and\/or the sensor circuitry. As shown in , the control circuitry may connect to different alarm types - to -, where each alarm has its own alarm circuitry ---. Alarm devices may include a smoke detector -, a buzzer -, a piezoelectric buzzer -, a speaker -, or a strobe light, not shown. Each alarm circuitry may comprise a battery power supply  supporting an independent stand alone system. Different embodiments of a sound based fire alarm  may comprise any combination of alarm devices.","In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, a tone generator - provides the alarm signal which is amplified and drives speaker -. A commercially available microprocessor-based digital tone generator may be employed, or a simpler transistor-transistor logic (TTL) timer-based tone generator may be employed. For some applications, such as a multi-resident or multi-dwelling building, a digital multi-tone tone generator, such as PRONOR NV's Digital Multi-tone Tone Generator V-9927A (PRONOR NV, Gent, Belgium) may be employed. In other embodiments, a sound generator integrated circuitry -, an 8\/10 W amplifier -, and an 8 ohm speaker - can provide the alarm circuitry and alarm device, respectively.","As appreciated by one of ordinary skill, a single 9 volt battery may be used to supply 9 volts across a speaker or piezoelectric buzzer, while a diode combination or voltage regulator can drop the 9 volts to 5 or less volts across, for example, a programmable interface controller (PIC).","In still another embodiment, a smoke detector is incorporated as the alarm device -. An alarm circuitry -, which drives the smoke detector, will tap into the smoke detector circuitry in parallel with the smoke detection circuitry, ionizing or photoelectric, and will leave the smoke detection function intact. In alternate embodiments, the smoke detector is dedicated to the sound based fire alarm system and the smoke detection is disabled. A buzzer -, or piezoelectric buzzer -, may also be used as an alarm device in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A miniature ceramic buzzer can provide 80 decibels at 10 cm, while a larger one inch diameter piezoelectric buzzer can provide 108 decibel continuous alarm at only 50 mA for voltages between 5 and 15 VDC. A piezo transducer, piezoelectric buzzer, will produce high volume when driven near its resonant frequency. A suitable driver circuitry  for a piezoelectric transducer - may comprise, for example, a 555 astable timer. Piezo transducers require a small current, usually less than 10 mA, so they can be connected directly to the outputs of many integrated circuitry chips, without amplification. As discussed above, alarm circuitry - to - may include a battery and may also comprise a programmable interface controller (PIC). Alarm circuitry - is shown comprising a battery  and a driver circuitry . Any and all alarm circuitries may comprise a battery and\/or drive circuitry.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["412","420","440","459","447","447","1","447","3","480","3","1","480","3","3","460","3","1","460","3","3","447","459","447","1","459","2"]},"Some embodiments of the present invention may be readily incorporated into an existing smoke detector system.
