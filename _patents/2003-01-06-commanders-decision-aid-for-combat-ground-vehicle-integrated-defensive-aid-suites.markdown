No. 60\/413,793 filed Sep. 26, 2002.","The Government of the United States may have rights in this application as a result of work done on the invention described herein under one or more of the following contract numbers with the Department of the Army: DAAE07-95-C-R043, DAAE07-97-C-X073, DAAE07-97-C-X100, DAAE30-95-C-0009, and DAAE07-02-C-L012.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to countermeasures (CM) and more particularly to decision making with respect to CM.","2. Brief Description of Prior Developments","Ground combat vehicles such as tanks, howitzers and other artillery and reconnaissance vehicle typically have a proliferation of highly lethal, multispectral guidance approaches that may easily overwhelm the vehicle's capability to withstand hits from extremely lethal rounds such as the laser-designated guided Hellfire ATGM anti-tank guided missile. The critical need for rapid, accurate threat detection, identification, range estimates for TTG (time-to-go) estimation and applicable\/timely countermeasure deployment for threat prioritization, avoidance. Targeting in this environment also requires total incorporation of the onboard and offboard resources in a reliable manner that interacts well with the vehicle commander. A need exists for a means to meet these advanced threats.","This invention assesses applicable threats, their behavior, guidance systems (laser semi-active homing, optical, laser beam rider, MMW (millimeter wave), kinetically shot, and the like), sensors required to detect these threats (both presently available and advanced technology required), and applicable countermeasure suite options, while taking into account battlefield clutter and the false target environment. The present invention includes a closed-loop architecture may be advantageously used that performs multisensor (multispectral) fusion, aggregate threat typing, lethality assessment, TTG (time-to-go) assessment, threat prioritization, sensor control, CM (countermeasures) selection, and CM effectiveness evaluation.","Referring to , the CDA problem space includes battlefield clutter  such as flares, tracers, explosions, fires and gunfire. It also includes threats , weather  including wind, fog, rain and day or night, and vehicle environment  such as rough roads, ditches and rolling terrain. The integrated defense system (IDS) sensor suite  includes an infrared warner , a laser warner , radar  and an acoustic warner . The IDS countermeasures suite  includes an ATGM jammer , a laser decoy , a fire control jammer , an AP launcher  and a smoke generator . The commander's decision aid (CDA)  receives and gives information to and from off-board data base  and provides information to the user . The infrared warner  detects missile launches, ground fire, explosive events from top attack (overhead) where there is least armor on top of the vehicle from howitzer-fired munitions and\/or out of fighter or attack aircraft. The infrared warner  also looks for relevant explosive events within an angle around the initial infrared warner report. The laser warner  detects laser, semi-active homing (LSAH) missiles such as the U.S. Hellfire missile. The acoustic warner  allows for detection of tracked vehicles that are moving or idling as well as rotary winged vehicles. The radar warner  is active system\/tucked away based on a warning sensor report (IRW, LWR, acoustic warning reports from a fellow tanker or from downlinks from satellite or UAV reports).","Referring to , the CDA's architecture is shown wherein a multispectral sensor suite  as described above provides a signal to the CDA  and in particular to track fusion element  which includes, temporal association , spatial association , and type association , which provides information to threat typing . An a priori data base  also provides information along with threat typing to threat prioritization  and to CM effectiveness  and to CM response management  and to countermeasures . There is also a visual display  which receives pre-battle data  and provides and receives information through crew interface and offboard digital data.","It will be appreciated that an analysis of the threats and their operational characteristics, battlefield events and their signatures, background clutter, sensors and sensor processing, CM options (and required advancements), the \u201cintegrated EW\u201d concept, and vehicle dynamics, the five integral parts of the integrated algorithm (fusion, threat typing, threat prioritization, CM selection, CM effectiveness) were tailored to the ground combat vehicle problem space. These functions are further described in Table 1. Advantages of this system include: (1) easy use of offboard, a priori, and pre-mission data; (2) developing sensor correlation that incorporates the \u201csensed event\u201d with the \u201cthreat launch\u201d to determine if they are compatible, as, for example, a laser rangefinder detection with a missile warning report or a laser rangefinder report, missile launch report with a follow-on (several seconds later) laser semi-active homing designator report, (3) utilizing the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to merge threat type (e.g., class, ID) information and handle conflicting data, (4) computing threat lethality based on threat type and the approach angle toward the vehicle and relative armor strength, (5) computing an estimate of TTG (time-to-go) for the weapon to hit the vehicle, (6) performing resource\/response management in such a way to either prevent unnecessary use of CMs, or to maximize the use of the timing and CM to handle more than one threat (salvo engagements) with one CM, and (7) perform CM effectiveness through the effective use and interpretation of the sensor information.","In addition to the above features, the system of this invention also provides: (1) an assessment of YATO\/YANTO (\u201cyou-are-the-one\u201d\/\u201cyou-are-not-the-one\u201d) for inbound ATGMs (anti-tank guided missiles) as to whether the round is aimed at the vehicle to be or another friendly vehicle by use of P3I sensor developed PBO (post-burnout) IR tracking capability and to use this for CM effectiveness as well after a CM has been applied; (2) use of Cauchy weighting functions to assign a probabilistic value to both spatially-and temporally-correlated battlefield events such as tying the laser rangefinder events to a missile launch and\/or designator event by understanding the operational threat characteristics, or as a further example correlating the top-attack (SADARM [sense-and destroy armor] and SFW [sensor-fused weapon]) events to knowing the presence and timing of incoming \u201coverhead\u201d threat munitions; (2) performing passive ranging using the acoustic sensor angle measurements from two friendly vehicles to form a \u201ccombined threat ID\u201d and range using the data link. The acoustic sensor provides passive detection of both rotary-winged aircraft (like helicopters) and surface tracked vehicles (as long as they have their engines running\u2014in idle); (3) making a passive assessment of TTG (time-to-go) of an inbound ATGM that is heading toward another friendly vehicle by using PBO angle tracking (i.e., using optimized curve-fitting algorithms to process the angle rate and acceleration derived from the angle measurements); (4) cueing the APS (active protection system\u2014radar and self-contained CM firing mechanism systems) radar for purposes of performing\/supporting CM effectiveness; (5) supporting threat avoidance (TA) by using the acoustic sensor data that detects NLOS (non-line-of-sight) threats (helicopters and tracked vehicles) that are blocked by terrain (mountains\/trees)\u2014and allows the CDA to recommend \u201csoft responses\u201d such as remain still, get close to a hill or tree line for camouflage), posture the main battle gun for an offensive surprise attack due to the precursory information regarding the threat type\/ID, angle rate (heading), and inferred onboard threat weapons; (6) using real-time offboard reports regarding threat type\/ID and location within the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to correlate subsequent threat reports to the offboard reports and to slant (bias) the threat typing\/ID aggregation base on these reports, and more importantly, to \u201cde-weight\u201d the correlation with time as the offboard data becomes stale; (7) using 2-color missile warning data for purposes of threat typing and clutter discrimination (i.e., uses spectral ratio information in a novel manner); (8) minimizing fratricide through the managing of sensor and CM \u201cexclusion zones\u201d whereby reports from sensors in certain sectors around the vehicle are ignored and\/or if entities in the battlefield are detected, CM are not applied against them, (9) designing in a modular manner to allow the addition\/removal of sensors and countermeasures.","While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"CDA Function Descriptions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Function","Task Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Fusion","Initialize tracks using onboard, offboard and pre-battle data"]},{"entry":[{},"Determine which multispectral sensor data correspond to"]},{"entry":[{},"the same threat by use of kinematic, threat class\/ID"]},{"entry":[{},"information at the individual sensor level and the relative"]},{"entry":[{},"time of the received signature information"]},{"entry":["Threat","Combine threat type confidence values from each sensor"]},{"entry":["Typing","using Dempster-Shafer algorithm"]},{"entry":[{},"De-weight the threat type confidence for offboard reports"]},{"entry":[{},"that become invalid as time elapses"]},{"entry":[{},"Use pre-battle information regarding likely threat mix"]},{"entry":["Threat","Utilize threat type confidence"]},{"entry":["Prioritization","Assess intent using threat line-of-sight (LOS) information"]},{"entry":[{},"Assess time-to-intercept using IRW signature data and"]},{"entry":[{},"using the vehicle LRF if available"]},{"entry":[{},"Apply the lethality equation or table that uses threat type"]},{"entry":[{},"information and anticipate side of vehicle that will be"]},{"entry":[{},"impacted"]},{"entry":[{},"Factor in Response Effectiveness"]},{"entry":["Resource &","Control onboard sensors"]},{"entry":["Response","Provide crew threat track data via the solder-machine"]},{"entry":["Management","interface (SMI)"]},{"entry":[{},"Deploy\/control CMs when necessary"]},{"entry":[{},"Update crew of CM inventory"]},{"entry":[{},"Take into account crew's preferred CM list, Cm exclusive"]},{"entry":[{},"zones, and other CMs that may be used at the same time"]},{"entry":["Response","Use elapsed time to drop certain tracks"]},{"entry":"Effectiveness"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}}],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is further described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
