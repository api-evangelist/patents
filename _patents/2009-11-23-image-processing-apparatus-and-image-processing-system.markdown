Because the flow of need\/needlessness judging process in the judging section  is the same as that of embodiment 1 (), so explanations are omitted.","After the need\/needlessness judging process is executed through the judging section  (Step S), and an execution instruction is performed (Step S), the executing section  performs an obtainment instruction to the document size obtaining section  in order to obtain document size information.","The document size obtaining section  obtains document size information from the application information received from the document process application section  on the basis of the obtainment instruction, and then notifies the executing section  of it.","Then, the executing section  transmits the document size information informed from the document size obtaining section  along with the paper change information and the paper size information that are informed from the paper size watching section  to the comparing and judging section . Then, the comparing and judging section  compares the document size information with the paper size information, and judges whether or not they are consistent, that is, performs a comparing and judging process (Step S).","When document size information is consistent with paper size information, the comparing and judging section  judges that paper of paper size that is consistent with document size is set in any one of paper tray of the printer . Thus, the inquiry controlling process is completed in the personal computer .","When it is judged that document size information and paper size information are not consistent, that is, inconsistent (Step S), the comparing and judging section  notifies the executing section  of the judgment result representing inconsistency.","Then, the executing section  informs of document size information and paper size information with respect to the inquiring section , and then performs an inquiry instruction.","The inquiring section  displays an inquiry scene  () on the display  on the basis of the inquiry instruction from the executing section  (Step S).","Further, the executing section  informs of a process ID and a document name with respect to the updating section , and then performs an updating instruction. On the basis of the updating instruction, the updating section  updates the storing section  (Step S).","On the display of the inquiry scene  (), when any one of the selection buttons and is selected, the inputting section  inputs a change instruction of document size and tray designation information (Step S). On the basis of the input, the executing section  notifies the changing section  of paper size information corresponding to the inputted tray designation information as change size information (Step S). Then, the changing section  transmits a change demand and the change size information to the document process application section .","After the document process application section  receives the change demand and the change size information from the inquiring process controlling section , the setting section  changes a setting of document size information into the change size information with respect to the process object document (Step S). Thus, the inquiry controlling process is completed in the personal computer .","As stated above, after a paper change is detected in the printer , a comparing and judging process of document size of a process object document in the document process through the document process application section  and paper size of the printer  is executed, when they are not consistent, the inquiring process is executed.","Further, because the operation of the personal computer  is the same as that of embodiment 1 in the case that the print instruction is performed through the instructing section , so explanations are omitted.","As stated above, according to the printer system  of the present embodiment, because the printer , after detected the installation of the paper tray section , is capable of obtaining paper size information of the paper tray section  and informing the personal computer  of it, it is possible for the personal computer  to detect the inconsistency of document size and paper size not only when a document process operation is detected but also when a paper change is detected. Therefore, it becomes possible to further restrain the occurrence of the failure print.","The Utilization Possibility in Industry:","In respective embodiments stated above, a printer is adopted as an image forming apparatus that is connected to an image processing apparatus. However, the present invention is not limited in the case. For example, it is also possible to adopt MFP that has both FAX function and scanner function.","The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments but many modifications and variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the appended claims of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 28"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
