All of the foregoing are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The invention generally described herein relates to the design and fabrication of micro-optic devices. In particular, the present invention pertains to micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) optical assemblies used in fiber optic switching arrays, wavelength routers, laser scanners, bar code scanners, variable optical attenuators (VOA), wavelength tunable lasers, and other related devices. More particularly, the present invention pertains to the design, structure and fabrication of MEMS reflectors and hinges used in fiber optic switching devices.","As is well known, fiber optic technology is a rapidly growing field with vastly expanding commercial applicability. As with all technologies, fiber optic technology is faced with certain practical difficulties. In particular, the design and fabrication of arrays of optical elements that enable the efficient switching and coupling between input optical elements and output optical elements in an optical network is a significant consideration of designers, manufacturers, and users of optical systems. Optical systems commonly use laser generated light beams, to carry information through optical fibers and are directed through complex optical paths with the assistance of optical switching elements, routers and other like components. Other applications include wavelength routers that demultiplex incoming signals into individual wavelength and then switch in the nonblocking fashion single wavelengths between outputs, laser beam deflectors in laser printers, bar code reading devices and others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102","103","104","105","106","101","102","103","104","105","106","101","102","103","104","105","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2(","i":"a","b":["200","200","202","204","200","202","204","210","211","220","221","202","202","204","204","200"]},"Light beams carry information throughout the optical network. The light beams are directed to their final destination by passing through switching array systems  which direct the light beams to the desired destination. Electronic control circuitry  is used to dynamically control the switch  configuration. The control circuitry  can include, among other elements, position sensitive detectors, demultiplexing circuitry, photodetectors, position sensing detectors, amplifiers, decoding circuitry, servo electronics, digital signal processors, communication hardware, and an application programming interface. The control circuitry directs entering light beams to the desired exit fibers.","The following simplified illustration describes how a light beam can be switched from one of the incoming fibers in array  to a selected one of the fibers in array . Such description is also applicable to switching a light beam between any selected fiber in array  to a selected fiber in array .","In the depicted illustration, the light beam  exits the fiber  (and in preferred embodiments, passes through a lens array (not shown) so that the beam propagates without significant divergence) onto the reflector array . Servo electronics of the control circuitry  initiate deflection in a reflector \u2032 of the reflector array  to direct the light beam  along an optical path  to a desired fiber  (in fiber array ) using a signal from position detection array . By changing the deflection of the reflectors (e.g., \u2032) of the reflector array the light beams can be switched to enter any selected outgoing fiber . Also, the deflection of each of the reflectors \u2032 can be altered in very small ways to fine tune light beam optical characteristics. The reflector \u2032 deflection can be adjusted in response to instructions contained within the data streams of the light beam . Alternatively, reflector \u2032 deflection can be adjusted in response to instructions provided externally via an application programming interface of, for example, the control circuitry. Other methods of adjusting reflector \u2032 deflection known to those having ordinary skill in the art can also be used.","A light beam can be switched from one outgoing fiber to another outgoing fiber, by changing reflector deflection angle. For example, if light beam ,  is to be switched from fiber  into another outgoing fiber , the controller circuitry  sends appropriate instructions to the servo electronics which reposition the reflector \u2032 so that beam  is redirected along optical path  to fiber . Typically, the beams (e.g., , ) pass through a lens array (not shown) which focuses and couples the light beam (here ) into the outgoing fiber (here ). It should be noted that although fibers have heretofore been referred to as belonging to the incoming fiber arrays  or the outgoing fiber arrays , such fiber arrays are bi-directional. In such bi-directional embodiments, light beams also travel from the outgoing fibers in the outgoing fiber array  to incoming fibers in the incoming fiber array . This is done in the same way as light beams traveling from incoming fibers in the incoming fiber array  to outgoing fibers in the outgoing fiber array . Also shown in ) are the position-sensitive-detectors , which feed the position-error-signals to the controller circuitry .","The switching array system  is shown as one-dimensional in the embodiment of ) for clarity. In preferred embodiments the aforementioned arrays are two-dimensional. For example, in an embodiment with a two-dimensional reflector array , there are rows and columns, or some other two-dimensional arrangement of reflectors. The other arrays and alignment structures are similarly two-dimensional in some embodiments. In addition, the overall system is shown as two-dimensional in ). In preferred embodiments, the system is three-dimensional, as the additional dimension in and out of the plane of the paper can be advantageously used to position the various components and minimize the dimensions of the hardware.","It should be noted that although ) depicts the switching device  as having a single reflector array , many embodiments include two or more reflector arrays instead of just one with or without additional plane reflectors. One such embodiment is schematically illustrated in ). ) is a simplified schematic illustration showing an overview of two-reflector array bi-directional optical cross-connect switching array system . The system  includes fiber arrays  and  for passing light beams into and out of the switching array system . The fiber arrays ,  include a plurality of fiber optic transmission lines (a portion of which are shown here by fibers , , , and ). Here, the incoming light beam  is directed toward a first reflector array  which reflects the beam ,  onto a second reflector array  and then into the desired outgoing fiber (here, ). Switching may be accomplished by altering the deflection of the reflectors of the first reflector array  or by altering the deflection of the reflectors of the second reflector array  or by altering the deflection of the reflectors of the first reflector array  and the reflectors of the second reflector array  at the same time. In this example, the path of light beam  is altered by the deflection of first reflector \u2032 which directs the light beam  onto the altered beam path  onto second reflector \u2032 and into outgoing fiber . Additionally the control circuitry (not shown) controls the reflectors of both the first reflector array  and the second reflector array . Although structurally somewhat different from the previously discussed embodiment , the principles of operation of such multiple reflector array switches  are similar. Similar switching functions can be performed using alternative switching configurations. For example, one embodiment can use combined first and second sets of movable reflectors and one fixed reflector. An optical beam can be switched by reflection of an input beam from a movable reflector onto a fixed reflector and from this reflector back onto a movable reflector and into output fiber. Number of reflectors in the combined array is the same as total number of reflectors in two physically separate arrays. Many other configurations are used and known by those having ordinary skill in the art.","MEMS switching arrays can also be used in wavelength routers. One embodiment of such a wavelength router is depicted in . Using wavelength division multiplexing light beams of several wavelengths can be optically transmitted using the same fiber. For example, a single fiber can carry light beams comprising k signals at k wavelengths. These light beams of many wavelengths are coupled from a fiber  into a wavelength division demultiplexer . The demultiplexer  can be based on arrayed waveguide gratings, interference filters, or fiber Bragg gratings. The illustration of  uses an arrayed waveguide grating  as a wavelength division demultiplexer. Multi wavelength light beam  enters into the first free space region , is separated into individual wavelengths in grating  and exits through the second free space region  where light beams at k wavelengths are spatially separated. Light at each specific wavelength is coupled into linear fiber array that directs light beams onto a lens array . Relatively collimated light beams such as  and  propagate toward mirrors of the first array . The light at each specific wavelength is reflected from one mirror in the first array  onto a specific mirror of the second mirror array  from which the light is directed onto focusing lenses  and into a selected output fiber . The mirror arrays  and  can be one-dimensional arrays in order to match the spatial distribution of the light beams or two-dimensional arrays. Mirror arrays  and  are formed by bi-axial (bi-axially actuated) mirrors.","In accordance with the principles of the present invention, one embodiment of the invention comprises an optical element capable of motion in at least one degree of freedom wherein the motion in at least one degree of freedom is enabled by serpentine hinges configured to enable the optical element to move in the at least one degree of freedom. The embodiment further includes driving elements configured to deflect the optical element in said at least one degree of freedom to controllably induce deflection in the optical element and a damping element to reduce magnitude of resonances","Another embodiment includes a MEMS optical apparatus comprising an optical element capable of motion in two degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom are enabled by a first pair of serpentine hinges that is configured to enable the optical element to move in one degree of freedom and a second pair of serpentine hinges that is configured to enable the optical element to move in a second degree of freedom. The apparatus further includes driving elements configured to deflect the optical element in said two degrees of freedom and a damping element to reduce magnitude of resonances.","Another embodiment includes a MEMS optical apparatus comprising in combination a support structure, a movable optical element, at least one pair of serpentine hinges, driving elements positioned such that activation of the driving elements can controllably induce deflection in the movable optical element and a damping element. The combination comprising means for inducing a damped rotation of the movable optical element about an axis of rotation defined by each of the at least one pair of serpentine hinges.","A method embodiment for forming an array of MEMS optical elements comprises: providing a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer. Photoresist masking the top and bottom surfaces with appropriate patterning. First etching to remove the top oxide layer in hinge regions defined by the openings in the top photoresist layer exposing a hinge region of the device silicon layer. Forming a second photoresist layer patterning the hinge region of the device silicon layer so that a hinge can be formed. Second etching the patterned hinge region to remove portions of the device silicon layer forming recessed portions and such that unetched surfaces correspond to a hinge. Removing the second photoresist layer, thereby exposing the underlying top oxide layer as a hard mask layer having openings in the hinge region. Third etching the device silicon layer through the openings in the hard mask wherein the recessed portions are etched until the internal oxide layer is reached wherein the previously unetched surfaces are partially etched leaving a portion of the unetched surfaces in place as hinges. Fourth etching the bottom surface of the SOI wafer to form a pocket region and a separation line region. Fifth etching the SOI wafer to remove the internal oxide layer in the pocket region. Forming a reflective layer on at least one surface of the movable optical element, and a sixth etching to remove material from the separation line region to complete the separation line thereby enabling the substrate to be separated into arrays of a desired size.","These and other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.","Reference numerals refer to the same or equivalent parts of the present invention throughout the several figures of the drawings.","The present invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to certain preferred embodiments and specific features thereof. The embodiments set forth herein below are to be taken as illustrative rather than limiting. It should be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4(","FIG. 4("],"i":["a","a"],"b":["400","401","401","400","401","400","401","401","401","400","400","401","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4(","i":"b","b":["401","401","407","407","408","404","404","407","408","405","400","406","407","405","400","407","407","407","405","400"]},"The pair of mirror hinges  supports the frame  such that another axis of rotation (here, for example, rotation about a Y-axis) is defined. Typically, the pairs of hinges ,  define substantially perpendicular axes of rotation. Thus, three-dimensional motion can be achieved in the reflector assemblies . Simpler, reflector assemblies can also be constructed. Such assemblies only rotate about a single axis. These reflector assemblies find utility in many applications including smaller optical switches and in so-called digital (on-off) switching arrays. Such arrays only require rotation about a single axis. Generally speaking, such reflector assemblies  are driven by electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric or thermal driving elements. Electrostatic actuators are commonly fabricated underneath the mirror  and frame elements . These driving elements are typically controlled by the control circuitry of the switch.

For example, other types of actuators such as electrostatic rotational comb actuators, electromagnetic actuators, piezoelectric actuators or thermally driven actuators can be used. Although the depicted embodiment shows the mirror  as circular, the mirror  can have any shape.","Hinge design is an important aspect of the high performance reflector assemblies. The length, width, thickness, and cross sectional shape of hinges determine the stiffness and consequently the driving signals (voltages in case of electrostatic actuators) required to achieve desired deflections in the reflectors and the desired frequency response of the actuator. The torsional hinge stiffness is proportional to hinge thickness, to the third power of hinge width and inversely proportional to hinge length. The bending hinge stiffness is proportional to the third power of hinge thickness, to hinge width and inversely proportional to hinge length. The hinge stiffness has to be low enough to provide sensitive deflections but also high enough to exhibit high frequency resonances. The hinge must also be robust enough to be manufactured with a high yield and withstand the conditions of a normal operating environment. Additionally, if the reflector was constructed so that both the mirror and the hinges have the same low thickness, the lack of flatness of the mirror would lead to excessive wavefront distortions in light reflected by the mirror. Consequently, in most cases, the mirror thickness will be greater than hinge thickness. Therefore, fabrication processes should be capable of generating these two different thicknesses. In addition, hinge width is limited by processing (lithography and etching) and reasonable widths do not lead to acceptably low stiffness, unless the length of hinges is much greater than that which straight hinges can provide.","The principles of the present invention address this problem by using a serpentine hinge structure. Serpentine hinges can include one, two, three, four or more \u201cwindings\u201d. The inventors contemplate that n windings can be used in the hinges, where n is equal to or greater than one. )\u2013() depict examples of such single (()), double (()), triple (()), quadruple (()) serpentine hinges. ) shows a single winding hinge . Each winding includes two arms (shown here inside the dashed line boxes , ). In embodiments having many windings, the arms snake continuously from one arm to another for the entire length of the hinge. The windings include a pair of shafts ,  which connect the hinges  to the larger array elements. The arms ,  extend in a direction transverse to that of the axis of rotation for the hinge. ) is a perspective view of a portion of a double serpentine hinge . The thickness  of the hinge typically ranges from about 3 \u03bcm (micron) to about 50 \u03bcm. Thicker embodiments can be fabricated and, for some embodiments, are favored. However, the most preferred thickness is in the range of about 5\u201310 \u03bcm. This is in comparison to a typical mirror embodiment which is in the range of about 10\u201350 \u03bcm thick. The width  of the hinge typically ranges from about 2 \u03bcm to about 10 \u03bcm. Again, embodiments having greater widths can be fabricated. However, the preferred width is in the range of about 5\u201310 \u03bcm. The length (defined here by the dashed line)  of the serpentine hinge  can be any length. Embodiments having lengths in the 100's or even 1000's of microns being preferred. Of course, the length  of the serpentine hinge  depends on the number of windings in the hinge.","Damping is an advantageous feature that can add to the utility of each of the embodiments disclosed herein. One example of such a means is a thin coating of a damping agent applied onto the hinges. Such damping agents when dried (or cured) act as a damping factor which reduces resonances in the optical structures disclosed herein. Such damping agents are typically polymeric materials. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to silicones and elastomer materials for example, di-methylsilicone, polyurethane, polyisobutene-co-isoprene, and polybutadiene-co-acrylonitrile. Such damping agents are coated onto the hinges and cured. Alternatively, the damping agents are dried until the volatile constituents outgas. Typically, such damping agents are applied onto the hinges and part of the adjoining support structures. Such damping agents can be applied using, for example, an ink jet dispensing in any desired pattern and quantities over the hinge surfaces. Curing can be with room temperature, elevated temperature or exposure to ultraviolet radiation, electron beams, or a combination of these methods. In some embodiments, the damping agent is applied to the hinge in smaller quantities, forming isolated \u201cislands\u201d of damping material on the surface of the hinges. The amount of material applied to the hinges can depend on many factors, including, material type, amount of adjustment necessary, thickness of material, method of application, and other factors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5(","i":"g","b":["551","520","552"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5(","i":"h","b":["561","520"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5(","i":"i","b":["571","520","571"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6(","i":"a","b":["600","607","608","609","609","608","603","606","609","606"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6(","FIG. 6(","FIG. 6("],"i":["b","a","b"],"b":["601","607","607","608","608","607","607","607","608","608","608","607","607","608","608","609","606","607","607","608","608","607","607","608","608","607","607","608","608","654","655","656","657","607","608"]},"Another advantageously constructed embodiment is depicted in ).

Smaller reflector arrays allow a larger number of devices to be built on a given wafer, thus reducing the cost of these reflector arrays and the deflection angles required for switching. Furthermore, smaller structures have higher resonance frequencies, which improve switching and addressing times for the reflector array. Also, smaller reflector arrays enable shorter optical paths within switching devices.

A., Nee, J. T., Lau, K. Y., and Muller, R. S.","Extension of these general fabrication principles from uni-axial actuators to bi-axial actuators, and from structures where both the reflector and the hinge have the same thickness to devices where the reflector and hinge thicknesses are different presents a challenging fabrication problem. This is important because, it is desirable to have relatively thin hinges, otherwise the hinge stiffness can be too high requiring large torque to produce the desired deflection angles, which in turn leads to high driving signals. However, if the same low thickness is used for the reflectors, metal coating stress and\/or oxide stress can result in excessive mirror distortion. Therefore, a fabrication process that permits the decoupling of reflector and hinge thicknesses is advantageous. In addition, release and separation of these fragile bi-axial actuators requires special release and separation techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIGS. 11(","FIG. 6("],"i":["a","m","a"],"b":["11","610"]},"The depicted method embodiment illustrates a fabrication method using a single layer silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer.

The use of oxide masks can be substituted with additional photoresist masks. Also, low stress dielectric materials in layer  facilitates release of structures from the wafer. Also, it is preferable to use low stress materials for the internal etch stop layers. Such materials include low stress silicon oxides on the order of about 10\u2013100 MPa. Sputtering or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition processes that provide very low stress are used rather than thermally deposited oxides. Because hinges are fabricated from single crystal silicon, creep and fatigue are minimized and reliability is improved as compared with devices that use hinges made with polysilicon, metal and metal alloys in surface micromaching. Rotational comb designs have leads incorporated on movable electrodes and no bottom electrodes are required. The interconnections between the top and bottom wafers are fabricated using, for example, solder reflow or other techniques.","It should be noted that the optical devices formed on the wafers are very delicate. Care must be taken in separating the wafer into its component arrays. One approach for separating the very sensitive actuators into individual arrays (dies) is performed in combination of three steps. First, separation lines are defined lithographically or with shadow masking and dry etched, usually using standard deep reactive ion etching of silicon. The etch depth is chosen such that the wafer containing the actuators retains its rigidity but does not separate into individual dies. In the next step, deeper cuts are made along separation lines with laser cutting. The cut depth is controlled by pulse energy, pulse rate, number of pulses and translational speed of the substrate or laser beam. It is desirable to use lasers with very short pulse duration as shorter pulses reduce size and amount of particulate contamination. In addition, short wavelength lasers are used in order to provide sufficient absorption of laser energy by the material desired to be cut. Examples of the appropriate lasers are tripled or quadrupled neodymium YAG and Ti sapphire. With very short laser pulses, only gaseous by-products form during cutting and thus particulate contamination can be eliminated. Photochemical laser cutting can also be employed. A small thickness of material is left remaining in the trenches so that particulate and\/or gaseous contamination does not collect on the more critical surfaces (e.g. optical reflecting surfaces) during laser of the device. The final step involves cleaving this remaining material with a small amount of torque applied to separate the arrays. An alternative separation process can use only dry etching in combination with cleaving or laser cutting followed by cleaving. A preferred approach includes all three process steps. Additionally, these techniques, either individually or in combination, can be used to effect device separation from both the front and the backside of the wafer.","The present invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to certain preferred embodiments and specific features thereof.
