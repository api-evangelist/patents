The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present application is one of four related copending applications including application entitled Haar Wavelet Transform Embedded Lossless Type IV Discrete Cosine Transform, Ser.

No. 11\/126,705, filed May 10, 2005, by the same inventor.","The invention relates to the field of discrete cosine transforms. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of forward Haar transform for use in discrete cosine transforms for data compression.","The discrete cosine transform (DCT) does not enable one to directly merge two equal sized transforms into one double size transform, nor to split double size transform in halves. The equal sized splitting and merging is desirable for communicating transformed packets in smaller divisible packets. As such, the DCT is not a true merge and split transformation process. When used to split or merge, a mirror inverse DCT transform does not provide for lossless transformation. The only way for the DCT to perform a merge process is to inversely transform two equal sized DCT transforms back into the time domain, and merge in the time domain, and finally forward transform the combined double size block into a double size DCT transform. This disadvantageously required additional inverse transformations and forward transformations prior to transmission, while degrading the transformed data when additionally inverse and forward again transforming the data, and hence, the DCT is not a true direct split or merge transform. Another problem with the fast discrete cosine transform is that there is no decimation-in-time DCT separate flow process compatible with the DCT decimation-in-time combine flow process. That is, prior DCT processes do not have mirror block and flow processes. In prior art, the T(N\/2), type-II DCT and D(N\/2) type-IV DCT blocks are DCT transforms of the sum and the difference of two equal sized blocks processing first and second halves of the input data prior to combining the two halves into a double size DCT output. In both forward and inverse DCT transforms, the prior art requires operations on two different types of discrete cosine transforms T(N\/2) and D(N\/2), which are incompatible with true merge and split transform processing.","Another disadvantage of the prior DCT transforms is that the DCT are processed with integer operations that always incurred large errors in the resulting transformed data that is very lossy, whereas floating-point operations have minimum amount of loss. The term lossy means that the resulting data from transform to inverse transform losses data fidelity. In the content of image compression and decompression, the lossy image would have lower fidelity that the original uncompressed image. There are no completely lossless integer operated type-II or type-IV discrete cosine transforms. Yet another disadvantage in the prior art type-II DCT and type-IV DCT is that the DCTs are implemented with single function. As such, the DCTs do not share resources with other transforms, for example, a Haar transform. A 2\u00d72 rotator, whether lossy or lossless, has two bit-parallel serial word inputs Xand Xthat are rotated in radians into two outputs Y, and Y. The first output of the 2\u00d72 rotator is the first input weighted by the cosine of the rotating angle adding to the second input weighted by the sine of the same rotating angle. The second output of a 2\u00d72 rotator is the first input weighted by the sine of the same rotating angle subtracted from the second input weighted by the cosine of the same rotating angle. That is, Y, =cos \u03b8X+sin \u03b8Xand Y=cos \u03b8X+sin \u03b8X. An integer lossy 2\u00d72 rotator has two integer outputs for two integer inputs. An integer lossy 2\u00d72 rotator has been implemented using traditional lifting stages. The unweighted input in each lifting stage is always used for addition but not used for subtraction. Rotators have been used in DCT transforms. Rounding errors cannot be cancelled during continuous use of additions in lifting stages. The total rounding error of the traditional lifting method used in prior arts is very large because the accumulation of rounding errors throughout lifting stages. As such, the use of traditional lifting method produces lossy rotators.","Most linear discrete transforms including DCT, produce non-integer coefficients. The DCT coefficients have to be quantized into integers. The rounding off or quantizing of the DCT coefficients into integers cause information loss that can never be completely recovered by inverse transformations. In many applications, it is often desirable to approximate the original linear DCT with a nonlinear DCT that may produce integer outputs from integer inputs, while retaining the reversibility property of a transform. However, this reversibility still suffers of loss of data fidelity during the transformation and inverse transformation processes. Discrete cosine transforms (DCTs) are widely used by JPEG, MPEG and other international data compression standards to perform lossy compressions on digital image, audio, and video data. These compression methods divide the data into blocks, each of which is first transformed by a linear orthogonal transform, such as, the DCT. The DCT matrix consists of real numbers. The DCT outputs are floating point numbers, and the floating point number have to be quantized in order to convert to integers for transform domain processing. Most of the existing integer discrete cosine transforms are either lossy or unfavorably causing the dynamic range of transform coefficients to increase. There is no lossless integer DCT that still retains the transform fidelity as of the floating point DCT. The quantization process will cause information loss in the inverse transform. The DCT has been used by the current international still-image compression standard JPEG for many years. Yet the international still-image compression standard JPEG2000 has adopted the wavelet transforms. The JPEG2000 does not use the Haar wavelet transform. Also, there is no compatibility between the DCT and JPEG2000 standard wavelet transforms. As such, there are no common processes shared by these two transforms.","The modulated lapped transform is a special form of the cosine-modulated subband filter banks. The modulated lapped transform is also called modified discrete cosine transform in MPEG, the international data compression standards for audio and video data. The modulated lapped transform compression method divides the data into windowed overlapped blocks, each of the overlapped portion is first transformed by a linear orthogonal transform, i.e., the type-IV discrete cosine transform (DCT-IV). The coefficients are quantized into integers. The rounding off or quantizing of the modulated lapped transform coefficients into integers causes information loss that can never be completely recovered by inverse transforms. It is desirable to approximate the original linear modulated lapped transform with a nonlinear modulated lapped transform that may produce integer outputs from integer inputs, while retaining the reversibility property of a transform. The window function and the DCT-IV matrix consist of real numbers. The DCT-IV outputs are floating point numbers that have to be quantized in order to convert to integers. The quantization process causes information loss that may never be recovered in the inverse transform. In many applications, it is desirable to approximate the linear modulated lapped transform with a nonlinear transform that produces integer coefficients from which the original integer data can be reconstructed losslessly. Both the DCT-IV and Haar wavelet transform are exact in floating point operations. However, in many applications the inputs are integer-valued data sequences. These DCT-IV transforms and Haar wavelet transforms are approximated by nonlinear transforms producing integer outputs as close as possible to the true outputs, but still include lossy data. These nonlinear operations may be regarded as a quantization process. But the nonlinear transform is reversible while the quantization is nonreversible.","The random numbers generators are used in many applications. Random numbers produced by digital electronic random number generators are not truly random. The resulting random numbers, especially integer random numbers, either have certain correlations between the generated numbers or have some pseudo periodic structures. Typical examples are the pseudo random sequences found in wireless communications systems. The Haar transform cannot be used to accurately decorrelate the pseudo random sequences for use as a random number generator. The Haar transform has been used for data compression and edge detection in medical images. But, the performance of the regular Haar transform is limited by the lack of sufficient decorrelation power of the Haar transform. These and other disadvantages are solved or reduced using the invention.","An object of the invention is to provide a system for generating lossless DCT-II transform data.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system for generating lossless DCT-IV transform data.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide a system for generating lossless extended Haar transform data.","Still another object of the invention is to provide a shared Haar transform for use with appended transform for collectively providing lossless DCT-II transform.","Still another object of the invention is to provide a shared Haar transform for use with appended transform for collectively providing lossless DCT-IV transform.","Still another object of the invention is to provide a shared Haar transform for use with appended transform for collectively providing lossless extended Haar transform.","A further object of the invention is to provide an extended Haar transform for decorrelating digitally generated pseudo random numbers.","The invention is directed to forming lossless transforms including DCT-II, DCT-IV, and extended Haar transforms. A shared Haar transform is used as a front-end transform, and an appended transform is used as a back end-transform. The front-end and back-end combine as a complete transform. In the preferred forms, a first aspect is directed to a DCT-II appended transform, a second aspect is directed to a DCT-IV append transform, and a third aspect is directed to an extended Haar transform. All three aspects of the inventions cover the use of the front-end shared Haar transform. The shared Haar transform is also called the Sequential transform or S-transform. The S-transform includes word pair-wise rotators that can be factored into lifting steps.","The first aspect of the invention is directed to a nonlinear discrete cosine transform type-II (DCT-II) that produces integer outputs from which the original integer data can be reconstructed losslessly. The lossless DCT-II is configured as a cascade connection of the front-end shared Haar transform having many word pair-wise rotations and a backend appended DCT-II transform. The integer-to-integer lossless DCT-II and the shared integer-to-integer lossless Haar transform are cascaded. That is, the lossless Haar transform is an integral front-end part of the lossless DCT-II. The shared integrated integer-to-integer lossless Haar transform and appended DCT-II transforms are implemented by using a nonlinear lifting stages for providing accurate floating-point operations. The nonlinear lifting stages are reversible. As such, the resultant DCT-II transform is perfectly lossless during forward and inverse transformations.","The second aspect of the invention is directed to a nonlinear type-IV discrete cosine transform (DCT-IV) that produces integer outputs from which the original integer data can be reconstructed losslessly. The lossless DCT-IV is also configured as a cascade connection of the shared lossless Haar transform. The appended lossless DCT-IV and shared Haar transform are combined to form a lossless DCT-IV transform. The integrated integer-to-integer lossless Haar transform and DCT-IV transform are implemented by using nonlinear lifting stages.","In a third aspect of the invention, the shared Haar transform and an appended Haar transform are combined into an extended Haar transform. The extended Haar transform increases the decorrelation power. The extended Haar transform is a cascade connection of two Haar transforms, the shared and appended Haar transforms. The shared Haar transforms uses fix angular word pair-wise rotations whereas the extended Haar transform uses adaptive angular word pair-wise rotations. Using nonlinear lifting methods, the integer-to-integer extended Haar transform becomes lossless due to the reversibility of the integer-to-integer Haar transform and the adaptive word pair-wise rotations. These and other advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","An embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the figures using reference designations as shown in the figures. Referring to , an input set of eight integer image data samples from input buffer  is passed on to the next processing stage in consecutive word pairs.

Simultaneously, input words one and three of latch A  latch on the two rotated outputs from PU . The latch A  serves to permute input words to latched words by mere wire routing. Input words two and four of latch A  latch on the two rotated outputs from PU . Input words five and seven of latch A  latch on the rotated outputs from PU .

The rotating angle of PU is 3\u03c0\/16 radians. The rotated outputs from PU , PU , and PU  are respectively connected to the input word pairs two and three, four and five, and six and seven of the DCT output buffer . The latch A  and latch B  are used for buffering and word permutation. The output data from the DCT output buffer  is the lossless DCT-II transformed data.","Referring to , the Haar output buffer  passes on eight integer output data from the shared forward Haar transform to latch C  with sign changes on data words six and eight, denoted by dashed lines. The latch C  is used for permuting and buffering of the shared forward Haar transformed data from the Haar output buffer. The latch outputs are sent to block processing unit  for processing with two parallel fourth-order lossless DCT-IV transforms. The DCT-IV transformed outputs from the block processing unit are passed on to processing units, PU , PU , PU , and PU . The processing units PU , PU , PU , and PU  are lossless 2\u00d72 rotators. The rotating angle of PU  is \u03c0\/32 radians, of PU  is \u03c0\/16 radians, of PU  is 3\u03c0\/32 radians, and of PU  is \u03c0\/8 radians. The outputs from the processing units PU , PU , PU , and PU  are sent to the DCT-IV output buffer . The output data in the DCT-IV output buffer is the lossless DCT-IV transformed data.","Referring to , the Haar output buffer  passes on eight integer output data from the shared forward Haar transform to processing units, PU , PU , PU , and PU . The processing units PU , PU , PU , and PU are identical lossless 2\u00d72 rotators. Each of the rotating angles in PU , PU , PU , and PU  is precalculated from the two inputs. The latch E  latches on the rotated outputs from PU , PU , PU , and PU , then sent to processing units PU , PU , PU , and PU  in word pairs. Each of the processing units PU , PU , PU , and PU  has a specific rotating angle that is precalculated from the two inputs. The extended Haar output buffer  latches on the rotated outputs of PU , PU , PU , and PU .","Referring to , a processing unit comprises of three integer-to-integer lifting stages. The integer inputs, IN- and IN-, from the input buffer  are fed into the first lifting stage, comprising a processing pipeline unit PL-A  and an adder . The first input IN- to the first lifting stage is weighted by a weighting constant that is one minus the sine of a rotating angle divided by the cosine of the rotating angle at PL-A . At adder , the second input IN- is added to the integer round-off of the weighted output from PL-A . The second lifting stage  comprises of a processing pipeline unit PL-B  and an adder . The inputs to the second lifting stage  are the outputs from the first lifting stage . The first output of the first lifting stage  is passed on to adder  with a sign change. The second input to the second lifting stage  is passed on to the second output of the second lifting stage without change. The second output of the first lifting stage  from adder  is weighted by a second constant, that is, the cosine of the rotating angle, at PL-B . At adder , the first output of the first lifting stage  is subtracted from the integer round off of the weighted output from PL-B . The first output of the second lifting stage  is the integer round off of the weighted second input subtracting the first input. The weighting constant is the cosine of the rotating angle. The third lifting stage  comprises of a pipeline processing unit PL-C  and an adder . The inputs to the third lifting stage  are the outputs from the second lifting stage . The first input of the third lifting stage  is passed on to the second output Out- of the third lifting stage  without change. The first input of the third lifting stage  is weighted by a weighting constant that is one minus the sine of the rotating angle divided by the cosine of the rotating angle at PL-C . At adder , the integer round-off of the PL-C  output is subtracted from the second input of the third lifting stage . The first output Out- of the third lifting stage  is the integer output of adder . Both outputs Out- and Out- of the third lifting stage  are buffered at output buffer .","Referring to , the design of a processing unit is based on a three-stage lifting transform comprising three lifting stages, the first lifting stage , the second lifting stage , and the third lifting stage . The electronic circuit is a parallel pipeline with data flow arranged in word serial and bit parallel format. Three multiplying constants, p, c, and (\u2212p), are respectively stored in read only memory (ROM) , ROM , and ROM  in canonic signed digital codes. The constant c is the cosine of the rotating angle. The constant p is equal to one minus sine of the rotating angle divided by the cosine of the rotating angle. In two's complement, the first input data IN- from the input buffer  is multiplied to the canonic signed digit codes of p in ROM  by the first pipelined multiply-add unit PMA-  in the first lifting stage . In the same PMA-  unit the multiplied result is added to the second input data IN- from the input buffer  in two's complement form. The pipelined multiply-add unit, having many levels of arrays of carry and save adders, and an array of carry look-ahead adders with an output latch at the output end of the pipelined multiply-add unit, performs array multiplications and additions in the same unit. The number of pipelined multiply-add unit levels depends on the bit length of each data involved in multiplication and addition operations. At the same time instant that PMA-  begins processing, the first latch FF-  latches on the first input IN-. A common data ready signal is used to delatch the PMA-  latch and the FF-  latch, so that both outputs from PMA-  and FF-  can simultaneously flow to the second lifting stage . The output from PMA-  is multiplied to the canonic signed digit codes of c in ROM  by the second pipelined multiply-add unit PMA-  in the second lifting stage . In the same PMA-  unit the multiplied result subtracts the output of FF-  in two's complement form. At the same time instant that PMA-  begins processing, the second latch FF-  latches on the output of PMA- . A common data ready signal is used to delatch the PMA-  latch and the FF-  latch, so that both outputs from PMA-  and FF-  can simultaneously flow to the third lifting stage . The output from PMA-  is multiplied to the canonic signed digit codes of (\u2212p) in ROM  by the third pipelined multiply-add unit PMA-  in the third lifting stage . In the same PMA-  unit the multiplied result is added to the output of FF-  in two's complement form. At the same time instant that PMA-  begins processing, the third latch FF-  latches on the output of PMA- . A common data ready signal is used to delatch the PMA-  latch and the FF-  latch, so that both outputs from PMA-  and FF-  can simultaneously flow to the output buffer . The output from PMA-  is the OUT- in the output buffer . The output from FF-  is the OUT- in the output buffer .","In the three lifting stages, multipliers are replaced by binary shifts and additions for improved operational speed. Integer arithmetic operations such as additions, subtractions, and shifts of binary numbers are used according to the lifting algorithm to give accurate results for a lossless 2\u00d72 rotation. The implementations of the Haar, extended Haar, DCT-II, and DCT-IV transforms includes the 2\u00d72 rotator, referred to as processing units. A three-stage lifting method is used to reduce the four multiplications in a 2\u00d72 rotator into three multiplications. Thus, a lossless 2\u00d72 rotator for integer inputs comprises of three integer-to-integer lifting stages. In the first lifting stage, the second integer output of the first lifting stage is the second integer input of the lossless 2\u00d72 rotator adding to the integer round-off of the weighted first integer input of the lossless 2\u00d72 rotator. The first integer output of the first lifting stage is the same first integer input of the lossless 2\u00d72 rotator. In the second lifting stage, the first integer output of the second lifting stage is the integer round-off of the weighted second integer output of the first lifting stage subtracting off the first integer output of the first lifting stage. The second integer output of the second lifting stage is the same second integer output of the first lifting stage. In the third lifting stage, the second integer output of the third lifting stage being the first integer output of the lossless 2\u00d72 rotator is the weighted first integer output of the second lifting stage adding to the second integer output of the second lifting stage. The first integer output of the third lifting stage being the second integer output of the lossless 2\u00d72 rotator is the same first integer output of the second lifting stage. The weighting constant in the first lifting stage is one minus the sine of the rotating angle divided by the cosine of the rotating angle. The weighting constant in the second lifting stage is the cosine of the rotating angle. The weighting constant in the third lifting stage is the sine of the rotating angle minus one divided by the cosine of the rotating angle.","Referring to , the block processing unit, comprising three integer-to-integer lifting stages, is to perform a 2\u00d72 lossless vector rotation. The vector has four integer data that are processed in parallel. The two sets of integer inputs, IN(-) and IN(-), from the input buffer  are fed into the first lifting stage, comprising a block processing unit DCT-IV-A  and an adder . The first set of inputs, IN(-), is fed into the block processing unit DCT-IV-A  for performing a 4\u00d74 DCT-IV transform. The transformed data are rounded off into integers before adding to the second set of inputs IN(-) at adder . The inputs to the second lifting stage are the outputs from the first lifting stage. The second lifting stage comprises of a block processing unit DCT-IV-B  and an adder . The first output set of the first lifting stage is passed on to adder  with a sign change. The second output set of the first lifting stage is the second input set to the second lifting stage that is passed on to the second output of the second lifting stage without change. The second output set of the first lifting stage is also fed into the block processing unit DCT-IV-B  for performing a 4\u00d74 DCT-IV transform. The transformed data are rounded off into integers before subtracting the first output set of the first lifting stage, IN(-) at adder . The third lifting stage comprises of a block processing unit DCT-IV-C  and an adder . The inputs to the third lifting stage are the outputs from the second lifting stage. The first input of the third lifting stage is passed on to the second output OUT(-) of the third lifting stage without change.

The first output set of the third lifting stage is the integer input set, OUT(-), in the output buffer . The second output set of the third lifting stage is the integer input set, OUT(-), in the output buffer .","Referring to all Figures, a radix-2 decimation-in-time DCT algorithm is used to decompose the ordinary DCT into a cascade structure consisting of, as the first part, a Haar wavelet transform and, as the second part, a pair of lower-order DCTs followed by a rotation operation.
