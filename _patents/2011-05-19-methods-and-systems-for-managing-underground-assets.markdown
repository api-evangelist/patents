title: Methods and systems for managing underground assets
abstract: Systems and methods for managing underground assets are disclosed. One or more computing devices may be used to receive a request for clearance to excavate including a location identifier, resolve a location based on the location identifier, and retrieve asset data corresponding to the location from an asset location database. The asset location database can include location data regarding the positions of a plurality of assets associated with a plurality of different asset owners and may be maintained by one or more updates regarding the positions of assets from computing devices associated with the different asset owners. The systems and methods can include determining if one or more assets are buried proximate the location based on the retrieved data and transmitting data related to the determination of assets buried proximate the location.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION DATA","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to Indian Patent Application No. 1192\/CHE\/2011, filed Apr. 7, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Many assets, such as utility lines (e.g., power, gas, water, sewage, communication, military\/security, etc.) and other infrastructure assets owned by both government and private enterprises, are buried underground. When excavating (e.g., digging, grading, demolishing, cultivating, augering, blasting, boring, and the like), excavation equipment and underground assets that the excavator may not know were present can be damaged. Such damage may cause a disruption of service to customers, expensive repairs, and costly litigation, all of which can additionally lead to loss of reputation for the excavator. In extreme cases, such accidents may even lead to injury or death.","Before excavating, in some areas an excavator may submit a dig ticket to a call center requesting clearance to excavate at a specific location. Indeed, in many regions, excavators are required by law to submit dig tickets and receive approval before excavating. The call center receiving the dig tickets is generally in communication with various asset owners and must contact the asset owners to determine if there are underground assets at each excavation location. If there are no underground assets within a determined proximity of each excavation location, the dig ticket may simply be approved, thereby allowing the excavator to excavate at the excavation location. However, if there are underground assets proximate (e.g., within a determined buffer zone) of the excavation location, a locator may need to travel to the excavation location and mark the location of the underground assets to allow the excavator to avoid excavating within a buffer zone of any underground asset.","Generally, implementations employ one of two variants of this system. In the first variant, the call centers employ Geographic Information System (\u201cGIS\u201d) systems that include land based data (e.g., map information) and underground asset data mapped to each other. Each call center generally employs an independent GIS system. However, underground asset data is often not up to date even though each call center may frequently check with the several underground asset owners (e.g., utilities and government offices) for record maintenance. Additionally, land based data in GIS systems may be out of date if not constantly updated. Thus, even though a call center may try to keep their GIS system current, conventional GIS systems may fail to reflect recent changes in either land based data or underground assets data, leading to excavators damaging underground assets. In the second variant, a GIS system may be individually maintained by each asset owner (utilities, etc.) and a call center may only dispatch the excavation request to these asset owners who in turn will determine if the excavation affects their assets. Thus, in the second variant, the call center only acts as a conduit between the excavator and asset owners.","Further, in much of the world, addressing of parcels of land is inconsistent or nonexistent and many excavators may not have access to sophisticated sensing equipment such as Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d) sensors. This often makes it difficult for a call center to locate an excavation location indicated on a dig ticket even on their GIS system. Even if the excavation location can be found on the GIS system, it may be difficult for a locator to travel to the excavation location to manually expect the excavation location or to mark the location of underground assets.","While systems and methods are described herein by way of example and embodiments, those skilled in the art recognize that systems and methods for managing underground assets are not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood that the drawings and description are not intended to be limiting to the particular form disclosed. Rather, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Any headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used herein, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201cincludes\u201d mean including, but not limited to.","Disclosed embodiments provide computer-implemented methods and systems for managing underground assets. These methods and systems may improve accuracy, correctness, and vintage of map, address, and asset location data. By reducing the number of dig tickets which require a locator to travel to the excavation location, the majority of the tickets can be resolved automatically without requiring a field visit, which may reduce the overall cost of ownership and maintenance of these systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","104","103","105","106","101","101","105"]},"UAMS  may receive asset location information from one or more asset owners . The asset location information may include geographic location coordinates of the asset (e.g., latitude and longitude of one or more points on the asset), geometric reference of line assets (like telecom lines, power lines, gas pipes, etc), burial depth (e.g., depth below the ground level or altitude in relation to mean sea level), type of asset (e.g., gas line, telecommunication cable, septic tank, etc.), area to be buffered surrounding the asset, and the like. UAMS  may then map the underground assets to current land based data. UAMS  may maintain current asset location information by periodically (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) sending a request to asset owners  requesting updates of asset location information that has changed. For example, each one of asset owners  may provide an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to allow UAMS  to directly request updated asset location information. Of course, data may be transmitted via interfaces other than APIs. Alternatively, each one of asset owners  may automatically send updates to asset location information as the asset location information changes. Asset owners  may be motivated to keep all asset location information stored by UAMS  current to ensure that newly buried asserts are not damaged by excavation.","UAMS  may also maintain current land based information. UAMS  may periodically receive current land based data from one or more land based data sources , such as ESRI\u2122, GOOGLE\u2122, NASA\u2122, and others. UAMS  may, for example, store land based data in a central database and update the land based data as one or more providers of land based data update their data. UAMS  may further be configured to determine the most accurate land based data provided by various sources. For example, if land based data from plural sources are inconsistent, UAMS  may include a set of rules to determine the accuracy of the various sources. A set of rules may include, for example, a consistency check based on metadata provided by data provider. Through custom built algorithms, UAMS  may check data formats, coordinate systems, coordinate numbers of features and feature classes, and the like in addition to visual checking (e.g., edge matching) on different data sources. For example, if land based data from three sources are consistent with each other and a fourth source is anomalous, UAMS  may determine that only the consistent land based data should be used. Alternatively, if land based data from one data source has been updated more recently than others, the most recently updated land based data should be used. Of course, other rules may also be applied. UAMS  may also be configured to alert a user of potential inconsistencies between data sources so that the user can confirm the correct data.","Alternatively, rather than maintaining current land based information UAMS  may be configured to request land based information for an area from land based sources  and for assets from asset owners  in response to receipt of a dig ticket. Such embodiments may require UAMS  to store less data, but may require additional processing in response to receipt of a dig request.","UAMS  may map the underground assets to the land based data. Because both the underground asset locations and the land based data may be maintained up-to-date, UAMS  may always maintain an up-to-date mapping of the underground assets to the land based data.","UAMS  may receive a dig request from an excavator  specifying an excavation location at which the excavator would like to excavate. An excavator  may provide an excavation location in various ways, as described in detail below. UAMS  may determine if there are any underground assets within a determined proximate distance of the excavation location. If no underground assets are found to be proximate the excavation location, UAMS  may confirm to the excavator that there are no underground assets proximate the excavation location. Alternatively, if there are underground assets proximate the excavation location, UAMS  may automatically generate a locate ticket for a locator  to travel to the excavation location to manually determine if there are underground assets and\/or to mark the location of underground assets. A locator  may provide information back to UAMS  relating to the excavation location, for example if a locator  uses a sensor to confirm the location of an asset and also finds an additional asset that UAMS  was not aware of, for example due to delays in updating data, due to unauthorized burying, or due to classified governmental activities, a locator  may provide location information to UAMS  about the additional asset and UAMS  may add the additional assets to their mapped land based and underground asset data.","UAMS  may additionally be operatively coupled to one or more regulatory agencies . For example, regulatory agencies  may restrict excavation in some regions or may be required to preauthorize excavation. Thus, UAMS  may request permission to excavate in the excavation location indicated in a dig ticket before granting the dig ticket. Alternatively, UAMS  may provide periodic information to a regulatory agency  for record keeping purposes.","Thus, system  provides a single centralized UAMS . Beneficially, asset owners may rely on the centralized UAMS  by simply transmitting their updated asset data rather than having to maintain their own costly independent systems. Additionally, system  may be much less expensive to maintain in general because economy of scale distributes the cost of a singe centralized UAMS  unlike several individual call in centers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["201","101","210","121","122","123","124","201","201"]},"Web server  may be one or more computing devices. Web server  may store land based data and underground asset data on a local storage device or may be operatively coupled to one or more database server  configured for storing and\/or mapping land based data with underground asset data. One or more additional computing devices  may perform additional services, for example load balancing, caching, and the like. Of course, while plural servers such as web server , database server , and additional computing devices  may provide an Underground Asset Management System as shown in the architecture of , in alternative embodiments the system may be provided by a single computing device, a cloud computing architecture, or any other computing architecture. Server computing devices, such as web server , database server , and additional computing devices  may be separated from other networked computing devices by a firewall , thereby increasing the integrity of the system.","One or more data sources  may transmit land based data or underground asset data to web server . Data sources  may include companies providing land based data (e.g., maps and other geographic data), such as ESRI\u2122, GOOGLE\u2122, NASA\u2122, as well as others. For example, UAMS  may use ArcGIS\u2122 JavaScript API version 1.3 for displaying a base map, displaying a given address on the base map, buffering a specific area around the address, and querying the buffered area to check of any underground asset is present and may use GOOGLE\u2122 MAPS JavaScript API version 2 for displaying the GOOGLE\u2122 STREETVIEW for the given address. Of course, other combinations of data sources  may be implemented. Data sources  may also include asset owners or other entities providing underground asset data, such as utilities or government entities. Data sources  may periodically update their data and may send updated data to web server  after each update. For example, a utility may transmit updated data to web server  after a new communication line is buried, the data including information such as the location of the line. Alternatively, web server  may request updated information from data sources  periodically, for example on a regular schedule or in response to a dig request for a particular location. Requests may be in a proprietary format dictated by each data source , may be in a format compatible with an API for each data source , or may be in any other format. As shown, data sources  transmit data to web server  via network , however in alternative architectures data sources  may transmit data to web server  via other routes, for example by physically transmitting storage media (e.g., DVDs or other non-transitory media) having the data stored thereon. Data sources  may provide complete land based and asset data to web server  or may transmit only updated land based and\/or asset data as the data changes over time. Data sources  may thus provide dynamic and live updates to web server .","Web server  may be configured to map the asset data to the land based data. Thus, web server  may provide a consolidated mapping of underground assets from plural asset owners to land based data. Additionally, by receiving periodic updates, web server  may maintain up-to-date mapping of underground assets to land based data. Web server  may provide a unified view of both the land based data and the asset data, such as a map showing all underground assets in an area. For example, a program accessing data from web server  may display a user navigable map showing all underground assets in an area. Alternatively, a browser may access a website hosted by web server  for displaying a user navigable map showing all underground assets in an area. Of course, these user interfaces may additionally provide for receipt of dig tickets from excavators, transmission of locate tickets for display to locators, receipt of various asset location information from locators, updates to land based data sources or asset owners, and the like.","In addition to mapping underground assets to land based data, embodiments may also map landmark data to the land based data and underground asset data. Landmark data may include any distinguishable structure on a map or landscape. Thus, landmarks do not need to be famous, such as the Eifel Tower, but may be any structure with distinguishable features, such as a house or a tree. For example, landmark data may be received by web server  that indicates where various landmarks are in a region. The landmark data may be mapped to the land based data. Because the underground assets are also mapped to the land based data, the location of underground assets may also be mapped in relation to various landmarks. Thus, a dig ticket may be received indicating an excavation location in relation to one or more landmarks rather than, or in addition to, the geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) and the system may determine whether there are underground assets in the excavation location. Thus, dig tickets may be more reliably processed for excavators who do not have ready access to survey equipment, such as GPS sensors, and may not have address information for the excavation location, for example in developing countries.","Alternatively, asset owners may transmit underground asset data giving the location of an asset relative to a landmark rather than, or in addition to, other location information (e.g., geographic coordinates) and the system may map the underground assets to the land based data based on the mapping of landmarks to the land based data. This may improve the accuracy of mapping of assets, especially in areas or countries where sophisticated surveying equipment, such as equipment using GPS sensors, may not be readily available.","In addition to transmitting landmark information, basic location information, such as a town or other geographic region, may be transmitted to web server  as well. By reducing the size of the geographic region (i.e., by specifying a town or other geographic region), web server  may reduce the number of potential landmarks to recognize, thus increasing accuracy of landmark recognition and decreasing resource usage.","Web server  may also provide various geocoding and reverse geocoding services. For example, web server  may resolve a geographic coordinate (e.g., latitude and longitude) from information such as an address, a reference to one or more landmarks (e.g., distance from and position relative to a single landmark), imagery, and the like. This may be useful for receiving dig tickets when an excavator can provide an address for an excavation location but cannot provide geographic coordinates. Web server  may also provide information relating to addresses, landmarks, imagery, and the like when provided with a geographic coordinate. This may be useful for a locator to travel to an excavation location to inspect or to mark the location of underground assets.","Embodiments may provide geocoding services to match the address of either an asset's location or a dig request to a geographic coordinate. For example, web server  may include address data cross-referenced with locations on the land based data. Thus, when web server  receives address information, web server  may resolve the geographic coordinates for the address. Alternatively, web server  may query a separate service to resolve an address location. For example, an API request may be made to a geocoding API, such as those provided by YAHOO\u2122 or GOOGLE\u2122, to resolve the geographical coordinates associated with an address. Of course, web server  may be configured to receive addresses in varying forms according to country and custom. For example, an address in the United States may be provided in the format of an address line, a county and\/or city, and state, or in the format of an address line and a ZIP code. Embodiments may also provide their own database to provide geocoding services.","For example, a custom locate function may invoke a method for locating an address on a map. The custom locate function may search a received address in one or more candidate search engines, for example those provided by GOOGLE\u2122 MAPS, MICROSOFT\u2122 BING\u2122 MAPS, ArcGIS\u2122 online services, and the like. For example, if a user inputs an address having a house number along with a street name, a custom locate function may be configured to show the address on the map if the exact address is found. The following is exemplary pseudo code for displaying a location on the map using a symbol if the address is found (i.e., the address has a candidate score of 100).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"if (candidate.attributes.Loc_name == \u201cStreet_Address\u201d) {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"if (candidate.score == 100) {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"var infoTemplate = new esri.InfoTemplate(\u201cLocation\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cAddress:"]},{"entry":[{},"${address}<br \/>Score: ${score}<br \/>Source locator:"]},{"entry":[{},"${locatorName}\u201d);"]},{"entry":[{},"var attributes = { address: candidate.address,"]},{"entry":[{},"score:candidate.score,"]},{"entry":[{},"locatorName:candidate.attributes.Loc_name };"]},{"entry":[{},"----------------------------------------"]},{"entry":[{},"-------------------------------------------"]},{"entry":[{},"----------------------------------------------"]},{"entry":[{},"points.addPoint(candidate.location);"]},{"entry":[{},"myMap.graphics.add(graphic);"]},{"entry":[{},"map.setExtent(points.getExtent( ).expand(3));"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In other instances, an address may include a street name but not house number.

To do this, the function may get the returned addresses having a location name attribute as the street address and parse through a results array until the minimum and maximum house numbers on the street are retrieved from the array list. The function may then geocode the address of the minimum house number and of every twentieth house member thereafter until 100 house numbers more than the maximum house number is reached. This may ensure that house numbers after the maximum house number are retrieved from the array and included in case they are present.

For example, a dig ticket may indicate the address of an excavation location as well as the fact that the excavation location is located forty-five feet north and sixty feet east of the south-west most point on the addressed property. Thus, web server  may first resolve the geographic coordinates of the address then resolve the specific geographic coordinates of the excavation location.","Reverse geocoding may be useful for locate tickets. For example, while the geographic coordinates of an excavation location may be useful for determining if underground assets are mapped to land based data at that location, a locate ticket's indication to a locator that an excavation location is located at a specific latitude and longitude may be less useful than an address. Thus, web server  may be configured to resolve a geographic location to an address in similar fashion to how it resolves an address to a geographic location.","Embodiments may also combine actual imagery of a location where an asset is buried with land based data. For example, land based data may be integrated with images provided by asset owners indicating the location of underground assets. Alternatively, images may be integrated with land based data from third parties, such as those provided by GOOGLE\u2122 STREETVIEW\u2122. For example, an excavator may transmit, along with a dig request for an excavation location, geographic coordinates for the location or an address for a location. As described above, web server  may then resolve the excavation location and determine if underground assets are present. In some cases, web server  may issue a locate ticket to send a locator to the excavation location, for example to inspect or to mark the location of underground assets. To assist the locator, web server  may resolve an image of the location and transmit it to the locator to assist the locator with finding the excavation location. Web server  may, for example, transmit a request to the GOOGLE\u2122 MAPS\u2122 API requesting one or more images (e.g., an image facing north, south, east, and west) taken from the excavation location. Web server  may then receive the images and transmit them to the locator's computing device, for example a smartphone .","Additionally, or in the alternative, after receiving a dig ticket from an excavator, web server  may resolve the excavation location, retrieve one or more images of the excavation location, and transmit one or more images of the excavation location to the excavator to confirm accuracy of the resolved location. For example, web server  may receive an address for an excavation location with a dig ticket, for example transmitted by an excavator's smartphone . Web server  may then resolve the excavation location based on the address. Web server  may then retrieve one or more images of the excavation location, for example by transmitting a request to the GOOGLE\u2122 MAPS\u2122 API for a STREETVIEW\u2122 image of the location or at the address. Web server  may then receive one or more images of the excavation location and transmit them back to the excavator's smartphone  for confirmation of the excavation location. Additional information may be transmitted as well, for example indicating the angle from which the image was taken.","Aerial imagery may also be combined with land based data. For example, imagery from satellites or from Unmanned Arial Vehicles (\u201cUAVs\u201d) may be mapped to the land based data. Alternatively, aerial imagery data may be integrated with land based data from third parties, such as those provided by GOOGLE\u2122 EARTH\u2122. For example, an excavator entering a dig ticket may indicate an excavation location on a user interface showing aerial images of the region surrounding the dig location. Alternatively, an excavator may transmit a dig ticket by providing other information, such as geographic coordinates, an address, or any combination thereof, and web server  may retrieve an aerial image of the dig location and transmit it to the excavator for confirmation of the accuracy of the excavation location. Aerial imagery may also be useful for identifying landmarks proximate an excavation location on a dig ticket.","Aerial imagery may also be useful for locate tickets. For example, in addition to other excavation location information, such as an address or geographic coordinates, a locator may be transmitted one or more aerial images of the excavation location. The image may assist the locator with locating of the excavation location.","Embodiments may also provide geocoding services that resolve a location to a geographic coordinate based on imagery. For example, an excavator may transmit one or more images of the landscape along with the dig ticket to web server . Web server  may execute image recognition software configured to recognize if the received landscape corresponds to a landscape image associated with a location on land bases data. For example, the landscape may be compared with a database of landscape images associated with land based data or may be compared with images from GOOGLE\u2122 STREETVIEW\u2122. Alternatively, web server  may access a third party's image recognition software, for example through an API provided by KOOABA\u2122 or GOOGLE\u2122 GOGGLES\u2122. The image may then be recognized as a landscape and compared with a database of landscapes or with remotely hosted landscapes to determine the geographic coordinates.","Further, an image may be recognized as a landmark. In such instances, the geographic coordinates may be determined generally by knowing the location is proximate the landmark which may be recognized as a landmark mapped to land based data. Machine vision technology may be implemented to provide a more precise geographic location based on a derived distance from and direction relative to the landmark. In still other embodiments, GOOGLE\u2122 MAPS API, or another service, may be queried to retrieve the location of a recognized landmark and it can be deduced that the excavation location must be proximate the location of the landmark. Web server  may then transmit a locate ticket to a locator including the image, thereby allowing a locator to determine the excavation location in relation to the landmark.","Of course, any or all of the above disclosed features may be used in combination. For example, an excavator may access a web based application hosted by web server  via a browser on their tablet . The excavator may transmit a dig ticket to web server  including the address of the excavation location as well as a photo of the excavation location taken by a camera on the excavator's tablet . Web server  may send a request to a geocoding server, such as GOOGLE\u2122 MAPS API, to determine the geographic coordinates of the excavation location. Web server  may then determine that there are no underground assets within a determined buffer zone of the excavation area and transmit an indication that the dig ticket is validated back to the excavator's tablet . Alternatively, if assets are within the buffer zone, web server  may transmit a locate ticket to a locator on their smartphone . The locate ticket may, for example include both the address and the image of the excavation location, thereby allowing the locator to confirm the accuracy of the excavation location by confirming that the address matches the image. The locator may travel to the excavation location to manually confirm the automatic validation and\/or to mark any nearby underground assets (e.g., plant flags or stakes, paint the ground, and the like). Web server  may also transmit data relating to the dig request to any government agencies, asset owners, proximate landowners, and the like.","Embodiments may, for example, use ArcGIS\u2122 Server geometry service class to create a buffer.

Likewise, if landmark data is received, then landmark identification methods may be used to resolve the geographic location. Of course, if plural forms of excavation location information are received, such as geographical coordinates, an address, a location description with reference to a landmark, and a photo of the location, the method may check the consistency of the information and implement rules to determine the most likely excavation location.

For example, an automated process may apply a set of rules and determine whether excavation is authorized, whether excavation is authorized with marking, or if excavation is not authorized. Alternatively, a person may review underground asset data mapped to land based data and determine excavation authorization. In some instances where tickers may not be resolved by automatic or manual screening, a locator may be required to travel to an excavation location to determine excavation authorization, for example if land based data and\/or underground asset data appears inconsistent or anomalous at the excavation location.  shows an exemplary UI  showing a map indicating a buffered region  surrounding an underground asset where a user may not be authorized to dig.","In instances where a locator must travel to the excavation location, for example to manually inspect the excavation location or to mark the location of underground assets and buffer regions surrounding underground assets, the system may be configured to generate and transmit a locate ticket . The locate ticket may be transmitted to a locator, for example by sending the locate ticket to an email account, by displaying the locate ticket on a website to be viewed by the locator, by sending the locate ticket to a specific program, and the like. The locate ticket may include a landscape image user interface D, for example from GOOGLE\u2122 STREETVIEW. The locate ticket may be sent to a particular locator, for example to the locator nearest the excavation location or to a locator who is not busy to maximize workflow efficiency. A locator may not be required to respond to a locate ticket and it may be assumed that the locator will travel to the excavation location after receipt of the locate ticket to mark any underground assets. Alternatively, at step  a locator may transmit data back to validate excavation step , such as confirmation of receipt of the locate ticket, confirmation that the dig ticket is authorized, confirmation that the excavation location is marked, and the like. A locate ticket may also include in image of the excavation location, for UI  shows an exemplary navigable interface including an image of an excavation location.","At step , the system may return validation of the dig ticket to the user.
