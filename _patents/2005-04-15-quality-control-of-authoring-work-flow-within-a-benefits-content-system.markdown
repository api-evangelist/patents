title: Quality control of authoring work flow within a benefits content system
abstract: A first change request is generated in a work flow process to implement a first change to a portion of content within the benefits content system. A first status indicator, indicating whether the first change has passed a quality check, is associated with the first change request. A second status indicator, indicating whether the first status indicator should be overridden, is associated with the first change request. The first change request is moved to a next step in the work flow process if the associated first status indicator indicates the first change has passed the quality check. The first change request is moved to the next step in the work flow process if the associated first status indicator indicates the first change has failed the quality check and the associated second status indicator indicates that the first status indicator should be overridden.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to quality control of authoring work flow within a benefits content management the system.","Managing the human resources (HR) and benefits functions of an organization (e.g., a corporation) can be a daunting task. Different benefits plans and policies that the organization offers are stored in different places. Some may be stored electronically and others mechanically. Different departments can be responsible for different benefits, so that an employee has to make several inquiries to different people to obtain answers. To assist an organization, vendors have developed automated software products to centralize and automate the management of the organization's benefits programs. For example, systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,590,037, 5,600,554, 6,505,183, 6,640,216, and 6,633,859 and U.S. Patent Published Application Nos. 2002\/0022982, 2002\/0049617, 2002\/0069077, 2002\/0099659, 2002\/0103680, and 2003\/0101091.","For many organizations, an investment in new and unknown technology is unappealing. These organizations want to focus on what they do best and outsource human resources management to service providers specializing in that area. One survey result indicated that 72 percent of large companies surveyed outsourced at least one HR\/benefits function. Human resource outsourcing (HRO) providers span the spectrum of the scope of services they provide. Some provide information technology (IT) services for the HR function, such as IT strategy, data centers, development of in-house applications, voice and data networks, and help desks. Others provide call centers for employees. Others provide transactional services, such as training and development, benefits record keeping, accounts receivable, tax services, compensation and payroll, and storeroom\/warehouse administration. Others provide all of these services plus other top-level and strategic planning, such as information management, budget forecasting, risk management, and material resource planning (MRP). These service providers provide full service benefits programs outsourcing (BPO). According to another survey, in 2003, the growth in the global full service HRO market was 24%, with annualized revenues of 1.6 billion dollars (US). The amount of employees serviced by full service HRO providers was 2.6 million employees. The average total contract value for transactions for the reported HRO contracts was 215 million dollars.","There are several service providers specializing in providing the management of benefits programs and who are providing full service to these organizations. One example is Fidelity Investments of Boston, Mass. In being a full-service benefits outsourcer, Fidelity Investments provides a Web-based user interface called netBenefits to assist an employer with delivery of the employer's benefits programs to its employees. The netBenefits user interface allows a plan participant (e.g., employee) to access one or more benefits programs (e.g., a 401(k) plan) and obtain self-help to answer questions about the benefits programs (e.g., balance of a 401(k) plan, loan availability, and loan requirements, etc.) and self-service to perform certain transactions associated with the benefits programs (e.g., transfer funds, loan initiation, etc.).","The description describes methods and apparatus, including computer program products, for a benefits content management system. In general, in one aspect there is a computerized method for quality control of authoring work flow within a benefits content system. The method includes generating a first change request in a work flow process to implement a first change to a portion of content within the benefits content system and associating a first status indicator, indicating whether the first change has passed a quality check, with the first change request. The method also includes associating a second status indicator, indicating whether the first status indicator should be overridden, with the first change request, and moving the first change request to the next step in the work flow process if the associated first status indicator indicates the first change has passed the quality check. The method also includes preventing the first change request from moving to the next step in the work flow process if the associated first status indicator indicates the first change has failed the quality check and the associated second status indicator indicates that the first status indicator should not be overridden. The method also includes moving the first change request to the next step in the work flow process if the associated first status indicator indicates the first change has failed the quality check and the associated second status indicator indicates that the first status indicator should be overridden.","Other examples can include one or more of the following features. The next step in the work flow process can include production. Some examples prevent the first change request from being closed while the associated first status indicator indicates the first change has failed the quality check. Some examples prevent the second status indicator to indicate an override of the first status indicator if the associated first status indicator does not indicate the first change has failed a non-critical quality check. Some examples verify the first change to complete the quality check. Some examples associate a second change request in the work flow process to implement a second change to the portion of content with the first change request, and the second change request includes an associated first status indicator indicating that the second change request has passed the quality check. Some examples move the second change request to a next step in the work flow process if the first status indicator associated with the first change request indicates the first change has passed the quality check. Some examples prevent the second change request from moving to the next step in the work flow process if the first status indicator associated with the first change request indicates the first change has failed the quality check and a second status indicator associated with the first change request indicates that the first status indicator should not be overridden, and move the second change request to the next step in the work flow process if the first status indicator associated with the first change request indicates the first change has failed the quality check and the second status indicator associated with the first change request indicates that the first status indicator should be overridden. Some examples verify the second change through quality assurance to complete the quality check.","The first change request and the second change request can be associated by comprising content of a common subject. The second change request can be prevented from moving to production if the first status indicator of the first change request indicates failure and the second status indicator of the first change is not set to override. Some examples automatically transmit an electronic message to an author associated with the first change request in response to the change request having a change in status. The electronic message can be an email. The change in status can include the associated first status indicator being set to indicate that the first change has failed the quality check. Some examples generate a local database associated with an author associated with the first change request, where the local database includes the first change to the portion of content. Some examples associate a location indicator, indicating a location of the first change, with the first change request. The location can include a location of the local database. The location can include a location of a local database associated with a user, wherein the user is co-worker of the author assisting the author with the first change.","In another aspect, there is a computer program product, tangibly embodied in an information carrier, for quality control of authoring work flow within a benefits content system. The computer program product includes instructions being operable to cause data processing apparatus to perform any of the processes described above. In another aspect, there is a system for quality control of authoring work flow within a benefits content system. The system comprises a computing device configured to perform any of the processes described above.","Implementations can realize one or more of the following advantages. As outsourcing continues to grow and more organizations request services from a human resources benefits outsourcer, the benefits content management system is scalable and can easily handle the increase in volume of both viewing content and changing content. The system provides processes to allow multiple-user authoring, allow authors to make decisions about controlling access to related content, control viewing at many different granularities, control the quality of changes to the content while also allowing the change process to progress when certain faults can be tolerated, and indicate pending changes to content being viewed. The system combines many available and existing the systems together to provide the features described herein, and some of those features are a result of having to join different the systems together.","The system can coordinate changes across multiple authors to maintain content consistency, eliminate record locking issues, and prevent authors from overwriting each other's work. The system can control access to changes based on a variety of parameters, keeping changes to content close to the users who own the content. The authoring tools security (e.g., access control) settings carry over into the runtime environment, where users of different experience levels can have different access rights. The system ties the transfer process to a workflow process so that efficiencies can be realized through a systematic schedule of object transfers. The system also links a pending change indication process to the workflow process so that the system can automatically generate a pending change indicator on viewed content when a change request is pending and automatically remove that indicator when a change request is closed. The system also links a quality control process to the workflow process so that automatic notifications can be sent to the applicable users when a change request changes status, eliminating the need for a user to query the system regarding the current status. The quality control process also enables users to decouple failed content, so that other related content changes are not held up, and to allow content with minor problems to move to production without losing an indication that a problem still needs to be addressed.","The system can control the granularity of the content viewed based on the role of the user viewing the content, automatically providing more or less content as the situation requires. Out of the hundreds of benefits programs an outsourcer might manage, the system enables the outsourcer to associate individual employees with specific benefits programs. This also allows multiple plans from the same plan type to be designated as actively enrolled in or available to a single participant. The system also enables sharing of benefits program content across multiple programs to realize efficiencies of scale. One implementation of the invention may provide all of the above advantages.","The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Further features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","1. Overview","This detailed description includes headings to several sections. This first section presents an overview that highlights components included in a benefits content management system. The overview also provides some exemplary roles of different users of the system. The second section of the description describes processes for viewing content in the benefits content management system. These processes highlight the filtering of content based on a user identity and\/or role. The third section of the description describes processes for changing content in the benefits content management system. These processes highlight the allowance of multiple authors changing the content, the indication of pending changes to users of the content, and the quality control used to process changes.","A Benefits Content Management System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","103","100","103","103","103","103"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b "]},"A benefits program refers to a plan (e.g., health\/dental\/life\/disability insurance benefit plan, 401(k) retirement plan), a policy (e.g., policy manual on sexual harassment in the workplace), an event (e.g., having a baby or getting married), etc. The content of a benefits program refers to all of the information used to describe that benefits program. For example, a health insurance benefit plan may apply to a child of an employee that is over 18 as long as the child is registered as a full-time student. The information describing whether such coverage is allowed and the requirements of such coverage constitutes a portion of the content of this health benefit program. The particular sentence or paragraph describing this particular benefit (i.e., coverage of a child over 18) can be referred to as a content element, as this sentence or paragraph description is a portion of all of the content that makes up the complete description of the health insurance benefit. The content element can include both a template, shared across benefits programs and variables that may also be shared across benefits programs or be specific to a single benefit program. The variables can be used to generate content dynamically, and such variables also can be considered part of the content.","Generally, the benefits guide  manages all of the content for a service provider that provides the service of managing content of benefits programs for one or more organizations. The service provider enables employees of an organization to access content related to benefits programs the organization offers, providing access to answers about the benefits programs. The service provider also maintains the accuracy of the data, changing the content when necessary, and maintains the technology (e.g., the system ) required to provide these services. The content management module manages the interface between users of the benefits guide and the repository in which the content is stored. The repository serves as the centralized storage for all of the content and is used to store and access the content of the benefits programs.","Connected to the exemplary repository shown in  there are five databases , , , , and generally referred to as benefits content databases . The database is a defined benefits (DB) database, which stores content of benefits programs related to defined benefits plans (e.g., pension plans). The database is a defined contributions (DC) database, which stores content of benefits programs related to defined contributions plans (e.g., 401(k) plans). The database is a health and insurance (HI) database, which stores content of benefits programs related to health and insurance, such as health insurance programs, dental insurance programs, disability insurance programs, etc. The database is a human resources (HR) and payroll (HRPR) database, which stores content of benefits programs related to the payroll and human resources policies of an organization. The database is a centralized database, which stores content of one or more benefits programs (e.g., defined contributions, defined benefits, heath and insurance, human resource, payroll, etc.). In the system , the content management module accesses the databases  using an access server . The exemplary server  uses a request protocol (e.g., a structured query language (SQL)) that communicates with the databases  using an open standard application programming interface (API) (e.g., open database connectivity (ODBC)) for allowing access to dissimilar proprietary databases. Other examples of the repository can use other database management technologies, such as Java database connectivity (JDBC). Other examples of the request protocol by the exemplary server  may include Web services (e.g. HTTP SOAP requests).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112","112","112","112","103","112","112","103","115","118","115","112","115","115"],"i":["a ","b ","b","a "],"sup":"SM"},"The role of user  is customer support services (CSS). The CSS user  is, for example, a telephone representative that talks to a participant over a telephone network  (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN)). The CSS user  is generally an employee of the service provider and a viewer of the content of one or more benefits programs stored in the repository . The CSS user  views the content to answer questions of a participant . There can be multiple levels of CSS users, for example a junior CSS user and a senior CSS user. These levels can limit how the CSS user interacts with other users and with the system . The CSS user  can access the content management module using a front-end application  that executes locally on a computer  associated with the CSS user . For example, the local application  can be referred to as a benefits workstation. The benefits workstation application  provides a user interface to enable the CSS user  to enter data about the participant (e.g., social security number) and to display the content returned from the content management module based on the entered information. The benefits workstation application  may also automatically receive participant context information (e.g., social security number) from a voice response system (VRS) (not shown) and pass that information to the content management module to display appropriate content. In one example, the benefits workstation application  is a portal application and communicates with the content management module using application communication technologies (e.g., a client\/server paradigm or a Web-based client paradigm). If the CSS user  notices an error in content (e.g., a typographical error) while answering a question for a participant, the CSS user  can notify another user to make a change. For example, the CSS user  can notify a service delivery specialist (SDS) user .","The SDS user  is generally an employee of the service provider and a viewer of the content of one or more benefits programs stored in the repository . The SDS user  views the content to verify the errors found by the CSS user . The SDS user  can access the content management module using the benefits workstation application  that executes locally on a computer  associated with the SDS user . In some examples, the SDS user  can initiate a request to change a portion of the content. The system  includes or communicates with a workflow process (e.g., , ) to track a request for a change to a portion of content. The SDS user  serves as a liaison between the CSS user  and a client service manager (CSM) user . In such a situation, the SDS user  communicates with the CSS user  and the CSM user  until a change request is resolved (e.g., change is incorporated into content or change request is closed as not being needed).","The CSM user  is generally an employee of the service provider and a viewer of the content of one or more benefits programs stored in the repository . The CSM user  may view the content by accessing through the benefits workstation application  or by accessing the content management module directly, in which case the module applies security restrictions to limit access to particular benefits programs or subsets of content elements. The CSM user  views the content to verify that the content is accurate according to a client . The client  is a representative of an organization (e.g., an employer) to which the service provider provides the content management services. The CSM user  can initiate a request to change a portion of the content and view and\/or change the status of pending change requests in the workflow process. Because the CSM user  has a direct relationship with the client , the CSM user  typically is involved in the approval process of a change request for content associated with that user .","The roles of users and are as content authors, generally referred to as the authors . The authors  are generally employees of the service provider. The authors  have direct access to the content management module so that they can generate and maintain the content of the benefits programs stored in the repository . The authors  also generate and maintain templates that can include both static content and logic to generate dynamic content. The authors  also generate and maintain logic to incorporate business rules that can trigger specific content based on client, participant, or benefits program data (e.g., variables).","The role of user  is a systems support and development (SSD) user. The SSD user  is generally an employee of the service provider. The SSD user  maintains the technology of the system . In other words, the SSD user  configures, tests, debugs, and upgrades the hardware and software components of the system . The SSD user  can also generate applications needed to integrate the different components, some of which can be off-the-shelf components of the system . The SSD user  may also perform administrative functions on the system (e.g. setting security access).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","203","206","209","212","203","206","209","212","100","100","203","206","209","212"],"i":["a","a "]},"The modules , , , and  interact with a knowledge base module  and a workflow process . The knowledge module  models the content and enables the use of templates to generate content dynamically using organizational variables. The knowledge module  can be implemented, using for example, one or more of the Authoria Advisor Series products, such as Employee Advisor and\/or Manager Advisor, manufactured by Authoria, Inc. of Waltham, Mass. or one or more of the Vignette suite of products, manufactured by Vignette Corporation of Austin, Tex. The workflow process  tracks changes to the content. The system  shows the use of a workflow process that is external to the content management module and can be used for other enterprise workflows, in addition to tracking the changes to content. The logical view is intended to show the functionality of the content management module and the physical boundaries of the implementation can be different from the logical boundaries shown in the exemplary the system . In some examples, a single server and\/or a single application implement all of the modules , , , and . In other examples, two or more servers and\/or applications implement the modules , , , and , without regard to the logical boundaries shown in . In yet other examples, the knowledge module  can be external to the content management module and\/or the workflow process  can be included in the content management module. For example, Vingette\u00ae of Austin Tex. offers a platform, referred to as Vignette\u00ae V7, that includes a suite of content management products. The Vignette\u00ae V7 products are marketed as a Web content manager, but the platform is adaptable to be incorporated as part of the implementation of the system . For example, the Vignette\u00ae V7 products from Vingette\u00ae of Austin Tex. include a workflow process  and a content modeler  that can be integrated into a single content management solution. The Vignette\u00ae V7 platform also includes a rich set of APIs that enable the modules , , , and  to provide their associated features on top of this platform. Further examples can include any other products that perform in the enterprise content management space, notably Documentum and IBM, which can be adapted as described herein.","Irrespective of the content management tools used to implement the system  (e.g., a combination of products from vendors and custom written software modules written by in-house developers), the content of the system  is modeled in a fashion to implement the processes described herein.  illustrates an exemplary logical diagram  modeling the content included in the system . The diagram  shows that the health and insurance database within the benefits guide repository includes two benefits programs, a health plan  and a dental plan . The content of the health plan  and the dental plan  is modeled by a collection of content elements having certain relationships with other content elements. In the health plan , a content element CE has a relationship R with a content element CE, a relationship R with a content element CE, and a relationship R with a content element CE. The content element CE has a relationship R with a content element CE. Similarly, in the dental plan , a content element CE has a relationship R with a content element CE, a relationship R with a content element CE, and a relationship R with a content element CE. The content elements CE and CE have relationships R and R, respectively, with a content element CE.","A content element is a portion of the content and can be, for example, a sentence, a paragraph, a section of multiple paragraphs, a variable, or some combination of these. The system  can generate a content element using a template. The following examples describe content elements describing the eligibility of dependents and are used in conjunction with  to help illustrate an example of content elements and their relationships. The content element CE represents the following template:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Eligibility of a Dependent"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003If your dependent is under the age of 18, your dependent is eligible "},{"entry":"under your health_plan_name health insurance."},{"entry":"\u2003IF dependent_eligibility_over_18=TRUE,"},{"entry":"\u2003THEN INCLUDE CE2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"This exemplary template includes the variable health_plan_name, the value for which is inserted when the system  generates this content element for viewing. The value for the variable health_plan_name varies by plan. The value for the variable health_plan_name, and any other variables may be retrieved from the centralized content or from one of the record keeping system stores , , , or . Variable values stored in the record keeping system stores may also be used for record keeping and benefits program transactions. For the health plan , the value of the variable health_plan_name is Blue Cross PPO. The exemplary template above is content element CE, so the variable health_plan_name is content element CE and the association between the template and the variable for this plan is the relationship R. The relationship R can be implemented using, for example, a database table. In this example, there can be one or more rows in a table for the health plan  identifying that the content element CE is the template above and the associated value for the variable health_plan_name is Blue Cross PPO. When a variable is used, the content element of the variable (e.g., CE) can also have a relationship (not shown) to a question content element that facilitates content entry by content authors . A question content element is a piece of content that describes what the variable represents, typically in the form of a question. For the CE example, the question content element can be a string of text as follows: WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE HEALTH PLAN? The system  uses these questions when obtaining values for these variables from a user of the system  who enters them, such as the content author or the CSM user .","The CE exemplary template above also includes the variable dependent_eligibility_over 18, the value for which is used by the system  to determine whether the IF condition is met. The value for the variable dependent_eligibility_over18 varies by plan. For the health plan , the value of the variable dependent_eligibility_over18 is TRUE. The exemplary template above is content element CE, so the variable dependent_eligibility_over18 is content element CE and the association between the template and the variable for this plan is the relationship R.

Viewing Content","The system  uses these stored relationships when dynamically generating content for viewing. A benefit of the dynamic generation using variables is that templates can be reused across benefits programs by simply changing the variable values for each program. With so many different benefits programs, the system  includes processes to limit the benefits programs that a particular participant can view. One of the features provided by the viewing filtering module  is filtering benefits programs available to a particular user on an individual basis.","Filtering of Content by a Particular User",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","112","400","403","100","403","406","100","406"],"i":"a"},"For example, the presentation page displayed in the second area  includes a content element  at the top of the page.

Another exemplary mapping rule in the mapping dictionary for benefits programs in the HRPR database is \u201cClient\u2225Practice\u2225Subject\u2225Hourly\/Salary\u2225HighlyComp\u201d. The mapping dictionary also includes a variable mapping portion that maps the variables in the mapping rules to the variables used in the system . In some examples, a system implements the variable mapping as its own separate dictionary.","When the system  receives () a request to view content, the system  also receives a user identifier for the request. The user identifier is based on the role of the user making the request to view some content. For example, the user can be the participant , requesting the information through the Web server . In such an example, the system  authenticates (e.g., receives correct user credentials) the participant . One example identifier is the participant's social security number (SSN). The participant may include this identifier as part of the log-in process or the system  can retrieve the identifier from a participant database (not shown) based on the user credentials. The participant database can be part of the repository or the participant database can be located external to the benefits guide  and accessible to the benefits guide  using a Web services paradigm. In another example, the user making the request is the CSS user  talking to the participant over the phone network . In this example, the CSS user  makes the request using the benefits workstation application . Again, the request includes some identifier to identify the participant , such as a SSN. The system  can determine (e.g., by receiving different parameter values in the requesting URL) whether the request is from the participant using Web server  or the CSS user  using the benefits workstation  and can provide different services depending on the user role. The CSS user  may obtain a broader view than what the participant might be able or want to view or the CSS user  may select a filtered view to limit the view down to what the participant would see.","In response to the received request, the system  retrieves () the applicable mapping rule. In order to retrieve () the applicable mapping rule, the system may need additional information. In one example, the mapping dictionary is organized by client (e.g., employer), practice (e.g., Health & Welfare (database )), and subject (e.g., medical). In this example, the system  uses the participant identifier (e.g., SSN) to determine the client with which this participant is associated. For example, the system  receives a SSN 999-99-9999 as an identifier for a participant who is requesting to view a list of benefits programs (e.g., the list in the first area  of display ). The system  retrieves from the participant database that this participant is an employee of the client ABC Corp. The system  can use an identifier for the client other than the client's name. For example, ABC Corp. can have a client ID of XX8052. Because the request is for a list of all benefits programs, the system  searches for all rules associated with ABC Corp. If this was not the case, e.g., if the request was only for a medical plan, the system  would narrow the search even further to rules applicable to the health and insurance database , where the subject is medical. The system  first finds the rule \u201cClient\u2225Practice\u2225Subject\u2225Status\u2225Plan Type\u2225Plan Code\u201d for client ABC Corp. for the HI () practice for medical plans. Using this rule, the system  determines that the mapping elements for which the system  needs to retrieve values are \u201cEmployee Status\u201d, \u201cPlan Type\u201d, and \u201cPlan\u201d. In other words, because this rule is applicable for client ABC Corp. for the HI () practice for medical plans, the system  already has values for the mapping elements \u201cClient\u201d, \u201cPractice\u201d, and \u201cSubject\u201d.

In one example, the system filters content based on the role of the user viewing the content. As an illustrative example, the participant has accessed her 401(k) plan that the employer provides to initiate a loan. While participant the is attempting to perform this self-help transaction through Web server , she is probably not interested in other content about the 401(k) plan not related to taking out a loan. Even more narrowly, she is probably only interested in the content that corresponds to the specific part of the transaction she is performing at that time. For example, when asked to enter an amount for the loan, she would like to know what the rules are (e.g., minimum of $5,000 and maximum of 50%) for her 401(k) plan. If the participant encounters problems or has questions, she may call the CSS user . The CSS user , to help her resolve her problems and questions, is going to want more of the content than just that related to specific task the participant is performing. For example, the CSS user  may want all of the content related to the employer's 401(k) plan that describes taking out a loan, or the CSS user  may want the content for the entire 401(k) plan. To accomplish this, the system  provides different levels of granularity to view the content of a benefits program.","The system  stores the contents of a benefits program as several content elements. Some content elements have relationships to other content elements. The relationships provide a process to the system  to determine whether changes to one content element may affect another content element. The system  also uses another entity, referred to as a collection, to group content elements together that might be applicable for different roles of users of the system . Using the 401(k) plan example, the content elements for the 401(k) have the granularity so that one or a few content elements are used to describe each transaction that a participant can accomplish on their own using user interface . If a few content elements are used, the system can make this a collection. For example, the transaction where the participant selects an amount might have three content elements that describe that particular transaction. The system  can define (e.g., using a database table) a collection named \u201cSelecting_a_Loan_Amount\u201d that associates the three content elements with that transaction screen. The system  can define a larger collection named \u201cLoan_Requirements\u201d that associates all of the content elements that describe the loan process of that 401(k) plan, including the three content elements in the \u201cSelecting_a_Loan_Amount\u201d collection. The system  can define nested collections, meaning the \u201cLoan_Requirements\u201d collection can include a reference to the \u201cSelecting_a_Loan_Amount\u201d collection, as an alternative to referencing each of the content elements individually.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","100","100","603","100","100","609","100","615","100","621","100","624"]},"If the system  determines () that the role of the particular user is a not a participant, the system  determines () whether the role of the particular user is a CSS. If the user is a CSS, then the system  filters () the collection, for example, based on the help the user is trying to provide. The filtering rule can be that for a particular transaction a participant is attempting, the system  transmits () the entire collection containing that transaction, such as the entire \u201cLoan_Requirements\u201d collection. If the system  determines () that the role of the particular user is a not a CSS, the system  can step () through other roles and apply the predetermined rules established for that role. For example, for a content author, the collection could be filtered by whether that content author is the author of a content element, allowing the content author to view only those content elements in the collection, for which he is an author. The rule for filtering content can also be based on security issues.","In one example implementation, the system  uses a Web services paradigm to retrieve and filter content. In such an example, the collections can be transferred between modules using extensible markup language (XML). The content elements and the collections can also be implemented using objects, where object-oriented technology is employed.","3. Changing Content","In addition to enabling users to view the content in the repository , the system  also enables the content authors  to change the content when problems (e.g., typographical errors) are found and when benefits programs change. When the system  is used to provide the content to participants as an outsourced service to a client (e.g., an organization), the system  includes benefits programs from a large number of different clients. The system  is scalable, so that as the number of clients grows and the content in the repository grows, the number of content authors  and the number of transactions they can accomplish can also grow. The features described below enable this scalability.","Multi-User Authoring","The system  includes the multi-user authoring module  to provide a process to handle multiple authors.  illustrates an exemplary process  to manage multiple authoring in the system . The system  defines () relationships between content elements. As described above (e.g., ), the system  can define relationships between content elements that have a dependency with other content elements. For example, a relationship can be defined when one content element is used in another content element, when a variable is used with a particular content element, and when a question content element for a particular variable is used in a process to obtain a value for a variable. When the content author  wants to make a change to a content element, the system  receives () a request from the content author  identifying the particular content element (e.g., CE). The system  identifies (), e.g., a database lookup, the other content elements with relationships to the content element that the content author  is going to change. For example, if CE () is the content element identified in the request that the content author  wants to change, the system  identifies that CE, CE, CE, and CE have a relationship to CE.","The system  provides () a user interface to the content author  identifying these related content elements and enables the content author  to control the access to these related content elements while the content author  is making the change. In some examples, the system  includes a sub-process  that is performed for each of the related content elements. In sub-process , the system  determines () whether the content author making the change wants to check out the related content element. The system  can determine () this, for example by providing a check box element (e.g., , ) in the user interface that the system  provides (). If the system  determines () that the content author does want to check out the related content element, the system  checks out () the related content element. For example, the system  marks the content element as checked out in the repository and allows access to that content element by the content author making the change. In some examples, the system  makes a copy of the checked out () content element and puts the copy into a working area, such as a local database (e.g., residing on the content author's computer, such as , ), so that the content author can make changes to the local copy. In such examples, the changes to the local copy have to be moved back to a centralized database (e.g.,  ) so that they can be incorporated into repository ","If the system  determines () that the content author does not want to check out the related content element, the system  determines () whether the content author making the change wants to lock the related content element. The system  can determine () this, for example, by providing () a check box element (e.g., , ) in the user interface. If the system  determines () that the content author does want to lock the related content element, the system  locks () the related content element. For example, the system  marks the content element as locked out in the repository and prevents access to that content element by any other content author requesting to make a change to that related content element.","If the system  determines () that the content author does not want to lock the related content element, the system  sets () a warning that is associated with the related content element. For example, the system  marks the content element in the repository with an indicator so that the system  generates a warning when another content author requests to make a change to that related content element.

Also included in the rows are check boxes -, generally referred to as , that enable the content author changing the component \u201cDomestic Partner\u201d to control access to the related content elements in rows , , , and , respectively. In the check boxes -, the content author can select to lock, to warn, and to check out each of the related content elements.","In the user interface , the content author has indicated to the system  that he wants to lock the \u201cDomestic partner documents\u201d (e.g., using the selection button in check box ) and check out \u201cDomestic partner restrictions\u201d (e.g., using the selection button in check box ). Instead of automatically locking or checking out all of the related content elements and preventing access to other content authors, user interface  advantageously enables the content author to prevent access. This way, the content author, who knows what the scope of the change is, can lock only those content elements that the content author knows should be locked due to the particular change. Similarly, the content author only checks out those content elements that he needs to check out to make corresponding changes. In the user interface , the content author has indicated to the system  that he wants to set a warning for the \u201cDomestic partner contact\u201d content element (e.g., using the selection button in check box ) and the \u201cDomestic partner eligible\u201d content element (e.g., using the selection button in check box ). This leaves those content elements available to other content authors, so that other content authors can change those content elements in parallel (e.g., simultaneously).","For the related content elements that the content author checks out, the system  can generate a recursive popup window (e.g., another user interface ) for each included item that is also checked out. In the example above, the system  can spawn another window for the \u201cDomestic partner restrictions\u201d component. If the content author makes modifications to one of the included variables or components, the system  allows the content author to check them in separately. The system  tracks the content elements as a single group to ensure that at the end, the content author checks in all of the related content elements. In one example, when the content author checks in the original component (e.g., \u201cDomestic Partner\u201d), the system  generates an auto check in window (not shown) that requires the author to check in the items (e.g., any related content elements) not previously checked in.

For example, a portion of the database is instantiated locally on a computing device associated with the user so the user can access the source of the content and make the necessary changes. In such examples, the changes have to be moved back to the centralized database accessible to all users so that the process  can be completed. An author  can also incorporate a change (e.g., , ) by making changes directly within the centralized database.","In examples where the workflow process  is a process external to the content management module , the system  uses the quality control module  to serve as an interface between the database management and the workflow process, to ensure that changes are automatically processed when a user completes a modification. The quality control module  generates a user interface that enables the user making the change to notify the quality control module  that the change is completed and ready to be moved back into the centralized database so that the change can be tested () by quality assurance (QA) and moved () to production. For example, the user making the change transfers the modified content to a submit location (e.g., a submit database , ) and then changes the status on the user interface, e.g., using a change request status entry button (e.g., a pull down menu), to a status of \u201cContent Submitted.\u201d The user making the change can also input into the user interface the location indicator (e.g., path name) of the content ready to be submitted. In response to the change in status, the quality control module  queues the changed content for transfer, and moves and integrates the changed content into the centralized database. When the centralized database confirms the transfer, the quality control module  changes the status of the change request to \u201cContent Checked In\u201d. The use of the quality control module  advantageously enables an administrator to review the queue of pending transfers to the centralized database of all of the changed content, which would not be available if each user manually transferred her content back to the centralized database. This review of the queue allows the administrator to manage the queue, (e.g., change priorities, cancel a transfer, and\/or manually effect a transfer).","Indicating Pending Changes to Content","With the processes described above, the system  can have pending changes to content that is being viewed (e.g., by a CSS user  helping a participant). To give the user viewing the content a more complete picture, the system  indicates in the generated view that a change is currently pending for that particular content element.  illustrates a screen shot  that includes an indicator  indicating that the \u201cApproval\u201d section (e.g., the content element that contains that text) has one or more pending changes. This indicator is also referred to as a caution note. The indicator  can also serve as a hyperlink.

The IDB  is in communication with the benefits guide , if it is not part of the repository . The IDB  can include information such as participant information, high-level plan relationship information, client configurations, etc. In the system , the IDB  also includes information about pending changes so that the system  can quickly retrieve the pending change information whenever the system  is generating content for viewing that has a pending change.","The workflow process  includes a workflow process interface module  that allows the BG  to retrieve information from the workflow process  corresponding to certain work items that the workflow process  is handling. For example, the workflow process interface module  can include an API that allows the retrieval of data. The workflow process  is configured to assign work items to certain queues based on a set of rules. The workflow process  includes a communication and education (C&E) queue , a back office queue , a SDS queue , a SIG queue , and a BG operator queue . The workflow process  uses the C&E queue  for work items to be handled by the content authors . The workflow process  uses the back office queue  for work items to be handled by back office personnel (e.g., document scanners). The workflow process  uses the SDS queue  for work items to be handled by the SDS users . The workflow process  uses the service installation group (SIG) queue  for work items to be handled by SIG users (e.g., SIG users are responsible for configuration of DC plan data in BG and in the record keeping system).","The BG operator queue  is not for any particular users, but is used by the BG  to keep track of work items related to the pending changes of content in the BG repository . The workflow process  has a set of rules to determine when work items going to the other queues (e.g., , , , and\/or ) should be copied and sent to the BG queue . For example, if the other queues , , , and\/or  always deal with work items changing content only in the BG repository , then the rule can be to simply copy each work item to the BG queue  as the work item enters into one of the other queues , , , and\/or . If there are other areas the workflow process  is used for, then the rule can be more sophisticated and look at values of certain parameters of the work item to determine if that work item relates to the BG repository .

Similarly, the product ID code (i.e., parameter \u201cPROD_ID_C\u201d) is a parameter that the workflow process rule can use when determining whether to send the work item to the BG queue . For example, the value for this parameter is the database in which the source is stored.

The parameters identify the plan name, subject code, page ID, and section name.","When the system  is generated content for viewing, the system  queries the IDB  to find out if there are any parameters with the same values of the content being generated. If there is a match, the system  applies the pending change indication at the appropriate section in the displayed page.","Workflow process A closes a work item when the change has been tested and put into production (e.g., the change has been incorporated into the repository ). Workflow process A can also close a work item when it is not desired, for example, when a user (e.g., a CSM user ) does not authorize the change because the change is not necessary or incompatible in some way with a client's instructions. As a work item is closed, the delete listener  deletes the values for that work item from the IDB . In one example, the delete listener  periodically (e.g., at a period set by configuration) checks the status of the work items in the BG queue  to determine if any of them have changed to a closed status (e.g., status code=RESOLV). Using these processes, the data in the IDB  represents the currently pending changes in the workflow process , with a tolerance of the period set by the configuration.

The system  uses the work item identifiers to obtain a description directly from the workflow process  (e.g., using an API). With the unique IDs for the specific work items, searching the work items through the workflow process  can be efficient and quick. This process advantageously allows the description to be changed as needed as the work item is moved in the workflow process  and enables the system  to display the most current description available. Further, when the work item is closed, the system  no longer displays the pending change indicator on the page, as the data is removed from the IDB  and nothing returned on subsequent queries.","In other examples, alternatives to the system  are used to implement indicating the pending changes. Some of these alternatives are described now only as illustrative examples and not to limit the alternatives in any way. For example, as an alternative to the BG queue , the BG work item servlet  and the delete listener  can monitor each queue (, , , and ) individually and apply rule logic similar to the rules described above to determine whether the data (e.g., Table 6) for a work item should be transferred to the IDB  while the work item is pending. The BG queue  can be moved so that all of the work items flow through the BG queue  first and the BG queue  transfers the work items to the other appropriate queues (e.g., , , , and\/or ). The description for the change can be stored in the IDB . This advantageously eliminates the need for the system  to query the workflow process  when generating a description of the changes. This requires that the description in the IDB be updated when it is changed in the workflow process .","Quality Control","The system  includes the quality control module  to track and control the movement of changes through the system . The quality control module  can have its own associated database (not shown) to keep information that the quality control module  uses in controlling quality of the process.

The information can also include the availability of the content, such as whether the content is in the centralized database available to be checked out or is already checked out by another user making a change. The quality control module  generates a user interface that displays this information and can be used to enable users to enter and\/or update this information.

These databases are used to move the changed content through the change process to different groups of users involved with the process . Although the process  uses databases, in other examples, the locations are not databases, but particular file locations on a network to which the changes can be stored as they move through the change process. Further, other examples may not use as many individual locations. For example, the local database  and the submit database  can be combined into the centralized database , the QA database  can be combined with the ACP database , or there can be a single centralized database from which all users access the changes.","An author making a change to content checks out () the content that she is modifying. In the process , checking out () the content includes transferring the content from the centralized database  to the local database  associated with that author.

If this verification fails (), the changed content is flagged as failed (e.g., the value of a parameter associated with the change is marked failed, or the system failed).","If the systems verification passes, then the systems user changes () the status of the changed content to a status representing the change content is ready for QA verification. When the systems user changes the status, the system  queues and transfers the changed content from the centralized database  to the QA database . Content elements have relationships to other content elements. The relationship can be, for example, that certain content elements are included in other content elements. In other examples, the relationship can be that all of the content elements are part of the same subject, such as all the content elements related to the subject \u201cair travel\u201d for a particular policy.

In that case, the QA user changes () the status of each of the changed content elements to a status (e.g., QA Verified) representing the changed content is ready for ACP verification. When the QA user changes the status, the system  queues and transfers the changed content from the QA database  to the ACP database .","If the QA user determines that one or more of the content elements are not acceptable, the QA user indicates () which of the content elements in the related group fails QA verification. In that case, some of the content elements are marked as passed (e.g., their status is changed to \u201cQA Verified\u201d) and some of the content elements are marked as failed (e.g., their status is changed to \u201cQA Failed\u201d). If one of the content elements of the group of related content elements is marked as failed, then the default is that the system  does not transfer any of the content elements in that group to the next location (i.e., the ACP database ). The system  includes an override process that enables the content elements of the group that are marked as passed (e.g., \u201cQA Verified\u201d) to be transferred.","In one example, the user interface generated by the quality control module  described above includes a listing of the group of content elements and the status (e.g., \u201cQA Verified\u201d or \u201cQA Failed\u201d). The listing includes an element (e.g., a check box) that enables a QA user to override the restriction of not allowing any content element in the group to progress in the process . For a change to a content element that has passed (e.g., \u201cQA Verified\u201d), the user selects a checkbox with the status \u201cQA Override\u201d to indicate to the system  that this passed content element can be moved independently from the group. A user may override the group restriction when, for example, the passed content element does not have an object dependency with the content element that has failed. The user interface displays an indicator (e.g., a yellow check mark) next to the status (e.g., \u201cQA Verified\u201d) of the content element that has passed. This indicator identifies that this content element has been overridden and allowed to progress through the process  without one of its related content elements from the group. The system  can impose a security restriction, for example, allowing only those users who are associated with a QA approver role to be able to access the override check box and select it.","When a user selects an override, the system  determines () that that particular content element can be split from the group and moved () to the next approval stage (e.g., ACP verification). The system  transfers () those content elements that have failed (e.g., their status is \u201cQA Failed\u201d) back to the centralized database  and notifies the author (e.g., by sending an email) that the change has failed and needs to be modified.","If the QA verification passes, then the group () or those individual content elements that have been overridden () are transferred () to the ACP database  and are ready for ACP verification. The ACP user verifies each of the content elements and indicates whether the ACP verification has passed () (e.g., sets the status to \u201cACP Verified\u201d) or failed () (e.g., sets the status to \u201cACP Failed\u201d). For failure conditions, the ACP user can differentiate between a critical failure (e.g., the change to the content element is incorrect) and a non-critical failure (e.g., the change contains a typographical error). The status of a non-critical failure can be indicated as \u201cACP Failed Non-Critical\u201d.","Similar to the QA override, the user interface generated by the quality control module  includes a listing of the group of content elements and the status (e.g., \u201cACP Verified\u201d, \u201cACP Failed\u201d or \u201cACP Failed Non-Critical\u201d). The listing includes an element (e.g., a check box) that enables an ACP user to override a non-critical failure and allow the failed content element to progress in the process . The system  uses the check box selection to determine () whether an ACP failure can be overridden. For a change to a content element that has a non-critical failure (e.g., \u201cACP Failed Non-Critical\u201d), the user selects a checkbox with the status \u201cACP Failed Non-Critical Manager Approval\u201d to indicate to the system  that this failed content element can be moved into production even though there is an associated failure. An ACP user may override the failure when, for example, the content element has some important changes in it, such as a new requirement, which outweigh the reason it failed, such as an identified typographical error. The user interface displays an indicator (e.g., a green check mark) next to the status (e.g., \u201cACP Failed Non-Critical Manager Approval\u201d) of the content element that has failed. This indicator identifies that this content element has been overridden and allowed to progress through the process  even though it has a failure. The system  can impose a security restriction, for example, allowing only those users who are associated with an ACP approver role to be able to access the override check box and select it.","After the overridden failed content element goes through the production cycle (), the system  does not close out the change request. Instead, the system  changes the indicator (e.g., green check mark) to a different indicator (e.g., a red check mark) to indicate to the author that the change has gone through production but has an ACP failure that must be addressed before the change request can be closed. The system  can automatically notify the author (e.g., by sending an email) that the change has been through production and needs to be addressed before the change request can be closed. In some examples, the system  notifies the applicable users each time a status changes and\/or a change is transferred from one database to another. This automatic notification advantageously allows the applicable users to become aware of the changes without periodically having to check the quality control module  (e.g., using the user interface generated by the quality control module ).","The above-described processes can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. The implementation can be as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage device or in a propagated signal, for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","Method steps can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and generating output. Method steps can also be performed by, and apparatus can be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Modules can refer to portions of the computer program and\/or the processor\/special circuitry that implements that functionality.","Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. Data transmission and instructions can also occur over a communications network. Information carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, the above described processes can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer (e.g., interact with a user interface element). Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The above described processes can be implemented in a distributed computing the system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, and\/or a middleware component, e.g., an application server, and\/or a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface and\/or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an example implementation, or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) and a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), e.g., the Internet, and include both wired and wireless networks.","The computing the system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","The invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments.

The steps of the invention can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results.
