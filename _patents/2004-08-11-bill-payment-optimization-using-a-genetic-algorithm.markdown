title: Bill payment optimization using a genetic algorithm
abstract: A genetic algorithm determines a plan for payment of payment obligations in accounts payable of a finance account. The genetic algorithm operates to satisfy certain objectives, including maximizing or minimizing the total amount of payments of the payment obligations on a given day within the amount of cash available for the given day. A genome population including a number of vectors is generated. The genome population is modified using a genetic algorithm, until at least one vector represents an optimal bill payment plan for the payment obligations such that payment of each payment obligation in accordance with the vector most nearly satisfies one or more objectives.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part application of, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 from, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/349,700, entitled \u201cCash Flow Optimization Using A Genetic Algorithm,\u201d filed on Jan. 22, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,124,105, the subject matter of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to bill payment optimization and, more specifically, to using genetic algorithms to optimize bill payments in terms of making bill payments for a given day as close as possible to the amount of available cash on that given day while optimizing one or more objectives.","Businesses or households generally have a set of accounts payables. For example, a company may have a tax bill to pay on April 15, salary payments to be made on April 28, lease payments to be made on May 1, etc. Businesses or households also have a certain amount of cash available for making payments of the accounts payable for a given day. Often times, businesses or households are particularly interested in figuring out the best way to utilize the amount of cash available for a given day for making payments of the accounts payable. They have a limited amount of cash available to make such payments on a given day, and thus would like to know which of the accounts payables and what fraction of those accounts payables they should pay on that day to make the best use of their limited amount of cash available on that day. They would also like to make payments of an amount as close as possible to the amount of cash available for that day, since that amount is what was earmarked for accounts payables for that given day.","In general, accounts payables have an amount to pay, a due date, certain penalties incurred for late payment, minimum required payment, and the like. One or more of these elements of the accounts payable should be considered to decide which of the account payables and what fraction of the account payables should be paid. For example, businesses may decide to make a certain payment on a given day earlier than the due date if there are certain benefits associated with early payments, such as a discount of the payment amount. Businesses may also decide not to make a certain payment on a given day even though the payment is due on that day, notwithstanding the penalties associated with late payments, because the amount of cash available on that day is less than the amount of payment to be made for that account payable. Businesses also may prefer lumping more than one payment to a single payee (vendor) on a given day together to minimize delivery cost, or may also prefer separating the payments for ease of identification and accounting.","Therefore, business and households should, but typically do not, consider various factors (or objectives) in deciding when and how much of a payment should be made on a given day, such as, maximizing the amount of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for a given day, maximizing or minimizing payments to a certain vendor or a certain account depending upon the importance of the vendor or account, maximizing discounts, minimizing late fees, minimizing new late fees, favoring late payables, favoring aged payables, minimizing delivery costs, favoring the least recently paid account, maximizing partial payments, minimizing full payments, maximizing the number of payables paid, minimizing the total days late, minimizing the total days early, etc. A very efficient bill payment plan (a plan dictating which and how much of the payment obligations of the accounts payable should be satisfied on that day) taking into consideration all of these objectives in an optimized manner could result in savings of a significant amount of money for the businesses.","It is a very complicated task to find a solution for an efficient bill payment plan while optimizing these various factors. Consider, for example, a highly simplified situation where the accounts payable includes 100 different payment obligations of $100 due on 10 different dates on a given day. The search space for this situation would involve devising a bill payment plan to pay all or some part of each payment obligation on the given day while satisfying the above-mentioned factors objectives. Assuming that payments can be made in $1 increments between $0 and $100, just to simplify the calculation, there will be 100 ways to make a payment for each payment obligation. This means that there will be 100 ways to make payments on 100 payment obligations on the given day, resulting in 100combinations of possible solutions, clearly too many to be each individually considered even on the most powerful computers in existence. In addition, a variety of the above-mentioned objectives should be considered when finding the solution with respect to a user-specified importance level for each objective. The solution space for such a situation will be enormous, discontinuous in scope and will typically involve non-linear, non-dimensional, and inter-dependent variables.","Such a complicated problem is very difficult to solve, but once a solution is obtained, it is easy to evaluate the solution. Such problems are called non-deterministic polynomial (\u201cNP\u201d) problems, which mean that it is possible to guess the solution by some non-deterministic algorithm and then check the solution, both in polynomial time. Generally, NP problems may be solved by genetic algorithms. However, so far there has been no attempt to apply a genetic algorithm to finding a solution for optimizing a bill payment plan while optimizing certain objectives of a user.","The present invention solves this problem by generating a plan for making payments of payment obligations in accounts payable of a given finance account on a given day by using a genetic algorithm, while satisfying or optimizing certain objectives, including, but not limited to maximizing the amount of payment to be made on that given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for that given day. In another embodiment, the present invention may generate a bill payment plan for making payments of payment obligations in accounts payable of a given finance account on a given day by using a genetic algorithm, while satisfying or optimizing certain objectives, including, but not limited to minimizing the amount of payment to be made on that given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for that given day.","In one embodiment, a genome population including a number of genomes is generated. Each genome has a plurality of alleles each representing a fractional (percentage) amount of the payment obligation to be paid on that given day, and each allele corresponds to each payment obligation in the accounts payable. For example, if a payment of $50 is due to a payee on Sep. 30, 2004, then the allele of the genome corresponding to this payment obligation could represent a 0.25 fractional payment amount, which would mean paying 25% or $12.50 on that given day. Thus, a single genome may be understood to represent a bill payment plan for that given day, since it has a plurality of alleles defining the fractional payment amount for a number of accounts payable. Each genome is represented by a vector, list or other useful data structure.","The genome population is evaluated with respect to various objective functions. The objective functions provide a way of measuring the degree to which the payment of payment obligations in accordance with a genome vector on a given day satisfies one or more objectives. For example, the genomes can be evaluated with respect to maximizing the amount of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for a given day, maximizing or minimizing payments to a certain vendor or a certain account depending upon the importance of the vendor or account, maximizing discounts, minimizing late fees, minimizing new late fees, favoring late payables, favoring aged payables, minimizing delivery costs, favoring the least recently paid account, minimizing or maximizing partial payments, minimizing or maximizing full payments, maximizing the number of payables paid, minimizing the total days late, minimizing the total days early, etc.","The genome population is modified using a genetic algorithm, including introducing into the genome population new genomes (vectors) derived from other genomes (vectors), including the original or previously existing genomes (vectors). In the context of the present invention the terms \u201cvector\u201d and \u201cgenome\u201d will be used interchangeably herein, but no limitation of genomes to a vector form of representation is intended. Various vectors which best match the desired criteria in each generation are selected as mating vectors from the first set of vectors based on their fitness, and then combined to obtain a second set of vectors, which are the offspring of the mating vectors. The resulting offspring vectors are preferably mutated, and used to replace selected ones of vectors in the genome population. The genome population is modified in this way until at least one vector represents a bill payment plan for making payments of the payment obligations on the given day such that payment of the payment obligations in accordance with the vector on that given day most nearly satisfies or optimizes the objectives, such as maximizing the amount of payments made on that given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for a given day, and the like. Note that the present invention is not concerned about future cash flow on subsequent days but is only concerned about satisfying objectives with the amount of cash available for payment of bills on that given day, and thus does not take into consideration accounts receivable information.","The present invention may be embodied in various forms, including computer program products, methods, and systems, special or general purpose computing devices or apparatuses, online services or systems, user interfaces, etc.","By employing a genetic algorithm in order to find a solution for optimizing a set of criteria, such as maximizing the amount of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for that given day, in the payment of payment obligations of the accounts payable on that given day, it is possible to search a potentially intractable solution space for an optimal solution in an acceptable amount of time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","114","116","122","124","100","128","116","122","126"]},"The available cash  is the amount of cash that may be used for payment of bills on the day when the genetic algorithm module  is used. In one embodiment, a user of the genetic algorithm module  manually inputs the available cash . In another embodiment, the available cash  is retrieved from a conventional relational or flat file database that is accessible to the genetic algorithm module . For example, many personal or business finance software applications, such as Intuit Inc.'s QuickBooks\u00ae and Quicken\u00ae, or Microsoft Corp.'s Money\u00ae use databases to store data pertaining to the user's cash balance. The available cash  may also be obtained, either manually or automatically, from the business's banking, such as through an online banking program. It is anticipated that the present invention in its embodiment as the genetic algorithm module  may be integrated into a business or personal finance software application, such as one of the foregoing applications.","The accounts payable information  includes a payment table having information relating to each of the payment obligations therein, such as the payment due date, payment amount, payee (vendor) information, late fees or penalties associated with the payment obligations in the accounts payable, and importance of the payee (vendor), and the like. The accounts payable information  also includes an account table having one or more accounts each corresponding to a billing matter and associated with one or more entries in the payment table. The accounts payable information  also includes a vendor table having one or more vendors each associated with one or more entries in the account table. The accounts payable information  may be provided manually by a user, or it may be obtained automatically by the genetic algorithm module  via appropriate connections with databases stored in personal or business finance application software or online information sources.","The manner in which the accounts payable information can be stored, and the manner in which the genetic algorithm module  retrieves such information from external databases or online information sources is well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the module  is integrated into a financial management application, an accounting application that stores the accounting information in a local or remotely accessible database; in this case, the module  has direct programmatic access to the accounts payable information . In another embodiment where the module  is independent of an accounting package, then it can obtain access to the accounts payable information  through an application programming interface, or even simple data importation. The particular details of how the accounts payable information  is obtained are not material to the operation of the invention.","The objectives  comprise the constraints that the genetic algorithm module  takes into consideration and attempts to optimize as it finds a solution for generating the bill payment plan . Those objectives  include, but are not limited to, maximizing the amount of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for a given day, maximizing or minimizing payments to a certain vendor or a certain account depending upon the importance of the vendor or account, maximizing discounts, minimizing late fees, minimizing new late fees, favoring late payables, favoring aged payables, minimizing delivery costs, favoring the least recently paid account, minimizing or maximizing partial payments, minimizing or maximizing full payments, maximizing the number of payables paid, minimizing the total days late, minimizing the total days early, etc. In another embodiment, the objectives  may include minimizing (rather than maximizing) the amount of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for a given day while satisfying the other objectives. Certain objectives  can be defined with respect to the available cash . One of these objectives  is maximizing (or minimizing) the amount of payments  to be made on a given day within the limits of the available cash . In addition, each objective  is associated with a weight that describes the level of importance of the objective . The weight may be fixed or it may be provided by the user. The weight is applied to one or more objective functions that relate to the particular objective. Any other relevant data , such as postage or courier fee data, may be input as well, so long as it can be used to modify or adjust the operation of the objective functions, their input parameters, or the genetic algorithm module .","In one embodiment, the genetic algorithm module  comprises an initialization module , a scoring module , a selection module , a mating module , a mutation module , and a replacement module . The specific details of one implementation of these software modules will be explained below in conjunction with . The genetic algorithm module  finds a solution for maximizing the amount of cash  to be used for payment of bills on a given day within the limit of the available cash  while optimizing the other objectives  and outputs the amount of cash  to be used for bill payment along with a bill payment plan  describing which and what fraction of the amount of the bills should be paid for each payment obligation in the accounts payable . Payments of the accounts payable  in accordance with the bill payment plan  will result in maximizing the amount of cash  to be used for payment of bills on a given day within the limit of the available cash  while optimizing the other objectives  according to user-specified weights.","Functional Model",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","1"]},"Referring to  and also , the operation begins  with the genetic algorithm module  receiving  input data such as the available cash , accounts payable information , objectives and weights , and other relevant data . More specifically, and depending on the embodiment, the genetic algorithm module  retrieves the available cash , accounts payable information , objectives and weights , and other relevant data  from a database, such as a local database, or a remote database, such as one maintained on the Internet by a financial services online provider, and stores the information locally. For obtaining the objectives and their weights , the genetic algorithm module  can provide the user with a graphical or textual user interface presenting each of the objectives and having the user rank order them in terms of importance, or use a sequence of pairwise comparisons to determine the user's implicit ranking, or provide the list of the objectives, along with a control for each to allow the user to set the weight (e.g., 1 to 10) of the objective, which are then internally normalized. In addition, the user can select which objectives  to satisfy and which to ignore (either by removing the objectives from the later computation process, or by giving such objectives a weighting of 0). Input of the available cash  can likewise be made via a text or graphical user interface, when provided manually.","Initialization of Genome Population","Then, a genome population is initialized  by the initialization module . The genome population comprises a plurality of genomes. In the preferred embodiment, the genomes are in the form of vectors, though other data structures and implementations are certainly possible. An initial genome population of around 100 genomes is useful, but more or fewer can be used. In the context of the present invention the terms \u201cvector\u201d and \u201cgenome\u201d will be used interchangeably herein, but no limitation of genomes to a vector form of representation is intended. Each genome comprises a plurality of \u201calleles\u201d (otherwise referred to herein as \u201cgenes\u201d), one allele for each payment obligation in the accounts payable . Each allele corresponds to a payment obligation in the accounts payable  and has information from which the amount of payment for the payment obligation can be derived. In a preferred embodiment, this information is encoded as a fractional (percentage) amount of the corresponding payment obligation to be made.","The genomes and the alleles will be explained in more detail with reference to .  shows N genomes G, G, . . . , Geach of which has M alleles. For example, genome Ghas alleles g, g, g, . . . , g, and g. Likewise, genome Ghas alleles g, g, g, . . . , g, and g. The number of genomes N is determined so that the genetic algorithm of the present invention efficiently and thoroughly searches the solution space for an optimum bill payment plan . As stated above, the number of genomes N can be around 100. The number of alleles M in the genomes equals the number of payment obligations in the accounts payable  to be analyzed. In other words, each allele gin one genome corresponds to one payment obligation in the accounts payable . This may be all outstanding accounts payable, or any subset selected by the user. For example, the user may select only payments due in the next 60 days.","Each allele in the genomes G, G, . . . , Grepresents a percentage of the amount of the payment obligation to be paid. In one embodiment, an allele  is represented by a 32-bit value indicating a payment percentage or fraction  of the bill to be paid. Note that other number of bits for the allele  may be used.","The payment percentage  is used to represent the percentage of the amount of the corresponding payment obligation to be paid, ranging from 0% to 100%. There are many different ways in which this value can be represented in the allele. In one embodiment, the allele stores an unsigned integer that represents the numerator of a quotient equaling the percentage, with the implicit denominator being the maximum unsigned integer that can be stored in a certain number of bits used for the percentage  of the payable amount to be paid. Therefore, the resultant quotient will be a number in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 in floating point form, which represents the percentage of the corresponding payable to be paid. A very simple example will suffice: Assume that the maximum number of bits is 32 as shown in , in which case the implicit denominator is \u201c11111111111111111111111111111111\u201d in binary form. Thus, a percentage  having a value \u201c10000000000000000000000000000000\u201d in binary form ultimately represents \u201c10000000000000000000000000000000\u201d divided by \u201c11111111111111111111111111111111\u201d (approximately 50%), which corresponds to the percentage of the amount of the payment obligation to be paid. As this should make clear then, the actual value stored for the percentage  in the allele  does not necessarily have to be the actual percentage of the payable, but only a value from which the actual percentage an be calculated. The use of unsigned integers in the alleles  has an advantage that it also helps avoiding epistasis, which is the inherent problem in genetic algorithms whereby a particular way of genome representation inhibits a genetic algorithm from finding an optimum solution to a problem. By using the entire bit field to represent the space of possible numerators, the entire range of possible percentages between 0 and 100% can be most effectively explored by the genetic algorithm.","According to one embodiment, the genomes in the initial genome population are randomly generated. The genetic algorithm module  of the present invention utilizes a bit-string uniform procedure in randomly generating the genomes, by assigning 0 or 1 to each bit in a genome with equal probability. To this end, the genetic algorithm module  first chooses randomly a bit density d corresponding to each bit in the genome from a uniform distribution, wherein 0<=d<=1. Then, the genetic algorithm module  randomly sets each bit of each of the alleles  in a genome to one (1) with a probability of d corresponding to the bit. This will result in genomes evenly distributed in the binary space. It should be noted that this initialization is with respect to the entire genome treated as single bit string, and temporarily ignoring the separation of the individual alleles. Thus, for example, if each allele is represented by a 32-bit value, and there are 10 alleles, then the genome is treated as a 320-bit string during the initialization process. The values of each allele are then the values of each corresponding 32-bit word in the bit string.","Additionally, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, selected ones of the genomes in the initial genome population are initialized with predetermined values thereby giving structured data for the genetic algorithm module  to draw on. For example, including a genome of all zeros (0) and a genome of all ones (1) in the initial genome population will help the genetic algorithm module  to find solutions at the very ends of the solution space. Any number of other fixed genomes may be added to the initial population, though this is likely to affect the quality of the overall search of the solution space.","Determining Fitness of Genomes by Use of Objective Function","Referring back to , the fitness of the genomes in the genome population is then determined  by the scoring module  to obtain a fitness score by using a composite objective function, respective objective functions and related objectives and weights . Determining the fitness of a genome is equivalent to determining how close the genome comes to optimizing or satisfying the specified objectives when the bill payment plan  represented by the genome is applied to the accounts payable . The objectives themselves include maximizing the amount of payment  to be made for the given day within the limits of the available cash .","According to one embodiment of the invention, the fitness scores of the genomes in the genome population are determined by (i) evaluating the genome in the genome population to determine the payments corresponding to each payment obligation, and thus the results of each objective function O; (ii) obtaining a composite genome objective value Ofrom the weighted combination of the objective functions, using the weights associated with each objective function; and (iii) computing a fitness score F for each genome by applying a fitness function to the composite genome objective value Ocorresponding to each genome. The fitness function will be illustrated in detail below.","The composite genome objective value Ofor each genome in the genome population is calculated by first applying the evaluated genome to the accounts payable , and using the respective objective functions, to compute the objective values Ofor each underlying objective (minimizing late fees, maximizing discounts, and the like). That is, for each objective, there is an objective function to which the bill payment plan defined by the genome is applied; the result of the each objective function is the objective value O. Then, the objective values Ofrom all of the objective functions are normalized and standardized to obtain normalized, standardized objective values Ofor each underlying objective. Finally, the normalized, standardized objective values Oare weighted and summed by a composite objective function to obtain a composite genome objective value Ocorresponding to the evaluated genome.","As illustrated in detail below, the objective values Ofor each underlying objective may be calculated by applying the evaluated genome to the accounts payable  to assess the impact of the bill payment plan  represented by the evaluated genome upon the various objectives. Each objective is associated with an objective value O. The best (optimum) and worst objective values Oand Ocorresponding to each underlying objective can also be calculated by analyzing the nature of the underlying objective.","Also as illustrated in detail below, the objective values O,for each underlying objective are normalized (to a value between 0 and 1) and standardized (optimal value is 0, worst value is 1) to generate normalized, standardized objective values O. Normalization and standardization of the objective values allow the different values\/scales of each objective value corresponding to different objectives to be summed together, because they are now unitless relative values, not dollar values or other objective-specific values any more.","The normalization and standardization of the objective values Omay be done in a different manner for different objectives by analyzing the nature of the objectives. For most objectives, the normalized, standardized objective value O, can be computed by dividing the difference between the calculated objective value Oand the best (or desired) objective value Oby a normalization factor, which for most underlying objectives is the difference between the worst objective value Oand the best objective value O, i.e., by the formula O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|. However, the normalization factor can be different from |O\u2212O| depending upon the type of objective to be optimized.","The following is an illustration of the manner in which O, O, Oand Oare computed for a given genome in the genome population for various objectives in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. These objectives listed below are merely exemplary, and can include other objectives that are not listed herein.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the objective of maximizing the amount  of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount  of cash available for a given day: Here, Ois equal to the amount  of cash available for a given day (the entire available cash  is used for payment of bills on the given day) and the value Ois equal to zero (none of the available cash  is used for payment of bills on a given day). Ois the amount  of cash to used for bill payments on a given day when the genome G is applied to the accounts payable , and can be determined by translating the payable parameters (the payment percentage ) in each allele of the genome into an actual payment amount for the corresponding payment obligation in the accounts payable  and adding up all the actual payment amounts. The normalized, standardized objective O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|.","In another embodiment, the objectives  may be to minimize (rather than maximize) the amount of payments made on a given day within the limits of the amount of cash available for a given day while satisfying the other objectives. In such case, Ois equal to the amount  of cash available for a given day (the entire available cash  is used for payment of bills on the given day) and the value Ois equal to zero (none of the available cash  is used for payment of bills on a given day). Ois still the amount  of cash to used for bill payments on a given day when the genome G is applied to the accounts payable , and can be determined by translating the payable parameters (the payment percentage ) in each allele of the genome into an actual payment amount for the corresponding payment obligation in the accounts payable  and adding up all the actual payment amounts. The normalized, standardized objective O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the underlying objective of maximizing or minimizing payments to a certain vendor or a certain account depending upon the importance of the vendor or account: Vendor or account importance is a user-specified value assigned to each payment obligation in the accounts payable  and represents a degree of importance of payment of a certain payment obligation by the due date or in full. Businesses may have different business relations with different vendors or may view certain accounts more important than others, and thus would have different priorities in making payments to the vendors or accounts by the due date or in full. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the higher the importance value for a particular payment obligation is, the more favored the non-fulfillment of that payment obligation is, that is the more the user wishes to fulfill that payment obligation in full by the due date. Vendor or account importance values can be input to the module  as one of the objectives , and may be in the range of 0 to 1. Alternatively, each payment can be associated with an importance value, and stored in the accounting information or database, such that this information can then be looked up when the genome is evaluated. Ois 0 (unimportant) and Ois 1 (very important, most disfavored non-payment). Ois the average importance value for all the payment obligations when the evaluated genome is applied to the accounts payable . Ois calculated by (i) adding the importance values corresponding to the payment obligations in which at least a fraction of the payment obligations are paid and (ii) dividing the total importance value by the number of payment obligations in the accounts payable . The normalized, standardized objective value O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|. Note that separate importance values may be assigned to indicate vendor importance and account importance and thus separate importance values may be calculated accordingly depending upon the embodiment.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the underlying objective of maximizing discounts: Here, Ois equal to the sum of all discounts available in the accounts payable and Ois zero (no discounts). The discount information is also part of the accounts payable information , so the genetic algorithm module  may readily calculate Obased upon such information. Ois the amount of discounts to be obtained when the evaluated genome is applied to the accounts payable , and can be calculated by adding the discounts available when at least a fraction of the payment obligations are paid. The normalized, standardized objective value O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the underlying objective of minimizing late payment penalties: Here, Ois zero (no late payment penalties) and Ois the sum of all late payment penalties associated with the payment obligations when all payment obligations are paid late. In another embodiment, Omay be a sum of a predetermined late fee and a predetermined percentage of the total payable amount. As stated above, the late payment information is also part of the accounts payable information , so the genetic algorithm module  may readily calculate Obased upon such information. Ois the amount of late payment penalties to be paid when the evaluated genome is applied to the accounts payable . Each allele  in the evaluated genome is applied to each payment obligation in the accounts payable , and may incur a late payment fee if the payment date (the date when the genetic algorithm module  is run) is later than the due date depending upon the late payment penalties. The normalized, standardized objective value O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the underlying objective of minimizing new late payment penalties: Here, Ois zero (no new late payment penalties) and Ois the sum of all new late payment penalties if all payments are made late. As stated above, the late payment information is also part of the accounts payable information , so the genetic algorithm module  may readily calculate Obased upon such information. Ois the amount of new late payment penalties to be incurred when the evaluated genome is applied to the accounts payable . Each allele  in the evaluated genome is applied to each payment obligation in the accounts payable , and may incur a new late payment fee if a payment due on the effective date is not paid according to the account payable's late payment information. The normalized, standardized objective value O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the underlying objective of favoring late payables: This objective is to minimize the payment of payment obligations that do not carry a late fee for late payments after the due date (\u201clate payables\u201d). Here, Ois zero (no payment of late payables) and Ois the sum of the amount of all late payables. As stated above, the late payment information is also part of the accounts payable information , so the genetic algorithm module  may readily calculate Obased upon such information. Ois the amount of payments of the late payables to be made when the evaluated genome is applied to the accounts payable . Each allele  in the evaluated genome is applied to each payment obligation in the accounts payable , and the sum of the payment amount of the late payables according to the evaluated genome is calculated to obtain O. The normalized, standardized objective value O=|O\u2212O|\/|O\u2212O|.","Calculating the normalized, standardized objective value Ofor the underlying objective of favoring aged payables: This objective is to favor the payment of payment obligations that have aged longer (\u201caged payables\u201d) as a function of the age of the payable and its terms. Businesses would generally favor paying payment obligations with longer terms because the payee had to wait longer for payment. For example, between a payable with a term of 30 days and a payable with a term of 90 days and both being 10 days before being due, the payable with 90 days will be favored. Here, Ois zero and Ois the sum of the amount of all payables. Ois the amount of payments of the aged payables to be made when the evaluated genome is applied to the accounts payable . Each allele  in the evaluated genome is applied to each payment obligation in the accounts payable  to derive payment amounts for corresponding to the payment obligations, and those amounts are weighted (multiplied) down by the age of the corresponding payment obligation divided by the term of the payment obligation, and the sum of the weighted payment amount of the longer term payables according to the evaluated genome is calculated to obtain O. This weighting thereby favors more aged payables because as the aging approaches the term of the payable, the weight moves from 0 to 1.

Urgent mailings of payments generally require a higher postage fee such as a courier fee. Therefore, businesses generally prefer mailing a payment well in advance of a payment due date. Thus, this objective prefers a bill payment plan that results in making payments sufficiently prior to their due date to avoid extra postage fees. Here, Oequals the amount of delivery cost when all the payments in the accounts payable  are sent using the least expensive delivery method, and Oequals the amount of delivery cost when all the payments in the accounts payable  are sent using the most expensive delivery method. Ois the amount of delivery cost incurred when payments are made and mailed in accordance with the represented by the genome to be evaluated. Since it is assumed that the payments are made on the day on which the genetic algorithm module  is run, it is possible to determine the delivery cost required for the payment to arrive prior to the payment due date by using postage rate or courier fee information.

After the standardized, normalized objective values Ofor the respective underlying objectives are calculated for the evaluated genome, the composite genome objective value Ofor the evaluated genome can be obtained by the following composite objective function:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["O","comp"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["w","i"]},{"mi":["O","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Ois the normalized, standardized objective value for each objective;","wis a weight for each objective; and","n is the number of objectives to be optimized."]}}}},"The weights are importance levels (either predetermined or specified by the user) in the range of 0 to 1 and are normalized so that they add up to 1. Each weight corresponds to an objective. Since the O's are normalized and standardized values, a composite genome objective value Oof zero (0) is the best (optimum) value and one (1) is the worst value.","In the manner described above, the composite genome objective values O's corresponding to each the genomes in the genome population are determined. Thereafter, the fitness score F for each genome in the genome population is obtained by applying a fitness function to each composite genome objective value O. The fitness function is applied to the composite genome objective values in order to redistribute the genomes in the solution space such that the genomes are distributed in a way more effective for the genetic algorithm to explore. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the fitness score F for each genome in the genome population can be obtained by sigma truncation:\n\n\u2212()\n\nwhere\n\n","After the fitness scores of all the genomes in the genome population is calculated, it is determined  whether or not the termination criteria are satisfied. The termination criterion is one of two circumstances:\n\n","The user of the genetic algorithm module  can specify how nearly the objectives should be optimized by the bill payment plan  represented by the genomes. For example, when one of the objective is to maximize the amount of payments to be made on a given day within the limits of the available cash on that day, the user can specify a threshold percentage for the ratio of the payment amount  to the available cash  or a threshold amount by which the payment amount  may be less than the available cash . When the ratio of the payment amount  to the available cash  exceeds the threshold percentage or when the difference between the available cash  and the payment amount  becomes less than the threshold amount, the termination criterion is satisfied. Alternatively, the user can, specify a threshold fitness score, and when the fitness score of at least one of the genomes in the genome population is lower than the threshold fitness score, the termination criterion is satisfied.","The number of generations limit for one genome population as the termination criteria is preferably set as , such that the genetic algorithm terminates when the number of generations of one genome population exceeds . According to another embodiment, another termination condition is used in conjunction with the maximum number of generations. Here, after the number of generations exceeds the maximum, then it is determined whether or not the ratio of the best fitness score in the first generation F1 to the best fitness score in the current generation Fc is smaller than 1, i.e., F1\/Fc<=1. If this ratio is smaller than or equal to 1, then the genetic algorithm is terminated because this means that the fitness score is not getting better (i.e., not getting lower) for further generations. If the ratio is larger than 1 (i.e., F1>Fc), then the genetic algorithm is not terminated because this means that the fitness score is getting better (i.e., getting lower) for further generations and it is worth trying the subsequent generations to find an optimum solution. In still another embodiment, after the number of generations exceeds the maximum, then it is determined whether or not the ratio of the F\/F<=1, where Fis the fitness score of the c-maxgeneration, max is the maximum number of generations, and Fc is fitness score of the current generation. In such embodiment, only the latest max generations are reviewed. If this ratio is smaller than or equal to 1, then the genetic algorithm is terminated because this means that the fitness score is not getting better (i.e., not getting lower) for further generations. If the ratio is larger than 1 (i.e., F>F), then the genetic algorithm is not terminated because this means that the fitness score is getting better (i.e., getting lower) for further generations and it is worth trying the subsequent generations to find an optimum solution.","If one of the termination criteria is satisfied , the results are reported  and the process is returned  to the user, when the genetic algorithm module  has satisfied  the goal of optimizing the objectives. If the goal is not satisfied , then it is determined  whether or not the execution time applicable to the entire genetic algorithm has exceeded a certain limit. If so, then the process is returned  to the user with the current best results. If not, the process returns to initialize  the genome population again and restarts the genetic algorithm. According to one embodiment, a user imposes this time limit for the entire genetic algorithm of the application. In another embodiment, this time limit is predetermined in the genetic algorithm module  itself. The results returned to the user may be displayed to the user by using any form of user interface, such as a graphical user interface, textual report, and the like.","Selection of Genomes for Mating","If the termination criteria are not satisfied , the selection module  in the genetic algorithm module  proceeds to select  genomes for mating. The selection can be carried out by roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, or any other type of selection method typically used by genetic algorithms.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, roulette wheel selection is used to give every genome in the genome population a chance of mating, the chance of mating for each genome being proportional to the determined fitness score of each genome. To this end, the fitness score Ffor genomeis used as a threshold and a random number R in the range of 0 to 1 is selected. The genome is selected for mating if R>F. Otherwise the genome is skipped. Because very good genomes will have very low F's, R will more likely be greater than their fitness F. Very poor genomes are less likely to be picked since their fitness scores will be relatively higher. Roulette wheel selection is continued until the genetic algorithm module  has selected two mating genomes from the genome population.","According to another embodiment, tournament selection is used for selecting the mating genomes. Specifically, a first superior genome is selected from a first set of two randomly chosen genomes in the initial genome population. Then, a second superior genome is additionally selected from a second set of two randomly chosen genomes in the initial genome population. The first and second superior genomes are the selected genomes for mating. Superiority of each genome is determined based on the fitness score for each genome computed above. Tournament selection is continued until the genetic algorithm module  has selected two mating genomes from the genome population.","Mating Genomes to Create Offspring Genomes","Thereafter, the two selected genomes are mated  by the mating module  to create offspring genomes. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the selected genomes are mated by single-point crossover. Single-point crossover is performed by randomly selecting a common crossover point in a first mating genome and a second mating genome among the selected mating genomes. In one embodiment, the crossover point is at one of the boundaries of the alleles in the genome. The first mating genome has a first portion and a second portion divided by the common crossover point and the second mating genome also has a first portion and a second portion divided by the common crossover point. Then, the second portion of the first mating genome is replaced with the second portion of the second mating genome to create an offspring genome.","In another embodiment, two-point crossover is used for mating. Two-point crossover is performed by selecting two crossover points (here, boundaries of alleles), copying the part from the beginning of the genome to the first crossover point from the first mating genome, copying the part from the first to the second crossover point from the second mating genome, and copying the part from the second crossover point to the end of the genome from the first mating genome, so as to create an offspring genome. Two-point crossover has a higher crossover rate than single point crossover.","In still another embodiment, uniform crossover is used for mating. Uniform crossover is performed by randomly copying from either the first mating genome or the second mating genome to create an offspring genome. That is, the length of the genome is traversed and at each bit location a bit is copied into the offspring genome from either the first mating genome or the second mating genome, using a random selection function to select which parent genome's bit it copied into the offspring.","According to still another embodiment of the present invention, arithmetic crossover is used for mating. Arithmetic crossover is carried out by performing a certain arithmetic operation with the first and second mating genomes to create an offspring genome. For example, the first and second mating genomes represented can be added to obtain the offspring genome.","Mutating Offspring Genomes","Thereafter, the offspring genomes are mutated  at a low frequency by the mutation module . According to one embodiment of the present invention, the mutation rate is 0.01%, and this is implemented by selecting a single integer in the range of 1 to 10,000, and mutating only when a randomly selected number in the range equals the selected integer. Another approach is to set the mutation rate as the threshold itself, and mutate only if a randomly selected number is below the threshold. The low frequency mutation rate is selected such that it is high enough for the genetic algorithm to explore the solution space effectively but low enough to prevent destruction of information obtained during mating. Mutation is carried out by (i) selecting a bit in the offspring genome to mutate by random selection in a uniform distribution, and (ii) changing the selected bit in the offspring genome from zero (0) to one (1), or vice versa, according to the mutation rate. In another embodiment, mutation can also be carried out by (i) selecting a bit in the offspring genome to mutate by random selection in a uniform distribution, (ii) determining what value to change the selected bit also by random selection, and (iii) changing the selected bit according to the determined value.","Inserting Offspring Genomes into Genome Population","Thereafter, the offspring genomes are inserted  into the genome population and a new generation genome population is obtained based on a replacement strategy by the replacement module . In one embodiment, the replacement strategy adds the offspring genome to the initial genome population to obtain a modified genome population. Then, the fitness score of each genome in the modified genome population is determined in the manner described above. Thereafter, a first predetermined number or percentage of the worst vectors are removed from the modified genome population based upon the determined fitness of the modified genome population. Finally, a second predetermined number or percentage of the best vectors in the initial genome population are added to the modified genome population based upon the determined fitness of the initial genome population. For example, 25 worst\/best vector maybe selected, or alternatively the 10% worst\/best vectors. The resultant modified genome population is the new (next generation) genome population.","Then, the process returns to determine  the fitness of the new genome population as described above. The above process is repeated until the termination criteria are satisfied .","The genetic algorithm module  is able to search an enormous, non-linear search space with a number of inter-dependent variables to find a near optimal solution for optimizing or satisfying numerous objectives specified by the user. Numerous (possibly conflicting) objectives can be weighted by the importance levels and optimized at the same time. The objectives can include maximizing the amount of payment of the payment obligations within the limits of the available cash. Moreover, the genetic algorithm module  is not limited to a certain type of payment and can be used with any type of payment obligations in the accounts payable . In addition, the solution can be found in an acceptable or interactive period of time, such as a few seconds to a few minutes.","It is also possible to use two or more of the genetic algorithm modules  at the same time in order to more efficiently find the optimum solution to the bill payment plan . One embodiment of the present invention uses two genetic algorithm modules , including an \u201cexploiting\u201d genetic algorithm and an \u201cexploring\u201d genetic algorithm. The exploiting genetic algorithm uses a mating method having a high crossover rate but will use a low mutation rate for mutation. This configuration allows this genetic algorithm to very effectively search the local space for better genomes. The exploring genetic algorithm uses a mating method having a low crossover rate but use a high mutation rate for mutation. This configuration allows the genetic algorithm to search over a very large amount of the entire solution space. If during any iteration, the exploring genetic algorithm finds a better solution than the exploiting genetic algorithm, the genome population in the exploring genetic algorithm is used to replace the genome population in the exploiting genetic algorithm and the exploring genetic algorithm is reinitialized. The population shift gives the exploiting genetic algorithm the \u2018better\u2019 population to search through, while the exploring genetic algorithm is redirected to evaluate a new portion of the solution space.","As a further refinement of this dual genetic algorithm approach, the relative amounts of processing time given to the exploring genetic algorithm and the exploiting genetic algorithm can be systematically varied. To begin with, the exploring genetic algorithm is given a majority portion of the available processing time, and the exploiting genetic algorithm is given a minority portion. As the number of iterations increases, the exploiting genetic algorithm is given progressively more processing time, and the exploring genetic algorithm is given progressively less; this change in processing time can be linear or non-linear. In this manner, the solution to the bill payment plan  optimizing the objectives  may be found in a more efficient manner, since the solution space is vigorously searched by the exploring genetic algorithm in the early stages of the process and then the solution is vigorously optimized by the exploiting genetic algorithm in the later stages of the process.","It is also possible to use multiple different genome populations as the initial genome populations and run them simultaneously according to the genetic algorithm, rather than use one initial genome population. For example, one embodiment of the present, invention utilizes 10 genome populations in parallel. This would result in reduction of the time required for finding the solution but would also be a heavier computational burden on the computer that runs the genetic algorithm.","The present invention has been described in particular detail with respect to one possible embodiment.
