{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ARTS","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to a photovoltaic system and, more particularly to a controlling apparatus for use in a photovoltaic system including a solar tracker and a solar cell array.","The azimuth and elevation of the sun relative to a place on the earth change during a day. A conventional photovoltaic system includes a solar cell array. The solar cell array cannot be aligned to the sun based on the spin of the earth. Therefore, there is no way to take the advantage of the highest intensity of the sunlight at any given time of a day.","There have been devised solar trackers for photovoltaic systems to track the sun and align the photovoltaic system to the sun. Such a solar tracker includes a frame, a first motor, a second motor, a controller and a sensor. The frame supports a solar cell array. The first motor drives the frame and therefore changes the azimuth of the solar cell array. The second motor drives the frame and therefore changes the tilt of the solar cell array. The controller controls the first and second motors based on signals transmitted from the sensor. The sensor is located on the frame to detect the azimuth and elevation of the sun relative to a place on the earth where the photovoltaic system is located. The structures of such solar trackers are often complicated. The maintenance of such solar trackers is difficult and often requires technicians.","Moreover, current photovoltaic systems are limited to direct use, without monitoring the optimal respondent angle and direct normal angle in a certain place on the earth and the efficiency of the conversion of direct currents into alternating currents with inverters. The layouts of the current photovoltaic systems are not optimal, and the maintenance is difficult and requires a lot of resources and high costs.","The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in prior art.","It is the primary objective of the present invention to provide a controlling apparatus for use in a photovoltaic system including a solar cell array, an inverter and a solar tracker including a solar position sensor, a controller connected to the solar position sensor, a first motor connected to the controller for rotating the solar cell array according to the azimuth of the sun and a second motor connected to the controller for tilting the solar cell array according to the elevation of the sun.","To achieve the foregoing objective the controlling apparatus includes a central unit, a basic unit, a diagnosis unit, a maintenance unit, a security unit and a check unit. T basic unit is operable in an alignment mode, a night mode and a restoration mode under the control of the central unit. The basic unit determines the direction of driving the solar tracker in the alignment mode, instructs the solar tracker to lay the solar cell array horizontally in the night mode, and executes a restoration mechanism after repair and maintenance of the solar tracker in the restoration mode. The diagnosis unit is connected to the central unit for scrutinizing the solar position sensor of the solar tracker, and scrutinizing the first and second motors and the inverter if determining the operation of the solar position sensor to be normal. The maintenance unit is operable in an initialization mode and a download mode under the control of the central unit. The maintenance unit acquires data of errors of the azimuth and elevation of the solar cell array after installment and re-installment of the solar tracker in the initialization mode, and downloads control programs from the controller of the solar tracker in the download mode. Under the control of the central unit, the security unit is operable in a storm mode when the wind speed reaches a certain value and a seismic mode in an earthquake. The security unit skips the solar position sensor and instructs the solar tracker to lay the solar cell array horizontally in the storm mode, and skips the solar position sensor and instructs the solar tracker to lay the solar cell array horizontally in the storm mode. The check unit is connected to the central unit for checking a clock built in the controller of the solar tracker, and synchronizing the clock of the controller of the solar tracker with a clock built therein if determining the time told with the clock of the controller of the solar tracker to be different from its own time.","Other objectives, advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description referring to the attached drawings.","Referring to , a solar tracker  for use in a photovoltaic system includes a solar position sensor , a controller  connected to the solar position sensor , a first motor  connected to the controller  and a second motor  connected to the controller . The solar position sensor  senses the sunlight and sends signals to the controller . Based on the signals, the controller  determines the azimuth and elevation of the sun relative to a place on the earth where the photovoltaic system is located. Based on the azimuth of the sun, the controller  instructs the first motor  to rotate a solar cell array of the photovoltaic system. According to the elevation of the sun, the controller  instructs the second motor  to tilt the solar cell array. An inverter  is connected to the solar cell array. A controlling apparatus  according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is connected to the solar tracker .","Referring to , the controlling apparatus  includes a central unit  for controlling a basic unit , a diagnosis unit , a maintenance unit , a security unit  and a check unit . The basic unit , the diagnosis unit , the maintenance unit , the maintenance unit , the security unit  and the check unit  are operable independent of one another.","Under the control of the central unit , the basic unit  is operable in an alignment mode , a night mode  and a restoration mode . In the alignment mode , the basic unit  determines the direction of driving the solar tracker . In the night mode , the night mode , the basic unit  instructs the solar tracker  to lay the solar cell array horizontally for protection in bad weather. The restoration mode  is initiated after repair and maintenance of the solar tracker .","The diagnosis unit  scrutinizes the solar position sensor  of the solar tracker . If the solar position sensor  is normal, the diagnosis unit  scrutinize the motors  and  and the inverter .","The maintenance unit  is operable in an initialization mode  and a download mode . In the initialization mode  the maintenance unit  acquires data of errors of the azimuth and elevation of the solar cell array after installment or re-installment of the solar tracker . In the download mode , the maintenance unit  down loads control programs from the controller  of the solar tracker .","The security unit  is operable in a storm mode  and a seismic mode . When the wind speed reaches a predetermined value, the security unit  enters the storm mode  to skip the solar position sensor  and instruct the solar tracker  to lay the solar cell array horizontally. In an earthquake, the security unit  enters the storm mode  to skip the solar position sensor  and instruct the solar tracker  to lay the solar cell array horizontally.","The check unit  checks a clock built in the controller  of the solar tracker . If determining the time told with the clock of the controller  of the solar tracker  to be different from its own time, the check unit  synchronizes the clock of the controller  of the solar tracker  with a clock built therein.","If direct normal irradiance (\u201cDNI\u201d) on the photovoltaic system is lower than a predetermined threshold (the unit is W\/m) for a predetermined period of time, the central unit  will acquire the azimuth and elevation of the solar tracker  compare the same with track data and start the alignment mode  of the basic unit  to send a STOP signal to the controller  of the solar tracker . On receiving the STOP signal, the controller  orders the solar tracker  to stop tracking the sun.","If the DNI on the photovoltaic system is higher than the threshold, i.e., the elevation of the sun is higher than a predetermined angle, the central unit  will start the alignment mode  of the basic unit  to send an ACT signal to the controller  of the solar tracker . On receiving the ACT signal, the controller  instructs the solar tracker  to start tracking the sun.","After sunset, the central unit  starts the alignment mode  of the basic unit  to send a RETURN signal to the controller  of the solar tracker . On receiving the RETURN signal, the controller  actuates the first motor  to return the solar cell array to the east. The tracking of the sun will begin again after sunrise tomorrow morning.","Moreover, the central unit  starts the night mode  of the basic unit  to send a LIE signal to the controller  of the solar tracker .
