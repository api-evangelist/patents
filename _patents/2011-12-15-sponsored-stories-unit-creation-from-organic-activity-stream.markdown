No. 13\/020,745, entitled \u201cSponsored Unit Creation from Organic Activity Stream\u201d, filed on 3 Feb. 2011.","This disclosure hereby incorporates by reference commonly-owned U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 13\/044,506, entitled \u201cEndorsement Subscriptions for Sponsored Stories\u201d, filed on 9 Mar. 2011.","This disclosure hereby incorporates by reference commonly-owned U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 13\/212,356, entitled \u201cComputer-Vision Detection for Sponsored Stories,\u201d filed on 18 Aug. 2011.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present disclosure for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the disclosure described herein.","Social networks, or social utilities that track and enable connections between users (including people, businesses, and other entities), have become prevalent in recent years. In particular, social networking websites allow users to communicate information more efficiently. For example, a user may post contact information, background information, job information, hobbies, and\/or other user-specific data to a location associated with the user on a social networking website. Other users can then review the posted data by browsing user profiles or searching for profiles including specific data. Social networking websites also allow users to associate themselves with other users, thus creating a web of connections among the users of social networking website. These connections among the users can be leveraged by the website to offer more relevant information to each user in view of the users' own stated interests in their connections.","A system, such as a website, that allows users to interact with the system typically stores a record for each users of the system. These records may comprise information provided by the user as well as information gathered by the system related to activities or actions of the user on the system. For example, a system may require a user to enter information such as contact information, gender, preferences, interests, and the like in an initial interaction with the system, which is stored in the user's record. A user's activities on the system, such as frequency of access of particular information on the system, also provide information that can be stored in the user's record. The system may then use information provided by the user and information gathered about the user, to customize interactions of the system with the user. For example, a website selling books may keep track of a users previous purchases and provide the user with information on related books during subsequent interactions with the system. Information in a user's profile may also be used by the system to target sponsored stories that are of interest to the user. Using information collected from and about users results in a system that is more efficient and beneficial for both the user and the system.","Users interacting with the social network may post stories or status updates to a live activity stream, such as a \u201cnews feed.\u201d A news feed is a data format typically used for providing users with frequently updated content. A social networking system may provide various news feeds to its users, where each news feed includes content relating to a specific subject matter or topic, and\/or other users. Various pieces of content may be aggregated into a single news feed. In some implementations, a social networking system may provide a news feed that includes selected entries corresponding to activities of a user's first-degree contacts and\/or pages or topics that a user has indicated an interest. Individual users of the social networking system may subscribe to specific news feeds of their interest. A group of related actions may be presented together to a user of the social networking system in the same news feed. For example, a news feed concerning the event organized through the social networking system may include information about the event, such as its time, location, and attendees, and photos taken at the event, which have been uploaded to the social networking system.","Generally, news feeds are customized for each member; only the status updates and stories posted by their connections are displayed. In this manner, members of the social network may quickly access their direct connections' status updates, story postings, and other interactions with the social network in a single stream, obviating the need to individually check their connections' profile pages.","However, given the vast number of contacts the average member of a social network has, and the prodigious amounts of status updates posted by users, it is possible that stories of interest to the user are lost in the unending stream of their newsfeed. Furthermore, sponsors may wish to pay for permanence of a particular story in members' newsfeeds. This functionality unavailable in typical social networking systems.","Sponsored or promoted stories are generated from actual stories in users' newsfeeds and promoted to a specific area of the user's web browser when viewing the social networking website. Sponsored stories are more likely to be viewed by users, because they generally involve interactions or suggestions by their connected friends, or fan pages that they are connected or subscribed to. Sponsored stories may additionally utilize computer vision algorithms to detect products in uploaded images or photos lacking an explicit connection to the sponsor on the social networking system.","In particular embodiments, any user of the social networking system may generate sponsored stories, even if they do not administer the object or node that is the subject of the sponsored story. In particular embodiments, the sponsor may designate particular objects\/nodes and actions on the object\/node, to boost to a sponsored story area. In particular embodiments, the objects, object instances, or actions may be customized in the social graph by the node administrator. In particular embodiments, the node administrator may define a set of permissions that permit sponsoring a portion or all of its objects or object instances, or for all or a portion of actions on those objects\/object instances.","Particular embodiments relate to a social networking environment including a social networking system and related systems that integrate individual stories, status updates, and user interactions with an advertising system. A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and then add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Once they are members of the social network, the users may interact with the social network itself, by posting stories and status messages on their own page, other users, by commenting, posting stories, etc. on other users' pages, or with non-user entities, such as fan pages that they subscribe to, online deals they redeem or subscribe to, or locations that they check in to.","Implementations of the present disclosure extend these concepts by allowing sponsors or specific users to export by promoting specific newsfeed stories to sponsored story space on users' social networking pages, thereby increasing the permanence and viewing frequency of these stories. In one example, a user may want to promote one of his news stories so that more of his connected friends can see the story in a more frequent and permanent view. For example, a sponsor who publishes an application, such as a social networking game, may wish for status updates generated with its application to have permanence on the application user's friends' homepages. In another example, a sponsor associated with a page on the social network, may want to promote news stories when a user connects to the page on the social network or to an object associated with the sponsor off network. In another example, the proprietor of a store may wish to promote news stories to a user's friends when that user \u201cchecks-in\u201d, or indicates that he physically visited, the store. In another example, the proprietor of a store may wish to promote news stories to a user's friends when that user subscribes, purchase, or redeems a deal or coupon associated with the sponsor. Other embodiments are readily envisioned by the disclosure and are described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","140","100","120"]},"Client devices  comprise one or more computing devices that can receive member input and can transmit and receive data via network . For example, client devices  may be desktop computers, laptop computers, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or any other device including computing functionality and data communication capabilities. Client devices  are configured to communicate via network , which may comprise any combination of local area and\/or wide area networks, using both wired and wireless communication systems. Third party website  and action terminal  are coupled to network  for communicating messages to social networking website  about the members' actions off website .","Social networking website  comprises a computing system that allows members to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein. Social networking website  stores member profiles that describe the members of a social network, including biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or preferences, location, and the like. Website  further stores data describing one or more relationships between different members. The relationship information may indicate members who have similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history. Additionally, the social network host site  includes member-defined relationships between different members, allowing members to specify their relationships with other members. For example, these member-defined relationships allow members to generate relationships with other members that parallel the members' real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. Members may select from predefined types of relationships, or define their own relationship types as needed.","A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. In particular embodiments, nodes representing members, businesses, places, or products on a social network may be connected by various types of interdependency or relationships. Each member of a social network is represented as a node, and each connection between two members is represented as an edge linking the two corresponding nodes. Edges represent a particular interaction between two nodes, such as when a user expresses an interest in a news article shared by another user about a particular topic. The social graph may record interactions between users of the social networking system as well as interactions between users and objects of the social networking system by storing information in the nodes and edges that represent these interactions.","Custom graph object types and graph action types may be defined by third-party developers as well as administrators of the social networking system to define attributes of the graph objects and graph actions. For example, a graph object for a movie may have several defined object properties, such as a title, actors, directors, producers, year, and the like. A graph action, such as \u201cpurchase,\u201d may be used by a third-party developer on a website external to the social networking system to report custom actions performed by users of the social networking system. In this way, the social graph may be \u201copen,\u201d enabling third-party developers to create and use the custom graph objects and actions on external websites.","In particular embodiments, nodes may represent any entity on the social network. For example, a concept node may exist for a broad generalized concept, such as \u201cbasketball.\u201d As another example, a store or chain of stores may be represented by a node on the social network, such as \u201cSports Authority.\u201d Even more particularly, every single product sold may be represented as a node on the social network; a node may exist for \u201cNike Air Zoom Kobe IV\u201d shoes. In particular embodiments, third-parties may create object types, such as, for example, \u201crecipes\u201d that may be interacted with via custom actions, such as \u201ccooked\u201d or \u201csaved.\u201d In particular embodiments, instances of objects, such as particular recipes in the previous example, may be created by third parties.","In particular embodiments, third-parties may create actions for nodes or objects that they do not administer. For example, third-party developer OpenTable may create an action \u201cmake reservation\u201d on nodes representing restaurants. In such an embodiment, when a user performs a search for a particular restaurant, the social networking system may include all action calls on the node. In particular embodiments, the node or object administrator may control the actions that may be performed on his or her nodes.","Third-party developers may enable users of the social networking system to express interest in web pages hosted on websites external to the social networking system. These web pages may be represented as page objects in the social networking system as a result of embedding a widget, a social plugin, programmable logic or code snippet into the web pages, such as an iFrame. Any concept that can be embodied in a web page may become a node in the social graph on the social networking system in this manner. As a result, users may interact with many objects external to the social networking system that are relevant to a keyword or keyword phrase, such as \u201cJustin Timberlake.\u201d Each of the interactions with object may be recorded by the social networking system as edges. Enabling third-party developers to define custom object types and custom action types is described further in \u201cStructured Objects and Actions on a Social Networking System,\u201d U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/249,340 filed on 21 Sep., 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system may integrate with third party websites via an application programming interface or script calls to the social networking system servers. In particular embodiments, third party websites may query the social graph using a specialized set of graph protocol functions for any information relating to a particular user, such as which of the user's first-degree connections have also visited third party website. In particular embodiments, third party websites may submit information regarding a particular user's purchases or browsing history, and the social networking system may dynamically generate object nodes for the products purchased, or, in particular embodiments, the pages visited. For example, if a user visits page containing a news article and clicks a \u201cshare\u201d or \u201clike\u201d widget that communicates with the social networking system, the social networking system may determine whether an object node already exists for the article, and, if not, dynamically create an object node for the article and connect the user node to the object node with a \u201cshare\u201d or \u201clike\u201d edge. This disclosure contemplates responding to any type of query to the social graph, and importing any type of object information into the social graph.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","250","260","160","270","280","175","205","210","215","220","245","230","100"]},"Web server  links social networking website  via network  to one or more client devices , as well as to one or more third party websites . Web server  may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between social networking website  and client devices  or third party websites . The messages can be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging technique.","Action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about member actions on and\/or off social networking website . Newsfeed generator  generates communications for each member about information that may be relevant to the member. These communications may take the form of stories, each story is an information message comprising one or a few lines of information about an action in the action log that is relevant to the particular member. The stories are presented to a member via one or more pages of the social networking website , for example in each member's home page or newsfeed page.","Ad server  performs an ad selection algorithm .

Examples of Sponsor GUI  are depicted in . The Sponsor GUI  provides a method for the sponsor to create story filters to locate specific types of news feed stories for promoting to the sponsored story space of a user's home page. Once the sponsor sets up its preferences for the types of stories it wishes to promote to the sponsored story portion, the sponsor specifications are stored into stream sponsored story specification database .","Any user may sponsor stories for any particular object or node in the social graph. For example, the store \u201cZappos\u201d may create an object instance for each make\/model shoe it sells, and define multiple custom actions that users may perform on the product. For example, Zappos may define shoes that may be \u201cwishlisted\u201d, \u201cpurchased\u201d, \u201csaved to my collection\u201d, or any other action Zappos wishes to design in addition to the standard \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d actions. In particular embodiments, third-party developers may define object instances that may be joined via custom graph actions, for example, a user may assemble an outfit with a collection of multiple object instances as a single story. While Zappos has the option of sponsoring stories generated by users interacting with its objects, object instances, or the node itself (for example, by posting on Zappos's wall), Zappos may not wish to pay for sponsoring such stories. In particular embodiments, a third party wishing to promote its products, such as the manufacturer \u201cNike\u201d, may with to promote stories generated by users acting on Zappos's objects. For example, although Nike has no administrator privileges over Zappos's node, Nike may wish to boost a sponsored story when a user \u201cpurchases\u201d a Nike shoe, offered by Zappos, to the purchasing user's friends.","In particular embodiments, sponsored story application  first checks in object privacy database  to determine the privacy settings of the node\/object administrator. For example, certain node administrators may wish to completely opt-out of having sponsored stories generated by actions on their node\/objects. In particular embodiments, node administrators may select pre-approved actions that may be boosted as sponsored stories. For example, a third-party may create a \u201cdislike\u201d or \u201chate\u201d action that may be performed on all nodes, including the node representing Zappos, as a form of consumer advocacy or corporate protest. Zappos may specify that only \u201cliked\u201d or \u201cpurchased\u201d actions may be promoted as sponsored stories. In particular embodiments, node administrators may utilize an administrator user interface  to define the privacy settings of a node, object, or object instance. In particular embodiments, a node administrator may independently define settings for each object or instance. In particular embodiments, a node administrator may define permissions for all its nodes\/objects\/instances globally. In particular embodiments, node administrators may have a default sponsored story permission setting that is automatically applied to all its nodes\/objects\/instances. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of managing sponsored story permissioning.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["310","310","310"]},"Node  includes objects A and B. Objects may be defined by the administrator of node . For example, node  may be a concept node for the store \u201cZappos\u201d, and object nodes A and B may be object types, such as \u201cshoes\u201d and \u201csocks.\u201d In particular embodiments, object B may be a particular product, such as \u201cNike Air Zoom Kobe IV.\u201d In particular embodiments, individual products may be represented on the social graph as object instances A-C. In particular embodiments, any degree of hierarchical levels may represent a single product. For example, the product \u201cNike Air Zoom Kobe IV\u201d may be represented, in particular embodiments, hierarchically or categorically, for didactic purposes, with the uppermost nodal level representing the object type \u201cshoes\u201d, followed by the category \u201cmen's\u201d, followed by the manufacturer \u201cNike\u201d, followed by \u201cAir Zoom Kobe IV.\u201d The degree of granularity per hierarchical level may be decided by the node administrator. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of hierarchically representing products, services, articles, or any other object, in the social graph.","In , object A includes three object instances A, B, and C. As previously discussed, an object instance may be any singular, uniquely referenced item defined by the node administrator. For example, object instances A-C may be particular shoes, cars, running paths, articles, menu items, or the like. Continuing with the Zappos example above, assume instance C is the specific shoe, \u201cNike Air Zoom Kobe IV.\u201d","User  interacts with object instance C by some action on or off the social networking system. For example, the user may \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d the shoe by clicking the \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d buttons on a product page. As previously discussed, the product page need not be hosted on the social networking system, they only need to have the correct social networking API calls embedded in the markup language for the product page. Hence, the product page may reside on the Zappos.com domain, yet communicate social actions to the social networking system via the social networking API. As described above, actions may be of any type and defined by the node administrator. After user  performs the action on instance C, the two nodes are connected via an action edge  in the social graph. In particular embodiments, actions may be custom defined by a node administrator. A custom action have an action definition and individual instances of that action between an individual user and an object.","Sponsor node  may be completely separate and independent from concept node or application . For example, sponsor node  in  may be Nike, and may additionally wish to sponsor stories of user interactions with its brand or shoes to the interacting user's friends A-N. Thus, in the example of , when user  interacts with the \u201cNike Air Zoom Kobe IV\u201d by, for didactic purposes, clicking the \u201cpurchase\u201d social networking button on Zappos.com, the social networking system generates a newsfeed story for the action (depicted by the dashed line in ), and Nike may pay for the boosting of the newsfeed story to the right-hand column of the friends A-N of user .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":"301"},"In step , sponsored story application  constantly monitors activity stream , searching for matches to any of the sponsored story specifications in stream sponsored story specification database . In step , the sponsored story system compares each story in the activity stream  to all stream sponsored story specifications in stream sponsored story specification database. If there is a match, the procedure continues to step , if not, it loops back to .","In step , upon finding a match, sponsored story application  accesses object privacy database  for the node owner. In particular embodiments, each object, object instance, or node has a different set of privacy settings. In particular embodiments, all nodes, objects, and object instances have the same privacy settings. In particular embodiments, the sponsored story privacy\/permissions settings have three general settings. First, the most restrictive setting may be a complete opt-out of all sponsored stories for the nodes and objects the administrator \u201cowns\u201d (has admin rights to). Thus sponsored story system cannot publish stories generated by actions on nodes having the complete opt-out permission. In particular embodiments, these stories are still published to the interacting user's and his or her friends' newsfeed, but cannot be published to an ad space, right-hand column, or any other portion of the social networking website as a sponsored story.","In particular embodiments, the second permission level permits sponsored stories to be generated from actions on nodes or objects, but only for a predetermined set of action types. For example, a particular node administrator may wish to permit sponsored stories, but only for \u201clikes\u201d, \u201cpurchases,\u201d \u201cfan\u201d and other positive actions. For example, a third-party developer may add custom actions to the node or object with negative connotations, such as a \u201chate\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d, button, that a node administrator may not want to be widely disseminated. As another example, particular actions may contain private information that users may not wish to have publicly boosted, such as when a user makes a reservation to a restaurant. Thus, the node owner is able to control what information and social actions are widely disseminated about its brand, stores, or the like, even if another entity is paying for the sponsoring of newsfeed stories.","In particular embodiments, the third and most liberal permission setting is a completely open setting. In such embodiments, stories generated by users interacting with nodes, objects, or object instances may be boosted as sponsored stories regardless of the type of action generating the story. For example, stories generated by custom actions defined by third parties who lack administrative privileges to the node or object may still be boosted.","At Step , sponsored story application  determines whether the object\/action pair is permitted by the node administrator to be sponsored. If not, the story entry is discarded, and the process returns to monitoring activity stream .","In step , upon finding a match and determining that the node administrator permits the boosting of the entry, sponsored story application  pulls the matching entry out of activity stream , and formats the entry into a predetermined visual specification. In particular embodiments, the visual specification is dictated by the social networking system to mimic a regular news feed story. In other embodiments, special identifiers may be added by the social networking system to indicate that the story is a sponsored story. In other embodiments, the visual specifications are entered by the sponsor through the Sponsor GUI  at the time of stream story specification. In such an embodiment, the visual specification is stored along with the story specification in the stream sponsored story specification database . In particular embodiments, the sponsor is given limited discretion as to the visual specifications for the promoted stream story, subject to predetermined constraints imposed by the social networking system.","In step , after the story is formatted pursuant to the visual specification or by the social networking system to visually comport with a news feed story, the sponsored story is passed to sponsored story system .","In step , after a social story is formatted into a sponsored story, it is priced and directed toward users in a similar manner as a social ad. In particular embodiments, the user may also add a weight to the story to alter its direction toward users. For example, certain stories may decay quickly, such as check-ins, and are not displayed to other users beyond a predetermined threshold time period from the story generation. In other embodiments, user-specified temporal factors, such as deadlines, may increase the weight of the sponsored story so that it is promoted over other sponsored stories lacking time sensitivity.","In particular embodiments, ad targeting is based upon an affinity score calculated by social networking website . A member may have affinities for other members, types of actions, types of objects, and content. Accordingly, a calculated affinity score may be based on a weighted function that takes into account the set of affinities for the particular member for each type of data field that is in a candidate story. The website may obtain a member's affinities based on the member's express interests (whether provided directly or indirectly, for example, through communications with other members) and\/or impliedly based on the member's actions (e.g., a member's checking of another member's page indicates an interest in that other member, or clicking on particular types of links may indicate an interest in similar links). An affinity, as measured for example by an affinity score, need not be an actual subjective interest or lack of interest that a member has for something (i.e., the member likes punk rock music, and dislikes vegetarian restaurants), but rather it may merely be a correlation between something in the candidate story and some information stored in connection with that member, whether is an action taken by the member, a communication involving the member, a characteristic, feature or expressed interest in the member's profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["306","305","301","3"]},"At Step , the social networking system receives a sponsored story specification via a sponsor user utilizing sponsor GUI . The operation of sponsor GUI  is described in greater detail in . The sponsored story specification is subsequently stored in story specification database .","At Step , sponsored story application  accesses object privacy database , and determines whether the privacy settings for the node, objects, and actions match the specifications in the sponsored story specification. In particular embodiments, sponsored story application  checks each object instance-action pair in the sponsored story specification against the allowed actions and object instances in the permissions for the node or object. For example, if the sponsored story specification requests to boost all stories on Zappos's object instances for the \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201cwishlist\u201d actions, sponsored story specification  may first determine which of the three permission settings the administrator of Zappos's node has selected; and if it is the second setting as described above, check each instance-action pair against the approved instances and actions.","If the administrator has selected the most restricted setting, or if none of the actions in the sponsored story specification are permitted by the node administrator, the process terminates and the sponsored story specification is rejected. In particular embodiments, sponsored story application  presents a dialog box to the user indicating that the selected objects or actions are not permitted for sponsoring. In particular embodiments, steps  and  occur simultaneously, and sponsored story application  greys out unpermitted objects or actions on sponsor GUI . This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of limiting requested objects, instances, or actions and informing the sponsoring user of the limitation.","In particular embodiments, at Step , sponsored story application  generates a modified sponsored story specification containing only the object\/action pairs that are permitted for boosting by the node administrator. In particular embodiments, this specification is stored in stream story specification database , and the original story specification is stored in a separate storage area that is not searched by sponsored story application . In particular embodiments, the modified sponsored story specification replaces the original specification.","In step , sponsored story application  constantly monitors activity stream , searching for matches to any of the sponsored story specifications in stream sponsored story specification database .

The sponsored story system  accesses a database of user privacy preferences when determining which users to display the sponsored story to. For example, if a user has previously specified that he or she does not wish to see sponsored stories from a particular company, the sponsored story system will not display stories promoted by that particular company. In particular embodiments, sponsored story system  accesses the visibility and privacy settings of the user that generated the newsfeed story to be promoted, and uses the settings in determining which users to display the promoted story to. For example, a user may have multiple friend lists, and members belonging to one or more different lists may be prevented from viewing specific stories, types of stories, or the user's newsfeed altogether. sponsored story system  respects these settings so that only friends of the user who are granted access to view the newsfeed story to be promoted are displayed the promoted stream sponsored story. This disclosure contemplates various methods of determining which users to display element  to as envisioned by those of ordinary skill in the art. Newsfeed  includes newsfeed stories -. These stories are generated specifically for a user based upon the activities the user's friends or other entities the user is associated with. Newsfeed story is an example of a newsfeed story that has been selected for promoting to sponsor space . When the sponsored story application  detects a match in the activity stream  to an sponsor's stream sponsored story specification from the stream sponsored story specification database , the sponsored story  is formatted to resemble a news feed story and sent to the sponsored story system .
