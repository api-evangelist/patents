{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel substituted imidazopyridazines, to processes for their preparation, to their use, alone or in combinations, for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for production of medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","By forming cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in disorders which are based on a disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of heme. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","In recent years, some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, WO 00\/06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives, and WO 03\/095451 carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines. WO 2008\/031513 describes inter alia substituted imidazopyridines and imidazopyrimidines as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase. 4-Amino-5,5-dimethyl-5,7,dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidones having imidazopyridine and -pyrimidine substituents are disclosed as sGC activators in WO 2010\/065275.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as potent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"38.69mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09150580-20151006-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"in which","Ris (C-C)-alkyl or benzyl,\n\n","A is N or C\u2014N(R)\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014R,\n\n","and the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides or salts thereof.","Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds, comprised by formula (I), of the formulae mentioned below and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts and the compounds comprised by formula (I), mentioned below as embodiments, and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, if the compounds, comprised by formula (I), mentioned below are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","In the context of the present invention, preferred salts are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the compounds according to the invention.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids, e.g. salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the compounds according to the invention which, in the solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of solvates in which the coordination is with water. Solvates preferred in the context of the present invention are hydrates.","The compounds according to the invention may, depending on their structure, exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or else optionally as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers, and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically uniform constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the compounds according to the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than that which occurs usually or predominantly in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, such as, more particularly, those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be of benefit, for example, for the study of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to the comparative ease of preparability and detectability, compounds labeled particularly with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore, in some cases, also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","Moreover, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Here, the term \u201cprodrugs\u201d refers to compounds which for their part can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents, unless specified otherwise, are each defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a linear or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
