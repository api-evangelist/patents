The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/112,848, filed Nov. 10, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.","This invention relates to organically templated three-dimensional framework compositions consisting of transition metal polyhedra with arsenate or phosphate tetrahedra, particularly vanadium-containing compositions, and properties and uses thereof.","Electrically conducting zeotype frameworks offer a new approach to energy storage technologies. In particular they offer new opportunities in electrical charge storage applications, such as in ultracapacitors, battery electrodes, and ion conducting membranes. Tailored materials with mono-dispersed pore size distribution and large pore density per unit volume have the potential to provide optimal electrical energy storage, in terms of both energy density and power density.","High-surface-area activated carbonaceous materials are most often used for electrical energy storage, but these materials possess random pore sizes and broad distributions leading to sub-optimal charge packing. Nano-carbon material promises better pore size and distribution over mesoporous carbon, but has proved difficult to produce in bulk. While nanostructured materials such as zeolites show more efficient packing than the above materials, they have previously been produced only in electrically insulating forms.","The development of different options for improving electrical energy storage capabilities is essential to meet the current and future requirements for efficient use of electrical energy in applications. New materials are needed to improve charge storage capabilities by increasing both the energy and the power densities, as well as achieving faster recharge times. Electrically conducting framework materials are crucial to the development of new charge storage materials. Porous electrically conducting frameworks allow for high storage densities and for new strategies in which materials simultaneously exploit multiple charge storage and mobility mechanisms. Particularly desirable are microporous zeotype electrically conducting frameworks where pore sizes range from sub-nanometer to 2 nm, and are roughly the size of hydrated and\/or solvated ions and small molecules.","Ultracapacitors are of particular interest in the field of electrical energy storage devices. The capacitance of the electrical double-layer (EDLC) forms the basis for ultracapacitors, where the layer is formed between mobile ions in an electrolyte and an electrically conducting plate. The capacitance per unit area is high, due to the short charge separation distance characteristic of ionic double-layers typically atomic in scale. The high attainable capacitance forms the basis for widespread similar electrolytic capacitors. An ultracapacitor adds to this a large effective area of the capacitor plate by employing a porous conducting medium as electrode. The capacitance values correlate with pore dimension and ion size, with pore size distribution, and pore density per unit volume. Thus an electrically conducting microporous zeotype material would function as an ultracapacitor material. A conducting zeotype material may also have additional uses as a novel semiconductor material for electronics and optics applications, in addition to properties and applications already known for zeolities and zeotypes such as catalysis, sorption, separation, ion-exchange membranes, etc.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for the development of conducting microporous zeotype materials for use as ultracapacitors in energy storage applications.","It is an object of the present invention to provide electrically conductive compositions having a vanadium arsenate or vanadium phosphate framework with tunnels and cavities. The tunnels and cavities of the frameworks of the compositions of the present invention may house water molecules and\/or organic cations. The water molecules and organic cations may also be replaced, either in whole or in part, by inorganic cations.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide methods for synthesizing electrically conductive compositions having a vanadium arsenate or vanadium phosphate framework. The methods of the present invention involve the mixing of vanadate with arsenate or phosphate reagents, organic template, water, and optionally an acid.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide media for charge storage applications, chemical catalysis, adsorption and separation reactions containing the compositions of the present invention. The compositions of the present invention can provide greater energy density for capacitors, ultracapacitors, battery electrodes, and ion conducting membranes. The compositions are also useful for novel memory and electronic and\/or optoelectronic devices.","The following words and phrases are used in this specification as defined below.","\u201cMicroporous\u201d is used in its common meaning and refers to materials having pore diameters less than 2 nm.","\u201cMixed conductor\u201d is used in its commonly understood meaning and refers to a material in which both electronic conduction and ionic conduction contribute to electrical conductivity.","\u201cOxo-vanadium arsenate\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cvanadium arsenate.\u201d","\u201cZeolites\u201d are microporous, aluminosilicate materials where the framework is formed by Al and Si tetrahedra and where the framework delineates channels and\/or tunnels that may intersect to yield cavities and pores that house extra-framework constituents.","\u201cZeotype materials,\u201d while not aluminosilicates, are similar to zeolites wherein a framework delineates channels\/tunnels and cavities and pores that house extra-framework constituents. In both zeolites and zeotypes, the extra-framework constituents present as part of the synthesis step may be exchanged after the initial synthesis step with other ions\/molecules.","In general embodiments of the present invention, there are provided compositions that may act as mixed conductors, including microporous mixed conductors; vanadium arsenate mixed conductors, vanadium phosphate mixed conductors, and mixed conductors including a framework (such as, e.g., a vanadium arsenate framework) which shows electronic conduction. The compositions of the present invention may also include a set of extra-framework constituents (such as, e.g., extra-framework constituents comprising an organic template and water; extra-framework which can be exchanged; etc.) which show ionic conductivity. Preferred examples of the compositions of the present invention are microporous vanadium arsenate and a microporous vanadium phosphate, with microporous vanadium arsenate more preferred.","In embodiments of the invention where a vanadium arsenate framework is used, an organoammonium template may be used as an organic template, forming a mixed conductor. In certain embodiments, the organoammonium template is piperazine. It is also contemplated that other organic templates besides organoammonium templates, which produce electrically conducting vanadium arsenate, may be used. In embodiments of the invention where a vanadium phosphate framework is used, methenamine may be used as an organic template, forming a mixed conductor. It is also contemplated that other organic templates, besides methenamine, which produce an electrically conducting vanadium phosphate, may be used.","For the microporous materials of the present invention, preferably the microporous material has pore sizes ranging from about 0.3 nm to about 0.7 nm, more preferably pore sizes of about 0.5 nm. However, it is also contemplated that the microporous materials may have smaller or larger pore sizes. The term pore size, as used herein, may be applied interchangeably to the size of tunnels and cavities in the compositions of the present invention, and these size ranges also apply to tunnels and cavities as presented herein.","In certain embodiments of the compositions of the invention, the compositions are crystalline vanadium compositions that include, as determined by x-ray diffraction, a three-dimensional covalently-bonded framework made up of VOpolyhedra, VOoctahedra and AsOtetrahedra. The connectivity of the covalently-bonded three-dimensional framework generates tunnels and cavities that may have a size range of about 0.3 nm to about 0.7 nm. In other embodiments of the present invention, the AsOtetrahedra may be replaced with phosphate tetrahedra.","It is contemplated that the compositions of the present invention may have frameworks that contain defects in their structure, e.g. frameworks that have deviations from a perfect crystal structure. These defects may arise during the normal synthesis process. It is recognized that these defects may affect the conductivity of the frameworks of the compositions of the present invention.","The tunnels and cavities of the compositions of matter of the present invention may house organic cations and\/or water molecules. Organic cations that are contemplated include cyclic di- or multi-amines, di- or multi-amines, or amines (e.g., NH\u2014(CH)\u2014NH), NH\u2014R\u2014NH, or R\u2014NH, where R may be an alkyl or an aryl group). In certain embodiments, when the composition includes AsOtetrahedra, the organic cation is piperazine. In certain other embodiments, when the composition includes phosphate tetrahedra, the organic cation is methenamine.","It is also contemplated that the tunnels and cavities of the compositions of the matter of the present invention may house inorganic cations such as Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs. Organic cations in the framework may be exchanged through intercalation reactions where single crystals or pressed powder pellets of the compositions of the present invention are placed in aqueous salt solutions containing the inorganic cation of interest. It is further contemplated that the tunnels and cavities of the compositions of the present invention may house both organic and inorganic cations within the same composition.","In another embodiment of the complexes of the present invention, the complexes are represented by Formula I:\n\n[AsVVVVO][(CNH)(CNH)(CNH)][(HO)(HO)(OH)]\u2003\u2003(I);\n","where VAC is a vacancy and where 0<x<9; 0<y<9; 0<VAC<1, where x, y and VAC each can be an integer or non-integer; +i is +3, +4 or +5, where 0<n<6; 0<n\u2032<6; 0<n\u2033<6 where n, n\u2032 and n\u2033 each can be an integer or non-integer; and where 0<m<24; 0<m\u2032<24; 0<m\u2033<24 where m, m\u2032 and m\u2033 each can be an integer or non-integer.","In certain embodiments of the invention, the complexes are represented by Formula I where 7<x<9, 1<y<3, VAC is 0, the summation of n, n\u2032 and n\u2033 is between 4.5 and 5.5 and the summation of m, m\u2032 and m\u2033 is between 12 and 18.","As with the embodiments described above, the tunnels and cavities of Formula I may house organic and\/or inorganic cations.","In another embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are vanadium oxide arsenate compositions having been characterized by a framework having a generic formula characterized by Formula II:\n\n[AsVVVVO]\u2003\u2003(II);\n","where VAC means a vacancy and where 0<x<9; 0<y<9; 0<VAC<1, where x, y and VAC each can be an integer or non-integer; and +i is +3, +4 or +5.","In this embodiment of the invention, the tunnels and cavities of the framework formed by Formula II may house inorganic and organic cations as is described above.

The structure is shown looking down the crystallographic a axis (), as well as looking down the 111 direction (). The structure crystallizes in a cubic space group, and a preferred embodiment is for the structure to be solved in the space group Im m.","A preferred example of a microporous framework for use in the invention is a microporous framework that can intercalate various other ions and or molecules into the framework, such as, e.g., alkali, alkali earth, metal cations, amines, di or multi amines, cyclic mono di or multi amines, and alcohols.","The frameworks of the present invention will possess favorable electrical properties which can be characterized using techniques well known in the art. Certain, non-limiting examples of techniques which can be used can be found in the Examples set forth below. An example of electrical characterization is the dependence of resistance on the temperature of the framework and any constituents present.","Without wishing to be bound by theory, the compositions of the present invention may demonstrate mixed conductivity, e.g. both ionic and electronic conductivity. For example, there may be constructed a vanadium arsenate that is a mixed conductor having electronic conductivity due to the vanadium arsenate framework and ionic conductivity due to organic cations and water housed inside the tunnels and cavities.","The present invention also contemplates methods for the synthesis of the compositions of the present invention. In preferred embodiments, the reagents used in the synthesis of the compositions of the present invention include at least one organic template (such as, e.g., cyclic di- or multi amines, di or multi-amines, or amines (e.g., NH\u2014(CH)\u2014NH), NH\u2014R\u2014NH, or R\u2014NH), at least one vanadium source (e.g. V, VO, NHVO, NaVO, KVO), at least one tetrahedral linker (e.g., PO, AsO), and\/or at least one metal cation (e.g., alkali or alkali earth metals), and\/or an acid source.

Conductivity values were obtained from the resistivity values.","Samples were thermally treated to 573 K under a flow of Ngas. The thermal treatment expels the organic template and water molecules out of the framework. The temperature of the thermal treatment was chosen from the thermogravimetric analysis data. I-V curves were obtained on single crystals with two contacts, and conductivity values extracted from the data.

Exchange reactions, e.g., with alkali cations, show that certain ions can efficiently replace template molecules used in the synthesis of the inventive framework. Further, the exchanged frameworks sustain ion conduction. Applications for uptake, conduction and release of ions include, e.g., ultracapacitors of high energy density and battery technology. The conducting exchanged zeotype shows electrochemical reactions occurring on the ions under applied potential, where the framework functions as an electrode. That capability is useable in electrically controlled catalysis, in electrically activated separation, and in battery technology.","The zeolite-like materials of the present Example present high effective area, due to the unusually dense and regular network of channels and pores defined by the crystal structure. Pore dimensions in microporous zeolites are influenced by the synthetic conditions, allowing control over the pore size and its distribution. The double-layer concept carries over to a zeolite-like material. A positive charge residing in a zeolite pore may induce a distribution of compensating charges from electrons in a framework (such as a framework shown in ). In this example, the double-layer separation is, as usual, atomic in scale, leading to high capacitance in this geometry. However, for zeolite-like materials to serve as EDLC charge storage units, a framework is needed that supports electronic conductivity such as an oxo-vanadium arsenate zeolite-like material.","The oxo-vanadium arsenate of this Example was synthesized through hydrothermal methods. The 3-dimensional framework of this material, as obtained by single crystal x-ray diffraction, is depicted in , and delineates channels that run down the 3 crystallographic directions. Extra-framework constituents, here the organic template organoammonium cation, and water (omitted from the figure for clarity), are situated in the channels which intersect along the diagonals of the cube. The framework shown in  is generated from idealized coordinates for the framework atoms in the space group Im m. The structure exhibits disorder potentially influencing the measured electrical characteristics. The presence of the organic template is crucial for the isolation of this particular material. The material was microporous, with accessible pore dimension of 0.5 nm. The extra-framework constituents within the pores of the as-synthesized material were removable by heating under an inert atmosphere or through intercalation reactions. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates the temperatures at which the extra-framework constituents were expelled, recorded as a loss in weight of the sample. Weight loss started around 340 K, and by 370 K a considerable weight loss had occurred, attributed to the loosely held water inside the pores. A second weight loss occurred around 470 K, and a third around 600 K, attributed to tightly held water and the organoammonium template inside the pores, respectively. Above 600 K, the framework pores were void, leaving an empty framework which was stable up to 770 K.","The zeolite-like material in this example exhibited mixed conductivity: ionic due to the extra-framework constituents, and electronic due to the framework. We investigated the contributions and interplay of the parallel ionic and electronic conduction pathways through measurement of the electrical conductivity (\u03c3) as a function of temperature (T). Conductivity values are obtained from electrical resistance measurements on single crystals contacted with silver epoxy. The measured room temperature conductivity of a cube with 50 \u03bcm edge is \u03c3=3.3\u00d710Ohmcm. The contribution of the ionic conductivity (\u03c3ion) may be obtained by subtracting the electronic conductivity (\u03c3el) due to the empty framework from the total conductivity (\u03c3tot), because both the parallel electronic and ionic conductivities contributed to \u03c3tot, attributable respectively to the framework and the extra-framework constituents (here water plus organoammonium ions). We plotted the various \u03c3, as log (\u03c3) vs T (). Initially, \u03c3ion (triangle) increased as T increased, but, around 380 K, the trend leveled off. Indeed, \u03c3ion was influenced by the loss of extra-framework ions resulting in a decrease in protonic conduction and a hydration dependent change in ion mobility. Deriving reliable values of \u03c3ion above 380 K was further influenced by the fact that at higher T, \u03c3el eventually dominated \u03c3tot. Reliable measurements of \u03c3ion extended to 420 K only, although \u03c3ion was obtained up to 465 K. In short, for T>380K, the measured \u03c3tot was dominated by the electronic contribution, while at low T, \u03c3tot was dominated by the ionic contribution. The decrease in water and organoammonium ions at the higher T influenced \u03c3el, as \u03c3el then, within the accuracy of the data, increased above the value obtained for the full framework. Hence, both conduction mechanisms were interdependent, as expected if the presence of extra-framework ions led to more localized electronic states, reducing the mobility.","To access electronic transport, measurements were performed on the empty framework, namely material where the extra-framework constituents were expelled from the pores under a thermal treatment. As mentioned above, when the material was heated up to 600 K, the extra-framework constituents\u2014here water plus organoammonium\u2014were expelled yielding an empty framework. The framework was back-filled with N, and kept under an overpressure of N, to avoid reoccupation of the channels with water for subsequent measurements. We observed \u03c3el increasing exponentially with increasing T, indicative of non-metallic conduction. The T dependence did not follow standard expressions for 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional Mott variable range hopping, or for activation across an energy gap, excluding these known mechanisms of electron transport even when accounting for the effective dimensionality (1, 2, or 3) of electron dynamics in the framework. Electronic conductivity in the material is likely influenced by coupling to the ionic degrees of motion, with polaron-like contribution.","Next, we investigated the ionic contribution, defined as \u03c3ion=\u03c3tot\u2212\u03c3el. For the T dependence of \u03c3ion, we plotted data up to 420 K. Above 380 K, \u03c3ion saturated to a near constant value, as extra-framework constituents (water plus organoammonium) are expelled from the framework. A simple Arrhenius-activated model of ionic transport did not fit well. A better fit was obtained upon considering channeling of ions through a sublattice of attachment sites in the framework, through a mechanism that at least includes phonon-assisted hopping. Theoretically, \u03c3ion then obeys T\u03c3ion\u221dexp(\u2212E\/kT), where Edenotes a characteristic activation energy required for ion hopping from attachment site to attachment site (see ). This relation was borne out experimentally with E\u22480.50 eV, and indeed physically led to an acceptable picture of ion conduction in zeolite-like materials, where channels and attachment sites can be identified within the framework.","The vanadium framework of this example was robust towards intercalation. The organoammonium cation was exchangeable with inorganic cations, and e.g., the K exchanged framework exhibited no change in its crystalline framework as determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction. The robustness of the framework, coupled with the electronic characteristics observed, yield a good candidate for EDLC applications. In a capacitor, the stored energy U is expressed by U=\u00bd C V=\u00bd QV, where C is the capacitance, Q the stored charge and V the voltage. A high Q per material volume is an advantage, realized by the high pore density in a zeolite-like material. Equivalently, U increases when C increases, and a high C is realized in zeolite-like EDLCs by the electrical double-layer storage and high effective area. Thus an electrically conducting zeolite-like material would provide favorable U (i.e., substantially-increased).","Referring to , which is a schematic diagram of an EDLC , the two frameworks P, N in this Example are two conducting vanadium arsenate frameworks attached to an external voltage source V. An ion membrane  is located in-between, permeable to the electrolyte ions. Framework P is positively charged and hosts negative ions inside its structure. Framework N is negatively charged and hosts positive ions inside its structure. In series, frameworks P, N form a storage capacitor \u00bd C. Charging and discharging in principle does not consume material, promising the many charge-discharge cycles inherent in the capacitor concept. Preliminary calculations of energy stored in this vanadium arsenate structure indicate a factor of 5 to 8 increase in Q and C per material volume over mesoporous carbon (Pandolfo and Hollenkamp, J. Power Sources, 157, 11 (2006); Huang, et al., Angew Chem., Int. Ed. 47, 520 (2008)). Indeed, the effective area per unit volume of material, \u03b1, is approximated by \u03b1=6p\/D where p denotes the fraction of pore volume to total material volume and D denotes the average pore diameter. In the microporous vanadium arsenate with a pore diameter of 0.5 nm, p is higher and D is smaller than in mesoporous carbon, resulting in a substantial increase in C and Q. Preliminary capacitance measurements validate the calculated \u02dc8-fold increase.","A vanadium phosphate composition was synthesized using hydrothermal methods.
