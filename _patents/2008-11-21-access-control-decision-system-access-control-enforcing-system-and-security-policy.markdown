No. 10\/872,574, filed Jun. 22, 2004, now abandoned the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Ser. No. 10\/872,574 is based upon and claims benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application Numbers 2003-178033, filed on Jun. 23, 2003, 2003-315921, filed on Sep. 8, 2003, and 2003-315996, filed on Sep. 8, 2003.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to an access control decision system, an access control enforcing system, and a security policy, in which an organizational security policy can be applied to an information processing system and an organizational security can be improved for not only digitalized documents but also a paper documents.","2. Description of the Related Art","While office works have been digitalized in business, importance of managing a digital document such as a confidential document has been increased. Thus, recently, an access control for the digital document is conducted in accordance with a predetermined security policy.","In a viewpoint in that the security for the digital document is secured by the security policy being uniformed over an organization, a describing method of a security policy and an apparatus for transmitting the security policy is proposed (for example, refer to Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2004-102907). Moreover, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2004-094401 discloses a method for distributing the security policy and an apparatus for operating based on the security policy. Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-299712 discloses a method and an apparatus for controlling printing a digital document by encrypting and decrypting the digital document in accordance with the security policy.","Moreover, since a system which object to sell digital contents mainly such as music data, image data, and the likes has a problem similar to a company secret management, similar technologies are applied to this system (for example, refer to Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 8-263441, U.S. Pat. No. 5,715,403, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 8-263438, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,971). In particular, a system is provided in that a condition should be satisfied when digital data (such as the music data, the image data, and the like which are called digital work) relating to a copyright. A protocol is disclosed to confirm whether or not the condition for exercising a security is satisfied. By using this technology, it can be realized to use the music data and the image data being distributed under a condition of a payment of referring to and printing the music and the image, or a restriction of a term of using without any charge.","However, these inventions described above do not take the company secret management at an office into account but do aim at sales of the digital contents. Accordingly, these inventions do not consider an access control including a printed matter output by copying the confidential document.","Furthermore, a system for conducting various processes for a print (for example, refer to Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2000-122977 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,233,684). For example, Glyphe code can be embedded into a printed matter. However, it is required to define information to be embedded for each document.","Furthermore, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2001-184264 (FIG. 1 and FIG. 2) discloses an access control sub system configured by a policy evaluation module for determining an access allowed or not-allowed in accordance with a policy, an enforcement function verification module, and an enforcement module.","However, the above-described conventional technologies have the following problems such as a lack of flexibility of an operation and a like:","Conventional Technologies","cannot manage related persons for each document since the related persons are variously changed for each document in a case in that a policy regulates \u201cAvailable for Related Persons to Refer\u201d,","cannot flexibly correspond to various stamps such as a confidential stamp, a top-secret stamp, an internal use only stamp, and a like in a case in that the policy regulates \u201cAffix Confidential Stamp for Copy\u201d,","cannot change a warning message (sentence) in response to a type of a document in a case in that the policy regulates \u201cWarn Users to Handle with Care\u201d,","cannot restrict to use within a zone even if the policy defines the zone to be \u201callowed zone\u201d to handle a document, and","cannot regulate and enforce a process in a case in that a paper document cannot be identified even if the paper document should be identified to control an operation with respect to the paper document.","Even if these above problems are solved, in order to uniformly conduct the access control in accordance with the organizational security policy, it is desired to completely separate a part for determining the access control in accordance with the policy from various application systems to share the part for determining the access control with the various application systems, and it is desired to separate the part for determining the access control from the part for actually enforcing the access control.","In addition, the conventional technologies cannot control an access in accordance with an abstract description such as the organizational security policy.","It is a general object of the present invention to provide an access control decision system, an access control enforcing system, and a security policy, in which the above-mentioned problems are eliminated.","A more specific object of the present invention is to provide an access control decision system, an access control enforcing system, and a security policy, in which an organizational security policy can be applied to an information processing system and securities can be secured for a paper document and a digital document.","The above objects of the present invention are achieved by an access control decision system including; an abstraction converting part converting first information indicated by an access decision request into second information being abstract higher than the first information when the access decision request for requesting an access control decision for subject information to be accessed is received; an access control decision part determining the access control for the subject information by referring a security policy being abstractly regulated based on the second information; and a decision result sending part sending a decision result showing the access control for the subject information by said access control decision part, to a request originator that sent the access decision request.","In the access control decision system according to the present invention, information for determining the access control can be converted into information having abstraction degree similar to an organizational security policy. Accordingly, it is possible to determine the access control in accordance with the security policy being abstract.","The above objects of the present invention are achieved by an access control enforcing system, including an access control enforcing part enforcing an access control for subject information based on access control information indicating a control concerning an access to the subject information in accordance with a security policy, wherein said access control enforcing part further includes a requirement capability determining part determining whether or not a requirement to execute the access can be executed, the requirement indicated by the access control information, and wherein the access control is enforced for the subject information based on a determination result by the requirement capability determining part so as to satisfy the requirement.","In the access control decision system according the present invention, it is determined whether or not the requirement to allow the access to the subject information is executable in accordance with the security policy. Accordingly, it is possible to enforce the access control for the subject information so as to satisfy the requirement.","The above objects of the present invention are achieved by a security policy, comprising a rule description showing a rule regulating whether or not an operation is allowed based on a first security attribute of subject information directed to the operation and a second security attribute of a user requesting the operation for the subject information, wherein the rule description regulates to allow the operation when a requirement is satisfied.","In the security policy according the present invention, it is possible to regulate to allow the operation by executing the requirement.","The above objects of the present invention can be achieved by a program code for causing a computer to conduct processes described above in the document processing apparatus or by a computer-readable recording medium recorded with the program code.","In the following, an embodiment of the present invention according will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.","A system applying an access control decision system according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated as shown in .  is a diagram showing a configuration of a system according to the embodiment of the present invention. In the system  shown in , a security server  for conducting an access control with respect to a digital document and a paper document is connected through a network to a document management system  for managing digital documents, a digital copier  including a plurality of different image forming functions served as a copy, a fax, a scanner, and a like, and a document viewer  for displaying the digital document at a client terminal  of a user.","In , the document viewer  is a predetermined application running for the client terminal . The client terminal  accesses a target document maintained in the document management system . The user  may make copies of the paper document brought with the user by the digital copier . The system shown in  may include a plurality of client terminals  and users .","Hereinafter, the digital document, which is managed by the document management system  and to which an access is controlled, is referred to as a server document . The paper document, which is copied by the digital copier , is referred to as a paper document . The digital document, which is downloaded from the document management system  and stored in a local storage of the client terminal , and opened and referred to by the document viewer , is referred to as a portable document .","When the user  connects to the document management system  by using the client terminal  and attempts to access to the server document , the document management system  obtains authentication information from the user  and sends a request of a user authentication to the user management server . The document management system  sends an access control decision request to the security server  based on an authentication result received from the user management server . The document management system  accesses the server document  based on access control information received from the security server .","Similarly, when the user  copies the paper document  by the digital copier , the digital copier  obtains the authentication information from the user  and sends a request of the user authentication to the user management server . The digital copier  sends the access control decision request to the security server  based on the authentication result received from the user management server . The digital copier  copies the paper document  based on the access control information received from the security server .","Similarly, when the user  executes the document viewer  at the client terminal  and displays the portable document  at the client terminal , the document viewer  obtains the authentication information from the user  and sends the request of the user authentication to the user management server . The document viewer  sends the access control decision request to the security server  based on the authentication result received from the security server . The document viewer  displays the portable document  or further outputs the portable document  displayed at the client terminal  based on the access control information received form the security server .","When the user management server  receives the authentication information of the user  from the document management system , the digital copier , or the document viewer , the user management server  refers to a user management table  and authenticates the user . The user management server  sends the authentication result to the document management system , the digital copier , or the document viewer , which sent the request of the user authentication.","The security server  includes a policy file  in that access control rules are described for an organization, a user security level table  for managing a user security for each user , a document profile management table  for managing a profile for each document, a zone management table  for managing the access control for each zone, and a print profile management table  for managing information concerning a print for each print. The security server  corresponds to the access control requests from the document management system , the digital copier , and the document viewer  by using a policy file  and these tables  through .","In the policy file , a rule such as \u201cAccess Allowed for Related Persons Only\u201d is regulated. However, a relationship showing who is a related person for which document should be managed. A table complimenting this policy showing this rule is managed in the security server  and separated from the policy. If this rule is described in the policy, the policy becomes lack of versatility. That is, a portion stipulating \u201crule\u201d such as a company secret management regulation of the organization is stipulated as the policy, and portions being variously set corresponding to each document and for each user are managed by tables. Since a different \u201crule\u201d for each organization is managed in a form of the policy file , a replacement of each \u201crule\u201d becomes possible.","Hereinafter, the server document , the paper document , and the portable document  are generically called as a document  ().","A user, who can be the client terminal  or the user  and accesses the document , is called as an initiator .","The document management system , the digital copier , and the document viewer  are generically called as an application system .","In the system , the security server  is separated from the user management server . However, a function serving as the security server  and a function serving as the user management server  can be included in a single server computer.","An overview of the access control will be described with reference to  showing an access control model described in accordance with ISO\/IEC 10181-3.  is a block diagram showing the access control model.","In , when the initiator  sends an access request for accessing the document  to the application system , the application system  sends a decision request to the security server  to have the security server  determined whether or not the access from the initiator  is allowed after the user authentication. In particular, in a case in that the user authentication is not required, an access permit can be requested for an anonymous user or a guest user.","The security server  determines in accordance with the access control rule (policy) described in the security file  internally maintained in the security server  whether or not the user as the initiator  has the security to access the document , that is, whether the user is allowed or prohibited to access the document . If the user is allowed to access the document , the security server  determines a requirement that should be satisfied to access the document . Then, the security server  sends information showing that the user is allowed or not allowed and the requirement is satisfied or not, as a decision result, to the application system .","The application system  receives the decision result and processes an access requested from the user if the user is allowed. In this case, if the requirement is indicated, the application system  processes document  so as to satisfy the requirement. If the user is not allowed or the requirement is not satisfied, the application system  denies this access to the document .","Next, a hardware configuration and a functional configuration of the security server  will be described with reference to  and .  is a block diagram showing the hardware configuration of the security server according to the embodiment of the present invention.","In , the security server  is a server computer and includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit) , a memory unit , a display unit , an input unit , a communication unit , and a storage unit , each of which is connected to a system bus B.","The CPU  controls the security server  in accordance with a program stored in the memory unit . The memory unit  includes a RAM (Random Access Memory) and a ROM (Read-Only Memory), and stores the program to be executed by the CPU , data necessary to process by the CPU , and data obtained in the process by the CPU . In addition, the memory unit  is partially used as a work area used in the process by the CPU .","The display unit  displays necessary information by the control of the CPU . The communication unit  is a unit to communicate with the application system  when connecting to the application system , for example, through a LAN (Local Area Network) or a like. The storage unit  includes a hardware unit, and stores management tables including a policy file , a user security level table , a document profile management table , a zone management table , a print profile management table , and the like.","A program controlling the security server  is installed into a storage unit  beforehand.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","231","400","241"]},"The abstraction processing part  includes a user security level mapping part , a user category mapping part , a zone mapping part , and a document security attribute mapping part .","In the abstraction processing part , when user identification information, access type information, document identification information, and context information are received from the application system , the user security level mapping part  obtains an security level abstracted by referring to the user security level table  based on the user identification information (1), the user category mapping part  obtains a user category that is abstracted by referring to the document profile management table  based on the user identification information and shows a related person or any person (2), the access type information is maintained without any change (3), the zone mapping part  obtains a zone category that is abstracted by referring to the document profile management table  and the zone management table  based on the context information and shows in-zone or out-zone (4), and the document security attribute mapping part  obtains a sensitivity level and a document category that are abstracted by referring to the document profile management table  and the print profile management table  based on the document identification information (5).","In this embodiment, a term may be set in the context information so as to obtain a term segment showing in-term or out-term.","The mapping parts  through  may be included in a single abstraction processing part. In this case, this single abstraction processing part refers to more than one management table.","Alternatively, the security level and the user category can be categorized into a user security attribute, the sensitivity level and the document category can be categorized into the document security attribute, and the zone category can be categorized into an access environment attribute, so that three attributes are used to categorize. Accordingly, an abstraction processing part may be provided for each attribute. In this case, each abstraction processing part includes more than one mapping processing part and each mapping part refers to more than one table.","The policy base access control decision part  receives information being abstracted by the abstraction processing part  as a parameter, and determines the access control in accordance with the access control rule (policy) described in the policy file . The policy file  can be set from outside. Accordingly, it is possible to easily change in response to the organizational security policy.","In this embodiment, by processes in two steps of the abstraction processing part  and the policy base access control decision part , it is possible to determine the access control in accordance with general security policy and by flexibly corresponding to a change of the security policy.","In addition, by providing the abstraction processing part , it is not required to change a formation of information to provide to the application system  when the security policy is changed. Since it is not required to change software for the application system  in response to the change of the security policy, maintenance in response to the change of the security policy can be easily conducted.","The access control can be conducted so as to allow or prohibit what type of an access for which user by managing an ACL (Access Control List) for each document. And there is a conventional system (U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,450) in that this ACL is called a security policy. However, in the conventional system, since a policy is defined for each document, there is a problem in that it is difficult to know that the security policy is applied in accordance with a company secret management regulation (policy) of an \u201corganization\u201d such as \u201cconfidential matter is allowed only for related persons\u201d.","The security server  according to the present invention and determining the access control first separates a general decision rule for the access control and a security setting for details of each document, maps an attribute of a document or a user to an abstract security attribute, and then makes an access decision. In addition, since a general decision rule can be described as a policy file, the rule is not fixed but becomes replaceable.","There may be one example in that the decision rule may be programmed as one logic in software. However, There is no example in that the decision rule can be flexibly defined and set in accordance with the organizational security policy.","Data structures of tables managed by the security server  will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["251","250","252"]},"The userMap includes a user ID or a group ID shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString principalId;\u201d, a type of each entry a character string showing a user, a group, or a like by code - showing \u201cString entryType\u201d, a security level shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString levelId;\u201d.","An entry of userMap for each user  using the application system  is created in UserMapList and the user  is registered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0127"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["261","260","262"]},"The docProfile includes an digital document ID shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString docId;\u201d, a document category shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString DocCategory;\u201d, a sensitivity level shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString docLevel;\u201d, a list of a plurality of related persons shown by an array of related persons shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString[ ] relatedPersons;\u201d, a list of a plurality of zone IDs shown by an array of zone IDs shown by a character string by code - showing \u201cString[ ] zones;\u201d, a nondisclosure date shown by a date by code - showing \u201cDate nondisclosure\u201d, a retention date shown by a date by code - showing \u201cDate retention\u201d, and a validity date shown by a date by code - showing \u201cDate validity\u201d.","An entry of the DocProfile for each digital document subject for the access control is created in the DocProfileTale and the digital document is registered.
