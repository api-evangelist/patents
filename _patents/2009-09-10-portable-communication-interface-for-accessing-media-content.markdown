{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/191,896 filed Sep. 12, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to wireless devices and more particularly to wireless devices for accessing media content.","As portable electronic devices become more compact and the number of functions performed by a given device increases, it has become a significant challenge to design a user interface that allows users to easily interact with a multifunction device. This challenge is particularly significant for handheld portable devices, which have much smaller screens than desktop or laptop computers. The user interface is the gateway through which users receive content and facilitate user attempts to access a device's features, tools, and functions. Portable communication devices (e.g., mobile telephones, cell phones, PDA's, Blackberries, etc.) use various modes, such as pushbuttons, microphones, touch screen displays, sensors (e.g., accelerometers, proximity, etc.) and the like, to accept user input.","These portable communication devices are used to access a wide variety of content, including text, video, Internet web pages, and the like. Increasingly, very large volumes of content are available to be searched. However, the current portable communication devices lack adequate display systems and modalities to allow users to easily browse or view high-resolution media content.","Accordingly, improved systems and methods for using wireless devices to access content are required.","The present invention generally provides methods for accessing media with a portable communication device in combination with high-resolution display resources, such as an HDTV set or a computer monitor. Media content along with geographical and other related information is available to users through multiple displays or screens. In one embodiment, a two-screen service allows a user to navigate a world map on a portable communication device to track geo-located media content that matches his or her interests. The user can show a matching video on his portable communication device or direct a nearby display device, such as an HDTV set, to show the video on the TV screen. A three-screen service allows the user to view the information described above, and, in addition, the user can show a map on another computer screen, focusing on the area of interest. The user can also zoom in and out of areas of the world map. All the controls are performed on the portable communication device without relying on the typical TV remote controls or the computer input devices (such as keyboard or mouse). It should be noted that additional viewing devices may be used to augment the two and three screen services described herein.","These and other advantages of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","200","102","102","102","102","108","106","102"]},"Web server , in one embodiment, is a computer configured to provide an interface through which portable communication device  can access data stored in media archive  or media engine .

After the display devices are detected, the detected devices are associated with a portable communications device in order to facilitate the display of media on the external displays under the control of portable communications device .","In step , portable communications device  receives data related to media available for display. In step , the received data related to the media available for display is displayed to the user (in one embodiment, as pointers identifying a specific location on a map as described in detail below). In step , it is determined if user input has been received indicating a user selection of media to be displayed on portable communication device . If a user has selected media to be displayed, a request to output the selected media is transmitted to computer  and\/or media box  for output from one or more of displays  and  in step . If no user input has been received, the method proceeds to step  in which it is determined if a request has been received from the user to zoom in on a particular map location. If a user request to zoom in or out on an area has been received (in order to view a more detailed display of a particular area), the method proceeds to step  and the area of interest indicated by the user is displayed. If a user request is not received, the method loops back to step .","An implementation of the method shown in  and described above is described as follows. Portable communication device  receives data related to media available for display based on user preferences. The use of user preferences to identify information that may be of interest to a user prevents the user from being bombarded with large amounts of what the user may consider irrelevant. In one embodiment, user preferences include device-specific preferences. For example, a user may enter a preference indicating that all high definition media be output via a high definition display. In another example, a user may also enter a preference indicating that all media to be output from a specific portable device or a media engine be transcoded to a format the destination device is currently configured to output.","Network  includes various media and data sources such as news websites and video sharing sites. These media and data sources may be updated frequently. For example, a website providing news may be updated within hours, minutes, or even seconds after an event occurs. Other media and data sources may provide data that is updated less frequently. In one embodiment, media may also be from portable communication device . For example, device  may be configured to take pictures or video. Media engine  is configured to analyze data provided by data sources in network  and compare the media and data to user preferences. Media or data that is determined to be relevant to a user's preferences may be flagged or otherwise tagged indicating that the media or data may be of interest to the user. The media or data of interest to the user, in one embodiment, is downloaded or copied to media archive  to allow quick access to the media or data in response to a user request. It should be noted that user preferences may be default preferences. For example, prior to a user entering their specific preferences, the user preferences indicate that recent information from one or more news websites should be identified as media for potential display. In one embodiment, a user may record programs using media archive  in a manner similar to program recording using a Digital Video Recorder (DVR). In one embodiment, media engine  and data sources in network  are located remote from the location of other devices depicted in  such as displays  and . For example, media engine  and data sources in network  may be located at a service provider.","In one embodiment, the media or data determined to be of interest to a user is then analyzed by GeoTracker located on web server . GeoTracker is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/942,407, filed Nov. 19, 2007 and is incorporated by reference herein. GeoTracker takes an RSS feed, extracts locations from the RSS item descriptions, and then maps these locations to pins on a world map using the Google Map Application Programming Interface (API). In one embodiment, the RSS feeds mapped by GeoTracker are RSS feeds selected using a user profile including user specified keywords. In another embodiment, generic RSS feeds received from RSS provider , such as RSS feeds from Yahoo Top Stories, may be mapped by GeoTracker. In yet another embodiment, user specified search criteria or keywords may be transmitted as a search string to a search engine configured to search based on the received search string and return media, for example, an RSS feed that can be mapped by GeoTracker.","GeoTracker may determine one or more geographic locations to which each RSS item is related. For example, a wild fire burning in Santa Barbara, Calif. may be tagged with a location identifier indicating that the data is associated with Santa Barbara, Calif. Data may be assigned more than one location identifier. For example, a news item concerning a retailer who is outsourcing manufacturing to a foreign country may generate location identifiers for the headquarters of the retailer and the location of the foreign manufacturer.","A map is presented to the user on display  of device  as shown in .
