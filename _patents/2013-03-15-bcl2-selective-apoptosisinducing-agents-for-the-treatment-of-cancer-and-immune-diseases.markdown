{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/793,418, filed Jun. 3, 2010, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/631,404, filed Dec. 4, 2009, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/181,180, filed May 26, 2009, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/120,275, filed Dec. 5, 2008, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","This invention pertains to compounds which selectively inhibit the activity of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treating diseases during which anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are expressed.","Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are associated with a number of diseases and are under investigation as potential therapeutic drug targets. These targets for interventional therapy include, for example, the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-Xand Bcl-w. Recently, inhibitors of Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported in commonly-owned PCT\/US\/2004\/36770, published as WO 2005\/049593 and PCT\/US\/2004\/367911, published as WO 2005\/049594. While this art teaches inhibitors having high binding to the target protein, compound binding affinity is only one of many parameters to be considered. One goal is to produce compounds that preferentially bind to, that is, are selective for, one protein over another protein. To exhibit this selectivity, it is well known that a compound not only displays a high binding affinity to a particular protein but a lower binding affinity for another member as well.","A typical measure of binding affinity of an anti-apoptotic protein inhibitor is the balance between the binding and dissociation processes between the protein and the inhibitor (K). The inhibition constant (K) is the dissociation constant of an enzyme-inhibitor complex or a protein\/small molecule complex, wherein the small molecule is inhibiting binding of one protein to another protein. So a large Kvalue indicates a low binding affinity, and a small Kvalue indicates a high binding affinity.","A typical measure of cellular activity of an anti-apoptotic protein inhibitor is the concentration eliciting 50% cellular effect (EC).","Accordingly, the inventors have discovered that while compounds taught in the art have utility for the treatment of various cancers and immune diseases, they are not selective for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins over anti-apoptotic Bcl-Xproteins and thereby result in a higher probability of side effects characterized by inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-Xproteins such as, thrombocytopenia.","This invention therefore comprises a series of compounds that demonstrate unexpected properties with respect to their selectivity for binding to, and inhibiting the activity of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein over anti-apoptotic Bcl-Xprotein as significantly higher than those of the compounds taught in PCT\/US\/2004\/36770 and PCT\/US\/2004\/367911.","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts, prodrugs or salts of prodrugs thereof, which are useful as selective inhibitors one or more than one anti-apoptotic protein family member, the compounds having Formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.52mm","wi":"58.34mm","file":"US09073855-20150707-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Ais N or C(A);","one or two or three or each of A, B, Dand Eare independently selected R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NHSONHRor N(CH)SON(CH)R, and the remainder are independently selected H, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;

Compounds of this invention may contain carbon-carbon double bonds or carbon-nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration, wherein the term \u201cE\u201d represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen double bond and the term \u201cZ\u201d represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of \u201cE\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore, the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuration. For examples, see C. D. Jones, M. Kaselj, R. N. Salvatore, W. J. le Noble 1998, 63, 2758-2760 and E. L. Eliel, and S. H. Wilen. (1994) . New York, N.Y.: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Compounds of this invention contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration, in which the terms \u201cR\u201d and \u201cS\u201d are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem. (1976) 45, 13-10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount, preferably an excess of about 85%-90%, more preferably an excess of about 95%-99%, and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99%. Accordingly, this invention includes racemic mixtures, relative and absolute stereoisomers, and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.","Compounds of this invention containing NH, C(O)OH, OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug-forming moieties. The prodrug-forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed hydroxyl, amino or carboxylic acid in vivo.

Isotopes can be radioactive or non-radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine include, but are not limited to, H, H, C, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and\/or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.","In another embodiment, the isotope-labeled compounds contain deuterium (H), tritium (H) or C isotopes. Isotope-labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope-labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope-labeled reagent for a non-labeled reagent. In some instances, compounds may be treated with isotope-labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope, for example, hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO\/DO. In addition to the above, relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance, in Lizondo, J et al., 21(11), 1116 (1996); Brickner, S J et al., 39(3), 673 (1996); Mallesham, B et al., 5(7), 963 (2003); PCT publications WO1997010223, WO2005099353, WO1995007271, WO2006008754; U.S. Pat.

Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. 64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., J. 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., 77, 79-88 (1999).","In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called \u201cheavy drugs,\u201d can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl-2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic N et al. in \u201cDosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy\u201d, Zamenhof R, Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp. 125-134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).","Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.","Amides, Esters and Prodrugs","Prodrugs are derivatives of an active drug designed to ameliorate some identified, undesirable physical or biological property. The physical properties are usually solubility (too much or not enough lipid or aqueous solubility) or stability related, while problematic biological properties include too rapid metabolism or poor bioavailability which itself may be related to a physicochemical property.","Prodrugs are usually prepared by: a) formation of ester, hemi esters, carbonate esters, nitrate esters, amides, hydroxamic acids, carbamates, imines, Mannich bases, phosphates, phosphate esters, and enamines of the active drug, b) functionalizing the drug with azo, glycoside, peptide, and ether functional groups, c) use of aminals, hemi-aminals, polymers, salts, complexes, phosphoramides, acetals, hemiacetals, and ketal forms of the drug. For example, see Andrejus Korolkovas's, \u201cEssentials of Medicinal Chemistry\u201d, John Wiley-Interscience Publications, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1988), pp. 97-118, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.","Esters can be prepared from substrates of formula (I) containing either a hydroxyl group or a carboxy group by general methods known to persons skilled in the art.

The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032-OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand. For example, siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT-263, (i.e., N-(4-(4-((2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1-cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(morpholin-4-yl)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide) or ABT-737 (i.e., N-(4-(4-((4\u2032-chloro(1,1\u2032-biphenyl)-2-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide) in multiple tumor cell lines (Tse et. al, 2008, 68(9), 3421 and references therein).","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF, or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.","Alkylating agents include altretamine, AMD-473, AP-5280, apaziquone, bendamustine,

It also surprisingly demonstrates these compounds having comparatively less affinity for anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein, which in turn gives rise to high binding selectivity ratios (Bcl-xL K\/Bcl-2 K) ranging from >2 to >250,000. This selectivity for Bcl-2 protein is significantly greater than compounds previously disclosed in PCT US 2004\/36770 and PCT US 2004\/367911, as exemplified by ABT-737 in TABLE 2.","For some compounds (e.g., 192 and 193), the assay did not detect any activity against either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL under the conditions stated above in the experimental description for the FRET assay. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the upper and lower limits of detection in an assay are influenced by the assay conditions, and for the FRET assay specifically, by the concentration of the probe that is used. Since compounds represented by Examples 192 and 193 show Kvalues that are greater than the limits of detection in the assay format used, it can be stated that their affinity for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL is less than the upper limit of detection of the assays. However, they may still have affinity for one or both proteins, and the inventors expect that they also have selectivity for Bcl-2.","Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (prepared in-house according to conventional techniques) was incubated with ABT-737 (4-(4-((4\u2032-chloro-1,1\u2032-biphenyl-2-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N-((4-(((1R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylthio)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)benzamide) or compounds of the invention at various concentrations for five hours at 37\u00b0 C. After the incubation, platelets were equilibrated to room temperature for 20 minutes and then an equal volume of Cell Titer Glo reagent (Promega Corporation) was added. Samples were mixed for two minutes and then allowed to equilibrate for an additional 10 minutes at room temperature. The luminescence generated from the samples was quantitated using an LJL Analyst plate reader. ICvalues are concentrations of compound needed for 50% inhibition of cellular viability.","FL5.12 is an IL-3 dependent prolymphocytic murine cell line that undergoes apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal as a result of the upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bim and Puma. Stable overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (FL5.12\/Bcl-2) protects against apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal by sequestration of Bim and Puma. [Refs. Harada, et. al. 101, 15313 (2004); Certo, et. al. 9, 351 (2006).] The ability of compounds to kill FL5.12\/Bcl-2 cells upon IL-3 withdrawal is a direct measure of the compounds' ability to inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein function.","Wild type FL5.12\/Bcl-2 overexpressing stable transfectants were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin\/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 57 \u03bcM \u03b2-ME, and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (source of IL-3) and maintained at 37\u00b0 C. containing 5% CO. 1\u00d710cells\/ml were washed 1\u00d7PBS and resuspended in medium not supplemented with 10% WEHI-3B for 48 hrs prior to cytotoxicity assays. Cells were then treated for an additional 24 hrs in the presence of various concentrations of the indicated compounds.

FL5.12 is an IL-3 dependent prolymphocytic murine cell line that undergoes apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal as a result of the upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bim and Puma. Stable overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (FL5.12\/Bcl-2) protects against apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal by sequestration of Bim and Puma. (Refs. Harada, et. al. 2004, 101, 15313; Certo, et. al. 2006, 9, 351.) The ability of compounds to kill FL5.12\/Bcl-2 cells upon IL-3 withdrawal is a direct measure of the compounds ability to inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein function. Compounds of Formula I are very effective in killing FL5.12\/Bcl-2 cells under IL-3 withdrawal as demonstrated by low ECvalues.","Compounds of this invention bind to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with high affinity and potently inhibit the function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in a cellular context and are therefore expected to have utility in treatment of diseases during which anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein is expressed.","The anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein has been disclosed elsewhere (Mar. 23, 2007, 128, 1173-1176.) to be the major regulator of the survival of circulating platelets in animals. Genetic mutations to Bcl-xL protein that decrease Bcl-xL protein stability and half-life causes a decrease in platelet survival and life-span in mice bearing these mutations. A potent pharmacologic inhibitor of Bcl-xL, ABT-737, causes a rapid, concentration dependant decrease in circulating platelets following injection into C57BL\/6 mice or in beagle canines (Mar. 23, 2007, 128, 1173-1176. May 2007; 14(5), 943-51). Thus, without being limited by theory, compounds of this invention that have reduced affinity for Bcl-xL can be expected to show lower levels of platelet apoptosis than previously reported compounds with higher Bcl-xL affinity.","The effect of compounds on platelet survival can be directly evaluated ex vivo by examining the viability of isolated canine platelets in the presence of various concentrations of compound. The data in Table 3 shows that compounds of Formula I have significantly less to no effect on the viability of isolated canine platelets ex vivo (higher ECvalues) compared to compounds previously disclosed in PCT US 2004\/36770 and PCT US 2004\/367911, as exemplified by ABT-737. Furthermore, the functional selectivity ratio (canine platelet EC:FL5.12\/Bcl-2 EC) for compounds of Formula I ranges from 32 to 4849, which is significantly higher than that for compounds previously disclosed in PCT US 2004\/36770 and PCT US 2004\/367911, as exemplified by ABT-737.","Because compounds having Formula I bind to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein with comparatively lower binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-Xprotein, the compounds would have utility as medicaments for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune and immune diseases with reduction of the side effect of thrombocytopenia (i.e., they would be circulating platelet-sparing). Involvement of Bcl-Xin thrombocytopenia is disclosed in Mar. 23, 2007, 128, 1173-1176. As described herein and elsewhere, a potent inhibitor of Bcl-X, ABT-737, causes a dose-dependent decrease in circulating platelets following injection into C57BL\/6 mice or in canines (. May 2007; 14(5), 943-51). Compounds with reduced Bcl-Xaffinity exhibit substantially less to no decrease in circulating platelets. Thus, without being limited by theory, compounds of this invention that have reduced affinity for Bcl-Xcan be expected to show lower levels of platelet apoptosis than previously reported compounds with higher Bcl-Xaffinity. The ECdata in TABLE 2 show the effects of administration of compounds of this invention, compared to ABT-737, on canine platelets.","Involvement of Bcl-2 protein in bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, bone marrow cancer, cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, lymphoblastic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoid malignancies of T-cell or B-cell origin, melanoma, myelogenous leukemia, myeloma, oral cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma, prostate cancer spleen cancer, and the like is described in commonly-owned PCT US 2004\/36770, published as WO 2005\/049593, and PCT US 2004\/37911, published as WO 2005\/024636.","Involvement of Bcl-2 proteins in immune and autoimmune diseases is described in 2003, 3, 378-384; 2000, 110(3), 584-902000, 95(4), 1283-92; and 2004, 351(14), 1409-1418.","Involvement of Bcl-2 protein in arthritis is disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.
