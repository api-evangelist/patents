{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 09\/543,958, filed Apr. 7, 2000, now abandoned, and is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to a computer system that implements an automated review and approval system. In particular the review and approval system incorporates workflow procedures along with the ability to store frame accurate reviewer comments for a review of a video clip.","Conventionally, the process of producing an audio\/visual work such as a commercial, an infomercial, a television program, or a movie has involved recording and capturing the necessary content for both the audio and visual material, editing the content to produce a draft version of the finished work, and circulating the draft versions of the finished work for review to solicit approval for the work before distribution. Typically, the last step of reviewing the draft versions involves multiple iterations of review.","The review process is time intensive since multiple reviewers are involved, who are usually in different geographical locations. To distribute the work, tapes must be sent out to each reviewer, which in itself is time consuming. For efficiency sake, the reviews are generally performed in an ordered fashion to avoid conflicting change requests that might create delays. At each reviewing level in the hierarchy, a new set of tapes must be created that reflect the prior requested changes.","If the reviewer's comments are in the form of handwritten notes or voicemail, it may be difficult to correlate the comments to the precise location in the work. In order to assure accuracy of the comments at the frame level, the reviewer and the editor may need to review the work together on the phone. While this collaboration produces the desired result, it is also costly in time and expense, and again submits to the possibility of a misunderstanding.","What is needed is a Review and Approval system that permits efficient access by multiple reviewers to the content to be reviewed, and that promotes accuracy in correlating a reviewer's comments with the appropriate portion of the content. In particular, the comments should correspond to an individual frame of the content under review or a sequence of frames. Comments may then be saved and made available for later review.","The Review and Approval system of the present invention advantageously provides computer implemented access for a reviewer to digital content for the purpose of reviewing and approving the digital content. In one aspect of the invention, the digital content under review is an audio\/visual work.","In a further aspect of the invention, the digital content is a visual work that is comprised of digital frames. The digital frames are encoded using the Quicktime format.","In a yet further aspect of the invention, the Review and Approval system consists of cooperating software applications, one which is a client software component that executes at a client computer system while the other is a server software component that executes at a server system. The Review and Approval system of the present invention employs a client\/server architecture.","In a further aspect of the invention, the client software component and the server software component interface and communicate over a remote communications network.","In a still further aspect of the invention, the client software component of the Review and Approval system includes an Internet software browser for communicating over the Internet with the server system. The Internet software browser may also permit the execution of a JAVA\u00ae applet to implement portions of the Review and Approval system.","In a still further aspect of the invention, the digital content is stored at the server system and transferred to the client system for viewing using the Internet software browser. Video may be played at the Internet software browser at the normal speed at which it was recorded or on a frame by frame basis with the user determining when the next frame is played.","In a further aspect of the invention, a reviewer may enter comments into the Review and Approval system using the Internet software browser. The comments are associated with and correspond to individual frames or a duration of frames that are played by the Internet software browser. The comments are stored at the server system and made available for later viewing.","In yet further aspect of the invention, a reviewer using a pointing device may indicate a location on a frame of video played by the Internet software browser to which comments may apply. In this aspect of the invention, the video along with the pointer markings are stored at the server system and available for later viewing.","In a still further aspect of the invention, comments are entered into the Review and Approval system by recording speech that is input at the client system. The speech is correlated by the Review and Approval system with an individual frame of video data or a sequence of frames, and is transmitted to the server system for storage thereon.","In one aspect of the invention, multiple reviewers may access the Review and Approval system concurrently to review the same content. Each reviewer's comments are stored at the server system, and all the reviewer's comments are available for viewing. The comments are displayed according to the timecode of the video frame.","The drawings and specification illustrate an exemplary system and method of the invention. It is to be understood that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principals of the specific and preferred aspects of the invention. It is not intended to limit the broad aspects of the invention to the illustrated or exemplary embodiments thereof. The review and approval system (hereafter the \u201cR&A system\u201d), according to the present invention will now be described. The R&A system advantageously provides for the automated distribution of video and\/or audio clips to one or more reviewers to solicit approval for the work. The R&A system according to the present invention is described with reference to the review of video and audio clips for movies, commercials, infomercials, and the like. However, it is clear that certain aspects of the invention are not limited to a review and approval application for only video, audio or film clips, but have a broader applicability, and the following disclosure should be read in this light","Referring now to  there is shown in schematic form the environment in which the present invention operates. Client system  is a computer system on which a user invokes the R&A system of the present invention. Client system  is typically a personal computer (PC), but may also be a workstation, minicomputer or mainframe computer. One of ordinary skill in the art will clearly recognize that the present invention is not restricted to a specific computer system and is applicable to many different computer system configurations. Client system  is connected to a communication network  for transmitting and receiving data to and from a server system  that is also connected to communication network . Communications network  may be a Local Area Network (LAN), such as an Ethernet network, or a Wide Area Network (WAN), such as a packet switching network. Communication network  may also be a combination of a LAN and WAN, and is in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the Internet. The present invention does not require a specific communication network  to practice the invention, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many communication configurations are applicable to the invention. Server system  connects to communication network , and is capable of communicating with client system  through communication network . Client system  typically make requests to server system , and the server system  responds to the request by communicating back to the client system through the communication network . Client system  and server system  conform to the well-known \u201cclient\/server\u201d architecture. The foregoing discussion has been limited to only one client system and one server system for the sake of simplicity and clarity, but one of ordinary skill in the art will clearly recognize that the environment in which the present invention operates is not so limited. Multiple client systems and multiple server systems may be connected to a communication network  for the purpose of communication between the systems (both client and server systems).","For simplicity, the invention herein will be described in relation to a single client system and one server system, but again the invention is not so limited. Each reviewer in the review and approval process may use a different client system to access the R&A system, and communicate over the communication network . Communication network  provides for the ability to connect many client systems and server systems, and is only limited by performance considerations as is well known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","20","10","20","20","20"]},"Client system  includes a computer processing unit (CPU) , such as a Pentium III processor from Intel Corporation, for executing computer instructions, and a random access memory (RAM)  for storing computer instructions and digital data. CPU  communicates with RAM  via communication bus . A storage element , such as a magnetic or optical disk, for storing non-volatile digital data also connects to communication bus  through a disk controller . Communication bus  also allows communication of messages and data between storage element  and CPU  or RAM . Client system  further includes a network port  for communicating data over communication network , and an input controller , such as a keyboard  for keying in data, a pointer device , such as a mouse, or a microphone  for entering information into client system . Client system  also include a display device , such as a display monitor, for viewing multimedia data such as video clips and graphical information, and is interfaced to communication bus  through display controller .","Client system  executes computer software including computer instructions for implementing a review and approval system, in the preferred embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment of the invention, client system  executes an Internet software browser such as Netscape Navigator from Netscape Corporation of Mountainview, Calif. or Internet Explorer from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. for communicating over communication network  to server system  and uses the HTTP protocol to invoke the review and approval services at server system . Server system  includes computer software for executing portions of the R&A system, according to the present invention.","As shown in , the R&A system  includes R&A server software  that executes on server system , and interfaces, in one embodiment of the invention, to R&A client software  that executes at client system . In one embodiment of the invention, as shown in , R&A server software  interfaces to an Internet software browser , executing on client system . The Internet software browser , executing on client system , includes the R&A client software  that executes as a JAVA\u00ae applet  at client system . The R&A client software  typically resides on server system , and is transmitted from server system  to client system  for execution at client system  under control of a JAVA\u00ae virtual machine (not shown) incorporated in the Internet software browser . JAVA\u00ae is a software specification from Sun Microsystems of Mountainview, Calif. for executing a custom computer application in association with a web browser at the client system. JAVA\u00ae is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems. The R&A server software  and R&A client software  communicate using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for requesting and delivering data and the HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) for encoding the data. The HTTP protocol, JAVA\u00ae and HTML are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and thus there it is not necessary to describe them in further detail here.","The R&A server software  and R&A client software  execute as cooperative computer applications, and together implement the R&A system  of the present invention. While the preferred embodiment of the invention is implemented as a web browser application executing over the Internet, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the invention described herein can be readily implemented as two cooperative computer applications interfacing remotely over any suitable communications network or even as a single computer application in which the functionality of the server and client software are combined in one computer system.","Having described, in general, the hardware and software environment in which the present invention operates, further details of the R&A system will now be described. Again, the invention is described for illustrative purposes in relation to a R&A system for reviewing video, film, or audio clips, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that aspects of the invention are applicable to other review applications, and the scope of the invention is not contemplated to encompass only a review process associated with these media.","In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the R&A system  is invoked at client system  by initiating execution of an Internet web browser  as earlier described, and directing Internet web browser  to contact the R&A system  at server system  by addressing the system with a specific Universal Resource Locator (URL). In the preferred embodiment of the invention, Internet web browser  initiates R&A system  by addressing the URL, www.AvidProNet.com, and the R&A system will be described in relation to this embodiment.","After initiating contact with the R&A system  at server system  through Internet web browser , the R&A system may optionally required the user at client system  to \u201clogon\u201d to the system for identification purposes. The identification process allows the R&A system  to customize its response to the user, but this is not a requirement of the invention.","Review and Approval Workflow","With the \u201clogon\u201d process completed, the user of the system is presented with a user interface as shown in  for navigating through the R&A system . In the following figures, underlined text indicates that the text may be selected by an input device such as a mouse to solicit additional information that is associated with the text. The R&A system according to the current invention tracks the review process associated with a project. A project may consist of multiple tasks under review, and in the preferred embodiment each project includes media content having one or more media clips for review. The media clips may be either video or audio clips. The \u201cReview and Approval Administration\u201d user interface  provides information about the status of pending projects under review and permits the user to create a new project for review. The \u201cReview and Approval Administration\u201d user interface  indicates in a pending project list  that three projects are pending in the review process. One of the pending projects is the \u201cBalance Beam commercial\u201d  that includes a sequence of three reviews: roughcut two , roughcut two legal review , and a roughcut two rev  review. The review status is also presented for each of the reviews , , and . For example, the roughcut two  status indicates that 4 out of the 6 reviewers have reviewed the commercial. Since the text is underlined, further information is available for the roughcut two  review. The \u201cReview and Approval Administration\u201d user interface  also provides for the ability to create a project and review a directory of reviewers by choosing the respective selection option  or .","Selecting \u201cMy Reviewers List\u201d from \u201cReview and Approval Administration\u201d user interface , a user of the R&A system  is presented with a user interface  for adding or removing reviewers from a global directory of reviewers. The directory provides an easy mechanism to store a reviewer's data for later assignment to a project, and also permits the grouping of reviewers to provide an efficient way to assign multiple reviewers to a project. User interface  includes entry fields for entering a name , an email address  and optionally a group designation  for each reviewer. The group designation allows multiple reviewers to, be selected by a common designation. For example the all attorneys in the Legal Department could be selected as reviewers by specifying the group name \u201cLegal\u201d. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, each reviewer subscribes to the services provided at the web site www.AvidProNet.com (APN) by Avid Technology Inc. of Tewksbury, Mass., and thus an APN membership identifier can identify an individual. The \u201cMy Reviewers List\u201d user interface  also permits the creation of a group  and the deletion of a group , including optionally the deletion of all the reviewers associated with the group .","If a project is to be created as determined by the user in the \u201cReview and Approval Administration\u201d user interface , a \u201cCreate a Project\u201d user interface , as shown in , is presented to the user for soliciting a project name  and a description of the project .","Having specified a new project for review as shown in , the user is presented with user interface  for identifying clips that are to be reviewed by individual reviewers. The reviewers are selected from the list of reviewers  in the global directory that was earlier created. The selected reviewers are assigned a clip, which in the preferred embodiment of the invention is a video or audio clip, to review by identifying a clip  residing on server system  or specifying a path name to access the clip  on another system. A short description of the review  and the date for completion of the review  may be entered. Instructions  for the reviewers may also be entered in free form. Having completed the assignment process, the user submits the clip for review  to the designated reviewers. The reviewers are notified, in one practice of the invention, by email of their assignments, but other ways of notification are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention. For example, reviewers may be notified when they \u201clogon\u201d to the R&A system .","In  there is shown an example of an alternative embodiment of the invention in which the workflow process permits the reviews to be sent out in an ordered manner. For example, the project creator determines that a lawyer needs to see and approve the sequence before any other reviews take place. The creator selects the lawyer as the first reviewer, as shown in step , and indicates that the lawyer's approval is necessary before the sequence is sent on to the next reviewer. The lawyer completes the review, step , and indicates whether the sequence can be sent on to the next reviewer. If it is approved, step , notification is sent to the next reviewer, step , and notification of approval is sent to the project creator, step . If it is not approved the project creator receives notification of the rejection, step , and he can view the comments, step , and make the appropriate changes to the project before sending it out for review again, step .","In this embodiment of the invention, a template workflow is generated that ensures the correct order of review events based on the role a reviewer plays in a project. Templates provide a mechanism for the R&A administrator to build in both the correct business logic and correct role-based workflow for each project. For example, a firm is currently engaged in producing three different television programs, each of which has a set of reviewers and a correct order of review events. One program must have every sequence reviewed by the legal team before any further reviews can take place and their comments must be routed to both the project creator and the Executive Producer. Another program requires a legal review only at the end of the process. The third program requires that the Executive Producer and Producer be the first set of reviewers and that their reviews must occur simultaneously. The R&A administrator builds templates for each program and stores them on the R&A server. The project creator can then initiate a complete role-based workflow around a specific sequence with one click, ensuring correctness and minimizing the chance that a person will be skipped in the R&A process.","The R&A system  of the present invention also includes the ability to determine the status of the review process as shown in .  depicts a user interface  for displaying the status of individual clips assigned for review. The clip  is identified, and the review status  for each reviewer is reported. As is shown in , the review status  includes the group designation, if applicable, for each reviewer. A selection box  is provided for viewing the comments of those reviewers that have completed their review. The comments from all the reviewers who have completed their review may be viewed by selecting button , or only the comments of selected reviewers may be viewed by selecting button .","Referring now to , there is shown a list of all the completed reviewer's comments  for a selected clip . Comments  may be displayed by timecode, reviewer, or date of the comment. As was earlier discussed, the present R&A system  is described in terms of a review of video clips corresponding to a commercial, infomercial, movie or the like, and thus, in thus embodiment, a timecode identifies a frame of video.","The Review Process","Having described the process for assigning media content for review, according to the invention, the review functionality of the present invention will now be described. R&A system  will be further described with reference to video data. However, the invention is not limited to video data, but encompasses media content including but not limited to audio data, and graphical data. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, R&A system  is invoked at server system  by directing an Internet web browser  at client system  to contact a specific URL associated with R&A system , as earlier described. After a reviewer \u201clogs on\u201d to R&A system , the reviewer is presented with a list of assignments for review. Each assignment includes one or more video clips for review. A video clip consists of a series of video frames in digital form. Each video frame from the clip is associated with a timecode that uniquely identifies the video frame. In one practice of the invention, the video clips are encoded according to the QUICKTIME format from Apple Computer of Cupertino, Calif. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present invention is not limited or restricted to the QUICKTIME format, and other encoding formats may be used to practice the invention. The video clips for review are digitally stored on server system  and transmitted to client system  for playing the video clips during the review process. Consequently, client system  includes a video player to play the appropriate format. If the media content is audio, the audio is digitized prior to storage at server system , and partitioned into audio frames, having an appropriate number of digital samples for providing reviewer comments. The audio frames are ordered in a well-defined manner to uniquely identify them.","After selecting an assignment for review, the reviewer is presented, as depicted in , with a review user interface  at Internet web browser  on client system . Review user interface  includes a video window  for playing the video clip to be reviewed. Using buttons , the selected video clip can be played at normal speed or on a frame by frame basis. The clip can be played in a fast forward mode or reversed. For each frame displayed in video window , the timecode  of the frame is displayed. The review user interface  further includes a comment window  for entering comments in free form corresponding to the displayed frame. In one embodiment of the invention, the R&A client software  includes voice recording software for recording comments corresponding to the displayed frame that are orally entered through a microphone. The voice comments can be selected for an individual frame and played back for review. Voice comments may be stored in a \u201c.wav\u201d file, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other formats are acceptable for practicing the invention. In general the only requirement is that the voice which is associated with a particular frame be captured digitally for transmission to the server system . In yet a further embodiment of the invention, the R&A client software  includes support for voice recognition software such as supplied by Dragon Systems of Newton, Mass. for entering text into comment window  using a microphone. The voice recognition software converts speech to text, and the text is captured in the comment window. Review user interface  also includes a history window  that indicates a history, according to timecode, of the comments made for the video clip by a reviewer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["1210","1210","1230","1150","1220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1310","1140","1310","1320","1150","1150","1220","1150"]},"Review and Approval Interchange","In a further embodiment of the invention, R&A system  receives an R&A Interchange file that is generated by an editing system such as the Media Composer from Avid Technology, Inc., and incorporates comments produced at the editing system with the original comments of the reviewers. The comments generated at the editing system may be a response to original comments, and thus the R&A Interchange file provides allows a continuous dialog between the reviewers and the editors on the editing system.","R&A system  includes generating an R&A Interchange file for directly communicating R&A metadata with an editing system. R&A metadata may include without limitation the reviewer's identification, the comments of each individual reviewer, and the time of the reviewer's comments. The comments of reviewers can thus be integrated into the timeline by the editing system and are selectable on a frame basis by the editor. An example of such an editing system is the Media Composer\u00ae that is sold by Avid Technology, Inc. of Tewksbury Mass.","The R&A Interchange file is a TAB delineated file format with basic global information in the header. The data fields can be specific to already existing bin column data or can be extended by any custom data the user wishes to add on per clip basis. In the case of the R&A system , it permits additional information to be associated with a point in time (a frame) or optionally a duration (a series of frames).","Header information will describe the file type and global information as it relates to the review and approval process.","Header",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u201cFILE_TYPE\u201d will be \u201cR&A\u201d to specify that this is a Review and approval\u201d file and will not import directly into a bin.
