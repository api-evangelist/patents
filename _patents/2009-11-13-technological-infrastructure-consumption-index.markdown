{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["In general, embodiments of the invention relate to methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products for measuring consumption of technology resources within an enterprise business environment and, more particularly, providing for a technological infrastructure consumption index that creates a baseline for technological infrastructure consumption and serves to provide for measurement and management of technological infrastructure consumption.","In general, business entities, such as large corporate enterprises and the like, constantly strive to reduce costs. One of numerous cost reduction initiatives is related to reducing technological infrastructure costs, such as costs related to processing data, data storage, personal computing, servers, telecommunications and the like.","Costs associated with the technological infrastructure have two key components; (1) the internal rate charged, which may be defined as the total spent divided by the total capacity and, (2) the volume of infrastructure consumed, otherwise referred to as consumption. In this regard, the cost of the technological infrastructure is defined as the product of the rate times consumption (i.e., cost=rate\u00d7consumption). These two cost factors tend to be mutually exclusive in terms of control. For example, a line or business or other entity within a business may only have control over their volume of infrastructure consumption but they do not have control over the rate at which they are charged for the consumption. Conversely, other factors drive rate increases or decreases, which have no correlation on the volume of consumption required.","All too often, business entities make mandates to reduce technology expenses by a prescribed percentage or dollar amount. However, in many instances, while striving to achieve their goals for reducing technology expenses business entities fail to assess all of the key components that drive cost, i.e., rate and consumption, because the necessary granularity in the data, especially in terms of consumption, is not readily and consistently available. Without such readily available and consistent assessment of both rate and consumption, the business entity is unable to gauge whether cost increases or decreases are driven by rate or consumption fluctuations.","In addition, by prescribing percentage or dollar goals for reducing technological infrastructure costs, business entities tend to manage consumption in a traditional dollar\/percent goal manner, as if it was equivalent to cost or the only factor in overall cost. In doing so, business entities fail to comprehend that consumption is not the sole driving indicator of infrastructure cost and, moreover, failure to ascertain and comprehend other factors that influence variances in consumption.","Therefore, a need exists to develop a system for measuring and managing technological infrastructure consumption. The desired systems should provide for automatically generating a consistent and readily available indicator of a business entity's volume of consumption. In addition, the system should provide for identifying key consumption elements, which are within the control of application teams, as components of the indicator, thereby insuring that the key consumption elements are being tracked and managed on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the desired systems should provide for an indicator with drill-down capabilities for the purpose of readily accessing data associated with specific key consumption elements of interest. Additionally, the desired system should provide for an indicator that may apply enterprise-wide, as well as indicator's that may be applied to portions of the business-entity, such as lines of business or the like. As a result, the desired system should provide for ease of tracking technological infrastructure consumption across the enterprise and at sub-levels of the enterprise and provide delineation between the volume of technological infrastructure consumed and the internal rate at which the use of the infrastructure is charged.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments, nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments.

Additionally, the presentation application may be configured to present at least one of a key consumption element breakdown of the consumption index, an organization breakdown of the consumption index or a key consumption element and organization breakdown of the consumption index.","A computer program product that includes a computer-readable medium defines yet another embodiment of the invention. The medium includes a first set of codes for causing a computer to receive consumption data associated with a plurality of key consumption elements. Additionally, the medium includes a second set of codes for causing a computer to determine a consumption index for at least a portion of the business entity based on the consumption data and a third set of codes for causing a computer to store the consumption index.","Thus, systems, apparatus, methods, and computer program products described in detail below provide for a technological infrastructure consumption index.

The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more embodiments. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various embodiments may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such embodiments and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present invention now may be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure may satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","As may be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a method, system, computer program product, or a combination of the foregoing. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may generally be referred to herein as a \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-readable medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium.","Any suitable computer-readable medium may be utilized. The computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples of the computer readable medium include, but are not limited to, the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires; a tangible storage medium such as a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), or other optical or magnetic storage device; or transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet. Note that the computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of embodiments of the present invention may be written in an object oriented, scripted or unscripted programming language such as Java, Perl, Smalltalk, C++, or the like. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of embodiments of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages.","Embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems), and computer program products. It may be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and\/or combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create mechanisms for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block(s).","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer-implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block(s). Alternatively, computer program implemented steps or acts may be combined with operator or human implemented steps or acts in order to carry out an embodiment of the invention.","Thus, present embodiments herein disclosed provide for a technological infrastructure consumption index. The consumption index serves as an indicator of the volume of infrastructure being consumed within a business entity or a designated portion of the business entity. The consumption index is generated on an ongoing and predetermined schedule, such as monthly or the like to provide management with an easily identifiable indication of infrastructure consumption. The consumption index tracks key consumption elements, which have been identified through statistical analysis as the elements most affecting infrastructure consumption and within the control of application teams. By tracking these key consumption elements the index insures that the overall consumption of all elements of the infrastructure are being managed accordingly. Additionally, the consumption index provides for drill-down capabilities for the purpose of readily accessing and managing consumption data associated with specific key consumption elements of interest and specific teams\/organizations within the business entity.","Referring to  a block diagram is depicted of an apparatus  for tracking and managing technological infrastructure consumption within a business entity, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Technological infrastructure includes all facets of a business entities information technology environment, including but not limited to, hardware, such as mainframes (i.e., processing capabilities), servers, storage devices, personal computers and the like; telecommunications and the like. The apparatus  may be embodied in one or more devices; in multiple device embodiments the devices work in unison to provide tracking and management of technological infrastructure consumption. Apparatus  includes a computing platform  that includes at least one processor  and a memory .","The memory  of apparatus  stores a consumption index module  that is configured to track and manage technological infrastructure consumption through a measurable consumption indicator, otherwise referred to herein as the consumption index. Technological infrastructure consumption is measurable and is based on volumes consumed. Tracking and managing technological infrastructure consumption delineates the accountability of managing consumption from managing the other cost factor, the usage rate.","The technological index module  is configured to receive key element consumption data  from consumption data sources as shown and described in , infra. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, key consumption elements are initially identified as the key usage elements within the business entity or, if the consumption index is associated with a portion of the business entity, for example a line of business within the business entity, within that particular portion of the business entity. The key consumption elements are identified based on the volume of consumption associated with these elements being reflective of the overall consumption of the technological infrastructure within the business entity or the associated portion of the business entity. In this regard, by tracking and managing consumption of the key elements, the consumption index serves to manage consumption throughout the business entity and\/or portions of the business entity. In specific embodiments of the invention, statistical analysis is performed to identify the key consumption elements. It should be noted that key consumption elements are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, such as annual or the like, to assess their significance in terms of their respective effect on the consumption index. As part of the re-evaluation the defined key consumption elements may change over time, certain previous identified and tracked elements may be eliminated from the consumption index while other key consumption elements may added to the consumption index.","The key element consumption data  may be received by the consumption index module  on a predetermined schedule, such as monthly or the like, or on an as-needed basis. While in other instance, receiving the key element consumption data  may include accessing various databases and\/or data sources to capture\/retrieve the data on a predetermined schedule, such as monthly or the like, or on an as-needed basis.","The consumption index module  additionally includes consumption index logic  that is configured to determine a consumption index  based on the key element consumption data . The consumption index logic  may be embodied in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. In specific embodiments of the invention, the consumption index logic  may be configured to provide for an enterprise-wide consumption index based on enterprise-wide key element consumption data or the logic  may be configured to provide for one or more consumption indices associated with a portion of the business entity, such as a line of business, organization, team or the like, based on key element consumption data associated with the respective portion of the business entity.","As discussed in more detail infra. and in accordance with specific embodiments of the invention, the consumption index is baselined to a predetermined number, for example one hundred, one thousand or the like and each of the key consumption elements are weighted in relation to the baseline based on the key elements proportion to the total cost of all the key elements. In this regard, each of the key consumption elements has index sensitivity in relation to the baselined consumption index. The index sensitivity being a specified volume associated with each key consumption element if the index moves up or down a specified amount and movement of the index is solely attributed to that particular key consumption element.","Referring to  a block diagram is depicted that includes the apparatus  of  and the consumption data sources  that provide the key consumption element data  used to determine the consumption index , in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Thus, consumption data sources  may include, but are not limited to, processing and storage data , server data , consumable data  and telecommunications data . It should be noted that the consumption data sources may vary from business entity-to-business entity and\/or from one portion of a business entity to another portion of a business entity depending on the identified key consumption elements. In the illustrated example of , the identified key consumption elements are associated with the illustrative data sources, specifically processing and storage data , server data , consumable data  and telecommunications data .","In the illustrated example of  the business identity or portion of a business entity has identified eight key consumption elements from amongst all of the business entities or portion of the business entities technological infrastructure consumption elements. As previously, noted the number of key consumption elements that are included in the index will vary from business entity-to-business entity, amongst portions\/segments of the business entity and over time. Thus, the number \u201ceight\u201d in the illustrated embodiment and the identified key consumption elements are by way of example only. Additionally, as previously noted, the key consumption elements are identified based on their consumption volumes being reflective of the overall consumption of the technological infrastructure for the business entity or the portion of the business entity. In specific embodiments, statistical analysis is implemented to identify the key consumption elements. For example, Pareto-type analysis may be implemented to identify the 20% of the elements that represent 80% of the total cost. In addition, a combination of regression and affinitization type analysis may be implemented to determine and refine best fit categories. In one embodiment of the invention, step-wise regression type statistical analysis is applied to specific technological infrastructure elements, such telecommunication elements and consumable elements. Key elements within the telecommunication and consumable elements are identified based of a coefficient of determination (R) greater than 96%. In addition, affinitization analysis is performed on best fit categories to determine best key element subsets.","Thus, processing and storage data  includes exemplary identified key element consumption data for non-peak MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) , peak MIPS  and mainframe storage . Non-peak MIPS  and peak MIPS  are defined in terms of the hours of use and mainframe storage is defined in terms of a storage unit, such as a gigabyte or the like. Server data  includes exemplary identified key element consumption data for dedicated mid-range servers  defined in terms of the number of servers implemented. Consumable data  includes exemplary identified key element consumption data for computing devices , such as Personal Computers (PCs) and the like, and voice and data ports . Computing devices  are defined in terms of the number of computing devices implemented and voice and data ports  are defined in terms of the number of voice and data ports implemented. Telecommunications data  includes exemplary identified key element consumption data for inbound communications , such as inbound toll-free telephone calls, and conferencing , such as audio, video or other multimedia conferencing. Inbound communications and conferencing are defined in terms of minutes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","140","110","130","130"]},"Further, computing platform  also includes processor , which may be an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. Processor  or other processor such as ASIC may execute an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer that interfaces with any resident programs, such as consumption index module  or the like, stored in the memory  of apparatus .","Additionally, processor  includes various processing subsystems embodied in hardware, firmware, software, and combinations thereof, that enable the functionality of apparatus  and the operability of the apparatus on a network. For example, processing subsystems allow for initiating and maintaining communications, and exchanging data, with other networked devices. It should be noted that any of the modules, sub-modules, applications, logic and routines shown and described as being in memory  may alternatively be embodied in processing subsystems.","The memory  of apparatus  includes the aforementioned consumption index module  configured to track and manage technological infrastructure consumption through use of a consumption index . The memory of apparatus  may optionally include key consumption element identifier  that is configured to identify key consumption elements that comprise the consumption index. The identifier may include a statistical analyzer  that uses Pareto-type analysis, regression, and affinitization to automatically identify key consumption elements or candidates for key consumption elements. The key consumption element identifier  may be implemented at the inception of the technological infrastructure consumption management program and\/or periodically, such as annual, to re-assess and re-define key consumption elements and\/or on an as-needed basis, such as when an enterprise business entity adds or subtracts portions of the business entity (e.g., acquires a new business\/division\/subsidiary or sells-off\/eliminates a business\/division\/subsidiary).","As previously discussed, consumption index module  is configured to receive key element consumption data  via communications module . In one specific embodiment, the key element consumption data  includes, non-peak MIPS data , peak MIPS data , mainframe storage data , dedicated mid-range server data , computing device data , voice and data port data , inbound communications data , conferencing data  and any other key element data . As previously noted, key element consumption data is specific to the business entity or portion of the business entity associated with the consumption index. Further, key element consumption data may vary over time based on re-evaluation of the key consumption elements that are included within the consumption index. Hence, the illustrated examples of key element consumption data  are by way of example only. The other key element data  reflects data of other key consumption elements that may be identified as comprising the consumption index , either at the inception of the system or over time as the system is re-assessed and refined.","The consumption index module  includes consumption index logic  that is configured to determine a consumption index  based on the key element consumption data . As previous noted, the key consumption elements may be weighted key consumption elements  that are weighted in relation to a consumption index baseline based on the key elements proportion to the total cost of all the key elements. For example, if the consumption index is baselined to one hundred, the key consumption elements will be weighted such that aggregate sum of the weighted portions equals the baseline value, one hundred. The percentage of the baseline allocated to each key consumption element (i.e., the weight) may be determined based on the overall total spend (cost\u00d7units) of the key consumption element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["170","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]},"Returning the reader's attention to , in accordance with other specific embodiments of the invention the consumption index logic  is configured to determine a key element consumption score  for each of the key elements and aggregate the key element consumption scores as a means of determining the consumption index . In further embodiments, the key element consumption score  is a weighted key element consumption score. For example, if a key consumption element, such as non-peak MIPS, is assigned a weight of 27% of the overall consumption index and index sensitivity (i.e., a one point movement up or down of the consumption index) for non-peak MIPS is 342,100 MIPS hours, the weighted consumption score for non-peak MIPS for a specified consumption index period may be 25 (i.e., 27\u22122) if the non-peak MIPS decreased by 684,200 hours during the specified consumption index period.","Additionally, consumption index module  may include organization-specific consumption data identifier  that is configured to identify organization-specific consumption data  associated with a designated organization, team, line of business or any other designated portion of the business entity, in the instance in which the consumption index logic  is configured to determine a consumption index that is specific to that particular organization, team, line of business or any other designated portion of the overall business entity. In one such embodiment, the identifier  may implement a translator table  or the like that serves to identify the organization, team, line of business or the like associated with the consumption data. It should be noted that while the organization-specific consumption data identifier  is illustrated and described as being included within the consumption index module , in other embodiments it may reside external from the consumption index module . In such embodiments, the specified portion of the business entity to which the consumption data is associated, is identified prior to the data being received by the consumption index module .","In addition, consumption index module  may include consumption index impacter  this is configured to receive consumption related forecast\/impact data , such as consumption index forecasts, previous identified action plans based on the consumption index or consumption index variances and the like. Based on the forecast impact data , the impacter  may perform a predetermined action. The predetermined action may include, but is not limited to, modify the consumption index, identify the consumption index as being affected\/impacted by the forecast\/impact data  or recommend further correct action plans based on variances in the current correct action to a forecasted consumption index. It should be noted that while the consumption index impacter  is illustrated and described as being included within the consumption index module , in other embodiments it may reside external from the consumption index module .","In accordance with other specific embodiments, consumption index module  includes consumption index presentation application  that is configured to provide, via a communication network, a user interface for presenting a consumption index meter  and other information related to the consumption index. The application  may be a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application accessible via the Internet, an intranet or the like. An exemplary consumption index meter  is depicted in . The meter , as shown indicates a consumption index baseline of one-hundred (100). Thus, a consumption index above 100 indicates that consumption is above the baseline and a consumption index below 100 indicates that consumption is below the baseline. The consumption index meter  provides a user, such as a key stakeholder or the like, a readily available and easily ascertainable indication of the current state of technological infrastructure consumption.","In addition to the consumption index meter, application  may provide for presentation of other information related to the consumption index. For example, the application may be configured to provide a user drill-down capability, whereby the consumption index is broken down based on portions of the business entities, such as applications, teams, organizations or the like. It should be noted that if the consumption index itself is associated with a specific applications, teams, organizations or the like, the drill down capability may provide for further partitioning of the consumption index based on lower hierarchy within an application, team, organization or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","320","600","1","2","3","4","5"]},"Referring to  a flow diagram is provided of a method  for tracking and managing technological infrastructure consumption, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. At Event , key consumption elements are consumed during a designated period of time, such as month. The designated period of time will define the interval in which the consumption index is updated\/revised.","At Event , the key element consumption data is received or otherwise collected from data stores, repositories or the like. The receipt or collection of the data typically transpires on a predetermined schedule, for example a predetermined date\/time of month, to provide for determining the consumption index on a corresponding schedule. At Event , the received key element consumption data is transformed, as applicable. In specific embodiments transformation may include formatting the data for the purpose of identifying the consumption associated with the data. In other instances, transformation may include applying the designated weighting factor to the consumption data to determine a key element consumption score or the like. In instances in which the consumption index being determined is for a portion of the business entity, transformation may provide for the consumption data to be identified based on the portion of the business entity to which it is associated.","At Event , the consumption index is determined. In accordance with embodiments previously discussed, determining the consumption index may include one or more of applying a predetermined weight factor to the key element consumption data, determining key element consumption scores, and\/or aggregating the consumption scores to result in the consumption index. As previously noted, the consumption index is typically configured to be determined on a predetermined schedule, such as monthly or the like. In other instances, the consumption index may be determined on an as-needed basis or, if the consumption data is received proximate in time to the consuming action, the consumption index may be continually determined, so as to result in a real-time or proximate real-time consumption index.","Once the consumption index has been determined, at Event , the consumption index is analyzed for variance. The variance analysis may be compared to previous consumption indices, comparison to forecasts or any other analysis associated with a variance. If variances are identified, at Event , proper corrective actions are identified and, at Event , actions are taken or a corrective action plane is devised and initiated. Once the corrective actions are taken, the method returns to Event , where further key element consumption ensues. In addition, at Event , consumption index variances are recorded and stored in an associated database and, at Event , the consumption index is distributed to business entity management, key stakeholders and the like.

In specific embodiments, the consumption index is determined based on determining weighted key element consumption scores and aggregating the scores to result in the consumption index. In such embodiments the key elements are weighted based on the overall total spend (cost\u00d7number of units) of the key elements and the scoring is in proportion to the consumption index baseline value.","At Event , the consumption index is stored in computing device memory. In specific embodiments, the consumption index is analyzed for variance, corrective actions identified and taken and the variance is stored in the memory.
