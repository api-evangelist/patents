{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 61\/421,535, filed Dec. 9, 2010, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth.","This invention generally relates to computer network systems, and more particularly, to monitoring and detecting online accounts and online activities of minors by their parents and guardians.","Software solutions to help parents monitor their children's online accounts, participation in social networks, and other online activity can be categorized into two groups: native solutions and cloud-based solutions. Native solutions generally rely on software agents that are downloaded and installed locally on a computer, router, or other local node through which Internet traffic passes, the Internet traffic is monitored as it passes through. Native solutions can monitor this traffic for photos, text, friend requests, visited sites, and any other online activity that parents would be curious about. Cloud-based solutions are not installed locally, but rather monitor a child's activity by accessing the contents of the child's account and activity stream via network-based communication with the relevant sites and services, for example making use of the fact that many online sites expose application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) to developers for this very purpose.","There are strengths and weaknesses to each approach. The native solution is very proficient at capturing all traffic that passes through it. However, the native solution is blind to traffic and activity that occurs elsewhere on the Internet. This is especially noticeable as children increasingly have access to the Internet from phones, computers at school, friends' houses, and other non-traditional access points that a parent might not be able to access for the purpose of installing software. In contrast, a cloud-based approach can work consistently no matter where a child is accessing the Internet from. However, a major weakness of cloud-based solutions is that their initial setup usually requires the parent to initially identity the child on any social networking accounts of interest. Services exist which discover a child's accounts based on an identifier like an email address, but these services are imperfect and still require the parent to correctly initiate the system with the child's email address. Furthermore, once an online account is identified, cloud-based solutions often need some form of cooperation from the child such as either their login credentials or permission to access their account via a social networking site's platform. Permission is necessary to access the contents of the child's account and the full extent of his or her online activity.","What is needed is a method for monitoring minors' online activities in a more efficient and less cumbersome manner.","An embodiment according to the within invention comprises a computer implemented method that comprises providing an online-monitoring agent configured for local monitoring of a personal computing device, receiving identifying information associated with at least one of an account, email address, site, and service from the personal computing device via the online-monitoring agent, and monitoring via a network the at least one of the account, email address, site, and service based on the identifying information received via the online-monitoring agent.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the personal computing device includes at least one of a laptop, personal computer, smart-phone, router or other internet enabled device.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the online-monitoring agent includes at least one of native software and cloud-based software.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the native software includes at least one of at least one of a key-logger, peer-to-peer processor, remote redirection agent, and hyper text transfer protocol secure down-grader.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the cloud-based software includes at least one of a collection server, a poller server, a proxy server and obfuscation-system.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the hyper text transfer protocol secure down-grader comprises removing an automatic redirect if a targeted application server executes a HTTP redirect process, accessing the targeted application server website directly such that at least one website page and user information can be intercepted, rewriting the intercepted at least one website page and user information to retain a connection using HTTP.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that rewriting intercepted website pages and user information further includes at least one of rewriting POST uniform resource locators in a form to be HTTP instead of HTTPS, rewriting link uniform resource locators in pages to be HTTP instead of HTTPS, changing a HTTP BASE HREF to be HTTP instead of HTTPS and rewriting rules to circumvent specific website protections for websites having website specific login procedures.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the HTTPS-down-grader further comprises the steps of tracking a uniform resource locator of each element that is down-graded, whether the down-grade occurred via handling redirects or by rewriting website page contents and storing the uniform resource locator into a uniform resource locator list.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that a proxy is configured for accessing a uniform resource locator list to determine if an outgoing connection to a targeted application server website should use HTTP or HTTPS to meet the security requirements of the targeted site such that when the uniform resource locator list indicates a HTTP level of security, the proxy server will access the targeted application server website via HTTP or when the uniform resource locator list indicates a HTTPS level of security, the proxy server will access the targeted application server website via HTTPS.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the HTTPS-down-grader comprises sending intercepted at least one web page and user information from the down-grader to HTTP sessions, to the collection server.","Another embodiment according to the present invention further comprises that the intercepted user information includes at least one of usernames, passwords, e-mail addresses and uniform resource locators.","The above and yet other objects and advantages of the within invention will become apparent from the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and Claims appended herewith.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","103","104","105","106","140","140"]},"Another embodiment according to the invention comprises using the online-monitoring agent to obtain a minor's login credentials, so that those credentials can be fed back to a cloud-based system to enable direct access to the minor's online content and activity stream, without requiring direct participation or cooperation from the minor.","Another embodiment according to the present invention comprises an obfuscation-system that can generate alternate Internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses. The obfuscation-system can be used when a targeted application server has filters to prevent large numbers of connections for different users from a single IP address. The obfuscation-system will allow a system's hosted servers such as the collection server and poller server to originate connections to the targeted application server using the IP address of the minor's personal computing device. The obfuscation-system can handle connections for that specific minor or any number of other minors whose IP addresses are in a nearby network IP address block that is close to the minor's IP address.","Another embodiment according to the within invention comprises installing a HTTPS-down-grader in a proxy or on a residential gateway. The HTTPS-down-grader can function as a standard HTTP proxy configured by a user or the HTTPS-down-grader can function as a transparent proxy by intercepting traffic as it flows to a target site. A function of the HTTPS-down-grader is to process HTTPS connections to be down-graded to HTTP such that traffic can be monitored for usernames, passwords and other information such as web mail service, email addresses, and other user information that can be useful to have for monitoring the minor. Connections leaving the proxy destined for a targeted application server would still be encrypted via HTTPS if the original connection that was HTTPS-down-graded, was intended to be secure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","301","301","302","303","307","202","203","204","205","206","207"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","302","302","303","301","303"]},"The online-monitoring agent  or  collects and sends data to a collection server . The collection server  functions as a repository for a minor's electronic information such as usernames, device identifiers, email addresses and passwords. The collection server  is periodically polled for new and updated information by a poller server . A proxy server  including an HTTPS-down-grader interacts with browser access from a home browser , enabled for example by the personal computing device , or a mobile-browser , enabled for example by a smart-phone  operated by the minor targeted to a particular application server , to render accessible the minor's electronic user information to the collection server . The minor's user information can be collected for example during the minor's browser interactions with a social networking application (e.g. Twitter\u2122, Facebook\u2122) via a particular social networking application server . Alternatively for example, the minor's user information can be collected during interactions with a third party application (e.g. TweetDeck\u2122, Plume\u2122) which provides an alternate interface to the social networking application for example through an alternate application server configured for communication with the particular social networking application server .","The poller server  accesses information regarding a monitored minor from the social networking application servers , for example using user names, passwords or other user information provided by the collection server . The poller server  is configured to access information related to or inputted by a monitored minor on an application server  regardless of whether the information originates from the personal computing device , the home browser  executed on the device , the user mobile browser , or a foreign browser . The foreign browser , enabled for example by a foreign personal computing device , is a browser on an unrecognized system which can include for example a browser accessed by the minor residing on the minor's friend's computer, a public computer or other unrecognized system. The poller server  can access a minor's information on an application server  for example through connection to a publically accessible web interface, by logging on to the minor's social networking application account, or via an API exposed for the purpose of user monitoring. Alternatively, the online monitoring agent  or  can perform the functions of the poller server , connecting to the social networking application servers .","The poller server , or alternatively the online monitoring agent  or , provides status updates to monitoring users such as parents of a monitored minor at predetermined intervals or responsive to predetermined events. A monitoring user client , implemented for example on a suitable personal computing device , can interface with the poller server  and\/or the online monitoring agent  or  to receive status updates regarding the minor's online activities. The status updates can include for example descriptions of postings by the minor or the minor's friends on particular social networking sites, indications of whether particular social networking sites are accessed by a device known by the poller server  and\/or the online monitoring agent  or , and the times of such accesses. A status update can include an indication of an IP address from which a posting originated, or alternatively a geographic location from which a posting originated if the device from which the posting originated is location-enabled, for example a GPS-enabled smart phone.","If information extracted by the poller server  or the online monitoring agent  or  from a social networking application server  is determined not to correspond to activity of recognized systems recorded by the online monitoring agent  or  or the collection server , the status provided to the monitoring user client  can include an indication that a posting originated from an unknown device (i.e. foreign system). Alternatively, such status can be provided responsive to a determination that extracted information includes information corresponding to a system not recognized as associated with the monitored minor. The online monitoring agent  or  and\/or the poller server  preferably maintain a listing of known devices corresponding to the minor for making such determination. The status provided to the monitoring user client  can include for example a statement such as \u201cyour child appears to be accessing Facebook\u2122 from a device other than your home PC or his mobile phone\u201d or \u201cyour child accessed Twitter\u2122 from an unknown system at 4:00 pm\u201d.","If it is determined that the posting originated from an unknown device, for example the foreign personal computing device , the collection server  can query the location of a location-enabled mobile device known to be associated with the monitored minor, for example the smart phone . The collection server  can query the location of the location-enabled mobile device  directly or via a request to a telecommunication carrier location infrastructure . The collection server , or alternatively the online monitoring agent  or , provides a status to the monitoring user client  indicating that a particular social networking application was accessed by an unknown system at a particular time at a particular location. The status provided to the monitoring user client  can include for example a statement such as \u201cyour child accessed Twitter\u2122 from an unknown system at 4:00 pm at or near 924 Spruce Street\u201d, or \u201cyour child accessed Facebook\u2122 from an unknown system at 12:30 pm at or near Northern Public Library.\u201d","Some application servers have filters to prevent large numbers of connections for different users from a single IP address. An obfuscation-system  allows a system's hosted servers such as the collection server  and poller server  to originate connections to the targeted application server using the IP address of the minor's personal computing device. The obfuscation-system  can handle connections for that specific minor or any number of other minors whose IP addresses are in a nearby network IP address block that is associated with the minor's IP address. When necessary the obfuscation-system  can generate alternate IP addresses using a peer to peer process or any other system process suitable for generating IP addresses.","The collection server , poller server , proxy server  and obfuscation system  can be embodied by one or a plurality of physical systems and enabled by hardware, software or combinations thereof. The social networking application servers  can be executed on or enabled by any suitable number of systems or devices.","Having described embodiments for a system and method for range search over distributive storage systems, it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING(S)","p":["The foregoing Summary as well as the following detailed description will be readily understood in conjunction with the appended drawings which illustrate embodiments of the invention.
