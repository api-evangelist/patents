title: Inferring household income for users of a social networking system
abstract: Information about a set of users of a social networking system is obtained to develop a predictive model of income distribution for all users of the social networking system. This predictive model is based on selected attributes about the users (e.g., declared/profile information, user historical information, and/or social information). Users of the social networking system are mapped to a specific income bracket based on statistical correlations derived from the predictive model. Advertisements are targeted to users based on income bracket. The system may use a machine learning algorithm to analyze conversion rates of targeted advertising to retrain the predictive model.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","SUMMARY"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/159,373, filed Jun. 13, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates generally to social networking, and in particular to inferring household income for users of a social networking system for targeting advertisements.","Traditional targeting criteria for advertising relies on demographic data and structured information, such as a user's self-declared interests and intentions to be marketable (e.g., to be in the market to purchase a product or service). Advertisers, in an effort to locate and target these users, purchase analytical data gathered by third parties that track users visiting websites related to the advertiser's product. For example, websites on the Internet track people comparing car prices and filling out a form for a test drive at a local dealership and sell this information to advertisers. Ultimately, advertisers depend on this analytical data, which assumes users have enough household income to make a purchase.","In recent years, users of social networking systems have shared their interests and engaged with other users of the social networking systems by sharing photos, real-time status updates, and playing social games. The amount of information gathered from users is staggering-information describing recent moves to a new city, graduations, births, engagements, marriages, and the like. Social networking systems have been passively recording this information as part of the user experience, but social networking systems have lacked tools to synthesize this information about users for targeting advertisements based on their perceived income.","Specifically, the information available on social networking systems has not been used to infer the household income of users of a social networking system. Information about users' household income is very valuable to advertisers that seek to market luxury goods and services to these users. However, existing systems have not provided advertisers with users that have been categorized by inferred household income ranges.","Information about a set of users of a social networking system is obtained to develop a predictive model of income distribution for all users of the social networking system. This predictive model is based on selected attributes about the users (e.g., declared\/profile information, user history, and\/or social information). Users of the social networking system are mapped to a specific income bracket based on statistical correlations derived from the predictive model. Advertisements are targeted to users based on income bracket. In one embodiment, the system uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze conversion rates of targeted advertising to retrain the predictive model.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Overview","A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Users of social networking system can provide information describing them which is stored as user profiles. For example, users can provide their age, gender, geographical location, education history, employment history and the like. The information provided by users may be used by the social networking system to direct information to the user. For example, the social networking system may recommend social groups, events, and potential friends to a user. The social networking system may also use user profile information to direct advertisements to the user, ensuring that only relevant advertisements are directed to the user. Relevant advertisements ensure that advertising spending reaches their intended audiences, rather than wasting shrinking resources on users that are likely to ignore the advertisement.","In addition to declarative information provided by users, social networking systems may also record users' actions on the social networking system. These actions include communications with other users, sharing photos, interactions with applications that operate on the social networking system, such as a social gaming application, responding to a poll, adding an interest, and joining an employee network. A social networking system may also be able to capture external website data that is accessed by its users. This external website data may include websites that are frequently visited, links that are selected, and other browsing data. Information about users, such as stronger interests in particular users and applications than others based on their behavior, can be generated from these recorded actions through analysis and machine learning by the social networking system.","A social networking system may also attempt to infer information about its users. A social networking system may analyze posted content by users that include keywords, such as \u201cPrada\u201d and \u201cBMW.\u201d Image recognition software could also help identify brand names in pictures posted by users, for example. This information can be analyzed to infer purchasing habits of users on the social networking system that may be indicators of household income.","Further, user profile information for a user is often not complete, and it may not even be completely accurate. For example, users may deliberately provide incorrect information, such as providing incorrect age in the user profile. Users may also forget to update their information when it changes. For example, a user may move to a new location and forget to update the user's geographical location, or a user may change jobs but forget to update their workplace description in the user profile. As a result, a social networking system may infer certain profile attributes of a user, such as geographic location, educational institutions attended, and age range, by analyzing the user's connections and their declared profile information. Inferring profile attributes are further discussed in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/916,322, filed on Oct. 29, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Even though a social networking system may collect, and in some cases infer, information about its users, significant resources must be expended to organize the staggering amounts of data collected. A social networking system having hundreds of millions of users, for example, gathers and infers a staggering amount of information about its users. To address issues of scalability and efficiently expending computing resources, a social networking system provides a snapshot of databases for modules to process. Recent changes in a user's personal life, such as an engagement, birth of a child, moving across the country, graduating from college, and starting a new job, can be collected and inferred from these snapshots on social networking systems. These life events may be analyzed as indicators of household income.","Reliable information about the household income of users of a social networking system is very valuable to advertisers because certain advertisers may wish to focus their advertisements on higher income users that have the discretionary income to afford the products being advertised. For example, users who recently changed jobs may be more susceptible to clicking on an advertisement for a new luxury car, such as a BMW, because they may have more disposable income due to the new job.","Some users may engage in \u201cprofile fraud,\u201d deliberately making false statements about themselves and other users on the social networking system. For example, some users may change their relationship status to \u201cmarried\u201d even though, in reality, the users are not actually married. Other users may indicate a sibling or parent-child relationship in the same manner. Accordingly, to infer reliable household income users, a social networking system may be designed to authenticate potential advertising income brackets of users for accuracy to identify and exclude these fraudulent users. Machine learning, heuristics analysis, and regression analysis may be used in authenticating the placement of users in income brackets using the predictive model described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","100","102","102","100","102","100"]},"Users of the social networking system  may take actions using the social networking system  that are associated with one or more objects. Information describing these actions is stored in the action log . The action log  includes many different types of interactions that occur on a social networking system, including commenting on a photo album, communications between users, becoming a fan of a musician, and adding an event to a calendar. Additionally, the action log  records a user's interactions with advertisements on the social networking system  as well as other applications operating on the social networking system .","An external website log  may be used by a social networking system  to track users' actions on external websites that communication information back to the social networking system . For example, an e-commerce website that primarily sells luxury shoes at bargain prices may recognize a user of a social networking system  through website plug-ins that enable the e-commerce website to identify the user. Because users of the social networking system  are uniquely identifiable, e-commerce websites, such as this luxury shoe reseller, may use the information about these users as they visit their websites. An external website log  records data about these users, including viewing histories, advertisements that were clicked on, purchasing activity, and buying patterns.","Connection objects  store information about users' connections on a social networking system . Such information may include the interactions between the user and the connection on the social networking system , including wall posts, comments on photos, geographic places where they have been tagged together, and photos in which they have both been tagged in. In one embodiment, a connection object  includes information about the strength of the connection between the users, such as an affinity score. If a user has a high affinity score for a particular connection, the social networking system  has recognized that the user interacts highly with that connection. Affinity scores and methods of gathering this social data from a social networking system are described further in U.S. Application Ser. No. 12\/978,265, filed on Dec. 23, 2010, which hereby incorporated by reference.","External data  may be used by a social networking system  for a subset of users to develop a predictive model of inferring household income for all users. This external data  may be licensed by administrators of the social networking system  and includes actual estimates of household income for the users in the dataset. For example, external data  may be licensed from ComScore or Nielsen for fifty thousand users of the social networking system . After a predictive model is developed using this external data , the predictive model would be used to infer the household income of all of the five hundred million users of the social networking system, for example.","The predictive model is developed and tested using a data modeling module . The data modeling module  uses information that is available about users of the social networking system  to develop, test, and use a predictive model of inferring household income for the users. This information is gathered from user profile information objects , the action log , the external website log , connection objects , and external data  described above. The data modeling module  uses this information to define which attributes and behaviors of users of the social networking system  correlate to the distribution of income in the predictive model. As more information is gathered about users of the social networking system , the data modeling module  may be used to alter the predictive model for inferring household income, giving more or less weight to a specific attribute or behavior of a user, such as the college(s) attended by the user.","The predictive model may be initially defined, in one embodiment, using the probabilistic distribution of income of a \u201cgolden dataset\u201d of users, i.e., licensed data that includes income data for a random sampling of users of the social networking system. Using the golden dataset of users, a probability distribution of income can be generated by the data modeling module , establishing a basis for the predictive model to make statistical inferences about all users of the social networking system. Income ranges, or brackets, can be defined in $25,000 increments for U.S.-based users, for example. For non-U.S.-based users, country-specific income brackets may be defined, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, income brackets may be defined by percentages (e.g., top 10%, or bottom 33%) of the population of users on the social networking system.","Continuing the example of using fifty thousand users as the golden dataset of users, administrators of the social networking system may analyze the dataset and select certain attributes that appear to be directly correlated to a user's income. If one of the users in the golden dataset earns $35,000 per year, as indicated by the external data  licensed by the administrators of the social networking system, that user should be associated with the second-lowest income bracket. Administrators may examine that user's attributes and behaviors on the social networking system to determine characteristics or indicators that could be used to infer the income of other users exhibiting similar characteristics or indicators.","These characteristics and indicators would form a predictive model for the second-lowest income bracket such that a user mapping module  could map another user to that bracket. In this way, the income of that user is inferred by the social networking system . Each defined income bracket is associated with an income bracket object . As users are mapped to income brackets by the user mapping module , the user profile information objects  are associated with the corresponding income bracket object  for the mapped income bracket.","Once users of a social networking system  have been associated with income bracket objects , the household income of users can be inferred by the social networking system  by analyzing relationships between the users. A married couple usually combines their income to create household income. Similarly, the user mapping module , in one embodiment, recognizes married users, combines their income brackets, and associates both users with the income bracket object  corresponding to their combined income. Other types of relationships, including engaged users, parent-child, siblings, and roommates, may also be recognized by the user mapping module , in one embodiment, and may have their incomes combined in the same fashion.","As mentioned above, some users of the social networking system  engage in profile fraud, deliberately misrepresenting information on their profile. To avoid associating users who are not actually married, other modules in the social networking system  may be used to police this type of behavior. Heuristics analysis may be used to identify these false positives and analyze unstructured data such as interaction analysis between users. For example, an income bracket object  may be associated with a user that has fraudulently indicated that another user is his parent. Heuristics analysis may be used to identify this user by calculating the age difference between the declared parent and child and flagging the user if the difference is less than 14 years. Additionally, the heuristics algorithm may check the last names of the users for a match and whether the users have similarities using facial recognition software that compares photos of the users.","The conversion rates of advertisements, or the rates of how many users actually clicked through the advertisement and made a purchase, based on these income brackets may be analyzed by administrators of the social networking system . Information about these conversion rates may be used, in one embodiment, to adjust the predictive model that was initially defined using the golden dataset of income information about users of the social networking system . For example, if a certain characteristic, such as which college the user attended, was used to infer a higher income bracket, and the conversion rates of those targeted users were low for luxury goods, that predictive factor may be given less weight in the predictive model.","System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","100","204","218"]},"The client devices  comprise one or more computing devices that can receive user input and can transmit and receive data via the network . In one embodiment, the client device  is a conventional computer system executing, for example, a Microsoft Windows-compatible operating system (OS), Apple OS X, and\/or a Linux distribution. In another embodiment, the client device  can be a device having computer functionality, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile telephone, smart-phone, etc. The client device  is configured to communicate via network . The client device  can execute an application, for example, a browser application that allows a user of the client device  to interact with the social networking system . In another embodiment, the client device  interacts with the social networking system  through an application programming interface (API) that runs on the native operating system of the client device , such as iOS 4 and ANDROID.","In one embodiment, the network  uses standard communications technologies and\/or protocols. Thus, the network  can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), G, G, CDMA, digital subscriber line (DSL), etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on the network  can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and the file transfer protocol (FTP). The data exchanged over the network  can be represented using technologies and\/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML) and the extensible markup language (XML). In addition, all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), and Internet Protocol security (IPsec).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","206","208","210","212","214","216","112","114","100"]},"The web server  links the social networking system  via the network  to one or more client devices ; the web server  serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, Flash, XML, and so forth. The web server  may provide the functionality of receiving and routing messages between the social networking system  and the client devices , for example, instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS (short message service) messages, or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. The user can send a request to the web server  to upload information, for example, images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally, the web server  may provide API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems, such as iOS, ANDROID, webOS, and RIM.","Income bracket objects are developed by the data modeling module  in the social networking system . These income bracket objects are stored in the income bracket store . A user mapping module  associates users of the social networking system  with income bracket objects based on information about the users stored in their user profile information objects stored in the user profile store , external data gathered from external websites , actions taken by the users and recorded by an action logger , and information about the users' connections stored in the connection store .","The action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about user actions on and\/or off the social networking system . The action logger  populates the action log  with information about user actions to track them. Such actions may include, for example, adding a connection to the other user, sending a message to the other user, uploading an image, reading a message from the other user, viewing content associated with the other user, attending an event posted by another user, among others. In addition, a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users, so these actions are associated with those users as well.","User account information and other related information for a user are stored in the user profile store . The user profile information stored in user profile store  describes the users of the social networking system , including biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, gender, hobbies or preferences, location, and the like. The user profile may also store other information provided by the user, for example, images or videos. In certain embodiments, images of users may be tagged with identification information of users of the social networking system  displayed in an image. A user profile store  maintains profile information about users of the social networking system , such as age, gender, interests, geographic location, email addresses, credit card information, and other personalized information. The user profile store  also maintains references to the actions stored in the action log  and performed on objects in the content store .","The connection store  stores the information describing the connections between users. The connections are defined by users, allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example, the connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. In some embodiment, the connection specifies a connection type based on the type of relationship, for example, family, or friend, or colleague. Users may select from predefined types of connections, or define their own connection types as needed. The connection store  acts as a cross-referencing database for the user profile store  and the content store  to determine which objects are also being modified by connections of a user.","Developing a Predictive Model to Infer Household Income",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["112","112","300","302","304","306","308","310","100"]},"An external data gathering module  interfaces with external websites to process information about users of the social networking system . This information may include ComScore data, Nielsen data, and other data licensed from third party providers. Additionally, the external data gathering module  may, in one embodiment, gather information about users and their actions taken on external websites that are connected to the social networking system  through the use of plug-ins on their websites. For example, a user may log into a live music concert website using a plug-in that allows information to be shared between that external website and the social networking system . If the user chooses to purchase concert tickets to the next Britney Spears concert on the external website, the social networking system  may collect that information and store an interest in Britney Spears in the user profile information object associated with the user, in one embodiment. The external data gathering module  may also collect other information about the user's actions on the external website, such as the price of the tickets and how frequently the user makes purchases on the live music concert website. This information may then be used as a factor in a predictive model for inferring household income for users of the social networking system .","The statistical correlation module  develops a correlation value for each factor in a predictive model for inferring income of users on the social networking system . A golden dataset of income information about a subset of users on the social networking system  is used as the basis of the predictive model. From this golden dataset of income information, a set of factors can be extracted from an analysis of the information based on the probabilistic distribution of the users. Returning to a previous example, a golden dataset included fifty thousand users can be segmented into income brackets of $25,000 increments (e.g., $0-$25,000, $25,000-$50,000, etc.). Analyzing each income bracket, a set of factors emerge that probabilistically indicate a correlation between the factor and the income bracket. If 95% of the users in the $100,000-$125,000 bracket have graduate degrees, for example, that factor may be selected as a factor to look at in developing the predictive model for inferring household income. The statistical correlation module  analyzes each income bracket and determines a correlation value for each factor that emerges in inferring the income bracket of the users. In this example, 0.95 is the statistical correlation value of having a graduate degree correlating to an income bracket of $100,000-$125,000. Using the golden dataset of income information in this manner, statistical inferences such as this can be made about the income of all users in the social networking system .","The statistical correlation module  may, in one embodiment, use unstructured information on the social networking system, gathered from user profile information objects , the action log , external website log , connection objects , and external data  to define predictive factors and calculate corresponding correlation values. Bursts of activity related to users in a specific geographic location, for example, can be detected by the social networking system  and identified. For example, it could be assumed that riots only occur in locations where users of a certain income bracket reside. Thus, if the word \u201criot\u201d occurs in a burst of communications related to users in a specific geographic location, this could be interpreted by the statistical correlation module  as a predictive factor of income brackets and a corresponding correlation value could be calculated. The specific geographic locations where riots might be expected to occur, for example, could be predetermined from external data  gathered from a third party website that lists the property values of homes by geographic location. Bursts of activity can be detected by normatively scoring the communications against a past empirical data measuring such bursts of activity on the social networking system. A specific normative threshold of expected activity may be generated for pre-selected world events, such as riots, tornados, and floods. Other types of unstructured information can be similarly measured and scored, including image recognition of wedding photos, recognizing multiple check-ins at or around a particular geographic location, and a significant increase in the number of new friend requests, or new connections, from users in a different geographic location than the one indicated in the user's profile. Certain exceptions may be made, depending on the usage of the keyword, in one embodiment. For example, a status message indicating that \u201cShelly is such a riot!\u201d does not imply that the user posting the message is in a lower income bracket. Language processing tools may be used to analyze the word usage of users and infer an income range. As an example, a user who frequently misspells words and uses incorrect grammar may be flagged as a user having a lower income than the average user who misspells words infrequently. By contrast, a user who writes perfect sentences complete with complex usage of grammar and prepositional phrases, for example, may be assumed to have a higher income bracket. Utilizing unstructured information to define predictive factors in inferring household income of users enables better predictive factors to emerge with higher correlation values.","A predictive factor selection module  selects a subset of the factors analyzed by the statistical correlation module  for use in a regression model developed by the regression analysis module . The selection of predictive factors may be manually selected by administrators of the social networking system , in one embodiment. In another embodiment, predictive factors may be selected to be used in the regression model if the correlation value for the factor, as determined by the statistical correlation module , is above a predetermined threshold. In yet another embodiment, the selected predictive factors may be a predetermined number of factors meeting the predetermined threshold.","The regression analysis module  uses a regression model to predict the income of users on the social networking system . Each income bracket has a separate regression model. The predictive factors for each income bracket are selected by the predictive factor selection module . Thus, an income bracket may have more or less predictive factors than its neighboring income brackets. The regression analysis module  may also add or remove predictive factors based on the performance of advertisements directed to users in specific income brackets. For example, suppose that the income of a user is inferred to be within the $100,000-$125,000 income bracket. If that user is targeted with advertisements for destination travel packages, luxury cars, and home mortgages, but explicitly declines each of those advertisements, the predictive factors that were selected to place that user in that income bracket may be modified manually by administrators or by the predictive factor selection module .","Using a combination of the predictive factors, the regression model for each income bracket assigns a coefficient to each of the predictive factors based on the probabilistic distribution of users from the golden dataset, i.e., the response. The regression analysis module  then determines a score that indicates whether a user is a good fit with golden dataset of users in the income bracket. A curve fit, or best fit, yields a number from 0 to 1 that can be used as the accuracy measurement of the income bracket, in one embodiment. The regression analysis module , in one embodiment, adapts the regression model to include or exclude factors that are determined to be relevant or not relevant to accurately inferring household income of users based on machine learning and heuristics analysis of the users.","A heuristics analysis module  operates independently and asynchronously from the other modules in the data modeling module . The heuristics analysis module  performs various steps to gather information from the social networking system . For example, the action log  includes actions that users perform on the social networking system. The heuristics analysis module  may be used to analyze the level of communications activity for particular users and determine whether those communications included certain keywords, such as \u201criot\u201d as described above.","Another use of the heuristics analysis module  includes gathering and analyzing different types of information about a user's geographic location such as check-ins at places in a specific geographic location, attending events in the same geographic region, receiving requests for connecting with users from the same geographic area, and geo-location codes embedded in photos and other communications, such as text messages, uploaded to the social networking system by the user. The heuristics analysis module  may conclude, for example, that although a user may indicate in her profile that she is from Oakland, Calif., a relatively low-income city, she frequently attends events in an affluent community such as Atherton, Calif. and posts many check-ins at high-end boutique shops in Palo Alto, Calif. An inference may be made, by the statistical correlation module , that a user who attends events in affluent communities and posts check-ins frequently may actually have a higher likelihood of being in a higher income bracket than the average income bracket of the geographic location indicated in her user profile and calculate correlation values for those income brackets based on probabilistic distributions of users in the golden dataset.","The heuristics analysis module  also determines, in one embodiment, the various locations of the connections of the user to infer the location of a user based on a subset of the connections of the user that interact frequently with the user. As mentioned above, the geographic location of the user may be used as a predictive factor in inferring household income based on external data detailing the property values of the geographic location of the user. Inferring the location of a user through interactions between users and their connections, such as exchanges of messages, wall posts, comments made on photos or videos, recommendations made to other users, and the like. Users that have not interacted with the user for a long time can be excluded since there is a possibility that they are old connections of the user and the user may have moved to a different location. The locations of the subset of the connections of the user are analyzed to determine the number of connections at each location. The location of the user is inferred as the location with the highest number of connections of the user that frequently interact with the user. For example, if the user frequently interacts with a large number of users residing in a particular city, it may be inferred that the user resides in that city. Similarly, if the user interacts with users in different cities of the same country, that country can be inferred as the user's country of residence.","The location of a user may be determined by the heuristics analysis module  based on other factors, in another embodiment, based on the internet protocol (IP) address associated with sessions created by the user. Various communication protocols provide IP address of a client device used to establish communication with a server in the social networking system . The IP address of the client device can be mapped to geographical location of the machines using the IP address. As a result, the geographical location of the client device can be determined. Some client devices are equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and the location of the client device as provided by GPS may be available to the social networking system . The location of a client device  that is equipped with wireless communication functionality may be obtained from the cell towers that the client device interacts with. Another factor used to infer the location of a user is the locale of the user used to interact with the social networking system . For example, a user using French locale is likely to be located in France (subject to information inferred from other sources). The location of a user can also be provided by the user in the user profile. In an embodiment, conflicts in locations obtained from various sources are resolved by attaching a confidence score with the source, for example, the location obtained via GPS may be considered more reliable compared to location specified by the user. The confidence score of the inferred values from various sources is compared to determine a final inferred location of the user as well as the confidence score of the inferred location.","A machine learning module  may be used in the data modeling module  to refine the predictive regression models and the predictive factors selected for each income bracket. In one embodiment, a social networking system  uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze the conversion rates of targeted advertising to retrain the predictive model. Using feedback from the conversion rates of targeted advertising, the predictive model may be refined to include more or less predictive factors and the weights assigned to each predictive factor, or coefficients, can also be adjusted based upon the response, i.e., the conversion rates of a sampling of the targeted users.","Additionally, advertisers may be given more options in targeting users with advertisements based on income brackets because of discounts given based on the correlation value of an income bracket of users. For example, if a user maps to the $100,000-$125,000 bracket with a correlation value of 0.50 and maps to the $75,000-$100,000 bracket with a correlation value of 0.95, then an advertiser that decides to target to that user because of its association with the higher income bracket would receive a 50% discount based on that user's correlation value. Because the pricing of advertising may be associated with user's correlation values of the income brackets, the machine learning module  may be used, in one embodiment, to expand or reduce the number of users in each income bracket by adding or removing predictive factors from the regression models of the income brackets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","112"]},"After the information about users of the social networking system is received , predictive factors are selected  to develop regression models for predicting the income of users of the social networking system  by income brackets. An administrator may, in one embodiment, manually select the predictive factors, as discussed above, such as geographic location, education level, and purchasing habits using the predictive factor selection module . The predictive factor selection module  may select  these predictive factors, in another embodiment, based on the correlation values of the predictive factors as determined by the statistical correlation module .","After predictive factors for the income brackets of users have been selected , a regression model for each income bracket is generated  based on a series of correlation values corresponding to the selected predictive factors. The statistical correlation module  determines the series of correlation values corresponding to the selected predictive factors. The regression analysis module  generates 404 the regression model using these correlation values and determines  a coefficient for each predictive factor in the regression model based on the probabilistic distribution of users in the golden dataset which includes income information.","After a coefficient for each predictive factor in the regression model for each income bracket is determined , the ranges of each income bracket are defined . In one embodiment, the ranges of each income bracket may be arbitrarily defined  by administrators at fixed incremental values. In another embodiment, the ranges are defined  by the distribution of users in the golden dataset and the coefficients calculated for each predictive factor based on the response, or the income information in the golden dataset.","Mapping Users to Income Brackets Using a Predictive Model",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","112","114","304","306"]},"In one embodiment, an analysis of posted content, by the heuristics analysis module , may be received to indicate the frequency of grammatical errors and language level in the posted content. In another embodiment, users' external website browsing histories may be analyzed by the heuristics analysis module  to indicate purchasing patterns, types of websites frequented, and level of interaction with different advertisers on the social networking system. For example, an assumption might be made about a user that reads CNN.com and nytimes.com every day that the user is in a higher income bracket than another user that only reads TMZ.com and PerezHilton.com on the theory that a user who reads newspapers might be assumed to make more money than a user who only reads celebrity gossip blogs. These types of customized assumptions may be created by administrators that have access to the external website browsing history data of users of the social networking system.","Location information, such as check-ins using GPS-enabled mobile devices and event information with an embedded location, may also be received  by the data modeling module . Further, emails and other messaging systems on the social networking system may be searched for keywords that indicate higher income users by the heuristics analysis module  and information about users would be received by the data modeling module . Users may choose to join or be associated with groups on a social networking system . Information about group membership may be used to infer income of users that are members. For example, a user's membership in a charitable giving foundation group on a social networking system may indicate that the user is in a higher income bracket than a user who is a member of a group dedicated to a popular music audition show. In one embodiment, the received information is only relevant for a limited period of time (such as check-in data) such that older received information may not be used by the data modeling module . The may be accomplished by applying a decay factor to the information or voiding the information after a period of time.","Based on the received information, confidence metrics for income brackets are determined  for the user using the predictive regression model generated by the regression analysis module . A confidence metric is determined  for each income bracket for each user because advertisers may be given the opportunity to target their advertisements to users in an income bracket at a discount based on the confidence metric corresponding to income bracket. For example, the regression analysis module  may determine a confidence metric of 0.85 that a user should be placed in the $50,000-$75,000 income bracket, a confidence metric of 0.50 that the same user should be placed in the $75,000-$100,000 income bracket, and a confidence metric of 0.30 that the same user should be placed in the $25,000-$50,000 income bracket based on the different regression models for the three income brackets. Advertisers may, in one embodiment, be given the opportunity to target the user as part of the $75,000-$100,000 income bracket at a 50% discount based on the confidence metric for that income bracket.","Each income bracket is stored as an income bracket object  in the income bracket store . Each user of the social networking system  is associated with a user profile information object  that is stored in the user profile information store . In one embodiment, as confidence metrics are determined  for a user, the user's user profile information object  is associated  with the corresponding the income bracket objects  for the determined confidence metrics. In another embodiment, the user's user profile information object  is associated  with the income bracket object  with the highest determined confidence metric for the user. As a result, advertisements that are targeted towards a specific income bracket are displayed  to the user that has been associated with the income bracket object .","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
