The electromagnetic actuator comprises a permanent magnet and a voice coil, and generates vibrations by the action of a magnetic circuit of a stator using a magnet. An electromagnetic speaker, in turn, generates sound by vibrations of a lowly rigid vibration plate of an organic film or the like which is fixed to a vibration section of an electromagnetic actuator.","Incidentally, the need for portable telephones and personal computers has increased in recent years, and associated therewith, small and power saving actuators have been increasingly demanded. However, since the electromagnetic actuator needs to apply a large current to the voice coil during its operation, it has a problem in power saving capabilities, and is not apt to a reduction in size and thickness from a structural viewpoint. In addition, the electromagnetic actuator must be electromagnetically shielded, when it is applied to an electronic device, in order to prevent evil influences due to leaking flux from the voice coil. From this aspect, the electromagnetic actuator is not either apt for use in small electronic devices such as portable telephones. Moreover, a reduction in size causes the voice coil to be made of a thinner wire, and a resulting increase in resistance of the wire can burn the voice coil as well.","In view of the problems mentioned above, piezo-electric actuators have been developed using a piezo-electric element such as piezo-electric ceramic or the like, which has such features as a small size and light weight, power saving capabilities, non-leaking flux and the like, for a driving source, as a thin vibration part which can substitute for the electromagnetic actuator. The piezo-electric actuator generates mechanical vibrations through motions of a piezo-electric element, and comprises, for example, a piezo-electric ceramic element (simply called a \u201cpiezo-electric element\u201d as well) which is bonded to a seat.","The basic configuration of a piezo-electric actuator will be described with reference to .  is a perspective view showing the configuration of a conventional piezo-electric actuator, and  is a cross-sectional view schematically showing how the piezo-electric actuator of  vibrates.","As shown in , piezo-electric actuator  comprises piezo-electric element  made of piezo-electric ceramics; seat  to which piezo-electric element  is fixed; and frame-shaped supporting member  for supporting the outer periphery of seat . As piezo-electric element  is applied with an AC voltage, piezo-electric element  performs expansion\/contraction motions. As shown in , seat  deforms in a convex mode (indicated by solid lines) or deforms in a concave mode (indicated by broken lines) in accordance with the expansion\/contraction motions. In this way, seat  vibrates in a vertical direction as viewed in the figures, with bonded area serving as a fixed end and the center of the seat serving as a belly.","For reference, the piezo-electric actuator, though it is advantageous in a reduction in size ant thickness, exhibits poor performance as an acoustic element, in one aspect, as compared with the electromagnetic actuator. This is attributable to the piezo-electric element which is highly rigid and incapable of providing a sufficient average vibration amplitude as compared with the electromagnetic actuator. In other words, this is because, as the actuator has a small amplitude, sound pressure of an acoustic element is also reduced. On the other hand, JP-61-168971-A and JP-2000-140759-A disclose configurations which support the outer periphery of a seat by a beam which is relatively easy to deform in order to increase the amplitude of vibrations of an actuator.","Also, JP-2001-17917-A discloses, to the same effect, a technique for providing a large vibration amplitude with a plate spring which is created by slitting in a peripheral region of a seat along its circumference. JP-2001-339791-A also discloses a technique for widening a frequency characteristic by bonding the outer periphery of a seat with a supporting member through a curved supporting member.","However, the piezo-electric actuators described in JP-A-61-168971-A, JP-2000-140759-A, and JP-2001-17917-A are essentially used mainly as vibrators contained in portable telephones and the like, and are not at all considered for use in reproduction of music and the like as an acoustic element such as a speaker. In other words, when they are applied to vibrators, the amplitude can be simply extended only at particular frequencies, whereas when they are applied to speakers, even their frequency characteristics must be taken into consideration. Specifically, they must be configured to provide a sound pressure at a predetermined level or higher in a desired frequency band, for example, from 1 kHz to 10 kHz.","On the other hand, JP-2001-339791-A is intended to generate displacements both in a thickness direction and a radial direction of piezo-electric ceramics in a configuration in which the seat for restraining the piezo-electric ceramics is bonded with the curved supporting member. With this curved supporting member, it is possible to disperse stresses at characteristic points and an attenuation ratio, reduce distortions, and extend the band of the frequency characteristic, but since vibrations occur both in the radial direction and thickness direction, vibrations attenuate in a sound radiating direction. For this reason, it must be configured to provide a sound pressure level at a predetermined level.","When even the frequency characteristic is taken into consideration as an acoustic element, a simple increase in vibration amplitude of actuator is not sufficient, but the manner of vibrations is desirably brought closer to a piston shape as shown in  (again described later in detail in later descriptions).","It is an object of the present invention to provide a piezo-electric actuator and an electronic device which are capable of providing a large vibration amplitude and reproducing sound over a wide frequency band.","To solve the foregoing problem, a piezo-electric actuator of the present invention comprises a piezo-electric element for performing expansion\/contraction motions in accordance with an electric field condition, a seat to which the piezo-electric element is adhered on at least one surface thereof, and a supporting member for supporting the piezo-electric element and the seat, wherein the piezo-electric element and the seat vibrate in a thickness direction of the piezo-electric element in accordance with the expansion\/contraction motions of the piezo-electric element. The piezo-electric actuator is characterized in that the seat is connected to the supporting member through a vibration film which is less rigid than the seat.","In the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention configured in this way, the seat is connected to the supporting member through the vibration film which is less rigid than the seat, and a connection (vibration film section) between the seat and the supporting member is susceptible to deformation, as compared with the seat section, so that the vibration amplitude is improved. Also, such a susceptibility of the connection (vibration film section) to deformation means that vibrations become larger in this section, and accordingly, the vibration mode can be brought closer to a piston type (a vibration mode similar to the electromagnetic actuator), as compared with the conventional configuration. Further, since an impact in the event of dropping is absorbed by the vibration film which intervenes between the seat and the supporting member, dropping stability is high, and applications to portable devices and the like are also possible.","In this regard, the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention comprises the vibration film as described above, and sound can be generated by vibrating this vibration film. In other words, the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention can function as an acoustic element as it is without using an additional vibration film or the like.","As described above, according to the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention, since the seat to which the piezo-electric element is adhered and the supporting member are bonded through the vibration film which is less rigid than the seat, vibrations of large amplitude can be produced, and when this is used as an acoustic element, sound can be reproduced over a wide frequency band.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. In the configuration of each embodiment which will be described below, the same structure components are designated the same reference numerals, and repeated descriptions are omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"As shown in , piezo-electric actuator  of this embodiment comprises piezo-electric element  which serves as a driving source of vibration; seat  for supporting piezo-electric element ; and vibration film  for supporting seat  in a configuration in which they are laminated in order. Piezo-electric element , seat , and vibration film  all have circularly shaped contours, and these three members are (concentrically) arranged such that they are centered at the same point. The outer periphery of vibration film  is connected to and supported by supporting member  which is formed in a circular frame shape.","More specifically, piezo-electric element  comprises a piezo-electric plate (piezo-electric ceramics) having two main surfaces , which oppose in parallel with each other, and an upper electrode layer and a lower electrode layer (neither of which is shown) are formed on main surfaces , , respectively, of the piezo-electric plate. While a polarization direction of the piezo-electric plate is not particularly limited, it is upward in a vertical direction (thickness direction of the piezo-electric element) in this embodiment, as shown in the figure. Piezo-electric element  thus configured performs expansion\/contraction motions in the radial direction (radially expanding motions) such that both main surfaces , thereof expand or contract at the same time when an AC voltage is applied to the upper electrode layer and lower electrode layer to apply an alternating electric field. In other words, piezo-electric element  makes motions to repeat a first deformation mode in which the main surfaces expand and a second deformation mode in which the main surfaces contract.","Seat  has a function of converting the expansion\/contraction motions of piezo-electric element  to vibrations in the vertical direction as shown in the figure. Seat  is formed of a resilient material (elastic material), and as its material, a material which is less rigid than a ceramic material which comprises the piezo-electric element can be widely used, such as a metal material (for example, aluminum alloy, phosphor bronze, titanium, or titanium alloy) or a resin material (for example, epoxy, acrylic, polyimide, or polycarbonate), and the like.","Main surface (lower electrode layer) of piezo-electric element  is fixed on a top surface of seat , whereby seat  restrains piezo-electric element . In , an area of seat  on which piezo-electric element  is adhered is shown as restraining area , and the remaining area (area surrounding restraining area ) is shown as non-restraining area ","Vibration film  is a film member for increasing a vibration amplitude of the piezo-electric actuator, and is less rigid than seat . As a combination of materials of seat  with vibration film , for example, seat  may be a metal material, while vibration film  may be a resin material (for example, urethane, PTE, polyethylene or the like). Alternatively, seat  and vibration film  may be made of the same material, and by making the thickness of vibration film  relatively smaller, vibration film  may be made relatively less rigid. In this regard, vibration film  may be paper, polyethylene telephthalate or the like, other than those listed above.","The thickness of vibration film  may be for example, equal to or larger than 5 \u03bcm and equal to or smaller than 500 \u03bcm in the case of a resin material. Particularly, when vibration film  is a plane sheet material, the thickness may be preferably equal to or larger than 30 \u03bcm and equal to or smaller than 180 \u03bcm.","Incidentally, when a piezo-electric actuator is utilized as an acoustic element, an organic film or the like is often adhered to a vibrating section (for example, seat  and the like) of the piezo-electric actuator to generate sound. On the other hand, in this embodiment, vibration film  provided for increasing the amplitude additionally functions as a vibration film as it is. In other words, vibration film  simultaneously has not only a function as a vibration film in a conventional acoustic element but also a function of increasing the vibration amplitude of the actuator. In this regard, the conventional configuration intended to increase the amplitude with the provision of a beam (for example, JP-61-168971-A) differs from the configuration of the present invention. According to the configuration of the present invention, a larger sound pressure can be produced due to the fact that the vibration film is provided. Nevertheless, for designing an acoustic element, a plurality of piezo-electric actuators which differ in resonant frequency from one another may be adhered on a common vibration film to create a single acoustic element. In this way, they can mutually compensate for bands in which sound pressure levels are lower, thereby realizing an acoustic element which can provide a large sound pressure over a wider frequency range.","Seat  is a member which forms part of a housing of the piezo-electric actuator, and its material is not particularly limited and may be a resin material or a metal material. In this regard, for bonding piezo-electric element  with seat , and for bonding seat  with vibration film , an epoxy-based adhesive, for example, can be utilized. While an adhesive layer is not particularly limited in thickness, the thickness is preferably, for example, 20 \u03bcm or smaller because an excessively thick adhesive layer would absorb larger vibration energy, possibly failing to provide a sufficient vibration amplitude.","As shown in , piezo-electric actuator  is configured such that piezo-electric element  is fixed on the top surface of seat , and seat  is supported by supporting member  through vibration film . In this regard, piezo-electric actuator  differs from the conventional configuration (see ) in which the seat is directly supported by the supporting member. According to the configuration of this embodiment, since seat  is supported through vibration film  in this way, a larger vibration amplitude can be produced, as compared with the conventional configuration, and moreover, a vibration mode approaches to a piston type (described later with reference to ). In the following, this will be described with reference to , B, together with a mechanism of generating vibrations of the piezo-electric actuator.","First, as a predetermined voltage (electric field) is applied to piezo-electric element  in a neutral state (see ) in which no voltage is applied to the piezo-electric element, piezo-electric element  deforms in a direction in which its area expands, as indicted by arrows p in . Here, since the bottom surface (main surface ) of piezo-electric element  is restrained by seat , a difference in the amount of deformation occurs between the top surface and the bottom surface of piezo-electric element  due to this restraining effect, resulting in a convex deformation mode, as shown. In this deformation mode, piezo-electric element  and seat , as well as vibration film  which supports seat  are curved to be convex upward as shown in the figure.","Subsequently, as the piezo-electric element is applied with an electric field reverse to the above, piezo-electric element  deforms, at this time, in a direction in which its area decreases, as indicated by arrows q in . A difference in the amount of deformation occurs between the top surface and the bottom surface of piezo-electric element  due to the restraining effect by seat , resulting in a concave deformation mode as shown. In this deformation mode, contrary to the aforementioned, the piezo-electric element, seat, and vibration film are curved to be convex downward as shown in the figure.","Piezo-electric actuator  of this embodiment alternately repeats the convex type deformation mode and concave type deformation mode as mentioned above, causing piezo-electric element , restraining member , and vibration film  to vibrate in the vertical direction. When the actuator of this embodiment is compared with the conventional actuator (see ), they are common in that motions of piezo-electric element  are transmitted to seat , and vibrations in the vertical direction are excited. However, regarding the configuration, they differ in that the actuator of this embodiment has seat  (and piezo-electric element ) supported through vibration film , and the following advantageous effects are produced due to this difference.","Specifically, vibration film  is more susceptible to deformation because it is made of a relatively lowly rigid material as compared with seat . Therefore, according to this embodiment, a larger vibration amplitude can be produced as compared with the conventional configuration in which the outer periphery of seat  is directly supported by supporting member . Also, in the configuration of this embodiment, vibration film  (see ) is provided to extend in the horizontal direction (i.e., in parallel with the main surfaces of piezo-electric element ). Consequently, it is less prone to a problem of an increase in size of the entire actuator due to the addition of vibration film .","Also, this embodiment employs circular piezo-electric element . Since an energy efficiency of circular piezo-electric element , when it performs a radius extending motion is high as compared with a rectangular element, this configuration can produce a larger driving force when the same voltage is applied. Then, with such a large driving force propagated to the vibration film, the amount of vibrations of the piezo-electric actuator increases. Also, in the case of the circular element, since the distance from its center to the peripheral edge is uniform, a stress generated when vibrations are propagated to a beam is uniformly distributed, advantageously resulting in a higher energy efficiency and an increased amplitude as well. Also, since piezo-electric element , seat , and vibration film  are concentrically arranged, uneven vibrations and the like are less susceptible to occur.","Next, a description will be given of the relationship between a vibration mode and the frequency characteristic of the piezo-electric actuator. The utilization of a piezo-electric actuator as an acoustic element per se has been disclosed in the aforementioned JP-61-168971-A, JP-2000-140759-A, JP-2001-17917-A and the like. However, the acoustic elements in these publications mean to be a buzzer and a vibrator. When used only as a vibrator, a sound pressure may simply be improved, but when used as a speaker, the vibration mode of the piezo-electric actuator must be studied in consideration of even its frequency characteristic as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 6B","FIG. 35","FIG. 6A"],"b":["20","20"]},"Next, a description will be given of features of flexion type motions and piston type motions. A vibration mode of flexion type motions generated by the conventional piezo-electric actuator presents a mountain shape in which the center of the piezo-electric ceramics matches a maximum displacement inflection point. While a large amplitude can be produced at the center, displacements relatively attenuate gradually at positions closer to the vicinity of the fixed end. On the other hand, a vibration mode of piston motions presents a trapezoidal shape having maximum inflection point  near the fixed end, as shown in , and features in that vibrations largely rises near the fixed end. In comparison of vibration displacement amounts in these two vibration modes, the flexion type motions are superior to the piston type motions in the amount of maximum vibrations within a sound radiation plane, whereas the piston type motions are superior to the flexion type motions in the amount of average vibrations within the sound radiation plane, with a large amount of displacement at the fixed end.","In this regard, since the sound pressure is usually defined by a volumetric displacement to a radiation plane, the sound pressure is higher as the average vibration amount is larger, so that the piston type vibration mode is preferably promoted for improving the sound pressure level. In this regard, the piston type motion and flexion type motion can be defined by the proportion of the average displacement amount to the maximum displacement amount, where the piston type mode is promoted as the proportion approaches to one in an equation expressed by (average vibration amount)\/(maximum vibration amount) (described in detail in Evaluation of Embodiment 5).","According to the configuration of this embodiment, as shown in , the area to which seat  is adhered is an area corresponding to A, and the outside thereof is a connection area A which is apparently less rigid (i.e., more susceptible to deformation) than area A. Accordingly, since this connection area A presents relatively larger deformations, the vibration mode can be brought closer to the piston type as a whole. Further, the fact that area A around the area to which the seat is adhered is made of a less rigid material means that the resonant frequency of a vibration plate (which refers to a laminate of the seat and vibration film) becomes lower as compared with the conventional configuration in which seat  is directly connected to the supporting member. Then, a lower resonant frequency leads to improvements in the frequency characteristic of the acoustic element, as described below.","In an acoustic element, it is usually regarded relatively difficult to generate sufficiently large sound at frequency equal to or lower than resonant frequency f, and for this reason, configurations are often employed to utilize only a frequency band after resonant frequency f as reproducible sound. Specifically, when resonant frequency f of a piezo-electric actuator exists in a high frequency band (for example, 2 kHz), stating extremely simply, the acoustic element can generate sound only in a band equal to or higher than 2 kHz.","On the other hand, a frequency band required to reproduce music by a portable telephone or the like is preferably from 1 k to 10 kHz. Thus, a piezo-electric actuator having resonant frequency f at 1 kHz or lower is suitable for portable telephones and the like, and an actuator which is also advantageous in a reduction in size, like this embodiment, has a high utility value. However, since the piezo-electric actuator uses highly rigid ceramic as a piezo-electric element, the resonant frequency of a vibration section becomes higher, and the piezo-electric actuator has a nature of being unsuitable for generating low sound. In this regard, it is contemplated to increase the element size, thereby reducing apparent rigidity of the piezo-electric element to lower the resonant frequency. However, as previously described, since the piezo-electric actuators are often equipped in small electronic devices such as portable telephones, by way of example, it is preferable to configure to facilitate the generation of low sound without changing the element size from a viewpoint of preventing an increase in the size of the device as well.","Summarizing the foregoing, in order to reproduce music in a wider frequency band in a portable telephone or the like, it can be said that it is important to set resonant frequency f of the piezo-electric actuator at a point lower than resonant frequency f. Then, in order to more lower resonant frequency f, it is effective to reduce the rigidity of the vibration plate.","According to the configuration of this embodiment, since the member for connecting seat  to supporting member  is vibration film  which is less rigid than the seat, the resonant frequency is reduced as compared with the conventional configuration. As a result, the piezo-electric actuator of this embodiment can produce a sufficient vibration amplitude over a wide frequency range, and can realize a good frequency characteristic when it is used as an acoustic element.","Other than the above, the piezo-electric actuator of this embodiment has the following advantages. First, the vibration characteristic of the piezo-electric actuator can be readily adjusted by changing the material characteristic and shape of seat , and the material characteristic and shape of vibration film  as appropriate. Particularly, since the shape of the seat and the thickness of the vibration film can be adjusted without changing the size of a housing (size of the supporting member), the supporting member can be used as a common part, which is advantageous in reducing the manufacturing cost as well.","Also, conventionally, a reduction in the resonant frequency of a piezo-electric actuator has been supported by making a piezo-electric element thinner, whereas, according to the present invention, the resonant frequency can be reduced simply by adjusting the material of the vibration film, and the spacing between the supporting member and the restraining member even if a relatively thick piezo-electric element is used. Generally, for manufacturing a thin piezo-electric element, a cost is relatively increased due to cracking during sintering and the like. On the other hand, according to the present invention, the manufacturing cost can be limited because such a thin piezo-electric element need not be provided.","The piezo-electric actuator according to the present invention can also be utilized as a sound source of an electronic device (for example, a portable telephone, a notebook type personal computer, a small gaming device or the like). Incidentally, conventionally, a piezo-electric actuator which uses ceramics as a piezo-electric element has an aspect that the piezo-electric element is highly susceptible to damages when it is dropped. On the other hand, the portable electronic device as mentioned above is often dropped by the user by mistake during use, and from this fact, the piezo-electric actuator has been conventionally considered to be unsuitable for portable devices. However, in the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention, since seat  to which the piezo-electric element is fixed and supporting member  are supported through lowly rigid vibration film , an impact can be absorbed by an attenuation effect of vibration film , even if the piezo-electric actuator is dropped, thus making the piezo-electric element less susceptible to damages. Accordingly, the piezo-electric actuator can be suitably used for portable electronic devices.","In the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention, a flection amount \u03b4 (m) of vibration film intervening section A between the outer periphery of the seat and the inner periphery of the supporting member can be calculated in the following manner. In this regard, vibration film intervening section A between the outer periphery of the seat and the inner periphery of the supporting member, i.e., vibration film intervening section A () is an intervening site comprised of the vibration film positioned between outer periphery of seat  and inter periphery of supporting member , as shown in , and flection amount \u03b4 (m) of this vibration film intervening section A is calculated from the following calculation equation (1).","A description will be given of a method of calculating flection amount \u03b4 of vibration film intervening section A in the present invention. Calculation equation (1) described below is an equation applied to vibration film intervening section A which is in a cantilevered structure, as shown in . Here, the cantilevered structure is a structure in which one end of vibration film intervening section A is coupled to supporting member  to form fixed end , while the other end is free end , as shown in . Then, by applying defined load W to a leading end of this free end , flection amount \u03b4 can be calculated.","Also, in calculation equation (1), L is the length of vibration film intervening section A to the radial direction of piezo-electric element ; h is the thickness of the vibration film; and E is modulus of direct elasticity of the material of the vibration film (see ). Then, in this embodiment, load W was chosen to be 1 N (N\/m), and width b of beam-shaped vibration film intervening section A to be 0.001 m for making the calculation.","In this regard, the calculation of flection amount \u03b4 of vibration film intervening section A in the shape of the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention is essentially made in consideration of an annular plane shape which has an opening, as described later with reference to , but in calculation equation (1), flection amount \u03b4 was calculated on the assumption that changes in the thickness, the modulus of direct elasticity of the material of the vibration film, and length L of vibration film intervening section A exponentially exerted influences, while the influence due to a plane area was small, so that an approximation could be made even when a plane shape was a rectangular shape, and a rectangular shape with width b equal to 0.001 (m) was employed in this embodiment.\n\n\u03b4=()\/(3)\u2003\u2003(Equation 1)\n","L: length (m) of the vibration film intervening section between the outer periphery of the seat and the inner periphery of the supporting member;","E: modulus of direct elasticity (N\/m) of the material of the vibration film;","W: load (N);","I: moment of inertia (m);\n\n=()\/12\u2003\u2003(Equation 2),\n","b: width (m) of the vibration film intervening section=0.001; and","h: thickness (m) of the vibration film.","In the following, flection amount \u03b4 of vibration film intervening section A is calculated in the shape shown in , as an example. Substituting 0.001 m (1 mm) into length L of vibration film intervening section A; 4.0\u00d710(N\/m) into the modulus of direct elasticity of the vibration film (material: urethane); 8\u00d710(m) (80 \u03bcm) into thickness h of the vibration film; 0.001 m (1 mm) into width b which is a defined value; and 1 (N) into load W which is a defined value, respectively, flection amount \u03b4 is calculated to be 0.0195 (m).","In the piezo-electric actuator of this embodiment, by making a selection such that flection amount \u03b4 (m) falls within a range of 0.001 to 5, a piston type vibration mode can be achieved. By making an adjustment such that flection amount \u03b4 of vibration film intervening section A, which is a node of vibrations, falls within a predetermined range, a stress concentrates on a joint () of the outer periphery of a spring and the vibration film or a spring seat (), when vibrations occur, resulting in a maximum inflection point position (see ).","Since the maximum inflection point is formed near the fixed end in this way, the piston type vibration mode is promoted. On the other hand, when flection amount \u25a1 is smaller than 0.001, a stress concentrates on the outer periphery of supporting member  and the center of the piezo-electric ceramics, the maximum inflection point exists at the center of the ceramics, resulting in a flexion type vibration mode. On the other hand, when flection amount \u03b4 is larger than five, a stress concentrates on the periphery of seat  when vibrations occur, but since the rigidity of the vibration film is low, the generated amount propagated to the vibration film attenuates, a sufficient vibration displacement cannot be produced, and its vibration mode is a free end type flexion motion which presents flexion motions only near the piezo-electric ceramic.","As described above, by adjusting flection amount \u03b4 of vibration film intervening section A to fall within a predetermined range, the piston type motion mode is promoted. As compared with a conventional piezo-electric actuator having a mountain-shaped motion mode, an average vibration amount is high within a sound radiation plane, and therefore a sound pressure level is high, so that it is possible to realize as a piezo-electric actuator for an acoustic element.","The piezo-electric actuator of the present invention is not limited to those shown in the foregoing embodiments, but may have a configuration as shown in , B.  is an exploded perspective view showing the configuration of a piezo-electric actuator of a second embodiment, and  is a vertical sectional view of the piezo-electric actuator.","Piezo-electric actuator  of  employs vibration film  which is formed with opening at the center thereof. The rest of the configuration is similar to the first embodiment. Opening is circular, and is formed to be concentric with piezo-electric element  and seat . Since opening is formed, seat  is supported only around the outer periphery of its back surface (bottom surface as shown in the figure) by vibration film . Stated another way, the back surface of seat  has an area corresponding to opening in an exposed state.","Even piezo-electric actuator  of this embodiment configured as described above perform vibration operations in a manner similar to the aforementioned embodiments using piezo-electric element  as a driving source. Here, seat  is configured to be supported only around the outer periphery thereof, and the area of opening is not restrained by vibration film , so that seat  is more prone to flexion and deformation, resulting in a further increase in the vibration amplitude of the actuator. Also, the fact that an apparent rigidity of the vibration plate (which refers to a laminate of the seat and vibration film) becomes lower in this way means that the resonant frequency of the actuator becomes lower, which is preferable because the frequency characteristic of the acoustic element is improved.","In view of advantageous effects produced by opening as described above, it can be said that as the area of opening is larger, seat  is more prone to flexion and deformation, leading to a lower resonant frequency of the actuator. In this regard, the shape of opening is not limited to the circular shape but may be a rectangular or a polygonal shape. Also, instead of a single opening as in the foregoing embodiment, a plurality of openings may be provided.","The actuator of the present invention is not limited to those shown in the aforementioned embodiment, but may have a configuration as shown in . Piezo-electric actuator  shown in  employs piezo-electric element  formed in a square shape. The rest of the configuration is similar to the first embodiment. Piezo-electric element  is modified only in the contour shape of piezo-electric element  in the first embodiment, and its material and basic structure are similar to the first embodiment. For example, piezo-electric element  is similar to the aforementioned embodiment in that an upper electrode layer and a lower electrode layer are formed on the top and bottom surfaces of a piezo-electric plate, respectively.","In this way, in the present invention, the piezo-electric element is not particularly limited in the contour shape, and may be circular (see ) or rectangular (see ). Further, the piezo-electric element may be oval or polygonal. Particularly, a square element is highly symmetric, like a circular piezo-electric element, and therefore provides a high energy efficiency when it performs expansion\/contraction motions (radially expanding motions), so that a larger driving force can be produced as compared with a rectangular element. Then, with such a large driving force, a sufficient vibration amplitude can be produced. Also, the rectangular element is advantageous in view of the manufacturing cost because it presents a higher yield rate and is easier to fabricate, as compared with a circular element.","The piezo-electric actuator of the present invention is not limited to those shown in the aforementioned embodiments, but may further have a configuration as shown in .  is a plan view showing the configuration of a piezo-electric actuator of a fourth embodiment, and  is a plan view showing a seat piece for use in the piezo-electric actuator.","As shown in , in piezo-electric actuator A, a plurality of beams are formed on the outer peripheral side of seat A. The rest of the configuration is similar to the first embodiment. A plurality of beams are formed along the outer periphery edge of body section which has a circular contour. All beams are in the same shape, and radially extend from the center of body section outward in the radial direction.","Seat A is a single member which has body section integrated with beams . Though the illustration is omitted, beams extend straightly within the same plane as body section . The material of seat A is the same as that of the first embodiment, and the contour shape of body section is the same as the contour shape of piezo-electric element . A lower electrode layer of piezo-electric element  is bonded on the top surface of body section , whereby piezo-electric element  is restrained by seat A.","The number of beams is not particularly limited. Piezo-electric actuator B shown in  is formed with four beams , while actuator C shown in  is formed with 12 beams . In any of piezo-electric actuators A-C, beams are formed at equal intervals (which is intended to define the same spacing between the beams with respect to the circumferential direction). Also, each beam may have constant beam width W, as shown in  and the like, or may be tapered such that beam width W becomes gradually smaller toward the leading end of the beam.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIGS. 13 and 14","b":["21","21","30","21","45","21"],"i":["a ","a ","a "]},"Even piezo-electric actuators A-C comprising beams as described above are similar to the first embodiment in their operation principle. Specifically, piezo-electric element  performs expansion\/contraction motions as an AC electric field is applied to the upper electrode layer and lower electrode layer of piezo-electric element . In accordance with the direction of the electric field, the expansion\/contraction motions by piezo-electric element  are alternately repeated to excite vibrations due to a restraining effect of seat A. In this event, body section vibrates in the vertical direction, and its motions are transmitted to a plurality of beams . Since beams do not have their leading ends directly connected to supporting member  but is connected thereto through vibration film , an amplitude increasing effect by vibration film  is expected as is the case with the first embodiment.","Particularly, in a region near beam , an apparent rigidity of seat A is reduced as compared with the seat which is not formed with a beam, which has an outer diameter defined by a circle indicated by broken line \u2032. Accordingly, the outer periphery of the seat is more susceptible to deformation, and vibrations of the vibration film can be more induced, so that the vibration amplitude of the piezo-electric actuator is more increased. In the actuator of this embodiment, since deformations of the beams are relatively large, while deformations of the piezo-electric body supporting section are relatively small, the piston type vibration mode is more likely to occur as shown in  rather than the vibration mode as shown in . For this reason, the piezo-electric element can be largely reciprocally moved in the vertical direction without giving large deformations or distortions to the piezo-electric body.","Alternatively, in the configuration described above, beams and body section can be provided as separate members, and further, these two members , may be of the same material or of different materials. Also, when seat A is formed from a single sheet-shaped member, it may be stamped out by pressing.","Further, the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention is not limited to those shown in the aforementioned embodiments, but may have a configuration as shown in . In this regard,  omits the illustration of piezo-electric element . Piezo-electric actuator  shown in  employs square supporting member , and accordingly, vibration film  also has a rectangular contour shape. The rest of the configuration is similar to the first embodiment.","Even if vibration film  is rectangular in this way, the advantageous effects of the present invention resulting from seat  connected to supporting member  through vibration film  can be produced in a similar manner to the foregoing. With the use of rectangular vibration film , an area for disposing the piezo-electric actuator can be effectively utilized for the following reasons. For example, consider circular vibration film  as indicated by a broken line in  and vibration film  of this embodiment. The sizes of vibration films ,  are in a relationship that the contour of vibration film  is inscribed in the contour of vibration film .","When a piezo-electric actuator is placed in an electronic device or the like, a rectangular area is often provided in general as a placement space in the electronic device. In this event, a placement space required in the electronic device is substantially the same whether a circularly contoured actuator having vibration film  is utilized or a rectangularly contoured actuator having vibration film  is utilized.","In view of this point, of the two piezo-electric actuators which use the same placement space, piezo-electric actuator  of this embodiment which can increase the area of vibration film  is more advantageous in that it can realize a higher sound pressure level. In this regard, when rectangular vibration film  is compared with circular vibration film , vibration film  has a wider area of the vibration film by four areas indicated by shading, and an improved sound pressure level is expected in correspondence to this increase.","The piezo-electric actuator of the present invention is not limited to those shown in the aforementioned embodiments, but may have a configuration as shown in . Piezo-electric actuator  shown in  employs vibration film  including a curved section . The rest of the configuration is similar to the first embodiment.","Vibration film  comprises flat central section for supporting the back surface of seat , and curved section formed outside of central section . Though the illustration is omitted, the contour shape of central section , when viewed from above, is circular, while the contour shape of curved section is annular, concentric with central section ","With curved section formed in this way, the stroke of the vibration film in connection area A is increased, thereby reducing the rigidity of the vibration film. As a result, the vibration film is more susceptible to deformation, the resonant frequency is reduced, and a larger vibration amplitude can be produced.","The above-mentioned \u201ccurved section\u201d is intended to be a structure with part of the vibration film which is three-dimensionally curved. Accordingly, the \u201ccurved section\u201d includes, for example, a cross-sectional structure in which waveforms continue, in addition to semi-circular curved section in cross-section as shown in .","While the third to sixth embodiments have employed vibration films , ,  which are not formed with an opening, this is not a limitation. For example, vibration film ,  (see , ) may be formed with an opening, as described in the second embodiment. Also, components of each embodiment (including a seventh embodiment below) may be combined with one another as appropriate, as a matter of course.","While the foregoing description has been given of an exemplary configuration in which piezo-electric element  is fixed on one surface of the seat, the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention is not so limited. The piezo-electric actuator of the present invention may be equipped with bimorph type piezo-electric element , as shown in .","Bimorph type piezo-electric element  comprises piezo-electric element A and piezo-electric element B adhered on both surfaces of seat  similar to that of the first embodiment, respectively. Piezo-electric element  thus configured alternates such operations as one piezo-electric element A expands while the other piezo-electric element B contracts, and the other piezo-electric element B expands while the one piezo-electric element contracts. According to such a configuration, a larger driving force can be produced as compared with a one-sheet type piezo-electric element as described above.","In bimorph type piezo-electric element , when one of piezo-electric element A, B expands while the other contracts (in other words, when it is comprised of two elements which perform reverse operations to each other), the polarization direction of each piezo-electric element is not particularly limited. For example, the polarization directions of both the piezo-electric elements may be arranged in the same direction (for example, upward as shown in the figure).","In this regard, when a bimorph type element is unitized, vibration film \u2032 formed with an opening may be employed, as shown in . Alternatively, vibration film  without an opening may be employed, where piezo-electric element B may be adhered on the opposite side to piezo-electric element A with the vibration film interposed therebetween (see [Example 5] later described).","Further describing the piezo-electric element, the piezo-electric element may be in a laminate structure per se. This is described with reference to . Piezo-electric element  shown in  is in a multi-layered structure which comprises piezo-electric plates -, made of a piezo-electric material, laminated in five layers. Electrode layers (conductive layers) -are formed one between the piezo-electric plates. The polarization direction of each piezo-electric plate -is opposite to one another, and the orientation of electric field is also configured to be alternately opposite. According to piezo-electric element  in such a laminate structure, since a high electric field strength is generated between the electrode layers, a driving force of the overall piezo-electric element is improved by the number of laminated piezo-electric plates. Piezo-electric element  shown in  can be utilized, for example, instead of piezo-electric element  shown in .","Characteristic evaluations of the piezo-electric actuator of the present invention were made with the following Examples and Comparative Examples 1-4 to evaluate the effects of the present invention. Evaluated items are shown below.","(Evaluation 1) Measurement of Resonant Frequency: Resonant frequency was measured when an AC voltage of 1 V was applied.","(Evaluation 2) Maximum vibration speed amplitude: Maximum vibration speed amplitude Vmax (see , B) was measured when an AC voltage of 1 V was applied during resonance.","(Evaluation 3) Average vibration speed amplitude: Vibration speed amplitudes were measured at  measuring points uniformly distributed in the longitudinal direction of the piezo-electric elements, as shown in , and an average value of these were calculated.\n\n(Evaluation 4) Calculation of flection amount \u03b4 of the vibration film intervening section. Flection amount \u03b4 was calculated from the following equation. In the following equation, the calculation is made with a load chosen to be 1 N (N\/m) and width b to be 0.001 m (Equation 2) (see the second embodiment for details of the calculation method).\n\n\u03b4=()\/(3\u00b7)\u2003\u2003(Equation 1)\n","L: Length (m) of Vibration Film Intervening Section between Outer Periphery of Seat and Inner Periphery of Supporting Member","E: Modulus of Direct Elasticity of Material of Vibration film (N\/m)","W: Load (N)","I: Moment of Inertia (m)","Moment of Inertia (I)\n\n=()\/12\u2003\u2003(Equation 2)\n","b: Width (m) of Vibration Film Intervening Section=0.001","h: Thickness (m) of Vibration Film","(Evaluation 5) Vibration Mode: As shown in , a \u201cvibration speed ratio\u201d is defined by average vibration speed amplitude Vm divided by maximum speed amplitude Vmax, and the vibration mode was discriminated on the basis of the value of this vibration speed ratio. Specifically, from the fact that an flexion motion (mountain-shaped motion) results as shown in  when the vibration speed ratio is small, whereas a reciprocation (piston type motion) results as shown in  when the vibration speed ratio is large, a threshold was set to vibration speed ratio=0.8 in this example, where an flexion motion was discriminated when the vibration speed ratio was smaller than 0.8, while a piston type motion was discriminated when equal to or larger than 0.8.\n\n(Evaluation 6) Measurement of Sound Pressure Level: A sound pressure level was measured by a microphone disposed at a position a predetermined distance away from the element when an AC voltage of 1 V was applied. This predetermined distance is 10 cm unless otherwise noted.\n\n(Evaluation 7) Drop and Impact Test: A portable telephone equipped with the piezo-electric actuator was naturally dropped five times vertically from above 50 cm to make a drop impact stability test. Specifically, destructions such as crack and the like were visually confirmed after the drop and impact test, and a sound pressure characteristic was further measured after the test. As a result, a sound pressure level difference (which refers to the difference between the sound pressure level before the test and the sound pressure level after the test) equal to or less than 3 dB was qualified (\u25ef), and that equal to or more than 3 dB was disqualified (X).\n","In this regard, the structure (shape, material and the like) of the piezo-electric actuator according to each
