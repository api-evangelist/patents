title: Non-inertial release safety restraint belt buckle systems
abstract: Vehicle body restraint systems including buckles for latching and retaining latch plates associated with safety belts wherein the buckles includes latching mechanisms having oppositely oriented release mechanisms which are operative in such a manner that any force applied to one release mechanism which would act to release a latch plate creates an increased force on the opposing release mechanism to retain the latch plate in a locked position. Release of the latch plates can only occur upon the simultaneous activation of the opposing release mechanisms by manual force applied in opposite directions.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Continuation-in-Part of Application Ser. No. 10\/462,738, filed Jun. 17, 2003, entitled NON-INERTIAL SAFETY RESTRAINT BELT BUCKLE SYSTEM, in the name of the same inventor, now abandoned.","This invention is generally directed to vehicle safety restraint systems including shoulder and lap-type seat belts and more particularly to such restraint systems which incorporate locking mechanisms for preventing release of latch plates from buckles of the restraint systems due to inertial forces created during vehicle accidents, such as in vehicle rollovers. The restraint systems can only be released by simultaneously manually maneuvering opposing release mechanisms in opposite directions.","Body restraint systems including seat belts, lap belts, shoulder harnesses and the like have been credited with saving numerous lives which otherwise would have been lost in vehicular accidents. The positive benefits obtained due to body restraints systems has been so recognized that, in the United States, the use of seat belts is mandated in all states.","Since their inception, there have been numerous innovative advances made to improve upon the safety and reliability of vehicle body restraint systems. Improvements have been made to the belt and belt materials, the manner in which the belt restraint systems are mounted within vehicles, the manner in which such restraint systems may be automatically adjusted to provide proper tension to suit not only safety standards but to also provide for a measure of passenger comfort and, further, to improve upon the security of the locking devices and belt buckles associated with such systems.","Most conventional vehicle body restraint systems incorporate a belt which either crosses in front of the lap or diagonally across the body of the vehicle operator or passenger in such a manner as to not adversely interfere with a region of an individual's neck. Belts are retained by latching assemblies including belt buckles into which latch plates carried by the belts can be inserted so as to automatically become locked to the buckles which are normally anchored relative to vehicle frames.","Conventional systems generally utilize two types of release mechanisms for allowing latch plates to be removed from buckle housings such that drivers and passengers can disembark vehicles. A first or side release system includes an operating release button which is generally resiliently urged outwardly at an angle which is perpendicular to an axis or line of insertion of the latch plate into a buckle housing. A second type of conventional release system is known as an end release system and includes an operating lever or button for releasing the latch plate from the buckle housing and which lever is mounted at an end of the buckle housing.","Currently, virtually all types of latching mechanisms for body restraint systems in automotive vehicles are subject to premature release when subjected to at least one mode of inertial force which is created under various conditions resulting from collisions, rollovers and other types of loss of vehicle control. Side release latching assemblies or mechanisms, referred to as Type  and Type  in the industry, will inertially release when subjected to lateral forces which are applied to a backside of a buckle during a vehicle collision or rollover. Such latching assemblies will also release by the release buttons being forceably engaged by an object in a vehicle accidently depressing the buttons during an accident, collision or rollover, thereby prematurely destroying the effectiveness of the restraint systems which can cause severe or deadly injury to persons using the systems.","By way of example, if a person's hip strikes the backside of a buckle frame, the interior latch will engage a latch plate of a seat belt and will release when the striking force level is sufficient to cause the inertia of the latch mass, relative to the acceleration and displacement of the buckle frame, to compress a leaf spring and unlatch the buckle.","End type release latching systems will inertially release due to the mass of the release buttons associated therewith when taken into consideration the mass of movement of latch plates and the direction of rotational release of the latch plates when subjected to an upward or upward and lateral force opposite a locking direction of latch dogs associated with such mechanisms, especially during vehicle rollovers. This lateral mode of failure occurs when an occupant is more apt to be ejected from a vehicle and thus can result in severe bodily injury or death.","An example of end release latching system for seat belts is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,358,879 to Magyar. The system uses a release button which is pushed down to release the latch plate as opposed to being pushed laterally as in the side release systems.","Virtually all end release buckles, generally referred to as Type II buckles, operate using an over-the-center mechanism so the actual latch uses either a fairly weak compression spring or a leaf spring for a latching force. A so called \u201clock for the latch\u201d is a rod or bar that follows an \u201cL\u201d shaped track where the lock bar moves laterally across the buckle frame in a direction of latch movement and then moves vertically along a leg of the \u201cL\u201d and behind the latch after the latch goes over-the-center to its latched position; thus supposedly locking the latch from moving laterally due to lateral forces acting on the buckle frame that would inertially move the latch laterally relative to the buckle frame.","However, the end release buckles have a release button, release slider, lock bar (pin) latch and two compression springs, all of which have mass. One spring actuates the latch laterally and the other spring acts against the latch plate to keep a locking edge in contact with a latch surface or \u201cdog\u201d and applies an upward force against the release button. This spring also acts to eject the latch plate from the buckle when the latch button is depressed and the latch is disengage.","When vertical forces, or forces with enough vertical component on a buckle, such as forces created by impacts to a bottom of a vehicle in a rollover, are sufficiently high enough, the buckle latch will release. The design of these buckles is such that release requires both a vertical (longitudinal) and horizontal (lateral) component in many cases because any vertically upward forces cause equally vertical downward inertial forces to the release button and related components, which causes them to move in a downward (release) direction due to their mass and acceleration relative to the buckle frame. When the components of the release mechanism approach an elbow of the locking \u201cL\u201d slot, the locking pin or bar follows the path of the slot and releases the latch and the compression spring against which these inertia forces are acting, and ejects the latch plate.","The forces acting on a latch plate\/buckle assembly that create inertia forces in a release direction come from various and foreseeable sources and directions and always follow Newton's Law. Some of these are:\n\n","A latch plate weighs anywhere from approximately two (2) to five (5) ounces, depending on whether it is a slip, partial slip or slip lock latch plate. A weight (mass) of the release components of the buckle (button, slider, locking pin, etc.) is a fraction of the latch plate weight.","The dynamic problem with the end release buckles is that when there is an upward force or upward component of force acting on the buckle or a downward impulse from sudden tensile loading\/unloading of seat belt webbing through the latch plate, the latch plate mass applies a downward inertia force or impulse that drives an unlatch mechanism downward toward an unlatch position, accelerating the unlatch mechanism masses downward and thus causing the latch to release. Any horizontal or lateral force acting on the buckle frame in an opposite direction of the unlatch direction compounds the unlatching due to acceleration forces acting on the buckle frame.","The above modes of failure are inherent in virtually all conventional side and end release latching mechanisms of conventional vehicle restraint systems. The side release buckle systems are generally simpler and have fewer moving parts and thus are more economical to construct and to install, whereas the end release systems are more complex having multiple moving parts and are thus more expensive to manufacture.","In view of the foregoing, there remains a need to further improve upon the reliability and effectiveness of vehicle body restraint safety belt systems to ensure that the latching mechanisms associated therewith cannot be accidently released during substantially any type of vehicular movement including vehicle rollovers caused during accidents, collisions or resulting from loss of control of a vehicle, such as by operator error or vehicle equipment failure. There is a further need to provide for improvements in vehicle body restraint systems which permit the latching assemblies to be more reliable and more economic to construct.","The present invention is directed to vehicle body restraint systems which include buckles for latching and restraining latch plates carried by seat or lap belts and safety harnesses. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed. The embodiments are designed to prevent inertial release of safety restraint buckle or latching assemblies associated with vehicles by requiring intentional manual release of two equally resisted and oppositely oriented push button release mechanisms associated with the buckles such that release of latch plates from the buckles is only possible by the simultaneous manual movement of the oppositely oriented release mechanisms or buttons.","Each locking mechanism utilizes equal and opposite locking forces against opposing lock release buttons such that if a force, or component of force, acts on a body of a buckle which is inline with an actuation direction of one of the release buttons, an equal and opposite force acts against the opposing release button thereby locking it into tighter engagement with the latch of the buckle assembly. Thus, the locking mechanism can not release by the application inertial forces to the buckle assembly. The release of the latch plate can only occur upon the deliberate and simultaneous manual application of force to the two opposing release buttons in opposite directions.","The safety belt assembly of each of the restraint systems of the invention is provided with a latch plate which is insertable so as to be locked and retained within a buckle housing having internal latching components for engaging and preventing the removal of the latch plate until manually released. The buckle housings including an opening in which a latch plate is slidably received. Mounted interiorly of each buckle housing is at least one movable latch which is operable in a first position to engage within an opening in the latch plate to thereby prevent withdrawal of the latch plate until the at least one latch is moved from the opening in the latch plate.","In a first embodiment of the invention, a single latch is movably mounted within the buckle housing against a resilient element or spring which normally urges the latch to its first or \u201clocking\u201d position. The latch includes a latch dog which is engageable with an edge defining the opening in the latch plate to thereby prevent withdrawal of the latch plate once it has been inserted within the buckle housing. The latch is operably connected to a pair of oppositely oriented release buttons which are mounted through opposite sides of the buckle housing. Each of the push or release buttons is engaged with a separate arm of the latch such that both arms of the latch must be engaged simultaneously by the oppositely oriented release buttons to urge the latch to a second or \u201crelease\u201d position wherein the latch dog is free of the opening in the latch plate thus permitting the release of the latch plate from the buckle housing.","As noted, a spring is mounted within the buckle housing so as to apply a constant force to the latch in the first locking direction such that, upon insertion of the latch plate within the buckle housing, the latch locking dog is urged into engagement with the latch plate as soon as the opening of the latch plate passes the latch dog of the latch.","The buckle housing includes an internal frame component on which the opposing push buttons are guidingly engaged. The housing is also configured such that the push buttons are recessed relative thereto to thereby prevent accidental engagement with, and inadvertent actuation of, the buttons. A resilient element, such as a spring, is mounted between each of the push buttons so as to apply an equal and opposite force urging each of the buttons to a first and outer locking position. With this arrangement, when a force is applied to move, one of the push buttons to a second release position wherein the push button is pushed inwardly of the housing, an opposite force is directed to the opposing push button thereby providing additional force to maintain the opposite push button in its first or locking position. Therefore, unless both push buttons are moved to their inner release positions simultaneously, the latch can not be moved to its second release position as one of the push buttons will be engaging an arm of the latch to prevent its movement from its first locked position. Further, the greater the force applied to one push button to move it to its release position, the greater the force applied to the opposite release button to retain it in its locked position.","In the first embodiment, the latch plate is specially constructed so as to simultaneously urge each of the push buttons to their second release positions upon the insertion of the latch plate into the buckle housing. In this respect, the latch plate includes a pair of forwardly spaced tangs having beveled edges which are engageable in slots in each of the push buttons so as to cam each push button to its second release position upon the insertion of the tangs until the opening in the latch plate is aligned to allow the latch dog of the latch to be resiliently urged within the opening to thereby lock the latch plate within the buckle housing.","In a second embodiment of the invention, a pair of latches are mounted within the buckle housing on opposite sides of a channel in which the latch plate is slidingly received when inserted through the opening in one end of the buckle housing. Each of the latches is resiliently urged to a first locking position in which lock dogs associated with each latch are engageable within the opening in the latch plate with the oppositely oriented latch dogs being positioned generally side-by-side when the latches are in the first locked position. Further, two push buttons are mounted through opposite sidewalls of the housing as with the first embodiment. Each push or release button includes an extended catch member which is generally u-shaped and designed to engage a separate one of the latch plates so as to prevent movement of the latch plate from the first locking position to a second release position wherein the latch dogs associated with the latches are moved from the opening in the latch plate to thereby permit the withdrawal of the latch plate.","Each push button further includes a beveled surface for engaging an opposing side of the latch associated therewith which side is also beveled, such that, upon movement of the push buttons from their first outer locking position inwardly to their second release position, the beveled surfaces will urge the adjacent latch to be moved to its second release position.","In order to ensure that both push buttons must be moved to their second release positions simultaneously to release the latch plate from the buckle housing, a pair of springs are provided between each of the catch portions of the push buttons and the opposing push button. If force is applied to move either push button to its second release position, an opposite force is directed by the interconnecting spring or resilient element to urge the opposing push button outwardly with increased force so as to maintain the opposite push button in its first locked position. Therefore, only by the simultaneous application of force to each of the opposing push buttons to move them inwardly relative to the buckle housing can both latches be moved to their second release positions to permit the latch plate to be withdrawn from the buckle housing.","It is the primary object of the present invention to provide safety restraint assemblies for vehicles which include buckle and latch plate mechanisms which can not be released by inertial forces applied to the components of the assemblies such as caused by vehicle accidents including rollovers.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide latching and locking mechanisms for seat belt restraint systems which follow Newtonian Laws of Physics to the effect that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, so that a latch plate can not be released relative to a buckle unless oppositely directed forces are applied to a pair of opposing push buttons associated with the restraint systems.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide latching and locking mechanisms for seat belt restraint systems wherein the inadvertent or accidental application of force to one of a pair of release push buttons associated therewith can not cause the release of latch plates of the restraint systems and further wherein such accidentally application of force supplies a greater force to retain the other of the release buttons in a locked position.","It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide non-inertial release restraint buckles for use in seat belt restraining systems of the type utilized in automotive vehicles and the like wherein the buckle latching assemblies can be structured from a minimal number of operative components to thereby reduce a risk of component failure while decreasing manufacturing costs of the restraint buckles.","With continued reference to  of the drawing figures, a first embodiment of non-inertial release restraint buckle of the present invention will be described as used with a seat belt restraint system of a vehicle. Such a restraint system includes a seat belt  in the form of a harness or lap belt which is mounted to a latch plate  for insertion into a buckle . The buckle includes a housing  which is connected by way of a buckle housing frame member  to an anchor belt  which is normally connected to an anchor bracket which is bolted to a frame of the vehicle.","The buckle housing  has been removed to show the inner workings of the buckle and latch plate in FIGS.  and \u2013, however, the housing is shown in  with respect to the first embodiment and is also shown in all figures with respect to a second embodiment in . As is illustrated in , to release the latch plate  from the buckle , simultaneous forces must be applied to the opposing release push buttons  and  associated therewith.","In the first embodiment showing in  the latch plate  includes an opening  for purposes of receiving a locking or latching mechanism as will be described in greater detail hereinafter. Forwardly of the opening  are a pair of spaced tangs  and  each having beveled inner surfaces  and , respectively, see , which taper inwardly from a front of the latch plate to an enlarged opening  between the tangs. The tangs form opposing locking catch hooks  and  which function to provide a secondary locking function when the latch plate is fully inserted within the buckle housing, as will be described. It should be noted that the opening  is spaced rearwardly of an inner edge  of the opening . The latch plate  further includes a base portion  which is somewhat enlarged compared to the leading tang portion and which includes slots  for receiving the seat, lap or harness belt .","The buckle housing  has an opening  in one end thereof for receiving the latch plate. The opening communicates with opposing channels or passages  formed by the buckle frame member  in which the latch plate is slidingly received when inserted into the buckle housing.","Mounted within the housing  is a single latch  which is movably mounted at its base  within a lip  of the buckle frame, see . A lock or latch dog  is provided generally centrally of the latch, and extends outwardly from a plane of the base of the latch. The latch is movable from a first locking position, wherein in the latch dog is positioned so as to engage within the opening  of the latch plate, see , ,  and , to a second release position wherein the latch and latch dog  is pivoted away from the channels  to permit the insertion and withdrawal of the latch plate , see . Extending forwardly of the latch dog  are a pair of latch control arms  and  which are spaced on either side of the latch dog. The control arms are connected by a forward connector element  such that the arms  and  are rigidly secured relative to one another.","The latch  is continuously urged to its first locking position by a leaf spring or other resilient element , as is shown in . When the latch plate  is inserted within the channels  of the buckle housing , the latch plate will engage the lock dog  and cam the latch  to its second release position. Once the opening  passes the leading edge of the lock dog , the spring  will urge the latch dog into the opening  to thereby prevent withdrawal of the latch plate  with the latch dog  engaging an edge  at the forward portion of the opening . This action provides a first and primary locking function for retaining the latch plate within the buckle.","Also provided within the housing  is a portion of the buckle frame . The frame generally includes a base portion  which is fixedly secured to a lower wall of the housing . The frame includes a pair of side openings  and  formed in opposite sidewalls  and  thereof. The sidewalls  and  have inwardly extending flanges  and  associated therewith which extend inwardly of the housing and thereby define the channels  for guiding the latch plate within the buckle.","To control the release of the latch , the present embodiment of the invention utilizes the pair of oppositely oriented and opposing release push buttons  and . The push buttons are slidably mounted on opposing tracks ,  and ,  defined in the flanges  and , respectively, of the sidewalls of the frame so as to movable within the openings  and  in the sidewalls  and  of the buckle frame.","Each of the push buttons  and  are generally similarly configured but are mirror images of one another. The push buttons include concave finger engaging outer surfaces  which extend generally flush with or slightly within recessed sidewall openings  and  of the housing . The housing  and openings  and  are illustrated in dotted line in . The recessed sidewalls of the buckle housing are better shown in ,  and  with respect to a second embodiment of the invention. The push buttons further include a pair of spaced closed slots  and  which are of a size to be slidingly received on the spaced guide tracks ,  and , .","With reference to , each push button also includes an open slot ,  which extends along a full length of the push button in which one of the tangs of the latch plate is slidingly received when the latch plate is inserted within the buckle housing. The push button  includes the slot or channel  for receiving the tang  of the latch plate. Push button  includes slot  for receiving tang . As previously described, each tang includes an inner beveled surface. Latch plate tang  includes a beveled surface  which engages against a side edge  defining one side of an opening into the slot  of the push button . In this manner, when the latch plate is inserted within the buckle housing , the latch plate tang  will engage within the slot  with the cam surface  thereof urging the push button inwardly of the housing by engagement with the wall or edge , thus moving the push button  into the buckle housing. When the tang member is fully seated, the hook  of the tang  engages within an opening  in an inner end wall of the push button  and thereby provide a secondary locking function to retain the latch plate in the buckle housing. In a like manner, the beveled portion  of the tang  engages a wall  of push button  as the latch plate is inserted within the buckle housing. Contact of the latch plate with push button  urges the button inwardly of the housing until the hooked end  of tang  seats in an opening  in an inner wall of push button  to thereby further lock the latch plate within the housing.","The seating of the latch plate tangs in the openings in the push buttons occurs simultaneously with the seating of the latch dog  within the opening  in the latch plate . Thus, there are three separate points of engagement of the latch plate with the components of the buckle. Further, proper alignment of the latch plate is assured by the edge  of the latch plate engaging the front face of the push buttons when in the locked position as shown in .","The movement of the push buttons  and  to their first or outer locking position, as shown in , is accomplished by a spring or similar resilient element  which is mounted within recessed seats  and  formed in the inner walls  and  of the opposing push buttons. The spring ensures that an equal and opposite force is applied to urge each of the push buttons to their first, outer locking position. The connection of the spring  further ensures that if a force is applied to one of the push buttons alone, to move the one push button from its first outer locking position to an inner release position, an increased force is applied by the compression of the spring  to urge the opposite push button more tightly into its first locking position. It is this equal and opposite application of force, based upon Newtonian Laws of Physics, which makes the lock mechanism of the present invention failsafe and not subject to premature release by inertial forces which can be caused during vehicle accidents. More specifically, any force applied to one push button to release it, without an opposite force being applied to the opposing push button, can not result in the unlatching of the latch  or a release of the latch plate tangs from both release push buttons.","To control the release of the latch , each push button has an opening \u2032, \u2032 along the full width thereof which communicate with the slots , , respectively, in which the arms  and  of the latch are received. As shown in , when the latch is in its locked position, each arm  and  is seated on pairs of outwardly extending catches or shoulders  and  of the push buttons  and  and thus, the latch can not be moved downwardly to its second unlocked or release position. However, each push button includes a beveled wall ,  opposing the catches  and  such that when the push buttons are urged inwardly of the buckle housing, toward their release position, see , the arms of the latch are free of the catches so as to be engageable by the beveled surfaces ,  which thereby urge the latch arms to move the latch to its second release position against the influence of the spring . In the second position of the latch, the latch plate may be easily withdrawn from the buckle housing as the tangs and latch dog are simultaneously release from the push buttons and latch plate, respectively.","Although not specifically shown in the drawing figures, it is possible that a separate spring element may be utilized in association with the latch plate frame of the present invention in order to provide a discharge force for further facilitating the removal of the latch plate from the buckle housing. Examples of such ejection mechanisms are described in applicant's prior U.S. Pat. No. 6,539,595 issued Apr. 1, 2003, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","From the foregoing description, it should be noted that each push button  and  supports a separate one of the arms  and  of the latch. Therefore, both push buttons must be moved to their release positions to release each of the arms  and  in order that the latch can be moved to its second or release position by a force of engagement of the beveled walls or surfaces ,  associated with the push buttons. The premature movement of either push button alone, as shown in , will only cause the catches ,  of the associated push button to release, one of the latch arms but will not release the opposing arm of the latch which is retained locked by the catches of the opposing push button. In , push button  is engaged with an object \u201cJ\u201d which applies a force to urge the push button to its release position wherein latch arm  is released from catches . However, the spring  applies an increased force against push button  to maintain latch arm  locked within the catch . Therefore, both push buttons must be moved inwardly of the buckle housing, simultaneously, as shown in  in order to cause a release of the latch plate.","To further guide the push buttons  and  of the present embodiment in their sliding movement between their outer locked position and their inner release positions, a guide block  is secured to the buckle frame . The block includes a depending flange  which extends over a top portion of each push button as shown in ,  and .","With particular reference to , a second embodiment of the invention is disclosed in greater detail. In this embodiment, the non-inertia release restraint buckle assembly  is shown as including a latch plate  which is connected to a conventional seat belt, lap belt or restraint harness  in a manner similar to that disclosed with respect to the first embodiment. Likewise, the buckle assembly includes an outer frame member  having an opening  therein for receiving an anchoring strap  which is connected to a bracket or otherwise secured to the frame of a vehicle.","In this embodiment, the latch plate  includes an opening  for cooperating with a pair of latches  and  which are movably mounted at  and  within a buckle housing . Each of the latches  and  includes at least one and preferably two spaced outwardly extending latch dogs  and , respectively. As shown in the drawing figures, the pairs of latch dogs are structured to fit in an interdigitated manner within the opening  in the latch plate when the latch plate is fully seated within the housing . In this manner, both latches  and  must be moved from their first locking position, as shown in , to a second release position, as shown in , in order to permit the insertion or removal of the latch plate  from the buckle housing . To ensure that each of the latches  and  is normally urged to its first locked position, each is resiliently urged by a leaf or other resilient or spring element  and , respectively, toward the locked position.","As with the previous embodiment, the housing has an opening  at one end thereof which communicates with a channel  defined between the latches  and  in which the latch plate  is slidingly receivable when inserted within the housing . As the latch plate  is inserted within the housing, the leading edge  thereof will engage cam like surfaces on the back of each latch dog thus pushing the latches  and  outwardly away from the channel  and permitting the latch plate to be fully inserted until such time as the latch dogs snap into engagement within the opening  in the latch plate to thereby lock the latch plate in position within the housing .","The present embodiment of the invention operates under the same laws of Newtonian Physics as the first embodiment in that, in order to release the latch plate  from the buckle housing , force must be applied to two opposing release or push buttons  and  which are mounted to extend outwardly through two spaced recessed openings  and  in opposite sidewalls  and  of the buckle housing .","As opposed to using a single resilient or spring element between the push buttons as disclosed with respect to the previous embodiment, in the present embodiment, a pair of spaced springs  and  are mounted within the housing so as to be supported within seats  and  of the push buttons  and , respectively. The opposite ends of the springs  and  are seated within seats  and  which are provided within generally u-shaped catches  and  of each of the opposite push buttons  and , respectively.","With specific reference to , push button  has an extension portion  which integrally connects the push button to its inner u-shaped catch . The unshaped catch engages a spaced or remote edge of the latch  to thereby retain the latch in its first or locked position. The latch  further includes a beveled or cam surface  which opposes a camming surface  of the push button  such that, when the push button  is pushed inwardly towards its second release position, the catch  will release one edge of the latch  and the camming surface  of the push button will move the latch, by engagement with its surface , to its second release position. However, even if the latch  is moved to its release position, the latch  remains engaged with the latch plate unless the push button  is pushed inwardly to its second release position.","Push button  also includes an extension portion  as shown in  which extends to its inner catch . The push button also includes a beveled or camming surface  which is engageable with a beveled surface  associated with the latch , see . In this manner, when the push button  is pushed inwardly of the housing , the catch  will release the latch  allowing the two cam surfaces to urge the latch  to its outer or second release position.","As each of the push buttons  and  are depressed inwardly of the housing, the springs  and  associated therewith will apply an increased force against the opposing push button. Therefore, any force applied to one of the push buttons to push it inwardly of the housing to its second release position will result in an increased force being applied to maintain the opposing push button in its first or outermost locked position. Thus, to release the latch plate, opposite forces must be applied to the opposing push buttons, as shown in , in order to effect a release of the latch plate  from the buckle housing. As soon as the latch plate has been removed from the buckle housing and the push buttons released, the springs  and  will urge the push buttons to their outer or first locked position and the springs  and  will automatically cause the latches  and  to move to their first locking positions.","In the operation of the second embodiment, upon insertion of the latch plate , the latches  and  will be cammed away from one another by the leading edge  of the latch plate engaging the cam surfaces of the lock or latch dogs  and  until such time as the latch dogs snap into the opening  to lock the latch plate within the housing. Thereafter, should any inadvertent force be applied to the buckle, its housing or elements causing an inadvertent depression of one of the push buttons, such inadvertent depression, which may be caused by movement of the belt buckle during an accident, will not effect a release of the latch plate. In , push button  is shown as being accidentally moved to its release position thereby releasing latch  from the catch . However, when moved to this position, the spring , see , will apply an increased force on the opposing push button  thereby ensuring that the opposing push button is maintained in its locked or outer position preventing release of the catch  from latch .","Only upon application of simultaneous forces to the opposing latch buttons  and  in opposing directions, as shown in , can the latch plate  be released from its locked engagement with the latches  and .","With particular reference to ,   and , the buckle housing  is specifically designed and configured to prevent accidental contact with the push buttons  and  which could lead to an inadvertent actuation of the buttons to move them toward their release positions. Each sidewall  and  is recessed inwardly as shown in dotted line in  at  and , respectively, such that the openings  and  for the push buttons are recessed inwardly of the outer portions of the sidewalls. As shown, the outer engageable portions of each push button are thus slightly recessed relative to the outer portions of the sidewalls when in their outermost, first locking position, thereby preventing their accidental depression, as is illustrated in . As shown in , should a sidewall of the buckle housing engage a surface of object \u201cJ\u201d, the release buttons will not be depressed due to their inset position or mounting relative to the outer portions of the sidewalls. the same recessed features are provided for the buckle housing and push buttons of the embodiment of .","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented to illustrate the principles of the invention and not to limit the invention to the particular embodiment illustrated.
