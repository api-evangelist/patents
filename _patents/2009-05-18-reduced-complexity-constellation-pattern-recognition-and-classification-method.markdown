In particular, the invention relates to devices and methods for the modulation of communications signals used for blind demodulation of cognitive radios.","Constellation pattern recognition is an important technique that has been used in digital image processing, digital signal processing, and digital communications. It is a statistical technique for recovering a constellation pattern from noisy data inputs by matching the noisy inputs against known alphabet sets. A two-dimensional image or a communication data symbol can be represented by a complex number, and a set of those complex numbers can form a two-dimensional pattern. These two-dimensional patterns include the binary phase-shift-keying, quadrature phase-shift-keying, and 16-ary quadrature-amplitude-modulation constellation patterns depicted in . The  constellation patterns are plotted using an in-phase coordinator for real numbers and a quadrature coordinator for imaginary numbers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C"]},"Constellation pattern recognition is a statistical method to recover a constellation pattern from noisy data inputs by matching the noisy data inputs to known alphabet sets.

A number of prior art statistical classification techniques have been developed, such as the Average Likelihood Ratio Test, Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test, Hybrid Likelihood Ratio Test, and higher order techniques.","One widely used statistical classifier used in prior art constellation pattern recognition is the Average Likelihood Ratio Test (ALRT).

This method avoids the nested constellation problem in GLRT but it can be complicated due to the multi-dimensional maximization required. Higher-order cyclic stationary and higher-order cumulants were also used for classifying the constellations of the communication signals. However, those methods usually require a large amount of data for the statistical analysis and are very computationally expensive.","While the prior art ALRT system has performed many valuable functions, it is still beset by a number of difficulties and shortcomings related to its multiple exponential and logarithmic calculations. These ALRT calculations are very computation intensive, tedious, and extremely time-consuming. In fact, current ALRT systems are so computation-intensive, tedious, and time-consuming that they are not feasible for real-time recognition operations in the adaptive demodulation of software radio. Currently, the modulation classification is conducted by taking snapshots of the data. Since the content of the data is of interest, the classification processing can be performed in between two snapshots which is usually a large time interval. While in the adaptive demodulation case, the classification is performed to the signal, one block after another. The classification processing of the current block has to be done promptly in a very short time interval before the next block comes. Thus, there has been a long-felt need for faster modulation classification processing to satisfy the quality of service in real-time software radio communication applications that has not been met by prior art constellation pattern recognition systems.","Up until now, the long-felt needs for simplified and more rapid constellation pattern recognition systems have not been met.","In order to answer the long-felt need for a more rapid and simplified constellation pattern recognition device that provides a real-time modulation classification, this invention provides a simplified, highly accurate, and real-time constellation pattern recognition and classification device that does not suffer from the limitations, shortcomings, and difficulties of prior art constellation pattern recognition devices.","The reduced complexity constellation pattern recognition and classification device comprises a group of test functions and a means for classifying a pattern that provides a simplified, highly accurate, and real-time constellation pattern recognition and classification device that does not suffer from the limitations, shortcomings, and difficulties of the ALRT-based prior art constellation pattern recognition devices.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a highly accurate and real-time reduced complexity constellation pattern recognition and classification system with a group of test functions, a means for estimating, a means for selecting the optimal test function, and a means for classifying a pattern.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method for highly accurate and real-time reduced complexity constellation pattern recognition and classification for a software-defined communications system with estimating, selecting, and classifying steps.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a simplified, highly accurate, and real-time constellation pattern recognition and classification article of manufacture with a storage medium encoded with machine-readable computer program code for a software-defined communications system with a means for estimating, a means for selecting the optimal test function, and a means for classifying a pattern.","These and other objects and advantages can now be attained by this invention's reduced complexity constellation pattern recognition and classification device for software radios comprising an r(k) input, a group of test functions, a means for estimating, a means for calculating, a means for selecting the optimal test function, a means for signal processing, and a means for classifying a pattern that answers the long-felt need for decreasing the numerous constellation pattern calculations and intensive computational requirements and providing a real-time rapid response unmet by prior art constellation pattern recognition systems.","Before providing a more detailed description of this invention's reduced complexity constellation pattern recognition and classification system for software-defined radios, it is necessary to better understand the constellation pattern recognition process and the test function of the ihypothesis. Referring now to , which is a processing flow chart depicting the calculation of the test function l(H|r(k)) of the noisy input data r(k) by using the ihypothesis H.

The invention makes the process much simpler since it eliminates all exponential and logarithmic calculations. It also reduces additions and multiplications. Comparing the prior art in Equations 1 and 2 with the new method in Equation 8, the calculation in Equation 2 for calculating the test function of one hypothesis requires approximately 4MK additions\/subtractions, (3M+1)K multiplications\/divisions, and (M+1)K exponential\/logarithmic operations. The calculation in Equation 8 only requires approximately (3M+1)K additions\/subtractions, 2MK multiplications\/divisions, and K minimization operations. The new method operates much faster because it has a simpler structure and is more suitable for parallel processing design.","Referring now to , there is depicted the steps of the method for highly accurate and real-time reduced complexity constellation pattern recognition and classification for a software-defined communications system, comprising the steps of providing an r(k) noisy input having an unknown constellation pattern, which is represented by Block ; estimating a function \u03c3with a digital signal processor, Block , the digital signal processor having a stored look-up table, a means for selecting test functions, and a means for classifying a pattern; computing a function CNwith a means for calculating using a group of add and multiply components, which is represented by Block ; calculating a function r. {circumflex over (\u03b2)}with the calculating means using a dot product component; estimating a function {circumflex over (\u03b2)}with a means for estimating using the lookup table, Block ; and computing a function {circumflex over (\u03b2)}. {circumflex over (\u03b2)}with the calculating means using the dot product component, which is represented by Block . This invention's method continues with the steps of comparing the functions with the calculating means and the estimating means, which is represented by Block ; determining a group of parallel likelihood test functions for an ihypothesis Hwith the calculating means, Block ; performing a likelihood function computation with the test function selection means to select an optimal likelihood test function from the group of parallel test functions, which is represented by Block ; rapidly detecting the optimal likelihood test function and the ihypothesis Hwith the pattern classification means to rapidly detect the unknown constellation pattern with a reduced level of computational complexity, Block ; determining a modulation scheme and an optimal constellation pattern to best fit the noisy input, Block ; and providing an enhanced level of performance for the software-defined communications system, which is represented by Block .
