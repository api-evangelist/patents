{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to engineered or industrial process plants such as solar thermal energy power generating plants in some embodiments, and more particularly to a computer-based system and method for tracking data file usage while performing simulations of such plants.","Computerized modeling and simulation is useful to predict the costs and performance associated with building and\/or operating existing or planned engineered or industrial process plants of many different types. Not surprisingly, such simulations involve the use of extensive amounts of data in the form of electronic data files used by the computer processor(s) to run the simulations. These files contain plant physical equipment and system configuration information, operating parameters, capita, operating, and maintenance cost data, and performance attributes. In addition, such simulations also may generate a number of simulation results files allowing further analysis to optimize equipment configurations and operations. One exemplary type of an engineered or industrial process plant that is amenable to computer modeling is a solar thermal energy power generation plant.","Solar thermal energy systems represent a technology for capturing renewable radiant energy from the sun and converting that energy into thermal energy that can be used to generate electricity. Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one technology that offers electric utility scale power production. CSP systems include collectors such as mirrors or reflectors (sometimes referred to as heliostats or concentrators) that are arrayed in a solar collector field (\u201csolar field\u201d or \u201cSF\u201d) which capture and in turn concentrate sunlight onto a thermal receiver. The thermal receiver contains a heat transfer fluid such as oil or molten salt (typically a mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate) that is heated to a temperature sufficient to produce steam via a combination of conventional fluid-to-steam heat exchangers. The steam is used to drive a conventional steam turbine-generator set (\u201cpower block\u201d or \u201cPB\u201d) which produces electricity that may be sold to a power grid operated by a an electric power distribution company or utility for delivery to its customers over a conventional power transmission network. Some present CSP system designs include parabolic trough systems, parabolic dish systems, and power tower systems that employ a plurality of reflectors which focus the solar energy onto a thermal receiver positioned atop a centrally-located tower.","Thermal energy storage (TES) is an integral part of CSP systems for capturing and storing as much solar thermal energy as possible when available to compensate for periods of time when sunlight is not available due to either weather conditions or time of day. TES basically employs an insulated hot storage tank and a pumping and piping system with suitable flow control valves which may temporarily store the heated heat transfer fluid or medium until needed to produce steam for generating electricity via the power block. In some systems, a combination of oil and molten salt may be used as the heat transfer fluids coupled with a combination of oil-to-salt and\/or oil or salt-to-steam heat exchangers. In other systems, a single heat transfer fluid may be used. The heat exchangers are not 100% efficient; therefore, there will be thermal energy losses incurred when heat is exchanged. Typical heat exchanger efficiency without limitation is about 92% as an illustration. Accordingly, the net amount of thermal energy that may be either stored in TES or transferred to the power block will be less than the thermal energy produced by solar collector field.","Two types of TES systems are generally employed\u2014direct storage and indirect storage TES. In direct TES, as shown in , a serial pumping and piping arrangement are used in the CSP system  between the solar collector field , thermal energy storage  which may comprise one or more conventional insulated storage tanks, and power block . Both the solar collector field  and thermal energy storage  may have one or more associated pumps that cause the heat transfer fluid or medium to flow in the desired direction through flow conduits A-B (and C shown in  discussed below). Whenever the solar collector field  generates thermal energy, it is sent to the TES. If the TES is full, the energy is dumped or wasted. When there is a demand to produce electric power, thermal energy is drawn from the TES storage tank to produce steam and drive the turbine-generator set of the power block. The embodiment shown employing dual heat transfer fluids requires both an oil-to-salt heat exchangers  and a salt-to-steam heat exchanger .","For indirect TES, as shown in , parallel pumping and piping arrangements are used in the CSP system  between the solar collector field , thermal storage , and power block . Therefore, thermal energy may be routed whenever generated by solar collector field directly to the power block  (an via oil-to-steam heat exchanger ) and\/or to the TES (via oil-to-salt heat exchanger ) depending on whether there is a demand to produce electric power and\/or the amount of thermal energy needed to produce sufficient steam to drive the turbine-generator set of the power block. The power block may draw thermal energy from both TES (via salt-to-steam heat exchanger ) and directly from the solar collector field if needed.","Both direct and indirect TES have advantages and disadvantages. The overall efficiency of indirect TES is higher than direct storage (generally about 8% more in some instances) because two heat exchanges are not always involved in the thermal energy flow between the solar collector field and power block as shown in . The efficiency of direct TES is therefore inherently lower because two heat exchangers are always used in the system as shown in . However, direct TES has a simpler control system and is generally easier to optimize and schedule its operation. Optimization is more difficult with indirect TES because of its flexible operation since scheduling when to dispatch of thermal energy from the heated TES tank to the power block depends on the hours selected for electricity generation. In direct TES, by contrast, thermal energy must always pass through and be drawn from the heated storage tank whenever there is a demand to produce steam for generating electricity. Accordingly, indirect TES requires a more complex control system than direct TES.","Modeling and simulation of the foregoing solar power generating plants and their operation using a computer-based simulator system allows plant components and performance to be predicted and optimized through iterative simulation runs. To model and simulate the many design and operational aspects and parameter of a solar power plant (e.g. weather predictions, solar thermal energy availability, electric production, energy conversion efficiencies, operating and maintenance costs, expected revenues, etc.), however, is complex and typically requires a relatively large number of different stand alone computer or software programs often furnished by different vendors\/sources. These computer programs each uses their own custom data or information files which must be opened and run using their own respective type of often proprietary computer software or application. In addition, each time a simulation is run with varying conditions which generally involves numerous iterative calculations, a large number of output or results files are also generated which must be later retrieved and reviewed by the user. The size of individual files involved in a simulation run can be very large as well. For example, solar availability modeling files may be 10 MB each or larger in size.","During each simulation listed earlier a large number of files are therefore accessed by the user and simulator system or created. The files are stored in many different directories (e.g. depending on the project, user, type of model being run, etc.) and may readily go into the tens of files in some cases. Each time, the user has to navigate several directories and open the files with the specified program. This specified program or software required to view these files can be different from the one that is associated by the operating system. To see the actual data in the file (which is tab delimited), the user uses gVim. Just to browse the data, the user may use notepad. To see a particular column or to plot the data in the file, the user may use Excel. And for examining the data, the user may use gVim, notepad, Excel, or other software program based on the type of examination needed.","When running the foregoing computer-based simulations, therefore, the user must therefore know and remember which data files are needed, where they are located in the computer-based simulator system in terms of drive and retrieval path (i.e. path\/directory\/subdirectories), and which particular computer program(s)\/software is required to open, run, and view the files. Each time, the user has to navigate through several layers of directories\/sub-directories and open the files with the required specified program\/software (typically by \u201cright clicking\u201d and selecting a program from a list). Accordingly, this is a cumbersome, inefficient, and time consuming process even for an expert software user. If the simulation is run on a cluster\/grid\/network of computers (which is very common while running high fidelity simulations) the problem gets worse because the locations and paths leading to the files becomes even more convoluted.","An improved computer-based simulator system and method is therefore desired.","A system and computer-implemented method are provided for optimizing the modeling of an engineered or industrial process plant. In one embodiment, the process plant may be a CSP generating plant. The system generally includes a computer system including a main or central hub computer processor, computer readable medium, and program instructions or control logic stored on the computer readable medium operable to direct the operation of the processor. In one, the computer processor implementing the control logic is operable to track and display to a user via conventional graphic\/video display devices the names, type\/category, location (path and destination), and an associated software program of the computer files that are accessed and\/or generated during a CSP plant simulation run. Advantageously, the system displays a list of these files available for viewing by the user and preferably offers the option to the user of retrieving and examining one or more of the displayed files. The system automatically tracks and remembers the software program or application associated with each data file needed to open and display the contents of the file so that the user need not remember this information. This capability is advantageous because the program needed to merely open display the data file contents to the user may differ from the program associated with the file type by the operating system.","Some additional benefits of the computer-based system and computer-implemented method according to embodiments of the present invention are that it: reduces the number of mouse clicks for a user; the user need not know where the files are stored; the user need not manually navigate to the home directories of individual files to open and view them; the user need not manually open the files; the user need not know the name of the program used to open and view the file, and user productivity is improved greatly because the system is fast and requires less manual operations than heretofore.","According to one embodiment, a system for tracking and displaying computer files used in computer simulations of an engineered or industrial process plant includes a computer processor and computer readable medium accessible to the processor, and control logic stored on the computer readable medium and executed by the processor. The computer processor, when executing the control logic, being operative to run a simulation of the process plant, compile a list of simulation-related files used or created during the simulation, and display the list preferably on a display device. In some embodiments, the processor is further operative to store a full path name of each simulation-related file on the list in a tracking-review file created by the processor and stored on the computer readable medium. The full path name of each simulation-related file preferably is added to the tracking-review file in real time as the simulation is run by the processor for retrieving each simulation-related file. In additional embodiments, the processor is further operative to automatically associate each simulation-related file with a software program or application which is required to open and display the contents of each simulation-related file. In other embodiments, the processor is further operative to receive a selection request by a user to view at least one of the displayed simulation-related files, retrieve each requested file using the full path name of each requested file, and automatically open and display the contents of each requested file on a graphic display device to the user using the software program associated with each requested file.","A method is provided that is performed by a computer processor executing program instructions for tracking and displaying computer files used in running computer simulations of an engineered or industrial process plant. In one embodiment, the computer-implemented method includes the steps of: running a computer simulation of the process plant on a computer system including a computer processor and computer readable medium operably accessible to the processor and containing program instructions executed by the processor; the processor creating in real time during the simulation a tracking-review file including the full path names of simulation-related files used or created during the simulation; and the processor displaying a list of simulation-related files in the tracking-review file to a user on a graphic display device. In some embodiments, the method further includes the processor receiving a selection request by the user to display one or more of the simulation-related files, retrieving the selected file or files, and displaying the contents of the selected file or files preferably on a display device. The method may further include the processor automatically associating each simulation-related file with a respective software program which is required to open and display the contents of each simulation-related file. The method further includes the processor advantageously automatically opening and displaying the contents of the user-selected file or files with the software program without the user specifying which program to use.","All drawings shown herein are schematic and should be interpreted accordingly.","In the description of embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, any reference to direction or orientation is merely intended for convenience of description and is not intended in any way to limit the scope of the present invention. Moreover, the features and benefits of the invention are illustrated by reference to preferred embodiments. Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be limited to such preferred embodiments illustrating some possible but non-limiting combination of features that may be provided alone or in other combinations of features; the scope of the invention being defined by the claims appended hereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","20","21","21","22","21","82"]},"In some embodiments, the computer software or program stored in and implemented by simulator system  for conducting the CSP modeling or simulations may be referred to for convenience by the non-limiting arbitrary name of \u201cRESTORM\u201d (renewable solar thermal objective resource modeling manager) in the description provided herein and accompanying figures.

In a preferred embodiment, Display Manager software object is implemented and runs on central computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","20","100","21","100","21","20","21","100","20"]},"Referring now to , Display Manager control logic routine  begins in step  wherein a user makes a decision and inputs a selection into central computer  to signal whether a new simulation will be run or whether the user wants to review files associated with a previously run simulation. If the computer receives an input signal to review a the results of a prior simulation, the user inputs the review file name from the previous simulation when prompted by central computer , which then executes step  in which the designated review file is retrieved from one of the databases associated with data storage devices , , or . Control passes then to step  further described herein below in which a list of all files associated with the requested prior simulation review file are displayed to the user by central computer  via display device  or .","If alternatively in step  the central computer  receives a signal that a new simulation has been selected by the user to be run, control passes to step . In step , a test is performed by computer  to determine whether data files required for the new simulation run are ready and available. In some embodiments, the data files may be stored in databases  and\/or  (see ).","The types or categories of files used and generated by simulator system  to conduct plant simulations may include without limitation files classified as input or details files, data files, and output or results files. These and other files used in running the computer simulation may be referred to herein as \u201csimulation-related files\u201d for convenience. Input or details files are design details\/configuration files related to the CSP physical plant equipment\/system being modeled including operating parameters, efficiencies, power consumption, flow rates, etc. of heat exchangers, power block, pumps, solar collectors, etc. Input files may further include time of use (TOU) for mapping expected power demand and CSP plant generating times, time of day (TOD), and other anticipated or actual operating characteristics, etc. These input files are opened and examined during the initial simulation runs by central computer . The data files are generally very large files (e.g. 10-20 MB are not uncommon), which are opened and examined only a very few number of times during the initial simulation runs. Typical data files include detailed information or data related to solar thermal energy available from the solar field, annual weather data, etc. The output or results files contain the results of the plant simulations generated by simulator system  which are of immediate interest to the user. The user opens, examines and\/or copies the results every time during the simulations in many instances.","Returning now to , if a \u201cYes\u201d decision is returned in step , control passes to step . If a \u201cNo\u201d is returned in step , the user needs to get or generate\/prepare the required data files in step . In step , a test is performed by central computer  to determine whether design details\/input files are available and ready. If a \u201cYes\u201d result is returned, control passes to step . If a \u201cNo\u201d result is returned, the user needs to get or generate\/prepare the details\/input files in step .","With continuing reference to , the CSP plant simulation is run in step , which is represented in more detail by control logic routine  shown in  which is stored on any computer readable medium accessible to simulation system . According to one aspect of the present invention, control logic routine  in particular includes the steps executed by central computer  that allows computer  to monitor, track, and remembers all of the files that are accessed and\/or created during the plant simulation for later retrieval and display by the user, as further described herein. In a preferred embodiment, logic routine  is executed by central computer .","Referring now to , control logic routine  preferably includes the following sequential steps. Step  starts the plant simulation and step  initializes the Display Manager in which central computer  clears the details of all previous simulation runs if any, and initializes the file counters (i.e. number of files) for all categories of files (data files, input\/details files and results files) to \u201c0\u201d. Step  opens the input\/design details files to be used in the simulation. In step , central computer  identifies, collects, and stores\/adds to the Display Manager software object tracking-review file information about each of these input\/details files with sufficient detail to permit subsequent retrieval and display of those files later in logic process  () by a user. In a preferred embodiment, this file information (also referred to herein as file \u201ctracking and display attributes\u201d) includes without limitation the full path name of each file (including the cluster\/network node name), type of the file, and the name or other identifier of what particular software program or application was used to read\/create during the simulation. Display Manager therefore advantageously creates an association between each input\/details file and its respective display software program\/application in which central computer  records and stores (i.e. \u201cremembers\u201d) the identity of what program is used to read\/write the contents of each file respectively during and simultaneously with running the simulation so that the user advantageously need not remember and select the required program manually. The Display Manager thus gradually and efficiently builds or compiles a list of all the input\/details files used in the simulation in real time, as well as making a dynamic software program association with each of those files, that includes all of the file tracking and display attributes noted above. It will be appreciated that this is different from the static association of file types in which each and every time a file is associated with one type of file extension and opened with that same software program\/application in system wide usage. In some instances, however, the software program used by central computer  to open a file may change from one process plant simulation to the next. Beneficially, the Display Manager uses dynamic file association wherein the software program association is created each time during the simulation. For example, if an .xml file is opened during the simulation with RapidSim, the Display Manager software object remembers and opens the file with RapidSim. In a subsequent simulation, a different program other than RapidSim may be used to read\/write the .xml file which is then remembered by Display Manager. Accordingly, Display Manager generates and uses its dynamic association that functions to allow central computer  to retrieve files based on user selection, and then open, read, and display the selected file contents to the user using the same previously associated software program used in the respective simulation run.","Another advantage of the present invention is location transparency. The user need not know where the files are available and located in system  (i.e. database, grid, network, path, etc.) in order to retrieve and display the files. Display Manager software object automatically records and stores the information necessary to retrieve the files simultaneously with running the plant simulation.","In some embodiments, the foregoing file tracking and display attributes are preferably recorded and stored in a unique Display Manager tracking-review file created for and during each simulation run. The tracking-review file may be stored on any computer readable medium operably accessible to computer  anywhere in system  such as data storage devices , , or . Each Display Manager tracking-review file may be automatically assigned a unique file name by central computer  (see, e.g. \u201cTest case-3\u201d shown in ). The contents of the tracking-review file include a list of all the simulation-related files touched or created during the simulation.","Returning now to  and logic routine , when running complicated simulations, the top level details\/input files and data files may each contain the names of other sub-level details or data files, which in turn can contain other even lower level details or data files. For example, the top level design details file may contain the name of lower level details file containing information for TOU. In step , central computer  opens the other lower level details files listed in the top level details files, which are also added to the Display Manager in step .","Step  opens the data files, which are then also added to the Display Manager in step  similarly to the details or input files handled in Steps  and  as described above. Step  may be following by steps similar to steps  and  (not shown) to open and add other lower level data files to Display Manager.","With continuing reference to  and control logic routine , the CSP system simulation is run in step  using the design details and data files opened in preceding steps , , and  described above. The results of the modeling or simulation are then stored in corresponding results files in step  which are added to the Display Manager tracking-review file similarly to the details and data files in the preceding step, thereby completing compilation of the list of all simulation-related files used or created during the process plant simulation. In step , the simulator system  automatically assigns or generates a suggested name for the Display Manager tracking-review file containing all the file tracking and display attributes. The simulator system  may display the auto-generated Display Manager tracking-review file name suggestion to the user in step  (e.g.: \u201csimulation-of-csp-date-month-year-time.txt:), then optionally may offer the user a choice in step  of either using the automatically generated tracking-review file name for the results file or option to supply a different name which is type and input (e.g. \u201ccsp-sim-date-month-year.dat\u201d). In step , the simulator system receives a response input the user to the tracking-review file naming choice.","In step , the system  creates and stores the Display Manager tracking-review file on computer readable medium accessible to the system such as in databases  or , or in local memory.","Returning now to  and control logic routine , after the CSP simulation in step  and routine  (shown in  and described above) are run, control passes to step . In step , the Display Manager via simulator system  displays a list of all of the results, input or details, and other miscellaneous files that may have been accessed, used, and\/or generated during the simulation run to the user on a display device. In some embodiments, depending on wherein the user is interacting with the simulator system , the files available for viewing may be displayed on display device , display devices  associated with networked computer , or other display device operably linked to system  depending on the access point to the system by the user. (see ). Step  therefore displays the contents of the Display Manager tracking-review file created and stored in step  shown in . An exemplary embodiment of the information that may be displayed on display devices  or  to the user in step  is shown in . As can be seen, simulator system  in conjunction with Display Manager control logic routine  automatically compiles and categorizes the files used and\/or generated in the CSP simulation into several types or categories and selection choices such as without limitation Results files, Input (or details) files, and Other (i.e. data and other miscellaneous) files. As further seen, system  is operative to display a list of Display Options to the user (step  in ) offering the user a choice of which, if any types or categories of files, are desired to be viewed. In one possible embodiment, as shown in , the display options or choices displayed and offered to the user may include without limitation (0) None, (1) Results only, (2) Results and Input (Details), or (3) All including data files.","With continuing reference to , the user selects a display option which is input and received by the simulator system  in step  via any suitable conventional computer input device  (). In step , a decision step, if the user has selected the (0) None option to files to be displayed, control passes to step  in which system  saves the contents of the Display Manager tracking-review file (previously created and named in logic process ,  as described above) for later retrieval and review by the user or other users.","With continuing reference to , if the user does not select display option (0) None in step , control passes to either step , or step , or step  in which system  executes control logic decisions to determine which type of files to retrieve and display to the user based on the user's selection. As shown, without requiring further explanation, if a \u201cYes\u201d is returned in either steps , , or , control logic routine  is executed as shown in  in which the selected files are retrieved and displayed. In a preferred embodiment, logic routine  is executed by central computer .","With reference now to  and control logic routine , step  is executed by system  in which the system determines which type of files have been selected by the user for display from choices (1) to (3) as described above in control logic routine  (steps -). Based on the type of file selected for display, step  is executed in which the total number of files to be retrieved by central computer  from step  is counted which initiates a file retrieval\/display counter. This counter is also used to loop through all the files that need to be retrieved and displayed to ensure all required files have been accounted for. With continuing reference to , the initial file number is set to zero (\u201c0\u201d). In step , the first file to be retrieved is incremented (initially to \u201c1\u201d). Step  is then executed in which the first file is automatically retrieved from its stored location on computer readable medium, such as without limitation databases , , or . The Display Manager control logic  has previously already stored the file full path name (see ) allowing the system  to automatically retrieve the file without further manual input from the user. The simulator system , and in particular central computer , next displays the first file contents to the user on display device  or  automatically using the proper software program or application required by the first file to display its content to the user. The required software program or application needed has previously been stored and associated with each simulation-related file type by the system . Advantageously, the user need not know or specify the required software program to open and view\/display the file contents as in the past. In step , therefore, central computer  automatically invokes the required associated software program to open and display the simulation-related file contents.","With continuing reference to , control next passes to a decision step  which determines whether all of the files selected for display by the user have been retrieved and displayed in the preceding steps. If a \u201cNo\u201d is returned, control returns to step  and steps  and  are repeated in a control loop until all selected files have been retrieved and displayed by system  to the user on display device  or .
