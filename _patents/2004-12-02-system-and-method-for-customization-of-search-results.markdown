System Overview","II. Exemplary Operating Environment","III. System and Method of the Invention"],"p":["None.","None.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to customization of search result descriptions. In particular, embodiments relate to user or developer control of displayed information upon execution of a computerized search over a network.","Through the Internet and other networks, users have gained access to large amounts of information distributed over a large number of computers. Various techniques are available for facilitating user access to desired information. Known techniques typically include user implementation of a search engine in order to locate desired information.","Currently, when implementing a search engine, a user enters one or more keywords and receives a set of results. Each result includes a description that has a predetermined set of components. Typically, the description includes a portion of a document title, a portion of a document body, and a relevant universal resource locator (URL) for each web page result returned. In a few specific instances, such as a web shopping search, a hard coded set of fields is returned. Such fields may include price or model number fields.","Search techniques are used for many different activities by end users and increasingly by developers. However, the results that are returned are wholly under the control of the search engine as predetermined by hard coded rules and cannot be controlled by the user or developer. While the uses of a search engine vary, the interface is locked.","No search system currently exists for allowing a user to control aspects of returned search results, including which portion of the body the description is pulled from, the length of the description, or what other attributes of the document or structured data within the document may be returned as a portion of the result. Furthermore, no currently known search system enables users or developers to specify elements of the user interface that display the description. Furthermore, after receiving search results, developers are unable to programmatically render search results in a desired format.","Accordingly, a system and method are needed for allowing customization of web search result descriptions by consumers including users and developers. A solution can be created by leveraging existing technologies such as XML, HTML, metatags, and indexing. By creating such a solution, a search platform can be created that is capable of expansion and modification. Such a system would improve the search experience for consumers of search results including users and developers.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method for customizing search result descriptions returned by a search engine. The search result descriptions are obtained through a search over a computer network. The method includes implementing a search result description request component to select at least one component of each search result description for return by a search engine. The method additionally includes sending a search result description request to the search engine encoded in a search query and processing the search query by implementing a search result description generator and returning the requested search result descriptions.","In an additional aspect, a system is provided for customizing search result descriptions for results returned by a search engine. The search result descriptions are obtained through a search over a computer network. The system includes a search result description request component for enabling selection of particular data for retrieval by the search engine. The system additionally includes a search result description generator for retrieving and returning the requested data and a search result description renderer for displaying search result descriptions in a selected manner.","Embodiments of the invention include a method and system for customizing search result descriptions. The disclosed system and method provide the capability for controlling which portions of document are returned to a user or developer. Similarly to a database system, the disclosed system enables a developer or user to specify which \u201ccolumns\u201d should be returned. Information discernable by a search engine that requests such information as a title, a URL, a document size, a predetermined document portion, a domain where the document is hosted, or a date of the document may be encoded in a query forwarded to the search engine. Accordingly, a user or developer is able to control display of attributes of the document. In further embodiments, a user may control display of structured data stored within the document, such as Meta-Tags, XML, resource description framework (RDF), fonts, colors, styles, or the order of the fields of the description. Furthermore, the system and method provide the capability for programmatic handling of search results, for instance through an API, rather than through the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","10","50","20","30","20","22","30","32","34","40"]},"In operation, a developer may customize search result descriptions by implementing the customizable search API  of the partner server . A search engine  may traverse a searchable index  and implement a search result description generator  to generate results in accordance with the settings implemented by the customizable search API . In operation, the user submits a query through the user browser . Based on the parameters required by the customizable search API , the search engine server  processes the query and returns results. Details of the customizable search API  and search result description generator  will be further described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , the exemplary system  for implementing the invention includes a general purpose-computing device in the form of a computer  including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit .","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer readable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/nonremovable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to nonremovable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/nonremovable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through an non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  in the present invention will operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Although many other internal components of the computer  are not shown, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such components and the interconnection are well known. Accordingly, additional details concerning the internal construction of the computer  need not be disclosed in connection with the present invention.","As set forth above,  illustrates a customizable search API  in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The customizable search API  may include a search result description renderer , a search result description API , and a search result description request component .","The search result description renderer  may display the search results to end users of the search site operated by the partner server . Although the search result description renderer  is shown as a portion of the customizable search API  on the partner server , the search result description renderer  could also be disposed in alternative locations. The search result description renderer  can be instructed to display descriptions with different fonts, colors, or styles, to order the fields of the description in various ways for display on the UI . For example, the search result description renderer  may change spacing or alignment of descriptions and otherwise modify the results as instructed by the developer.","The search result description API  is a subset of the overall search API that allows a developer to programmatically retrieve and inspect search results. The result description API  allows the developer to view the structured data and attributes as distinct programmatic attributes of each search result.","The search result description request component  enables the user or developer to specify what data should be retrieved in building the search result display for each retrieved document. The search result description request component  may cause information to be encoded within the user query string. The search result description request component  can also be exposed via user interface elements (e.g. advanced search) or programmatically within a search API.","The above-described components operate in conjunction with the search engine server  to request and generate search results. As shown in , the search result description generator  on the search engine server  may include an attribute retrieval component , excerpt retrieval component , a structured data retrieval component , and an anchor text retrieval component .","In currently known systems, a component analogous to the presently disclosed search result description generator  generates the description of a page, including its URL, title, and a snippet of its text. The presently disclosed search result description generator  expands upon this concept by allowing retrieval of selected alternative or additional information. These components of the search result description generator  may be configured to operate in response to requests made through the customized search API  described above.","The attribute retrieval component  enables retrieval of a programmable set of data pulled from attributes of the document, such as its size, date created, date changed, domain that it is hosted on or other trackable attributes.","The structured data retrieval component  allows retrieval of structured data stored within the document. The structured data may include metatags, XML, RDF, or other types of structured data. The structured data retrieval component  may also search for other types of data in html that are not normally visible. For example, an informational web site such as a news site may store various types of documents. The documents may include reference documents, coding examples, general overviews, tips and tricks, and other types of documents. The type of document is generally stored as a metatag. For instance, a \u201cmetatype\u201d may be set equal to \u201cexample\u201d or \u201creference\u201d. Metatags may also be used to indicate product and version. Thus a user request can be formulated to filter out the return of various products.","The excerpt retrieval component  facilitates retrieval of programmable excerpts from the body of the text, such as different lengths, different locations within the body, different numbers of distinct snippets, or snippets centered around specific words. The excerpt retrieval component  may also control links or number of different locations in the body of text that a word or set of words is centered on.","Finally, the anchor text retrieval component  retrieves anchor text of the document, or the text of links pointing to the document, with the same programming options as for the body of text within the document. The anchor text retrieval component  treats the anchor of link pointing to document as part of document and provides the ability pull information from an anchor tag data display.","The partner server  may be operated for any number of purposes. For example, the partner server  may be operated by a newspaper publisher. The newspaper publisher may provide access to a number of articles over the network. A web developer of the newspaper web site may want to have a query UI on the newspaper web site to allow users to issue a query. The user could request a search through UI  by entering keywords. A developer could set the results to return information such as an author or date or other information. The customizable search API  may send a URL to the search engine server  that requests the specified results and further instructs the search engine server  to display the results in a specific format, such as in consecutive columns.","In additional embodiments of the invention, a website may receive pre-determined data from the search engine server  as requested and may be responsible for rendering the received data using the customizable search API . The website may receive the data and select the data to render through the customizable search API  and in what format to render it, for example in structured columns provided by the customizable search API .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","112","114","100","120","100","150","300","300","320","340","400"]},"In the embodiment of , the user computer  implements the customizable search API  to selectively configure search result descriptions. The user may additionally selectively configure search result descriptions using the UI . The user computer  then communicates over the network  with the search engine server  in response to a user query entered through the UI . The search engine server  may then implement the search engine  to traverse the searchable index  and may generate results using the search result description generator . The search result description generator  may generate results in accordance with the user-selected preferences entered through the customizable search API . This embodiment eliminates the middle-tier shown in  and enables a user to select and render results directly from the search engine server . In this embodiment, the UI  may include components for simplifying a user's request for specific content and the rendering of that content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["600","300","602","604","300","22","606","20","30"]},"In step , the search engine  receives the request and processes the request by traversing the searchable index  and implementing the search result description generator  to generate results. The processing of the request in step  includes implementing the search engine  and the search result description generator . The search engine  may, for example, discern from a received query that a metatag has been requested. When the search result description generator  generates a description, it may open a cached copy of each relevant document and search for the metatag within each document identified in order to generate the description. Such a step would be performed by the structured data retrieval component . The other components of the search result description generator  will operate as needed in accordance with the descriptions provided above.","In step , the partner server  receives the generated results. In step , the partner server  implements the search result description renderer  to render search results for the user computer . The partner server  may also implement the search result description API  in order to further define rendering of retrieved results.","While particular embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described in detail herein, it should be understood that various changes and modifications might be made to the invention without departing from the scope and intent of the invention. The embodiments described herein are intended in all respects to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Alternate embodiments will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains without departing from its scope.","From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all the ends and objects set forth above, together with other advantages, which are obvious and inherent to the system and method. It will be understood that certain features and sub-combinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and sub-combinations.
