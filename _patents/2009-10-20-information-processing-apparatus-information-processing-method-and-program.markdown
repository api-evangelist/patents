abstract: Whether or not a default device exists among devices associated with a device management application is determined. When it is determined that the default device exists among the devices associated with the device management application, a friendly name of the default device is displayed in a device name display part of the device management application. When it is determined that no default device exists among the devices associated with the device management application, a device name of any one of the devices associated with the device management is displayed in the device name display part of the device management application.

Examples of a peripheral device include a printer, a facsimile machine, a scanner, a digital camera, a device having a multiple function of a printer, a facsimile machine, a scanner, and a digital camera, and so forth.","A device management application that manages peripheral devices exists as an example of a peripheral-device control system. By utilizing the device management application, a setting of a device or device driver can be changed, and an operation state of a device can be monitored.","Furthermore, when a printer is provided as an example of a peripheral device, an application that can print an image or document can be activated from the device management application. Additionally, when a scanner is provided as an example of a peripheral device, an application that can read an image or document can also be activated from the device management application.","As the Internet becomes widespread, an information processing apparatus and peripheral devices are connected to the Internet, and various types of online services utilizing the Internet are also provided. For example, a user can obtain, using the device management application, a link to an online service that is associated with a device.","Here, a multifunction printer in which a printer, a facsimile (FAX) machine, a scanner, and a storage device are mounted (hereinafter, referred to as an \u201cMFP\u201d in some cases) is provided as an example of a peripheral device. Both a driver that controls a printer function and a driver that controls a FAX function are printer class drivers, and are installed in an information processing apparatus as different drivers. As a result, a printer icon representing the printer (the driver for the printer function) and a FAX icon representing the FAX (the driver for the FAX function) are displayed as icons having different names on a printer queue. Accordingly, a device management application for the MFP needs to appropriately manage the two drivers. However, control of determining which priority is to be assigned to which driver or the like is not appropriately performed, and priorities of the drivers are simply determined in accordance with an order of installation of the drivers or the like. Moreover, a device name that is to be displayed in a device name display part of the device management application is not appropriately determined. Thus, a device name that is to be displayed in the device name display part is simply determined in accordance with an order of installation of the drivers or the like, and the device name is displayed.","As an example of the related art, a technique such as a technique disclosed in PTL exists.","PTL 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-084942","The present invention aims to focus on the following problems in a case in which a plurality of device drivers are associated to one peripheral device, and to solve the problems.","(1) A problem that a device name which is to be displayed in a device name display part of a device management application is not appropriate.","(2) A problem that a driver which is associated with each function that is to be performed using a device management application is not appropriate.","Here, in the above-described example of the MFP, an example is considered, in which a user mainly uses the printer function. In an environment in which the user uses the MFP, it is desirable that an appropriate name indicating the printer function or a printer (driver) name be displayed in the device name display part of the device management application. For example, when the user customizes a printer icon name (friendly name) so that the friendly name of the printer icon is changed to a friendly name such as \u201cKoichi's Printer\u201d, it is desirable that the friendly name be displayed in the device name display part of the device management application. For example, the user does not customize the printer icon name, it is desirable that a model name of the MFP or the like be displayed in the device name display part. Furthermore, each of the functions of the MFP is classified as the main function or a sub-function, it is desirable that a driver name or friendly name which indicates the main function be displayed in the device name display part.","Similar issues are considered for a function of chaining a setting of a device driver on the device management application or a function of monitoring an operation state of a device. For example, when an operation of opening a printer queue on the device management application is performed, in a case in which a plurality of printer queues that are associated with the device management application exist, it is desirable that a printer queue for a device which is set as a default device be preferentially opened. Additionally, similarly, also for setting (print setting) of a device driver, it is desirable that a print setting dialog for a driver which is set as a default device (printer) be preferentially displayed.","The present invention focuses on the problems of the above-described example of the related art, and proposes a system which provides a device management application that provides an appropriate display or function in accordance with an environment in which a user uses the system, which automatically fits to an environment in which the user uses the system, and which has an excellent operability.","An information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the following elements: a determination unit configured to determine whether or not a default device exists among devices that are associated with a device management application; and a display unit configured to display, when it is determined by the determination unit that the default device exists among the devices which are associated with the device management application, a friendly name of the default device in a device name display part of the device management application, and configured to display, when it is determined by the determination unit that no default device exists among the devices which are associated with the device management application, a friendly name of any one of the devices that are associated with the device management application in the device name display part of the device management application.","First Embodiment","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.","From information concerning Windows (registered trademark) Vista OS that is cited below, information to which no detail description is particularly added is disclosed at Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) site as of Sep. 29, 2008.
