title: System and method for aircraft infrared countermeasures to missiles
abstract: Apparatus and method for directing a laser beam at an object. Some embodiments include generating direction-control information, based on the direction-control information, directing laser energy into a first fiber at a first end of a first fiber bundle during a first time period, forming an output beam of the laser energy from the second end of the first fiber bundle, and steering the output beam of the laser energy from the first fiber in a first selected direction of a plurality of directions during the first time period, and optionally modulating an intensity of the laser energy according to a predetermined pattern. The direction-control information is based on sensing electromagnetic radiation from a scene. Some embodiments use a remote camera wire-connected to the image processor to obtain scene information, while other embodiments use a second fiber bundle to convey image information from an external remote lens to a local camera.

The government has certain rights in this invention","The present invention relates to laser-beam pointer devices, and more particularly to apparatus and method for infrared countermeasures (IRCM) to missiles launched against vehicles such as airborne helicopters, Navy vessels, and Army tanks by quickly determining a direction (e.g., toward an incoming missile) to which to point a modulated IR laser beam and for directing the laser beam in the determined direction.","Advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) present a significant threat to fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Mid-infrared laser-based infrared countermeasures (IRCM) systems could provide the needed protection from MANPADS for many types of aircraft. Unfortunately, with the complex pointer\/tracker-turret assembly, these systems typically cost more than $1.5 million. This prohibitively high cost precludes use with large numbers of aircraft, leaving them unprotected from advanced MANPADS.","Laser beams can be pointed using a number of methods and mechanisms, some which allow aligning the laser beam with a sensor-determined direction, which is useful for IRCM. Among these are methods using turrets and\/or one or more gimbaled mirrors, for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,020,955 \u201cSystem for pseudo on-gimbal, automatic line-of-sight alignment and stabilization of off-gimbal electro-optical passive and active sensors\u201d issued Feb. 1, 2000 to Peter Messina, and which is incorporated herein by reference. Messina describes an optical apparatus for use in auto-aligning line-of-sight optical paths of at least one sensor and a laser, comprising: at least one reference source for outputting at least one reference beam that is optically aligned with the line-of-sight of the at least one sensor, a laser reference source for outputting a laser reference beam that is optically aligned with the line-of-sight of the laser, a laser alignment mirror for adjusting the alignment of the line of sight of the laser beam, a sensor alignment mirror for adjusting the alignment of the at least one sensor, combining optics for coupling the plurality of reference beams along a common optical path, gimbal apparatus, a detector disposed on the gimbal apparatus for detecting the plurality of reference beams, a fine stabilization mirror disposed on the gimbal apparatus for adjusting the line of sight of the optical paths of the at least one sensor and the laser, and a processor coupled to the detector, the laser alignment mirror, the sensor alignment mirror, and the fine stabilization mirror for processing signals detected by the detector and outputting control signals to the respective mirrors to align the line-of-sight optical paths of the sensor and the laser. Other such systems or components are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,288,381 issued Sep. 11, 2001 to Peter Messina titled \u201cIntegrated system for line-of-sight stabilization and auto-alignment of off-gimbal passive and active electro-optical sensors\u201d, U.S. Pat.

No. 6,879,447 issued Apr. 12, 2005 to Carlos Casteleiro titled \u201cOptical gimbal apparatus\u201d which are all incorporated herein by reference. Such systems are complex and expensive.","U.S. Pat.

The pointer\/tracker assembly is also the least reliable component in conventional laser-pointer or other IRCM systems. Further, the low-cost method and apparatus of the present invention use the existing or Common Missile Warning Sensor (CMWS) or other conventional sensors for tracking what the laser beam should point at (e.g., incoming missiles), eliminating the costly fine-track infrared camera.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides an apparatus that includes a first fiber bundle having a plurality of light-transmitting fibers including a first fiber, a second fiber, and a third fiber, the first fiber bundle having a first end and a second end, a laser that emits laser energy, a processor that generates direction-control information, a fiber selector that is operatively coupled to the processor and based on the direction-control information, is configured to direct the laser energy into the first fiber at the first end of the first fiber bundle during a first time period, and transform optics located to receive the laser energy from the second end of the first fiber bundle and configured to form an output beam of the laser energy from the first fiber in a first selected direction of a plurality of directions during the first time period. Some embodiments further include a modulator that modulates an intensity of the laser energy according to a predetermined pattern. Some embodiments further include a sensor operatively coupled to receive electromagnetic radiation from a scene and to transmit sense information to the processor based on the received electromagnetic radiation, and wherein the processor is configured to generate the direction-control information based on the sense information. Some embodiments further include an ability to sense more than one object and simultaneously direct a plurality of laser beams in a plurality of different directions or sequentially direct a single laser beam in the plurality of different directions one at a time.","Another aspect of the invention, in some embodiments, is a method that includes providing a first fiber bundle having a plurality of light-transmitting fibers including a first fiber, a second fiber, and a third fiber, the first fiber bundle having a first end and a second end, generating direction-control information, based on the direction-control information, directing laser energy into the first fiber at the first end of the first fiber bundle during a first time period, forming an output beam of the laser energy from the second end of the first fiber bundle, and steering the output beam of the laser energy from the first fiber in a first selected direction of a plurality of directions during the first time period.","In other embodiments, the present invention provides an apparatus that includes a first fiber bundle having a plurality of light-transmitting fibers including a first fiber, a second fiber, and a third fiber, the first fiber bundle having a first end and a second end, means for generating direction-control information, means for directing laser energy, based on the direction-control information, into the first fiber at the first end of the first fiber bundle during a first time period, means for forming an output beam of the laser energy from the second end of the first fiber bundle, and means for steering the output beam of the laser energy from the first fiber in a first selected direction of a plurality of directions during the first time period.","Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purpose of illustration, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon the claimed invention.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The leading digit(s) of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced, such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component which appears in multiple Figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label, and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","121","111","111","100","110","112","113","110","240","120","122","123","113","110","111","121","112","111","122","121"]},"In some embodiments, the one-to-one relationship is ensured by bundling and\/or affixing to one another a plurality of fibers, and then cleaving the bundle, thus ensuring that each fiber end at one cleaved end corresponds exactly to that fiber at the other cleaved end. In some embodiments, a \u201cfolded\u201d or \u201clooped\u201d (i.e., looped to some bend radius that will not break the fiber) middle point (i.e., somewhere between the two ends of the fiber, typically but not necessarily in the exact middle) of fiber is threaded from each external aperture on the vehicle (e.g., a helicopter) or other mobile or fixed platform, to the location of receiver \/transmitter  (see ), thus providing two fibers (a transmit fiber connected to a receive fiber at the loop or fold point) from each external aperture to receiver \/transmitter . Once all the fibers are connected from their respective external apertures to their folded ends at the receiver\/transmitter, the folded ends are bundled to, e.g., a square cross section, and cleaved to obtain a receive-end bundle and a transmit end bundle, each bundle having fiber ends in a mirror-corresponding configuration (i.e., once cut, the fibers across any given row that are left-to-right on the receiver will correspond to those fibers in a right-to-left order on the same row of the transmitter). In other embodiments, a large number of fibers can be wound (e.g., around a large circular form) to a length at least as long as the longest fiber routing in the vehicle (e.g., 2 meters, in some embodiments). Once all the fiber loops are wound, the fibers at one point along the circular form are gathered into a bundle (e.g., one having a square cross-section area), and are cleaved to obtain a receive end bundle and a transmit end bundle, each having fiber ends in a mirror-corresponding configuration (i.e., once cut, the fibers across any given row that are left-to-right on the receiver will correspond to those fibers in a right-to-left order on the same row of the transmitter). At some midpoint between the transmit end and the receive end, each fiber is separately routed to its respective external aperture on the vehicle and cleaved at that point to form one fiber that goes to the receive end bundle, and another fiber that goes to a mirror-corresponding point on the transmit end bundle.","Fiber bundles are commonly used in medical endoscopes, where in some embodiments 30,000 fibers are bundled to create a flexible imaging cable. Recent developments (e.g., at the Naval Research Laboratory) have developed low-loss mid-infrared-transmitting fibers, (e.g., chalcogenide-glass fibers), and commercial manufacturers have fabricated mid-IR fibers into multi-element bundles.","In some embodiments of this design, the receiver and transmitter apertures are co-located and coupled rigidly to a common structure. Thus, any flexing in the platform structure will not lead to misalignment between the receiver and the transmitter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","215","240","240","220","220","221","222","222","223","125","125","120","125","120"]},"Although, in some embodiments, the laser would be capable of producing output with very narrow solid angles, the divergence of the laser must be increased to fill the solid angle typical of the MWS imaging sensor, to ensure that the target identified within an imaging-sensor pixel or cell (e.g., an MWS cell) is illuminated. Because of the increased laser divergence, the power of the laser must be increased, to provide a sufficient jamming\/laser-signal strength (J\/S) ratio. For certain platforms such as low-signature helicopters, this approach is feasible due to the relatively low radiant intensity needed to provide sufficient laser-signal strength (J\/S ratio) to cause the missile to optical break-lock or other desired effect on the target object. Beam shaping is used in some embodiments to propagate a flat-top intensity profile, which improves the efficiency and maintains the laser-power requirement at a manageable level.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["221","326","222","223","125","331","331"],"sub":["x","1-x","y","1-y "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In some embodiments, the invention could enable the hardware cost of an IRCM system for low-signature helicopters to be reduced to 1\/10the cost of current IRCM systems.  shows the overall system concept for a low-cost distributed-aperture beam-steering laser-pointer (IRCM) beam-steering system . The invention could enable the hardware cost of a laser-pointer system for certain platforms (e.g., for low-signature helicopters) to be reduced to about ten percent of the cost of current laser-pointer systems. In some embodiments, a plurality (e.g., four, in some embodiments) of sensors  (e.g., solid-state cameras or other suitable imager for one or more wavelengths of interest) each points in a different direction from the platform (e.g., an aircraft) and provide direction parameters to laser\/scanner unit  that outputs a laser beam to one or more fibers of a plurality of fiber bundles (e.g., four, in some embodiments), wherein one or more fibers outputs its light through each transmit lens  (in some embodiments, each transmit fiber's far end has its own lens to point its beam in a particular chosen direction with a chosen beam divergence).

Fiber coupling allows the Mid-IR laser to be isolated from the helicopter platform's vibration, thereby reducing the engineering required to harden the laser. Isolating the laser from vibration should also reduce the lifecycle costs by improving the reliability. The most significant cost savings, however, is present where multiple pointer trackers were required to provide adequate protection, with a single remotely located laser being coupled into any pointer tracker. Using a single laser for all bundles precludes or complicates the option of pointing laser beams at multiple objects (countering multiple threats) simultaneously, and in some embodiments, this level of complexity can add cost to the system.

The OPSL output is diffraction limited (DL) in one direction and 4 to 5 times DL (four to five times diffraction limited) in the orthogonal direction. In order to produce the required output divergence in the far field, assuming a 12.4-mm output aperture, some embodiments are limited to a beam quality of two to three times DL. Thus, there is a power loss in one dimension when coupling into the fiber. The loss due to the far-field profile is a result of the non-uniform far-field profile. If a Gaussian distribution is produced in the far field with a 1\/ediameter of 2 mrad, then the intensity at the edge of the field is only 23% that of a uniform distribution of the same size. Nonetheless, even with these inefficiencies the laser power required to produce a radiant intensity of 1.67 kW\/steradian is less than 1 W.","Alternative-System Concept",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","600","110","240","620","621","641","600"]},"The key to understanding this concept is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between resolution elements in the receiver and fibers in the transmitter, as illustrated in .  shows a one-to-one correspondence between a resolvable spot on the detector array in the receiver aperture and a transmitting fiber in the array making up the fiber bundle in the transmitter aperture. Each resolution element in the detector defines a solid angle in the MWS field-of-regard. If a threat is detected within that resolution element the laser power is directed into a particular fiber that transmits into that same solid angle. One key aspect of this design is that the receiver and transmitter apertures are co-located and coupled rigidly to a common structure. Thus, any flexing in the platform structure will not lead to misalignment between the receiver and transmitter.","In some embodiments, the divergence of the laser is increased to fill a solid angle equivalent to one pixel of the MWS. The power of the laser must be increased, as well, to provide a sufficient jam signal. Fortunately, because the beam can be many times diffraction limited and still fall within this solid angle, a more uniform profile can be transmitted into the far field.  shows that a 1-W laser generates a far-field radiant intensity of 1.67 kW\/steradian if a one-degree beam divergence is chosen. Researchers at AFRL (e.g., see the A. P. Ongstad et al. article cited herein) have demonstrated output powers of 14 W at 3.5 microns from an OPSL, which would correspond to 11 W at 4.5 microns. Fiber-coupling losses are assumed to be very small since in some embodiments the beam is coupled into a fiber having a large-mode-area core (e.g., one having a core of about 250 microns diameter, in some embodiments) fiber.","The top-hat profile is created in the far field by generating a uniform intensity at the end of the fiber and then imaging the end of the fiber bundle into the far field. The key is in producing a uniform intensity over the end of a fiber in a way that is not affected by varying the fiber-bundle handling or environment. Nominally, the OPSL output will not fill all of the fiber modes, and the fiber will probably not be long enough to allow sufficient mode mixing. Applying mechanical stress or shaping the fiber (non-circular cross section), perhaps over a subsection, will alter the mode-coupling properties and can be used to vary the output profile. Shaping the injected beam (changing the intensity or phase profile) such that it fills all of the fiber modes can also be used to improve the output uniformity. However, since the coupling between modes is determined largely by the defects in the fiber, and mid-IR fiber was developed only recently, the best method for generating a uniform intensity will have to be determined empirically.","Fiber-Bundle Demonstration Experiment","The fiber-bundle experiment shown in  and  sends out a red laser output beam that is pointed to track or follow a green spot projected from a green laser pointer onto a wall or screen. In some embodiments, the red track beam steps from one location to the next (due to the spacing, beam divergence, and pointing direction of the various fibers) as the beam is switched from one fiber to the next in response to the continuous motion of the green-laser-pointer spot. Using visible wavelengths eases issues with diagnostics and makes the operation of the system even more visible (apparent to observers). The field-of-regard in the experiment, in some embodiments, is 30 degrees horizontal and vertical. The 1-degree divergence of the track beam would be maintained as is present in some embodiments of the invention. Thus, the fiber bundle would contain about nine hundred fibers in a nested square array. In other embodiments, other widths of field of regard, other solid-angle divergences for the individual beams, and other numbers of fibers can be used to suit the requirements of a particular installation.","The block diagram of a system  for the experiment is shown in . The upper half of the system provides a lab version of an imaging sensor  and the image processor . The lower half of  provides the track laser, the mirrors and lenses for injecting the beam into the fiber bundle, the fiber bundle itself, and the output lens.","Mid-IR Fiber-Bundle Design","Various embodiments of the invention use various wavelengths for the lasers. In some embodiments, mid-IR wavelengths (e.g., between about 2 microns and about 5 microns) are used. In some embodiments, the distributed-aperture approach of the present invention for a low-cost pointer tracker has a mid-IR fiber bundle that serves to distribute the laser energy to transmit apertures co-located with the imaging sensors. The design of the fiber bundle can have a significant impact on the efficiency of the system as a result of fiber-coupling losses because the fiber bundle affects the far-field intensity distribution. The efficiency with which laser light is coupled to the target determines the size, weight, and cost of the laser, so it is important to consider the fiber-bundle design tradeoffs carefully.","In this section the objectives of the fiber-bundle design for some embodiments are laid out and the design considerations are described that result in the choice of important design parameters. Methods are also described for generating uniform spatial intensity at the end of the fiber and coupling the laser light into and out of the fiber bundle.","Design Objectives","The design parameters for some embodiments of the fiber bundle with typical values for some embodiments are listed in Table 2. These values are not derived from a specific set of requirements; rather they are an estimate of what is required from the distributed-aperture system to be an effective laser-pointer system for some applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example parameters for the fiber bundle, in some embodiments:"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Design Parameter","Value"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Divergence of laser output","1\u00b0 FW"]},{"entry":["Uniform far-field beam distribution","I = I+\/\u2212 10% within 1\u00b0 cone"]},{"entry":["Power within the output divergence",">70%"]},{"entry":"cone"},{"entry":["Match the receiver field-of-regard","90\u00b0 cone"]},{"entry":"(FOR)"},{"entry":["Minimize low-intensity areas in the","I < 90% of Iin < 15% of FOR"]},{"entry":"FOR"},{"entry":["Limit coupling and absorption losses","<20%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Fiber-Bundle Design","The characteristics of the light exiting the bundle are determined both by the parameters of the individual fibers and those of the fiber bundle.

It can be seen that with \u03b2>32 the output-beam-intensity profile is essentially a flat top. This puts a lower limit on the fiber-core diameter of D>85 microns. If D=100 \u03bcm is chosen then the configuration parameter is V=18.8 and the number of modes the fiber can carry is M=178.","Coupling the Laser into the Fiber","The next question is how the laser light may be injected in such a way that it occupies the modes. The most straightforward method is to simply couple the light into the fiber and let coupling between fiber modes transfer light from the initially occupied modes to all of the modes. Unfortunately, this method requires long fibers (>100 m) and the absorption and scattering losses that would result from propagating over larger distances in the fiber cannot be tolerated.","Another method of filling the fiber modes is to degrade the beam-parameter product of the laser light upon injecting it into the fiber such that it fills the fiber beam-parameter product. The beam-parameter product of a mid-IR fiber with a 100-\u03bcm core is 40 mm-mrad. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers (OPSLs) typically have beam-parameter products of about 25 mm by 10 mm-mrad in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the emitting junction. Thus, the beam-parameter product must be degraded by about 1.6 times in one direction and by four times in the other. Focusing the laser to a spot size slightly smaller than the fiber core and using an appropriate binary phase plate (see N. Davidson, R. Ozeri, and R. Baron, \u201cFabrication of binary phase surface relief optical elements by selective deposition of dielectric layers\u201d, Rev. Sci. Instru., 70, 2, pp. 1245-1247 (1999)) to expand the divergence on the beam such that it matches the fiber numerical aperture (NA) will degrade the beam-parameter product. The phase plate reduces the spatial coherence of the laser light. For example, in some embodiments, 10-W laser would lead to a peak intensity of <0.5 MW\/cmon the fiber end, well below the 1.1 GW\/cmdamage limit.","It is reasonable to wonder if speckle due to the interference between modes could result in a non-uniform intensity distribution at the end of the fiber.

As the cladding thickness is decreased the rays striking the cladding at high angles of incidence will leak out through the cladding and be lost. Light in the higher-order modes tends to propagate at higher angles, so the higher modes will be the first to be lost.
