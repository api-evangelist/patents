{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application for patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61\/387,451 entitled \u201cFRAMEWORK FOR THIRD PARTY EXTENSION OF CORE APPLICATION USER INTERFACES\u201d filed Sep. 28, 2010, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","The present disclosure relates to a mobile operating environment, and more particularly, to providing improved apparatus and methods of distributing integrated mobile applications for user devices.","Mobile operators or mobile device carriers play a major part in the telecommunication industry today. Initially, mobile operators concentrated their efforts on generating revenue by increasing their subscriber base. However, it will be appreciated that in several countries, the scope for increasing the subscriber base has now become very limited, as the market has reached close to the saturation point. As a result, the mobile operators have been branching into providing value added services to subscribers in order to increase their revenue.","One way of generating increased revenue is through the sales of premium services, such as ringtones, wallpaper, games, etc., to users. These services may be provided by the mobile operator themselves, or by business entities who may operate in collaboration with the mobile operators to provide such services. The services may be available for download to a mobile device or user equipment upon payment of a fee.","Many benefits, such as maximizing the potential earnings for sales, accrue upon recommending and promoting to users content or services that are the most likely to be of interest to the users. The users can have a better experience using their mobile device in light of these individually recommended content and services.","A burgeoning area of such content and services pertains to applications. For example, an on-device mobile application store has become a crowded, hard-to-browse experience as more and more applications come online. Similarly, given the general user interface limitations of most mobile computing platforms, applications that are installed can have functionality that can only be used one at a time. Each application generally runs standalone. Conventionally, mobile platforms in some instances allow for the sharing of data (e.g., contact details) across the mobile platform. That functionality does not extend, however, to the sharing of full, custom user interface (UI) extensions between third party and core applications.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for extending services of a user device. The method includes identifying a first application resident on a user device having a first service that utilizes a first data type. The method further includes identifying a second application of a plurality of applications having a second service that utilizes a second data type. The method further includes matching a compatibility of a selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application with a respective one of the second service or the second data type of the second application.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides at least one processor for extending services of a user device. A first module identifies a first application resident on a user device having a first service that utilizes a first data type. A second module identifies a second application of a plurality of applications having a second service that utilizes a second data type. A third module matches a compatibility of a selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application with a respective one of the second service or the second data type of the second application.","In an additional aspect, the present disclosure provides a computer program product for extending services of a user device. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium stores instructions. At least one instruction causes a computer to identify a first application resident on a user device having a first service that utilizes a first data type. At least one instruction causes the computer to identify a second application of a plurality of applications having a second service that utilizes a second data type. At least one instruction causes the computer to match a compatibility of a selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application with a respective one of the second service or the second data type of the second application.","In a further aspect, the present disclosure provides an apparatus for extending services of a user device. The apparatus comprises means for identifying a first application resident on a user device having a first service that utilizes a first data type. The apparatus comprises means for identifying a second application of a plurality of applications having a second service that utilizes a second data type. The apparatus comprises means for matching a compatibility of a selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application with a respective one of the second service or the second data type of the second application.","In yet another aspect, the present disclosure provides an apparatus for extending services of a user device. An extension manager identifies a first application resident on a user device having a first service that utilizes a first data type. A discovery agent identifies a second application of a plurality of applications having a second service that utilizes a second data type. The discovery agent identifies the second application by matching a compatibility of a selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application with a respective one of the second service or the second data type of the second application.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter described in more detail and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Current mobile devices are limited in the way core mobile applications, such as contacts, calendars, maps, photos etc., can be extended. While some mobile operating systems allow for third party downloadable applications to share some of their data, the same does not apply to their user interfaces. Additionally, the current standard model of a virtual application store from which mobile applications can be downloaded provides a single point of entry for application discovery (usually an application store icon on a home screen of a mobile device).","The present disclosure provides a mobile platform User Interface (UI) that can be structured to provide a mechanism for an application, such as one or more third party applications, to provide UI and data extensions into one or more other applications, such as core applications, stored on a mobile device. As used herein, a core application includes any application preconfigured on a mobile device, while a third party application includes any application that is not a core application, although the principles described herein relate to extending any application based on functionality of another application. Further, the provided UI and data extensions refer to additional services that can be added to one application based on another application. As used herein, the term service includes any application-related functionality. In some aspects, the extension of a service is based on one application utilizing a service or data type that is compatible with another application, where data type relates to a type or format of data used by the application. The present disclosure further provides multiple, contextual points of access for discovering and downloading of one or more applications, such as third party applications, from inside the UI of one or more other applications, such as core mobile applications, thereby allowing users to easily discover and download one or more new applications which functionality extends any resident application.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that the various aspects may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing these aspects.","In , the present disclosure provides an apparatus  for extending services of a user device , according to one aspect. An extension manager  identifies a first application  resident on the user device  having a first service  that utilizes a first data type . A discovery agent  identifies a second application , for example from a plurality of applications , having a second service  that utilizes a second data type . The discovery agent  identifies the second application  by matching a compatibility of a selected one of the first service  or the first data type  of the first application  with a respective one of the second service  or the second data type  of the second application .","For example, the discovery agent  can match a compatibility of the first service  of the first application  with the second data type  of the second application  as depicted at . For example, the first service  may include a contact service and the second data type  may include an online gamer contact. In another example, the first service  may include a contact service and the second data type  may include a location service.","Alternatively or in addition, the discovery agent  can match a compatibility of the first data type  of the first application  with the second service  of the second application  as depicted at . For example, the first data type  may include a media format and the second service  may include a media viewer. In another example, the first data type  may includes a media format and the second service  may include an uploader to a server. As an additional example, the first data type  may include an image format associated with at least one location and the second service  may include a service associated with the at least one location.","A user interface  presents the first application  with a representation, depicted as a discovery icon , of the discovery agent , which may be selected, e.g. based on user input, for activating the identifying of compatible applications, such as the second application .","In one aspect, the first application  may include at least one of a plurality of services  or a plurality of data types . The user interface  can present a current context  that identifies the first service  and the first data type . Accordingly, rather than consider all of the plurality of services  or the plurality of data types , in an aspect the discovery agent  may identify the current context  and then may identify the second application  according to the current context .","In one aspect, an application adder  manages the acquisition and storage of the second application  on the user device , for example from a server . In an exemplary aspect, the user interface  presents the first application  with a representation, depicted as a download or \u201cadd\u201d icon , of the application adder  for activating or initiating the acquisition and storage, e.g. downloading, of the second application .","In one aspect, a data structure  may define one or more of the compatibilities of the plurality of applications . For example, data structure  may identify service types and\/or data types of a respective application, compatible service types and\/or data types that work with a respective application, and\/or other applications that are compatible with a respective application. The discovery agent  may access the data structure  for use in determining matching of the compatibility of the first application  with one or more of the plurality of applications , such as for matching with the second application  as discussed above. For example, the data structure  can be resident on the user device  for all of the plurality of applications . Alternatively, the data structure  can be resident on the user device  for a subset of the plurality of applications  that are resident or stored on the user device . Alternatively or in addition, the data structure  can be resident on the server  for all of the plurality of applications , and linked to an application store  for downloading to one or more user devices, such as user device . In an aspect, for example, the user device  can access the data structure  via a network interface  on user device  that is capable of communication with a network interface  of the server .","Thus, in one aspect, the extension manager  obtains and integrates the respective one of the second data type  or second service  of the second application  for use by the selected one of the first service  or the first data type  of the first application  in response to a user selection.","In , in one aspect, a method  for extending services of a user device includes identifying a first application resident on a user device which has a first service that utilizes a first data type (block ). For example, the extension manager  identifies the first application  on the user device  having the first service  that utilizes the first data type  (). The method  further includes identifying a second application of a plurality of applications having a second service that utilizes a second data type (block ). For example, the discovery agent  identifies the second application  of the plurality of applications  having the second service  that utilizes the second data type  (). The method  further includes matching a compatibility of a selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application with a respective one of the second service type or the second data type of the second application (block ). For example, the discovery agent  identifies the second application  by matching a compatibility of the selected one of the first service  or the first data type  of the first application  with the respective one of the second data type  or second service  of the second application  (). Optionally, in an exemplary aspect, the method  further includes presenting the first application with a representation of the discovery agent for activating the identifying of the second application (block ). For example, the user interface  presents the first application  with the representation, depicted as the discovery icon , of the discovery agent  for activating the identifying of the second application  ().","In one aspect, the first application  may include at least one of a plurality of services or a plurality of data types. In this case, the method  can further include identifying a current context defined by the first service and the first data type, and identifying the second application according to the current context.","In one aspect, the method  can further include acquiring and storing the second application on the user device, e.g. by downloading from a server. In an exemplary aspect, the method  may further include presenting on a user interface the first application with a representation of the application adder for activating the acquisition and storage of the second application in the user device.","In one aspect, the method  of matching a compatibility (block ) may identify a match between the first service of the first application and the second data type of the second application. For example, the first service may include a contact service and the second data type comprises an online gamer contact. For another example, the first service may include a contact service and the second data type comprises a location service.","In one aspect, the method  of matching a compatibility (block ) may identify a match between the first data type of the first application and the second service of the second application. For example, the first data type may include a media format and the second service comprises a media viewer. For another example, the first data type may include a media format and the second service comprises an uploader to a server. For another example, the first data type may include an image format associated with at least one location and the second service comprises a service associated with the at least one location.","In one aspect, the method  may include obtaining a data structure that defines one or more of the compatibilities of the plurality of applications. For example, in an aspect, the data structure may be obtained by accessing the data structure via a network interface.","In one aspect, the method  may include obtaining and integrating the respective one of the second data type or second service of the second application for use by the selected one of the first service or the first data type of the first application in response to a user selection.","As examples of use, in  and A-B, an exemplary mobile device  presents a graphical user interface (GUI)  for interacting with a UI application integrator according to one aspect consistent with the present disclosure.","In , a first UI state depicted at  presents a home screen populated with a plurality of applications , one of which is a People application .","As depicted at , after selecting the People application , the GUI  lists contacts . Previously, a related location application (e.g., Locate Person Application) has been integrated that enhances the contacts  by presenting a current location if discernible. Upon selecting a particular contact, as depicted at , contact details  are displayed as well as location details . For instance, the Locate Person Application, downloaded from an application store, can provide a map UI within a contact detail user interface for a contact, thereby showing the location of the contact.","In one aspect, the integration of one or more applications can be dynamically performed. Thus, the application services can be easily toggled, added or removed as needed.","For instance, as depicted in , a locate person detail user interface  may be generated in response to a user selection  received at UI  (). In an aspect, a UI application integrator icon  is accessed from a core application. For example, in this case, UI application integrator icon  is located in a lower portion of UI . In response to a user selection of UI application integrator icon , a user interface is depicted at  that provides a listing of currently installed applications that are contextually relevant. As depicted at virtual key , the user can select an opportunity to discover one or more additional recommended contextually-related applications  from an application store . These contextually-related applications , like the \u201cGamer Net\u201d application , for example, can have their UI extended into multiple core applications according to the aspects described herein. Each application provides a service that is tailored for a specific purpose, and will affect the relevant core application in its own way.","For example, in , in response to a user selection of the \u201cGamer Net\u201d application  (), a details user interface  is depicted for the Gamer Net application , which includes two services provided by Gamer Net application  that can be integrated. In this case, the Gamer Net application  may extend to both a People application  and an Events application .","For instance, as depicted at , the user selects People application  to see how the services of the Gamer Net application  can enhance the People application . As depicted at , examples are presented for how the Gamer Net application  would enhance information for the People Application . Going back to UI , the user may select to add the Gamer Net application  to the collection of applications or services resident on the user device, which results in the installed collection of applications or services as depicted at UI  including the Gamer Net application . Once installed, new applications or services appear in the relevant core applications tabs. In an aspect, for example, a Contacts application on the user device may list Contacts with Gamer Net accounts and display gamer profiles within, for example, a contact details screen. For example, in this case contacts may be stored in People application , and the Gamer Net application  or service will affect the entry for the contact in the People application . The user can then select the contextually related People application  to see the integration in operation.","For example, in , as depicted at  the enhanced People application is shown for the previously selected contact that now shows a status  for the individual on Gamer Net. Selecting the People application  again backs out to a contact list UI, as depicted at , with gamer status  now annotated in addition to location .","In one aspect, how a service affects core applications can be determined by third party application developers, using flexibility inherent in the UI application integrator Application Programming Interface (API).","In , the collection of services as depicted at  shows the Gamer Net icon . Since Gamer Net is also a standalone application, Gamer Net is also accessible from the home screen. When selected for standalone operation as depicted at , additional services provided by Gamer Net are presented.","With initial reference to , some additional examples of how these services can be incorporated into the core applications are depicted. In the calendar application as depicted at , services from third party applications can change the core UI to add customized content directly into a calendar view, such as the Week view. For example, a calendar event  has a UI which has been enhanced by a Sports application. When the calendar event  is selected, an example of the functionality of this integrated service is depicted at , wherein additional information has been presented.","In an additional example, referring to , at  in a Maps application, UI layers, e.g. layer , can be added to show additional information as needed. When a layer is selected, such as the selection of layer  resulting in UI , one or more integrated services from another UI application, depicted as a Maps Location Synchronization service at , may then be available. In this case, for example, Maps Location Synchronization service at  enables locations or directions to be sent directly to the user device.","As a further example in , the present disclosure can be incorporated into a Photos application as depicted at  that provides a catalog of user photographs. When selecting a photograph as depicted at , one or more integrated services from other compatible applications are displayed. For example, in this case, the integrated services may include a process service that allows photos to be processed directly from within the core photo application without having to launch a separate application. Further, for example, the integrated services from other compatible applications may include an auto correct photograph service and a social site and\/or photo share site upload service.","In , an Augmented Reality Application is depicted at  and at  wherein UI layers, such as layers  and , can be added in a similar way to provide extra functionality to a real world depiction, such as a street view for shopping at  and a sky view of a star constellation mapping service at .","In , in one aspect, a communication system  is provided wherein an apparatus, depicted as mobile device  such as handset, user equipment, smartphone, access terminal, user device, etc., provides integrated services on a mobile computing platform . In particular, the mobile computing platform  executes a first application  on a user interface (UI) . The user interface  displays a user interface feature  of a second application  in response to the mobile computing platform  determining a contextual similarity with the first application .","In one aspect, the second application  is locally stored on the mobile device . In another aspect, the second application  is remotely stored on a core network  and is downloaded via a wireless wide area network (WWAN) via a node  to a transceiver  of the mobile device . Alternatively or in addition, the second application  is downloaded via a wireless local access network (WLAN) via an access point .","In an exemplary aspect, the user interface is designed to promote third party application discovery in a context that is useful to the user (e.g., related to the task or application the user is currently using and which functionality and\/or services the user wishes to acquire to extend the capability of the application currently in use). Accordingly, in one or more implementations, the described aspects provide a framework that allows application developers to extend the UI for the application developer's own application into a core application of a mobile device.","The present disclosure further allows deep integration of application functionality and\/or services across the entire mobile UI, making an application store  more of an end point than a start point for the discovery of new application or services (e.g., messaging, events, contacts, maps, browsers, photos, etc.). With the present disclosure, third party applications can extend their UI into core applications on the device, presenting functionality contextually in a respective core application where it is needed. These UI extensions can be referred to as services.","In one aspect, for one or more applications on the device, such as but not limited to a core application, a direct access point may be provided into the application store which only lists applications that have services related, e.g. having a matching compatibility, to the respective application.","In another aspect, an application details screen can identify an application on the device with which one or more other applications can be integrated. In addition, controls can be provided that allow the user to select one of the functionalities or services listed for the other applications to see more details about this integration. For example, a depiction can be presented of how a respective other application integrates with the resident application, which may include a preview image alongside of this depiction.","In , a methodology  is depicted for integrating services on a mobile platform. A mobile device executes a first application on a mobile computing platform (block ). The mobile device determines a contextual similarity of the first application to a second application, or a service provided by a second application (block ). The mobile device displays a user interface feature of a second application in response to the determined contextual similarity with the first application (block ). The mobile device receives a user selection of the user interface feature (block ). A determination is made whether the second application is installed (block ). If not, the second application is downloaded from an application store (e.g., via WWAN or WLAN) (block ) and then the service of the second application referenced by a defined extension (\u201cservice\u201d) may be executed (block ). If so, the service of the second application referenced by a defined extension (\u201cservice\u201d) is executed (block ).","Referring to , in one aspect, the user device  () may include a processor  for carrying out processing functions associated with one or more of components and functions described herein. Processor  can include a single or multiple set of processors or multi-core processors as part. Moreover, processor  can be implemented as an integrated processing system and\/or a distributed processing system, depicted as a computing platform .","User device  further includes a memory , such as for storing local versions of applications being executed by processor .

The term \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d (or alternatively, \u201ccomputer program product\u201d) as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips . . . ), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD) . . . ), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick). Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving electronic mail or in accessing a network such as the Internet or a local area network (LAN). Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope of the disclosed aspects.","The steps of a method or algorithm described in connection with the aspects disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. The processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. The ASIC may reside in a user terminal In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal.","The previous description of the disclosed aspects is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present disclosure. Various modifications to these aspects will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the disclosure.
