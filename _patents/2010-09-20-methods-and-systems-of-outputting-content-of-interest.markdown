The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any person of the patent document or the patent disclosure following publication of the application, as it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office file or records, but reserves all other rights whatsoever.","It can be desirable to access content from a structured electronic document, for example to utilize the content for another purpose. Identifying the content within the structured electronic document so that it can be accessed in an automated fashion, for example programmatically, can be a laborious process.","Often one goes back to the original source of the content and retrieves it from the source. In many cases the source is not available for access, or determining how to gain such access makes access impractical.","It is desirable to provide improved or alternate methods of identifying such content. It is also desirable to provide improved or alternate methods, tools and systems to assist with the identification of content within structured electronic documents.","Like reference numerals may be used in different figures to denote like components.","Referring to , an example browser page  displays weather information for Waterloo, Ontario. Such a page  displays specific content elements . In this description content elements  are referred to generically using reference numeral . A specific content element may be referred to using reference numeral  followed by a letter, for example ","Referring to , similar content elements  are displayed on an alternate page .","Referring to , a common expression  is stored in a computer readable storage medium . A data structure definition  is also stored on a computer readable storage medium . The common expression  identifies one or more content elements  in a structured electronic document . A structured electronic document is an electronic document structured in accordance with one or more structured definition languages, such as HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), XML (Extensible Markup Language), or WSDL (Web Service Definition Language). The structured electronic document  can, for example, be used to render page  (see ). The data structure definition  defines a data structure . The data structure definition  is defined according to the common expression . The common expression  and data definition  can be used together to extract content elements  from a structured electronic document . Extracted content elements can be used, for example, to render a page  (see ).","A common expression  and data structure definition  can be utilized to output content of interest to a first structured electronic document  from a second structured electronic document . The second structured electronic document  can, for example, be another instance of the structured electronic document  used to form the common expression . For example, the structured electronic document  from which the common expression  is formed can be a weather page for an earlier date, whereas the second structured electronic document  can be a weather page created at the time the common expression  is to be applied.","It is recognized that the common expression  and data structure definition  can be stored together on one medium , or distributed across different storage media . The common expression  and data structure definition  can be stored in a single file.","The common expression  and data structure definition  can together form a content extraction document CED  to extract content elements  from a structured electronic document , which CED  can be stored in the same file in the storage medium.","For ease of reference, this description will primarily describe a CED  embodiment; however, it is understood that the description also applies to distributed embodiments of a common expression  and data structure definition .","CED  stored on a computer-readable medium  has a common expression  and a data structure definition . The data structure definition  can include a data element identifying section  identifying data elements  for the identified content elements , and a relationship definition section  defining relationships between the identified data elements .","An electronic device  has processor , input device , and display device . The input device  can include, for example, a pointing device , such as a mouse, track ball, tablet, joystick or other pointing device. As a further non-traditional example, content elements  could be highlighted on the rendered document  with a unique reference such that the content elements  can be selected utilizing a microphone and voice recognition software operating on the electronic device . For example, various content elements  could be identified by unique references , ,  etc. Then the third content element  could be chosen by speaking \u201c3\u201d and speaking the unique reference to the microphone. Keyboard  may be similarly used to indicate a particular content element . The input device  can also include a keyboard . The keyboard  may act as a pointing device  by highlighting and indicating selection of a content element  for example. The processor  may be, for example, any processing device configured to carry out the functions described herein for the device . Example processing devices can include a suitably programmed microprocessor, or an appropriately configured application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The electronic device  can be, for example, a personal computer, or other computing device. The electronic device  can include memory , typically random access memory (RAM) within the processor  to store any applicable computer programs for execution. Such memory  may be further used to store other components described herein, such as the common expression  and the data structure definition , and the data structure . Alternatively, memory  external to the processor  and internal to the electronic device  or memory  externally accessible to the electronic device  may be utilized. Computer-readable storage medium  can form the memory , , or . Alternatively, the computer accessible medium  can be longer term storage such as a hard drive, CD-ROM disk, or flash memory. It is recognized that some forms of flash memory can be used as both RAM and long term storage.","Referring to  as an example related to weather, the CED  can identify data elements  which correspond to content elements . For example, icon representing weather conditions, and alphanumeric weather temperature , conditions , temperature units , and location correspond to respective content elements , such as icon , temperature , conditions , temperatureUnits , and location . Further data elements  could include a short term weather forecast , and additional weather condition icon , conditions , temperature , day , and time corresponding to icon , conditions , temperature , day and time ","The CED  can define a relationship between the identified data elements , for example, by grouping them together in a group data element , implying a common characteristic between the data elements  within the group  for example, implying that the icon represents the weather conditions with a temperature for the location with short term weather forecast . A further relationship between the identified data elements  can be defined by defining short term weather forecast as containing a further group of icon , conditions , temperature , day , and time , for example, implying that for the short term weather conditions are represented by the icon with temperature on the day at the time . Other aspects of the defined relationship can include, for example, that the short term weather can contain multiple versions , , of the group the version contains. For example, there can be a short term weather collection for a morning time of the given day , a collection for an afternoon time , and a collection for an evening time ","Referring to , and , a data structure  can be defined to include data elements  that correspond to respective content elements  within a structured electronic document . The data structure definition  can be defined according to the common expression  as the common expression  identifies respective content elements  within a structured electronic document . In this description data elements are referred to generically using reference numeral . A specific data element may be referred to using reference numeral  followed by a letter, for example . The data elements  can be stored in the data structure . The data structure  can include the entirety of the identified data elements ,  and the relationships between the data elements .","Referring again to , the sections ,  and  have been illustrated as separate sections for ease of comprehension. It is to be understood that the sections ,  and  can be merged into one or more sections. Further, functions of the sections can be explicit or implicit, such that identification or definition can be expressly made, or can be implied by other expressions. As an example, defining relationships between elements can impliedly identify those elements. Also, sections can be split into further sections with the functions of section ,  and  performed by more than one section. It is understood that each of these alternatives is encompassed within the illustration of the sections as sections ,  and  in .","As part of a common expression  for an electronic device  to identify content elements  within a structured electronic document, the CED  can identify the location of the structured electronic document . For example, the CED  can specify a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for the document . Alternatively, the document  can be dynamic, such that, an action needs to be carried out at a first structured electronic document (such as a search request page) in order to generate a structured electronic document  (such as a search results page). The required action at the first structured electronic document can be defined in the CED , along with all necessary inputs to the first structured electronic document. Alternatively, some structured electronic document  hosts may allow inputs to be included in a URL to bypass a first structured electronic document.","As part of a common expression for an electronic device  to identify content elements  within a structured electronic document , the CED  can identify the locations of the content elements  within the structured electronic document .","Referring to , in order to identify respective content elements  within a structured electronic document  a path can be used. A path is made up of a sequence of path parts. Each path part may be considered a step. Within each step is an element and optionally an index if the element is an array element. A path part can also have an identifier that is included after an element name after a number sign or hash (\u201c#\u201d) or other suitable separator. A path root is the highest level element from which the steps begin. The highest element can be the leftmost element. In the examples used herein, the steps are separated by a forward slash (\u201c\/\u201d). Steps at the same level are herein referred to as corresponding steps. Solutions can be implemented employing other separators.","As an example path, a content element  path can be structured as an XPath. For example the path \/bookstore\/book\/title might specify all titles for books on a bookstore page. Where bookstore is a root element and book and intervening element in the structured electronic document .","The content elements  within the structured electronic document  can be identified, for example, using paths based on the XML Path Language (XPath) (http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xpath), commonly referred to as an XPath. The XML Path Language is a language defined by the World Wide Web Consortium for selecting nodes from an XML document. It is to be recognized that XPath expressions are typically used in queries to return a result set; however, expressions using an XPath syntax are used herein to identify content elements  within the structured electronic document .","Referring to , relationships between the data elements  in the data structure  can be defined based upon the structure of paths identifying content elements  within the structured electronic document .","Referring to , to output content from a structured electronic document , at  common expression  and a data structure definition  are loaded into memory . The common expression  identifies a content element  in a first structured electronic document . The data structure definition  is defined according to the common expression. At , a data structure  is created in memory  using the data structure definition .","At , the common expression  is applied with a processor  to a second structured electronic document  to extract a content element  from the second structured electronic document .","At , the extracted content element  is stored in that data structure .","At , a template structured electronic document  (see ) is populated using the data structure  to produce an output structured electronic document  (see ).","Referring to , at , content elements  can be indicated by receiving through an input device  an indication of a plurality of content elements  within a structured electronic document . At , the portions can be determined with the processor  from indicated content elements . Determined portions can be, for example, individual content elements  or arrays of content elements .","At , the common expression  can be formed with processor  based on determined portions of the structured electronic document  associated with each content element . When the common expression  is applied to another structured electronic document , another content element is extracted from the other structured electronic document.","At , a data structure  can be defined according to the common expression . The data structure  can be further defined by a data structure definition  that is defined according to the common expression .","Referring to , content extraction according to the CED  document can be performed by remote server  through a content processing module  that performs functions similar to the browser extension  to carry out the retrieval of the structured electronic document , parsing of the CED  and the document , filling of the data structure , and formatting for presentation, with the assistance of presentation tier , prior to transmission to the browser . Typically the developer portion of the program  described earlier will remain as an extension to a browser  as the developer will likely be working at an electronic device  that is a desktop computer in order to perform development functions. Users of the additional structured electronic documents, as opposed to the developer, can utilize other forms of electronic device  without extension .","The network infrastructure can be accessible to the electronic device  through a public or private network . Similarly, the remote server  can be accessible through a public or private network . The networks , can be the same network, and can also be a combination of private and public networks. Content extraction according to the CED  at the handheld infrastructure  is particularly well suited to use in association with wireless handheld devices as electronic device  by reducing quantity of data transmitted to the wireless network device, and off-loading the processing requirements to the remote server . It is also to be recognized that the content extraction by a content processing module  according to the CED  to create and fill a data structure  and provide the data structure  to presentation tier  could occur at the remote server  or another remote server or be distributed across remote servers. For example, corresponding CEDs  could be stored at the remote server  for the markup documents  stored at the remote server ; so that, a website provider can provide parallel websites for different browser configurations, such as one using the structured electronic documents  for an electronic device  that is a desktop computer and another providing handheld browser optimized user interface screens using a CED .","A listener  in the remote server  can listen for a request to perform content extraction according to CED  or presentation template . If such a request is received, the listener  can begin the initiation process for the template  or CED . For example, a request might be inferred by the listener  where a CED  or presentation template  is associated with a particular URL requested by a browser . For example, the listener  can listen for a request on an HTTP over TCP\/IP (HyperText Transport Protocol over Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) transport layer. The listener  may also listen on other transport protocols.","The remote server  may also allow the initiation of content processing according to the CED  by a user and presentation of the content elements  to a user through transport protocols other than HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol), such as email (SMTP) or other messaging protocols such as SMS (Short Message Service). A combination of transport protocols can be used, for example initiation by HTTP and presentation by SMTP. Automatic initiation of a CED  is also possible. For example, a CED  can be initiated automatically once per day to send out a weather report by email.","By default, content elements  may be transmitted to the address from which the request is received. As part of the registration of a CED , a remote server can also receive user choices for desired protocols on which to listen for requests and on which to transmit content elements. For example, an email address can be associated with the CED  such that the content elements  are transmitted to the email address after content extraction according to the CED .","The content processing module  can include a markup language parser  (typically an HTML parser for parsing HTML for most documents ) and a content extraction engine . First the parser  parses the received structured electronic document  and generates a DOM (document object model) . The DOM  may be represented in many ways as is known to those of skill in the art. In this description the DOM  will be graphically represented as a tree structure. The DOM  is processed by the content extraction engine . The content extraction engine  processes the DOM  according to the CED  to create a data structure  in accordance with the data structure  definition in the CED . The content extraction engine  then populates the data structure  with the associated content elements  identified in the CED . The content extraction engine  traverses the paths of the DOM  specified in the CED  to find the specified content elements . The content extraction engine  then populates the data structure  with the content elements  in accordance with the associations in the CED .","Relationships between data elements can be defined by defining the data structure  for the elements. A data structure definition  can include a path wherein a separator between data elements  indicates that a data element  to the right of the separator is nested within a data element  to the left of the separator, and wherein an array representation indicates that a data element to the left of the array representation contains an array of data elements. For example, a data structure  can have paths such as: responseElement. ShortTermDay [x].temperature. Elements are separated by a \u201c.\u201d (dot). A \u201c.\u201d (dot) indicates that the element to the right is nested within the element to the left and \u201c[x]\u201d indicates that the element to the left has an array of elements. For example, shortTermDay has an array of ShortTermDay elements, one array record for different times of a day (for example, morning, afternoon, evening). A rResponseElement is a top-level container data element of the data structure . The responseElement contains the other data elements.","Relationships between data elements can be defined through the use of XML schema. Data elements can be defined within an XML schema. Using XML schema, data elements can be combined into arrays and complex types. Additionally, data types can be defined for data elements.","As an example, structured electronic document  can contain hypertext markup language (HTML) content containing HTML content elements . HTML content can be utilized from, for example, a web page by treating the HTML as a data source. Other markup language formats can be used, such as, for example, the XML, Extensible Hypertext markup Language (XHTML) and others.","The Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) can be used as the basis format for a CED . Although WSDL was originally created for web services, WSDL is extensible and can be used for other purposes. WSDL is suited for use with a CED  as WSDL allows the definition of a service to obtain a structural electronic document , is extensible to incorporate the use of other structured definition languages. WSDL is a standard, and there are various WSDL processing tools available.","A WSDL CED  can be made up of a plurality of sections. Examples of these sections will now be described for an example CED  used with reference to a structured electronic document which displays on a browser page  of a display  as shown in  in response to a request for weather information for Waterloo, Ontario.","A WSDL types section contains an XML Schema (XS) that defines relationships between data elements using complex types. Continuing with the weather example of , an example WSDL types section with XML schema relating various named data elements to a top level responseElement data element to define a data structure  (providing a data structure definition ) can include:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<wsdl:types>"},{"entry":"\u2003<xs:schema targetNamespace=\u201ctest.net.rim\u201d"},{"entry":"elementFormDefault=\u201cqualified\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<xs:element name=\u201cresponseElement\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<xs:complexType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002<xs:sequence>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cicon\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201ctemperature\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cconditions\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201ctemperatureUnits\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201clocation\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cshortTermDay\u201d maxOccurs=\u201cunbounded\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:complexType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:sequence>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cicon\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cconditions\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cday\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201ctime\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/xs:sequence>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002<\/xs:complexType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/xs:element>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002<\/xs:sequence>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/xs:complexType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<\/xs:element>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/xs:schema>"},{"entry":"\u2002<\/wsdl:types>."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Referring to , the data structure  responseElement defined in the XML schema includes a collection of elements, such as icon , temperature , conditions , temperatureUnits , and location , which correspond in  to the respective content elements , such as icon , temperature , conditions , temperatureUnits , and location .

Typically the program  executing the method will be used by a developer of an output structured electronic document to define paths that identify content elements  in an existing structured electronic document , such that the content of the content element  can be extracted from the existing structured electronic document  in the output structured electronic document, such as page  (see ); however, the program can be used to define paths to the content elements  to use for other purposes.","To compare the paths of two content elements , at , starting from the path root, for each step in the respective paths, determine if the element is the same. At , if any corresponding element in a step is not the same, comparison ceases as a pattern has failed to be recognized. At , for corresponding steps where the respective elements are the same, identify if indices match in the two paths. At , if so, the element is recognized at  one that can be represented as an array. Prior to pattern recognition at , at  structured electronic document  can be rendered to display device  and pattern recognition utilizing arrays is a method of identifying with a processer  a common characteristic between at least two content elements  in a structured electronic document . At least two separate indicators of content elements within the structured element document  can be received through input device . At  further content elements  in the structured document  that share the common characteristic can be identified for example by iterating through array indices in a path. Further content elements  that share the common characteristic can be highlighted of the display device  to a user.","In either case, processing is returned at  to  if there are more steps in the path.","When using the example path language described herein in further detail, a determination if the element is the same at  can be performed by determining if the element name and element ID are the same.","Where pattern recognition results in elements in the respective paths that can be represented as an array, the elements can be replaced in the paths by an array element.","For example, given the two paths:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/div[4]\/div[3]\/table\/tr[9]\/td[2]\/a\/href"]},{"entry":[{},"\/div[4]\/div[3]\/table\/tr[10]\/td[0]\/a\/href."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The resulting pattern will be identified as:","\/div[]\/div[]\/table\/tr[x]\/td[y]\/a\/href.","Hence, n-dimensional arrays can be identified for paths according to the above method, instructions and program . Such arrays can be identified from paths for two content elements . In the example above, a 2-dimensional array is identified, and any element with the matching path (having indices in place of x and y) can be identified by the path.","In use, paths specified using n-dimensional arrays can be utilized by one or more computer programs  executing on electronic device  to identify content elements  for example by iterating through the array indices based on a single path. This can provide a simple and efficient method to identify content elements  within a structured electronic document .","The paths can be used in, for example, a CED  for further use in identifying content elements  in a structured electronic document . CED  can be used by one or more computer programs  to identify content elements . For example, a path can be used in a structured electronic document that is a CED .","Further aspects of pattern recognition including receipt of at least two indications of content elements  within a rendered structured electronic document  are described herein with regard to an example tool embodiment.","Content elements  within structured electronic document  can be identified by paths that are similar to XPath paths, but with available markup language elements to define the path selected from a subset of markup language elements such that the path is less susceptible to changes in the structured electronic document . For example, it is possible to restrict the path to include only structural parents, i.e. the elements that define the structure of the document as opposed to its decoration. For example, in HTML, the <div> element defines structure, but the <b> element only defines element decoration. Ignoring non-structural elements in a path improves element identification immunity to changes in the structured electronic document.","An example method to restrict the path to include only structural elements for an HTML document  is to require the path nodes to be selected from a subset of HTML elements such as: head, div, span, form, table, thead, tfoot, tr, td, th, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5. In this case any other elements not included in the subset would be considered non-structural for the purpose of paths for elements within the structured electronic document. It is recognized that the above listed subset is not an exhaustive listing of all elements that might otherwise be considered structural. Other structural elements could be included in this subset if desired. For example, structured electronic documents in specific content areas, for example documents using Chemical Markup Language (CML), can have other markup language structural elements used on a regular basis. The above listed subset is considered to result in sufficiently unambiguous paths while resisting susceptibility to changes between structured electronic documents , for example between an instance of a structured language document  used to create the common expression  and the data structure definition , and an instance of a structured electronic document  to which the common expression  and data structure definition  are applied to extract content elements .","Paths can identify parent\/child relationships, element indices, element ids, and the whole or partial array of elements.","An example of a path containing a reduced subset of HTML elements for an href content element is:","\/div\/div[]\/div#short\/table\/tr[x]\/td\/a\/href, where:","\u2018\/\u2019 (forward slash) defines parent child relationship: parent\/child,","\u2018[ ]\u2019 (square brackets) defines element index for arrays:","element[index], and","\u2018# short\u2019 (number sign) defines element id: =\u201cshort\u201d is merely an example id and not an HTML element.","A variable in place of an index indicates that the whole array is identified (e.g. element[x]).","A polynomial in place of an index can indicate that a portion of the array is identified (e.g. element[2x]\u2014all elements with even index).","The last part of the path indicates what the path represents. If it is an attribute name, the path represents the value of that attribute; if it is the keyword \u2018text\u2019, the path represents the textual content of the element.","Further details of a possible path language for a subset of markup language elements are described in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0160"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Path Syntax","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["parent\/child","Indicates the element on the right of the \/ is"]},{"entry":[{},"nested within the element on the left (i.e., the"]},{"entry":[{},"element on the right is a child of the element on"]},{"entry":[{},"the left, which is the parent of the element on"]},{"entry":[{},"the right)."]},{"entry":["parent\/child#id","Indicates the child of the specified parent with"]},{"entry":[{},"the specified id (the string to the right of the #)."]},{"entry":["parent\/child[3]","Indicates the fourth* element encountered as a"]},{"entry":[{},"child of the specified parent.

For example, depending on which keyword is entered in an Amazon.com search, a different web page containing search results will be produced. Amazon is a trademark of Amazon.com, Inc. However, both search results page instances will correspond to the same structure. The structural resemblance assumption will usually hold because dynamic web content is usually produced by the same template (e.g. a template scripted in a scripting language such as JSP, Active Server Pages (ASP), and PHP).","Also, the above path language allows an index variable to be used to indicate a list of elements. In the example above, this is shown on the table row(tr) element, indicating that all table row (tr) elements of the parent table are to be included when the elements are fetched from the path.","While some content elements are independent; others can be combined into groups. Grouping can be incorporated into the data structure  to permit a node array element that includes elements that are themselves arrays. For example, a search of Amazon.com produces a structured electronic document  with a list of items. Each item has a title and price. The data structure  can include a data element  that is an array of complex types including title and price, rather than two parallel arrays.","Element grouping can be used for better organizing content when displaying it to a user.","Referring to , the tool displays to the user a screen shot  rendered version of the document  with content elements . For example, the document  can be rendered in a browser  window such that the document  will look similar to how the document  would ordinarily appear in a browser  window.","In order to select content elements  in the document , the tool receives a user indication from pointing device  when a cursor  is located over a content element  in the rendered document . To assist in visual selection, the tool can highlight a content element  at the pointing device before receiving an indication of the content element .","Selection ambiguity resolution can be utilized to identify a selected content element  based upon a selected visible content element . It is to be recognized, as with other aspects described herein, that selection ambiguity together with or separate from visible selection can be utilized separate from other aspects described herein to identify as selected content element . Selection ambiguity resolution can significantly assist users in working with structured language document content elements.","It is to be understood that various aspects of the tool can be embodied independently of other aspects, or utilized in embodiments other than the specific tool embodiment described herein.","Referring to , for example, an embodiment of the tool will be described that embodies a method to provide initial visual selection of content elements at , selection ambiguity resolution , associate a path of content element  with data element path , array pattern recognition , array path conversion and array path merger , and array grouping . Each of these aspects can be embodied independently of one another and of the tool, and each of these aspects may be used independently of one another.","Referring to , the tool stores gathered information in memory in a data structure , such as an object structure (for example, if the tool is a Firefox plug-in, the structure  would typically be based on JavaScript objects).","The tool keeps an OperationDefinition object  containing Element objects . Each Element object  points to two Path objects , one Path object  representing a data element path (elementPath ) within data structure  and a second Path object  representing a content element  path (htmlPath ) in document . Each Path object  contains PathPart objects  that make up the path. Each Element object  further specifies whether or not the object  represents an array element in array property , and the type of the element in a type property , and a defaultValue property  for the element.","Referring to , an example data structure  contains sample data for one OperationDefinition named Search with three Elements, Element, Element, Element.

Element has an elementPath, \u201ctemperature\u201d, and an htmlPath, \u201cidiv[]\/table\/tr[]\/td\/text\u201d. Element and Element are not arrays, while Element is an array.","Although the data structure  is described for one operation, the principles can be extended to multiple operations in which case there will be multiple OperationDefinition objects in the data structure in memory.","Referring to , many HTML nodes are invisible but still clickable on the rendered page. For example, a hyperlink content element  is not visible by itself; it covers other visible content elements  such as image or text. Where one element of content  surrounds another element of content , the elements of content  are coincident In order to resolve ambiguities between visible and invisible clickable elements, the tool at  by default initially recognizes the visible content elements  as the selected content elements . It is recognized that the tool could default to the invisible element if desired. The tool can receive instructions regarding the content element  being selected by the user to assist in resolving the ambiguity, such as for example whether the content element  is text, hyperlink, or image.","Referring to , for example, the tool can determine at  if there is an ambiguity with respect to a type of the content element  when the cursor  is positioned over the location of a rendered content element , and, if so, at  the tool can provide the user with the ability to access a right click menu  from which one of the possible content element  types may be selected. Once the type is selected, the tool at  seeks an associated content element  that meets the selected type. If at  an associated content element  is found then the tool at  recognizes a found content element  as the selected content element . If the tool cannot find an associated content element  then the tool fails to find an associated content element  and returns an error message at  to the user, for example through the display . For example, the error message could be a \u201cselected content element type not found\u201d.","In another example, non-content elements, for example structural elements such as, for example in HTML, tables \u201c<table>\u201d\/divs \u201c<div>\u201d\/rows \u201c<tr>\u201d\/columns \u201c<col>\u201d\/etc surrounding the desired content element  may not be visible, but they may be clicked if a cursor  is outside a clickable portion of a desired visible content element  when a user click is received content element. For example, a user may be attempting to select a text content element , but the cursor  is located outside the text content element , over a table row (tr) element containing the desired text content element .","Referring to , the tool assumes that a user is attempting to select content elements , such as for example text, hyperlink, or image. The tool at  examines the initially selected element to determine if it is one of the recognized types for a content element . If so, then the tool has resolved a non-content type ambiguity and the content element  is recognized at  as the selected content element . If not, then the tool at  seeks a recognized type of content element  that is associated with the selected element. If the tool at  finds a recognized type of content element  then, unless there is a further ambiguity at  in a content element  that is found, the tool at  recognizes a found content element  as the selected content element . If the tool cannot find an associated content element  at  then the tool fails to find an associated content element  and returns an error message at  to the user, for example through the display . For example, the error message could be \u201cAssociated content element not found.\u201d.

Typically a user will select elements that the user believes participate in a desired pattern. Element selection can be performed, for example, as described above by indication through a pointing device . For pattern recognition, the tool, for example, keeps a Pattern object  containing Element object  for content elements  to be considered in pattern recognition (sample elements) and resulting array element information.","A pattern can be determined by selecting two elements participating in the pattern. However, to potentially improve refinement of pattern recognition, the tool can allow choosing more than two elements for pattern recognition.","For each selected content element , a user holds a cursor over the element  and provides a key press, such as pressing a plus sign, \u201c+\u201d key on a keyboard  to indicate the selection of the element  for pattern recognition. Other key presses or indications could be used to indicate the selection of the element for pattern recognition. The \u201c+\u201d key press is received by the tool as a user indication that pattern recognition is desired for the selected element . Once the \u201c+\u201d key is pressed, the element  is highlighted to indicate that it is to be part of pattern recognition, and a corresponding Element object  for the selected element  is added to the Pattern object  as a sample element. A previously indicated content element  can be cancelled, for example, by receiving from the pointing device  an indication to cancel through a cancel indicator  such as cancel indicator .","Once two elements  have been chosen in the pattern, the tool shows a pop-up window  asking the user to enter a pattern name for the pattern in a textbox  (see ). The user enters the array name (optionally the user can enter element type and default value) and indicates acceptance of the user name for example by indicating \u201cOK\u201d on button .","With the selected elements the tool performs pattern recognition on the markup language paths (HTML paths in the examples used herein, although pattern recognition is not limited to HTML paths) associated with the Elements in Pattern object (elements selected for pattern recognition). Pattern recognition outputs a single markup language path for the selected elements containing variables in place of some indices (an array element path).","The tool can, for example, perform array pattern recognition and array path conversion in accordance with the following pseudocode:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0209"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Input: Set of HTML paths"},{"entry":"Output: A single HTML path containing variables or error"},{"entry":"\u20031.

CED  can be associated with one or more presentation templates , such that the content elements  retrieved from the document  can be put in a format for display by the electronic device  or the device . The templates  can be registered with the remote server  in a manner similar to the CED . Alternatively, if a presentation template  is not available, the content elements  can be sent as data structure , for example in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML format, to electronic device  or device .","It is to be recognized that a CED  can be associated with a presentation template  such that content extraction according to CED  can be used to initiate presentation generation according to template . For example, once the content elements  have been extracted then the CED  invokes a presentation tier  to perform presentation generation according to template . A CED  and presentation template  can be otherwise associated with one another. For example, the presentation template  can trigger content extraction according to CED , rather than pre-fetching content according to CED  and then initiating presentation generation.","A series of CEDs  and presentation templates  may be strung together to perform a sequence of operations on structured electronic documents; each CED  or template  calling the next, or being called under the control of a main CED  or template . For example, it may be required to enter information at a search request page prior to receiving search results. A CED  can be used for the search request page with a presentation template  to display the search request page. A further CED  can be used for the search result page. For interactions requiring multiple CEDs  without user input, multiple CEDs  can be initiated sequentially before a presentation template  provides information for transport to a user. Multiple operations can also be defined in a single CED, for example using multiple port types in a WSDL format. Other configurations of CED  and presentation templates  can be possible depending on the allowed methods of retrieving the document . For example, it may be possible to directly address the search result page in an URL to prompt the return of a results page in one step. An example presentation template  for the weather example discussed herein might include the following template, where {@elementPath} is replaced with a value for the specified element path for the data elements  in the data structure , and {*arrayPath}html{*arrayPath} repeats the specified HTML for each array element in the array specified by arrayPath:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0244","num":"0251"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00033","num":"00033"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<html><body>"},{"entry":"Weather for: <b>{@responseElement.location}<\/b>"},{"entry":"<br\/><br\/><br\/>"},{"entry":"<table>"},{"entry":"<tr>"},{"entry":"<td>"},{"entry":"<img src=\u201c{@responseElement.icon}\u201d\/><br\/><br\/>"},{"entry":"<\/td>"},{"entry":"<td>"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.conditions}"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.temperature}"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.temperatureUnits}"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.rain}"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.snow}"},{"entry":"<\/td>"},{"entry":"<\/table>"},{"entry":"<br\/>"},{"entry":"<table>"},{"entry":"{*responseElement.shortTermDay}"},{"entry":"<td>"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.shortTermDay.day}"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.shortTermDay.time}"},{"entry":"<\/td>"},{"entry":"<td>"},{"entry":"<img src=\u201c {@responseElement.shortTermDay.icon}\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"<\/td>"},{"entry":"<td width=\u201c20\u201d>&nbsp;<\/td>"},{"entry":"<td>"},{"entry":"{@responseElement.shortTermDay.conditions}{@responseElement.-"},{"entry":"shortTermDay.temperature}"},{"entry":"<\/td>"},{"entry":"<\/tr>"},{"entry":"{*responseElement.shortTermDay}"},{"entry":"<\/table>"},{"entry":"<\/body><\/html>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Such a template  would render an output structured electronic document  similar to that shown in  for the weather example described herein. One can see that the page  can be more compact and mobile browser screen friendly. It can also exclude elements of the structured electronic document  that might not be renderable by a mobile browser. Other formats of the output structured electronic document  are possible at the discretion of the designer. The benefits of the output structured electronic document  are not limited to presentation on mobile devices, and can extend to other platforms.","Referring again to , on a personal content delivery embodiment a user registers a content extraction document CED  with a remote server , such as a computer executing a computer program and accessible through a public or private network . The CED  defines a common expression for the remote server  to find a respective content element  within a structured electronic document . The structured electronic document  can, for example be located on a remote server  accessible through a public or private network . The remote server  associates the CED  with the user. The remote server  can use a variety of computer-based techniques to associate the CED  with the user. For example, the remote server  can associate the CED  with a user account that requires authentication, such as a password, from the user. The remote server  can associate the CED  with an address, for example an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), on remote server  that is known to the user. The remote server  can associate the CED  with a particular electronic device . The electronic device can be identified when the electronic device  communicates with the remote server  through the network . The electronic device  can be, for example a wireless handheld device , such as for example by a device serial number transmitted from the electronic device  to the remote server .","As the device  is an electronic device , it contains similar components, although in alternate configurations appropriate to a handheld format. Accordingly, similar reference numerals for the components of the device  will be used for the components of the device , for example, display device , input device , processor , keyboard , pointing device , and memory . For simplicity, the description of the components of the device  will not be repeated, nor will the components of the device  be independently identified in the FIGS.","The remote server  can utilize cookies that identify the electronic device  associated with the user. A combination of techniques to associate a user with the CED  can be used. Such techniques can be used sequentially, such that each step must be performed, or in parallel to allow alternative ways to associate the CED  with a user.","Data to determine the association of the CED  with the user when extracting content according to the CED  is stored on a computer readable medium, which is accessible to the remote server, such as memory or a disk drive.","Content element structured electronic document. The CED  can be created at an electronic device  executing a computer program . The computer program  can, for example, comprise a browser  with extension or plug-in  as discussed herein. It is recognized that the electronic device  can be a wireless device, though it is further recognized that a handheld wireless device can be limited in its speed and screen size among other resources, which can make it impractical for this purpose. Alternatively, other computer programs running on a computer can be provided for use in creating a CED . Computer program  for creating a CED  could be accessed remotely. For example, the wireless service provider could run a web-enabled application on a remote server for users to create a CED . For ease of use, a CED  may be created utilizing a desktop computer as the electronic device  with a display  (see ) of sufficient size for the work, and to avoid any wireless network charges.","Automated generation of a CED  can be implemented through a tool such as the tool described herein. Such automated generation can allow a CED  to be created without access to underlying coding technologies, for example structured definition languages such as HTML, XML, or WSDL. This makes it possible for users to create their own CEDs  for registration. It is also possible for developers to generate CEDs  in an automated manner. Although developers can have the knowledge necessary to manually create a CED  based upon the principles described herein, the use of a tool with automated generation capabilities can make the creation much more efficient.","Upon registration, the remote server  provisions the CED  on the network, such that the remote server  will initiate content extraction according to the CED  when the remote server  receives a request to process content according to the CED  associated with the user. As an example, the identifier could be a uniform resource locator (URL) pointing to a location in the remote server  that the remote server  associates with the CED . The identifier can also be the identifier for finding the original structured electronic document  (such as the URL of the document ), and the remote server  can be provisioned to initiate content extraction according to the CED  whenever the user uses the original URL. As a further alternative, if a remote server other than the remote server  is used, then the identifier could direct the electronic device  to the remote server. The identifier could, for example, be saved as a favorite by the user on the electronic device .","When the user wishes to view the content elements  from the structured electronic document  as defined in the CED , the user uses the identifier to initiate content extraction according to the CED  by the remote server . The remote server  accesses the CED , finds the content elements , and transmits them to the electronic device  in a form suitable for rendering to a display  (see ) for the user. Rendering may occur in a browser .","It is to be recognized that the computer for creating the CED , the electronic device for registering the CED  with the remote server , and the electronic device for viewing the content elements  need not be the same electronic device. (Each of these electronic devices is exemplified by the electronic device .) For example, the computer for creating the CED  can be a desktop computer. For example, the computer for registering the CED  could be either a desktop computer or a wireless handheld device. Requests to initiate content extraction can be made from the computer at which the user wishes to view the content elements . The remote server  can be set to recognize requests from the computer as a request from the user, provided the computer meets any authentication requirements, such as those discussed below.","The remote server  may be restricted to recognize requests from a particular electronic device  associated with the user's account, for example, a wireless handheld device . Similarly, transmissions in a form suitable for rendering to a display  could be restricted to a particular electronic device  associated with the user's account, for example, a wireless handheld device . For example, in the case of a wireless handheld device , device restrictions can be enforced based on a device identification number associated with a user account. A password, cookie or other authentication technique could be used where, for example, a device serial number is not available.","The CED  could be registered in many ways. If using a wireless handheld device , the CED  could be downloaded to the wireless handheld device  for uploading to the remote server . Alternatively, the CED  could remain on the remote server  associated with a user's account if created there by a user. Then a user could use a wireless handheld device  to register the CED  with the remote server , for example, by using a web interface or sending an email to the infrastructure .","After successful provisioning on the remote server  of CED , once the electronic device  or device  makes a request to initiate content processing according to CED , the remote server  obtains the content elements  defined in the CED  and transmits them to the electronic device  or the device  in a form suitable for rendering to a display  of the user.","The computer readable storage medium can be, for example, a random access memory, storage area network (SAN), magnetic disk drive (hard drive) or other computer-readable storage medium accessible to the remote server .","Further example details for creating and for using an example CED  for personalized content delivery have been previously set out. These details are being provided as examples only. Within the example description have been described other aspects and embodiments that have applicability beyond the creation and use of a CED . Within the example description have been described other aspects and embodiments that have applicability to personalized content delivery. It is to be understood that such other aspects and embodiments are included within the scope of the principles described herein, and not limited to the creation and use of a CED , or to personalized web delivery. Also, personalized web delivery could be carried out utilizing other forms of CED  created in another manner, or utilizing the techniques described herein other than with a CED .","In this description various aspects and embodiments of such aspects, have been described. For example, an aspect of an embodiment provides a method of outputting content of interest of a structured electronic document from a computer or distributed computer system having a processor and memory. The method includes loading a common expression and a data structure definition into memory, the common expression identifying a content element in a first structured electronic document, the data structure definition defined according to the common expression; creating in memory an instance of a data structure defined by the data structure definition; applying with the processor the common expression to a second structured electronic document to extract a content element from the second structured electronic document; storing the extracted content element in the instance of the data structure; and populating a template structured electronic document using the instance of the data structure to produce an output structured electronic document.","The method can include optimizing the output structured electronic document for delivery to a mobile electronic device. The second structured electronic document can be a result of a search performed using an input field associated with the common expression.","The common expression and data structure definition can be in a single file. The common expression is stored in a web services description language.","The method can include displaying the output structured electronic document on a display device. The display device can be part of a mobile electronic device to which the computer or distributed computer system is wirelessly connected.","In another example aspect an embodiment can provide a computer program product stored on a computer-readable medium. The computer program product includes instructions which when executed by computer or distributed computer system having a processor and memory cause the computer or distributed computer system to carry out loading a common expression and a data structure definition into memory, the common expression identifying a content element in a first structured electronic document, the data structure definition defined according to the common expression; creating in memory an instance of a data structure defined by the data structure definition; applying with the processor the common expression to a second structured electronic document to extract a content element from the second structured electronic document; storing the extracted content element in the instance of the data structure; and populating a template structured electronic document using the instance of the data structure to produce an output structured electronic document.","The instructions can be extensions of a browser forming part of the computer or distributed computer system for rendering structured electronic documents to a display device. The instructions can be instructions for a computer or distributed computer system that is a remote server, and the computer-readable medium is accessible to the remote server.","The remote server can be part of network infrastructure of a wireless network of mobile electronic devices.
