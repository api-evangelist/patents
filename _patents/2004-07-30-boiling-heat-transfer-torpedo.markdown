title: Boiling heat transfer torpedo
abstract: A system has a source of gas venting gas at a nose portion of the vehicle to create a gas/vapor cavity on the nose portion and an adjacent hull of the vehicle. A thermal engine propelling the vehicle through ambient water creates waste heat for heating the hull to raise the temperature of the gas/vapor cavity extending over it. A pump aft on the vehicle recirculates a portion of the gas/vapor cavity as recirculated gas to the nose portion. The velocity of the recirculated gas of the gas/vapor cavity is controlled by the pump to be virtually the same as the relative flow rate of the ambient water along an interface boundary between the gas/vapor cavity and the ambient water.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a system for increasing the performance of undersea vehicles. More particularly, this invention relates to a system for a torpedo that creates and maintains a vapor cavity to reduce drag and increase propulsion efficiency.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Undersea vehicles, such as torpedoes, are restricted in speed and range by the size of their power plants and amount of fuel they carry. Another significant factor limiting performance is the amount of drag created as the torpedoes go through water to their targets. Considerable research by designers of torpedoes to reduce drag is ongoing, but acceptable results are still being sought.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art a system to create and maintain a vapor cavity on the hull of an underwater torpedo to reduce drag and thereby increase system efficiency.","The first object of the invention is to provide a system for reducing drag and increasing propulsion efficiency of an undersea vehicle, such as a torpedo.","Another object is to provide a system for reducing drag and increasing propulsion efficiency of a torpedo with a gas\/vapor cavity created and maintained during a torpedo run.","Another object is to provide a system for reducing drag and increasing propulsion efficiency on a torpedo using ventilation gas, gas recycling, and waste heat from a propulsion engine to create and maintain a controllable, stable gas\/vapor cavity.","Another object is to provide a system for a torpedo that stores waste heat on-board a torpedo to sustain a stable gas\/vapor cavity around the hull.","Another object is to provide a system for reducing drag and increasing propulsion efficiency on a torpedo using supercavitation to control surface thermal properties.","Another object is to provide a system for reducing drag, increasing propulsion efficiency, and isolating a sonar array from self-generated noise of the torpedo.","Another object is to provide a system for reducing drag and increasing propulsion efficiency on a torpedo and having the ability to cycle between low speed and high-speed vapor cavity operation during a single torpedo run.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is a system to create and maintain a gas vapor cavity on the surface of an undersea vehicle, such as a torpedo. A source of gas vents gas at a nose portion of the torpedo. The vented gas creates a gas\/vapor cavity enveloping the nose portion and an adjacent outer hull of the torpedo. A thermal engine propels the torpedo through ambient water and creates waste heat as a by-product. The engine is disposed with respect to the outer hull of the torpedo for heating the outer hull with the waste heat to raise the temperature of the gas\/vapor cavity extending over the outer hull. A pump aft on the torpedo recirculates a portion of the gas\/vapor cavity as recirculated gas to the nose portion from the aft portion. The velocity is controlled by the pump to be virtually the same as the relative flow rate of the ambient water about the torpedo. The controlled velocity of the recirculated gas maintains the stability of the gas\/vapor cavity along an interface boundary between the gas\/vapor cavity and the ambient water. A cavitator plate is located on the torpedo forward of the gas venting source and a conical deflector is located behind the cavitator plate and forward of the gas venting source for radially deflecting the vented gas to assure that the gas\/vapor cavity covers the nose portion and the outer hull.","Referring to  of the drawings, a torpedo  has an internal thermal engine or motor  connected by a shaft  to one or more propellers  to propel torpedo  through ambient water  to a distant target. Engine  can be any of many well known proven designs that creates sufficient power to rotate interconnected propellers  for propulsive thrust and generates considerable amounts of waste heat as a by-product of operation. Engine  could also be a rocket or jet engine that produces significant waste heat. This waste heat is effectively coupled by heat transfer-ventilation system of the invention to an outer surface  of hull  of torpedo  to help create a cavity  to reduce drag between torpedo  and ambient water .","Referring also to , hull  can be made of layers A, B, of high heat capacity liquid or metal that are sandwiched within matrix layers C, D of highly conductive material. Hull  has an insulating layer E for thermal shielding of structural support elements and other components (schematically generally designated as A inside of hull  of torpedo ).","In accordance with this invention, heat is added to surface  (such as by conduction, convection, and\/or radiation of waste heat from engine  to hull surface  via layers A, B, C, and D). The temperature of surface  rises causing a normal sequence of natural convection and then sub-cooled boiling. The term sub-cooled boiling is meant to include the transition from the liquid state of water  at 100\u00b0 C. along surface  to the gaseous state of water (steam) at 100\u00b0 C. along surface . Since significant amounts of energy are needed to effect this transition for a given amount of water along surface , the heat transfer coefficient at surface  can increase dramatically as surface  experiences pool boiling. This increase in heat transfer coefficient makes it increasingly difficult to raise the temperature of water  at surface  sufficiently for pool boiling over the entire surface  since inordinate amounts of heat must be introduced to surface .","At some point, however, the boiling on surface  by waste heat from engine  can be made intense enough to produce large amounts of bubbles at surface . The layer of bubbles causes a decrease in the effective transfer of heat to ambient water , and the temperature at surface  then rises rapidly. This rise in temperature continues until surface  is entirely covered with a blanket of vaporized steam in cavity . From this point of time on, relatively low amounts of heat from engine  are needed to maintain gas\/vapor cavity .","Even at significant depth, less than half of the waste heat typically produced by a conventional open cycle torpedo engine is sufficient to maintain gas\/vapor in cavity . Having gas\/vapor cavity  in place on surface  virtually eliminates frictional drag over torpedo  (or other underwater vehicle surfaces) as torpedo  is propelled forward through water . Consequently, drag is greatly decreased and\/or pressure fluctuations associated with self-noise are eliminated.","In accordance with this invention, two major technical hurdles have been identified and overcome by heat transfer-ventilation system  of the invention to create and maintain gas\/vapor in cavity . The first major technical hurdle overcome by system  was providing sufficient energy to transition portions of ambient water  from the liquid state at 100\u00b0 C. along surface  to the gaseous state (steam) at 100\u00b0 C. as gas\/vapor cavity  along surface , and then maintaining the stability of gas\/vapor cavity  on surface  of hull  in terms of thickness and temperature at different pressures. While there is sufficient waste heat to sustain gas\/vapor cavity  of boiling water (steam) on surface  of hull of typical torpedo , there is not sufficient waste heat to reliably create gas\/vapor cavity  since the amount of waste heat required to nucleate boiling from liquid water to gaseous steam of gas\/vapor cavity  requires about an order of magnitude increase in waste heat that may not be attainable by engine  alone. In other words, it was found that the size of engine  might need to be increased to a prohibitive size for torpedo- to produce this amount of heat.","This problem is overcome by the supplementary ventilation system which keeps the heat transfer of surface  of hull  relatively low while it is heated to a temperature sufficient to maintain boiling within gas\/vapor cavity . System provides the desired supplementary heat ventilation at a nose portion  forward of and adjacent to surface  of hull  of torpedo  and stabilizes gas\/vapor cavity  by recirculating an aft portion of gas\/vapor cavity , as described below. The rate of recirculation of gas\/vapor cavity  is tuned to match the apparent speed of ambient water  as torpedo  makes its run through it. By matching the velocity of the recirculating gas\/vapor cavity  to the velocity of ambient water  along a cavity interface boundary , cavity  will be stable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","10","8","22","16","10","17","17","28","10","28","33"]},"Referring additionally to , at low speed operation of torpedo , cavitator  would at best create only small, unstable cavities A that might only flutter in and out of existence behind cavitator  and in front of sonar array  at nose portion  of torpedo . In addition, at low speed operation other speculatively shown cavities B might be formed by cavitator  but these are likely to be so unstable or poorly defined as to be virtually nonexistent along hull  of torpedo . At low speeds, system  is not activated and torpedo  performs very much like a conventional torpedo during low speeds and does not produce cavities in front of sonar array ; however, it may have increased sonar and homing capabilities.","Referring also to , at higher speeds, however, the dome shape of cavitator , venting of ventilation gas (as shown by arrows ) from a source of ventilation gas , and other gas recirculation of system  to be described, cause torpedo  to be fully enveloped in a gas\/vapor cavity . Gas\/vapor cavity  extends radially outwardly from cavitator  and behind it over nose portion  and along outer surface  of hull .","Ventilation gas source  can include compressed gas cylinders, gas and\/or steams generators, or other suitable source of readily available volumes of ventilation gas  for helping cavitator  create gas cavity . Small amounts of ventilation gas  can be selectably vented through an opening  that extends from gas source  through sonar array  in nose portion . A conical deflector  is mounted on support member  forward of sonar array  and gas source  and behind cavitator  to deflect the vented amounts of ventilation gas  and to minimize oscillations in a forward portion C of cavity  that is created behind cavitator  and in front of sonar array . Deflector  also deflects vented gas  radially outwardly to cover surface  along hull  with gas\/vapor cavity .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["32","34","10","33","22","32","33","33","22","34","10","33","32","33","36","26","26","16","22","22","26","33","22","22","18","28","16","33","33","36","18","14","15","22","33","27","26","22","23","10"]},"In addition to pumped, drawn-in gas A from cavity , some excess gas D can leak from cavity  at aft end  of torpedo ; however, gas leakage D associated with system  is much less than that for other known supercavitating vehicles. This lesser amount of leakage D of system  is not a concern for torpedo runs of typical duration and range. The important considerations which are met by system  are that gas\/vapor cavity  has a nearly uniform thickness  and velocity surrounding hull . The speed of pump  will impact the total mass flow and hence velocity of recirculated drawn-in gas within cavity . The speed of pump  is controlled by control unit  to assure that the velocity of recirculated gas B gas within cavity  nearly matches or is virtually is the same as the forward speed of the vehicle, but in the opposite direction. By selectively matching the velocities across interface boundary , gas\/vapor cavity  will be stable for different forward speeds. This greatly enhances the stability of the interface boundary . The stable, fast moving gas\/vapor along hull  and recirculated through duct  greatly reduces friction between hull  and ambient water  to enhance performance in terms of speed and range of torpedo .","In addition, system  can provide for minimization of loss of waste heat of torpedo  to further assure that gas\/vapor cavity  can be continuously maintained over outer surface  of hull . A continuous heat shield or heat sink  is placed around engine . Heat shield-sink  collects and stores engine waste heat of engine  transfers it to hull  of torpedo  along the abutting juncture of high heat capacity layer A of hull  where layer A contacts heat shield-sink , see .","An independent auxiliary heating unit  additionally also can be located at a convenient position forward in torpedo  and next to hull . Auxiliary heating unit  will further assure an adequate supply of sufficient heat is transferred to maintain gas\/vapor cavity . Heating unit  can be placed adjacent high heat capacity layer B of hull  and can combust a self-contained oxygenated fuel supply or could create additional heat in coils from an onboard electrical power source, for examples.","A computerized control unit  can be connected via leads  to pump , gas source , engine , independent auxiliary heating unit , as well as other control surfaces (not shown to avoid unnecessary complication). Control unit  also can be connected by leads A to temperature\/pressure\/thickness monitors  located at several different places in cavity , (only two monitors  are schematically depicted). Monitors  are provided to indicate whether cavity  is at the right temperature, pressure, and thickness to maintain cavity  for different speeds and depths of torpedo . Control unit  is connected to pump  to draw-in and recirculate greater or lesser amounts of recirculated gas\/vapor B of cavity  in response to monitor . Control unit  is connected to gas source  to deliver appropriate, predetermined amounts or flow of gas  to cavity  at predetermined times in response to monitors . Control unit  can activate independent auxiliary heating unit  when more heat is needed to sustain cavity  in response to monitors . Control unit  also can be responsive to remotely originating acoustic or other control signals  to selectively activate these and\/or other interconnected components as needed to successfully complete a mission.","In operation outer surface  of hull  of torpedo  would operate near ambient temperature of ambient water  as a result of forced convection along outer surface . At a desired time control unit  initiates ventilation gas source  to vent gas  through opening  behind conical deflector  and cavitator  to envelop torpedo  in an envelope of gas . As contact between liquid ambient water  and outer surface  of hull  is interrupted, the temperature within the gas envelop of cavity  on surface  rises rapidly since waste heat from engine  is being conducted through layers A, B, C and D. Meanwhile, internal components of torpedo  are shielded from the high temperature of the waste heat by insulating layer E.","When a desired heat flux rate is being transmitted from engine  to hull  via heat shield-sink , the amount of heat flowing into shell  allows heat to flow outward and forward along hull . When sufficient heat is produced by engine  alone, the use of auxiliary heating unit  would be curtailed, but if more heat were needed, then auxiliary heating unit  could be activated.","After the desired heat flux and temperature is created along surface  of hull  by engine  and heat shield-sink  and possibly auxiliary heating unit , the flow of gas  from ventilation gas source  can be shut off and cavity  will be self-sustaining. Thus, it is seen that ventilation gas  of ventilation gas source  was used to initiate cavity , and only relatively small amounts of ventilation gas  are required. In addition, system  of the invention is able to initiate and maintain gas\/vapor cavity  without expending the excessive (and nearly overwhelming) amounts of heat energy otherwise needed to nucleate boiling from liquid water to gaseous vapor within cavity .","Heat transfer-ventilation system  of the invention provides for decreased drag and results in increased range and speed. System  permits the use of supercavitation at deep depths and can operate over multiple speed ranges during a single run to provide increased lethality of onboard ordnance. System  decreases the level of self-generated noise and hence increases the performance of the vehicle's sonar arrays.","Heat transfer-ventilation system  has the ability to create gas\/vapor cavity  over an underwater vehicle, such as torpedo , and the ability to store large amounts of waste heat onboard torpedo  so that gas\/vapor cavity can be efficiently and quickly created with a minimum amount of ventilation gas  during a torpedo run. System  has means to affect and control the stability of vapor cavity  at variable speeds. Heat transfer-ventilation system  can use supercavitation to control thermal properties of surface  of torpedo  and can cycle between gas\/vapor cavities  that are recirculated at different speeds for low speed and high speed operation during a single torpedo run.","It is understood that heat transfer-ventilation system  could be made in accordance with this invention in different sizes and configurations for different undersea vehicles without departing from the scope of the invention herein described. System  having a means to create gas\/vapor cavity  and then heating a surface to maintain cavity  could be adapted to any underwater and\/or surface platform. Heat transfer-ventilation system  could be operated over a range of surface temperatures with or without waste heat from engine  and could be used with or without auxiliary heat source . System  could be used on a conventional, rocket or electric powered torpedo and could be operated with or with the recirculation of gas via pump . The design of heat transfer-ventilation system  in association with the shell and\/or torpedo homing system of torpedo  as disclosed is not the only way, nor is the length and position of vapor cavity  on torpedo  the only configuration. Having this disclosure in mind, selection of suitable components from among many proven contemporary designs and compactly interfacing them as disclosed herein can be readily done without requiring anything beyond ordinary skill.","The components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention.
