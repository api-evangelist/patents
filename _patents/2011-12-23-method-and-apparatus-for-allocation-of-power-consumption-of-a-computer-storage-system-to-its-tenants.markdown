No. 13\/076,747 entitled \u201cENERGY-AWARE VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE\u201d filed on Mar. 31, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document may contain command formats and other computer language listings, all of which are subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","This application relates to monitoring energy consumption in a computer network.","Energy efficiency has recently taken on a great deal of importance in Information Technology. Two major issues have driven this switch: (1) the cost of electricity and (2) concern for the environment.","Example embodiments of the present invention provide a method, an apparatus, and a computer program product for determining power consumption of a computer storage system attributable to an application. The method includes obtaining metadata relating to power consumption of a computer storage system and obtaining metadata relating to storage configuration of the computer storage system. Storage utilization of the computer system attributable to an application is then determined and a transformation is performed according to the metadata relating to power consumption of the computer storage system, the metadata relating to storage configuration of the computer storage system, and the storage utilization of the computer storage system attributable to the application.","As organizations migrate to virtualized Information Technology (IT) infrastructures, many have found that it is no longer necessary to own, operate, and maintain a dizzying array of servers and switches to run their businesses. Instead, it is more cost-efficient to outsource operations to a service provider. The provider can gain major economies of scale by consolidating the IT operations of many organizations into a single data center.","Sharing infrastructure resources saves on equipment costs. For example, a cloud service provider runs and maintains applications and charges the owner of the application a fee. Such a multi-tenant architecture allows applications from different organizations to use the same hardware simultaneously. Similarly, fewer IT managers are required to maintain the same quality of service. In addition, this architecture results in less equipment in use and therefore less power consumed. Given these dimensions of savings, service providers must be able to allocate the costs of their physical plant, equipment, and labor and charge them back to the user. These so-called \u201ccharge-back\u201d mechanisms measure and bill for labor and equipment. However, traditional charge-back mechanisms do not capture power utilization.","In order to make cloud computing an attractive business proposition, one generally adopts a multi-tenant model. That is, several applications potentially tied to several different owners all running on the same physical machine. Costs could be allocated either by usage or by available space. However, customers are not willing to pay for capacity provided by the host but not used. Rather, accurate charge-back is necessary, including power, which is becoming the largest line item cost for running a data center.","Computing the power consumed by a virtualized application enables computation of a monetary value relating power consumption to power generation and transmission. This monetary value then may be reported to a charge-back accounting system for assessment to the application owner. Moreover, this data may be provided directly to users, administrators, auditors, or other consumers of such data for presentation in reports or a real-time \u201cdashboard\u201d display.","Additionally, VMs may be migrated to physical machines where power, optionally including the associated carbon-emissions cost, is cheapest. Such \u201cspace-shifting\u201d of VMs allows minimization of the total costs (power and otherwise) of running an application.","Example embodiments of the present invention enable extending these traditional charge-back mechanisms by measuring, managing and assigning the value of power consumed by an application in a virtual machine (VM). This method allocates power consumption to tenants based on data stored and data accessed. The rationale is that reading and writing data requires power consumption (e.g., for activating and potentially moving the arm of storage drives and overcoming preexisting magnetic field alignment) beyond that required to store and preserve the data at rest. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the power consumption charged to a tenant may be the sum of the amount of power consumption attributable to the physical blocks backing the tenant's logical storage container plus the amount of power consumption attributable to accessing the tenant's logical storage container.","Example embodiments of the present invention determine the power metadata associated with storing data in a computer storage system, allocate the power consumption associated with storing data in a set of blocks, determine the power metadata associated with accessing (e.g., reading and writing) data in the computer storage system, and allocate the power consumption associated with accessing data in the set of blocks. Determining and allocating power consumption to the tenants using a set of blocks can be applied repeatedly. Thus, the power consumption attributed to a logical storage container at any level can be determined at successively lower levels until it is applied to the storage blocks of the underlying computer storage system.","It should be understood that example embodiments of the present invention apply equally to physical data centers and physical machines as well as to virtual data centers and virtual machines. Tenants may be in geographically dispersed locations, meaning that multiple companies, for example, could be running applications in physical or virtual machines all using storage provided by the same cloud storage provider.","Mapping Physical Storage to Logical Storage",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["105","120","1","120","2","120","3","120","130","1","130","2","130","3","130","150","1","150","2","150","3","150","130","145","130","140","150","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["250","1","250","2","250","3","250","230","1","230","2","230","3","230","120","105"]},"As illustrated in , the physical storage  may be divided into sets of blocks (e.g., the high capacity storage - has six blocks, the high performance storage - has three blocks, and the solid state storage - has one block). A portion of each of each respective set of blocks may be provisioned (e.g., thick or thin provisioning) and mapped to the logical storage containers. Metadata regarding the network configuration or topology may include metadata regarding how logical units (LUNs) are configured (e.g., thin v. thick provisioning) and how much storage in thin provisioning is actually being used.","There may be multiple levels of logical mapping, including intermediate logical datastores -, -.","Thus, as illustrated in , five of the six blocks of physical high capacity storage - are logically mapped to four blocks of intermediate logical storage at logical datastore 1 -. Of the four logical blocks of intermediate logical datastore 1 -, two blocks of logical datastore 1 - are shared via a second layer of logical mapping to two blocks of logical storage 1 - for tenant 1 (e.g., tenant 1 - of ) and two blocks of logical storage 2 - for tenant 2 (e.g., tenant 2 - of ).","Further, two of the three blocks of physical high performance storage - are logically mapped to two blocks of intermediate logical storage at logical datastore 2 -. The two logical blocks of intermediate logical datastore 2 - are logically mapped together with the two blocks of logical datastore 1 - referred to above to form the four blocks of logical storage 2 - for tenant 2 (e.g., tenant 2 - of ).","Moreover, the remaining one of the three blocks of physical high performance storage - is logically mapped with the one block of physical solid state storage - to the two blocks of logical storage 3 - for tenant 3 (e.g., tenant 3 - of ). Thus, multiple levels of logical mapping, and combinations of tiers of physical storage, may be used in mapping the physical storage  to the logical storage  for the tenants .","Determine the Power Metadata Associated with Storing Data in a Computer Storage System","Power metadata for each managed block using measurements or modeled values may be determined during a \u201ccalibration period\u201d. Real-time power measurement also may be used via meters or other power measurement mechanisms, such as application programming interfaces (APIs), available for each storage block (e.g., power usage reporting capabilities are provided in various storage arrays).","The average power consumption of a computer storage system may be determined over a representative time period by measuring or modeling values for these categories:\n\n","Power consumption for stored data may be by measured by determining the total power consumption of a storage system in a \u201cready idle\u201d mode, in which the storage devices are powered up but there are no active I\/Os being processed, and prorating the power consumption according to the number of blocks or the relative power consumption of each storage technology employed. First, the average power consumption of each storage technology used in the system may be determined over a representative time period by measuring or modeling values for the average power consumed by the components of each storage technology and the raw capacity provided by the components of each storage technology. Next, the average power consumption may be prorated over representative time periods across the storage capacity of the system, weighted by the total number of blocks for amortized-power components and weighted by the relative power consumption of each storage technology used for managed- and episodic-power components. Each addressable block or set of blocks of \u201craw capacity\u201d can be allocated a number of watts in this manner.","Consider these calibration values (measured or modeled) for a computer storage system. In this example, amortized power is prorated across 100 blocks equally, managed power is prorated across 10 solid state and 30 high performance blocks according to the relative power consumption of each technology, and episodic power is allocated across the 60 high capacity blocks:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Amortized-power","100W"]},{"entry":[{},"Managed-power","50W, Solid State and High Performance"]},{"entry":[{},"Episodic-power","20W, High Capacity"]},{"entry":[{},"Solid State","2W for 10 blocks"]},{"entry":[{},"High Performance","7W for 30 blocks"]},{"entry":[{},"High Capacity","1W for 60 blocks"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Power metadata for the blocks of the computer storage system is determined as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Amortized","100W \/ (10 + 30 + ","1W per storage "]},{"entry":[{},{},"60) blocks","system block"]},{"entry":[{},"Managed","50W * (2W \/ (2W + ","1.1W per solid "]},{"entry":[{},{},"7W) \/ 10 blocks","state block"]},{"entry":[{},"Managed","50W * (7W \/ (2W + ","1.3W per high "]},{"entry":[{},{},"7W) \/ 30 blocks","performance block"]},{"entry":[{},"Episodic","20W * (1W \/ 1W) \/ ","0.3W per high "]},{"entry":[{},{},"60 blocks","capacity block"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The sum of amortized and either managed or episodic power (whichever applies) for a set of blocks is the power consumption allocated for storing data in those blocks. This value is referred to as the \u201cstore\u201d power metadata for a set of blocks.","Allocate the Power Associated with Storing Data in a Set of Blocks","A logical storage container  is a set of logical blocks which a manager  provides to its tenants . The set of physical blocks  which the manager  uses to actually store the data are referred to as the underlying blocks. Managers  that provide enhanced protection (e.g., RAID) use more underlying blocks  than are presented to the tenant in the logical storage container . Managers  that provide capacity optimization (e.g., data deduplication, thin provisioning, delta snapshots) use fewer underlying blocks  than are presented to the tenant in the logical storage container .","The \u201cstore\u201d power metadata is allocated according to the mapping between the blocks exposed to a tenant (i.e., a logical storage container ) and the underlying physical blocks  backing the logical storage container . If N tenants share a set of underlying physical blocks , 1\/N of the \u201cstore\u201d power metadata for these blocks  will be attributed to each tenant. If a set of blocks is not allocated to any tenant, the power consumption of these blocks is attributed to the block manager  (the \u201clandlord\u201d) as overhead. As will be illustrated below with reference to , \u201cgreedy landlords\u201d may further assign overhead to their tenants , such as by prorating it according to the percent of power already attributed to each tenant . Similarly, if N>M blocks are used to back the M blocks presented to the tenant (e.g., to improve media protection), the power metadata of all of the N underlying blocks will be attributed to the tenant. In summary, the power metadata of the blocks backing the blocks of a logical storage container will be prorated according to the mapping maintained by each block manager for its tenants.","Determine the Power Metadata Associated with Accessing Data in a Computer Storage System","Allocation of power consumption for accessed (i.e., read or written) data may be accomplished by determining the total power consumption of a storage system in \u201cactive\u201d mode and prorating it over the blocks of that storage technology. Note that deleting data may consist of writing metadata blocks and optionally writing data blocks (e.g., secure erasure).","Accordingly, to determine the power metadata associated with accessing data, the average power consumption of a computer storage system performing I\/O to a specific storage technology over a representative time period may be determined. Separate measurements for power and I\/O operations per second (or modeled values) may be made for each storage technology employed.","For each storage technology, the average power consumed per I\/O may be calculated. Each addressable block or set of blocks of \u201craw capacity\u201d may be allocated a number of watts per I\/O in this manner. This value is referred to as the \u201caccess\u201d power metadata for blocks composed of a particular storage technology.","Consider these calibration values (e.g., measured or modeled) for accessing data in a computer storage system containing three storage technologies:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Solid State","2W for 100 reads and 5 writes"]},{"entry":[{},"High Performance","30W for 100 reads and 100 writes"]},{"entry":[{},"High Capacity","20W for 30 reads and 200 writes"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The \u201caccess\u201d power metadata for the blocks within this computer storage system is determined as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Access (Solid State)","2W \/ (100 + 5) I\/Os","0.019W per I\/O"]},{"entry":["Access (High ","30W \/ (100 + 100) I\/Os","0.150W per I\/O"]},{"entry":["Performance)",{},{}]},{"entry":["Access (High Capacity)","20W \/ (30 + 200) I\/Os","0.087W per I\/O"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The power consumption associated with accessing a logical storage container is attributed to the tenant owning the accessed logical storage container.

Whether the underlying blocks are shared by other tenants is not a factor in the allocation. It should be understood that storage arrays (e.g., physical and virtual) provide visibility into the number of reads and writes to a set of blocks and the identity of the tenant that owns the accessed blocks.","Using Metadata to Allocate Power Consumption to a Tenant","The power consumption attributed to a set of blocks is the summation of the power consumption of the blocks backing them, whether physical or logical. Power consumption associated with storing data in a set of blocks is prorated to the tenants sharing the underlying blocks. Power consumption associated with I\/O activity is allocated to the tenant owning the accessed blocks. The deep (i.e., multiple levels) mapping between the logical storage container assigned to a tenant and the physical storage blocks backing this container is reflected in the repeated allocation of power associated with storing data in a set of blocks. Allocating power consumption is based upon power metadata which is determined during a representative \u201ccalibration\u201d time period, as discussed above. Tenant allocations may be adjusted to equal the total power consumption measured over a time period by multiplying each allocation by the ratio of total measured power consumption to total allocated power consumption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"From the perspective of the physical storage blocks (e.g., physical storage  of ) and the power metadata, the high capacity storage - having a store metadata value of 21 watts (W) per block and an access metadata value of 0.087 W per I\/O.
