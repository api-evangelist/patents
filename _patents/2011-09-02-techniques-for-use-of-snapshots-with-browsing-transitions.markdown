title: Techniques for use of snapshots with browsing transitions
abstract: A snapshot of a page is stored in response to navigation away from the page. When the user navigates back to the page, the snapshot is displayed while the page is loaded. When the page is sufficiently loaded, the snapshot is replaced by the (fully or partially) loaded page. Determining whether the page is sufficiently loaded is based on monitoring of pre-selected criteria.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This U.S. patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/493,485, entitled, \u201cTechniques For Use of Snapshots With Browsing Transitions\u201d filed Jun. 5, 2011.","Embodiments of the invention relate to graphical representations of pages of data, for example, in a browser application. More particularly, embodiments of the invention relate to use of snapshot images to facilitate transitions between pages.","Browser applications are commonly used to access pages of information over a network. When transitioning between pages, browsers present a new page in response to certain conditions, for example, when a first non-empty layout is generated or when all object in the page have been loaded. These conditions may result in slow loading or in a user experiencing a partially-loaded page.","A snapshot of a page is stored in response to navigation away from the page. The navigation away from the page may be in response to user input that may be, for example, a swipe gesture, clicking of a button, tapping a control pad, selecting a link, or any other navigation technique. When the user navigates back to the page, the snapshot is displayed while the page is loaded. The navigation back to the page may be in response to user input that may be, for example, a swipe gesture, clicking of a button, tapping a control pad, selecting a link, or any other navigation technique. When the page is sufficiently loaded, the snapshot is replaced by the (fully or partially) loaded page. In one embodiment, determining whether the page is sufficiently loaded is based on monitoring of pre-selected criteria. The pre-selected criteria can be one or more of: page complexity, page loading status, render tree size, DOM tree characteristics, outstanding network requests, and\/or user input.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.","When a user of an electronic device (e.g., computer system, tablet device, smartphone, kiosk) utilizes a browser to access information presented as a page the user is provided the best experience when pages switch quickly and completely. As discussed above, under certain conditions a user may be provided with a less than optimal experience. Described herein are techniques to improve the user experience when switching between pages using a browser or other application to view content presented as pages.","In one embodiment, when a user navigates away from a page, a snapshot of that page is stored and may be used if a user navigates back to the page. When the user navigates back to a previously viewed page, the browser may present the stored snapshot of the page until the page can be loaded sufficiently to provide the user with a satisfactory experience.","Various characteristics may be monitored to determine when to provide the page instead of the previously captured snapshot. For example, the complexity of the remaining content to be rendered may be monitored, the size of a DOM tree or render tree may be evaluated, a number of outstanding network requests may be monitored. Other characteristics and parameters may also be monitored.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Electronic system  includes bus  or other communication device to communicate information, and processor  coupled to bus  that may process information. While electronic system  is illustrated with a single processor, electronic system  may include multiple processors and\/or co-processors. Electronic system  further may include random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device  (referred to as main memory), coupled to bus  and may store information and instructions that may be executed by processor . Main memory  may also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor .","Electronic system  may also include read only memory (ROM) and\/or other static storage device  coupled to bus  that may store static information and instructions for processor . Data storage device  may be coupled to bus  to store information and instructions. Data storage device  such as a magnetic disk or optical disc and corresponding drive may be coupled to electronic system .","Instructions are provided to memory from a storage device, such as magnetic disk, a read-only memory (ROM) integrated circuit, CD-ROM, DVD, via a remote connection (e.g., over a network via network interface ) that is either wired or wireless providing access to one or more electronically-accessible media, etc. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, execution of sequences of instructions is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software instructions.","A computer-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides content (e.g., computer executable instructions) in a form readable by an electronic device (e.g., a computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone). For example, a computer-readable medium may include read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; etc.","Electronic system  may also be coupled via bus  to display device , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD), to display information to a user. Alphanumeric input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, may be coupled to bus  to communicate information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys to communicate direction information and command selections to processor  and to control cursor movement on display .","Electronic system  further may include network interface(s)  to provide access to a network, such as a local area network. Network interface(s)  may include, for example, a wireless network interface having antenna , which may represent one or more antenna(e). Network interface(s)  may also include, for example, a wired network interface to communicate with remote devices via network cable , which may be, for example, an Ethernet cable, a coaxial cable, a fiber optic cable, a serial cable, or a parallel cable.","In one embodiment, network interface(s)  may provide access to a local area network, for example, by conforming to IEEE 802.11b and\/or IEEE 802.11g standards, and\/or the wireless network interface may provide access to a personal area network, for example, by conforming to Bluetooth standards. Other wireless network interfaces and\/or protocols can also be supported.","IEEE 802.11b corresponds to IEEE Std. 802.11b-1999 entitled \u201cLocal and Metropolitan Area Networks, Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications: Higher-Speed Physical Layer Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band,\u201d approved Sep. 16, 1999 as well as related documents. IEEE 802.11g corresponds to IEEE Std. 802.11g-2003 entitled \u201cLocal and Metropolitan Area Networks, Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, Amendment 4: Further Higher Rate Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band,\u201d approved Jun. 27, 2003 as well as related documents. Bluetooth protocols are described in \u201cSpecification of the Bluetooth System: Core, Version 1.1,\u201d published Feb. 22, 2001 by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, Inc. Associated as well as previous or subsequent versions of the Bluetooth standard may also be supported.","In addition to, or instead of, communication via wireless LAN standards, network interface(s)  may provide wireless communications using, for example, Time Division, Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocols, Code Division, Multiple Access (CDMA) protocols, and\/or any other type of wireless communications protocol.","The navigation transitions described herein may be provided in response to any type of user input that may be provided to navigate between pages. One common navigation technique is the use of forward and back buttons on a browser application. Another common navigation technique is use of links on a graphical user interface or keyboard buttons on a computer keyboard.","In one embodiment, navigation may be in response to gesture inputs by a user. These gestures may include, for example, a swiping motion on an input pad, or a movement in a particular direction. Further, navigation may be accomplished by non-tactile inputs, for example, a computing device may monitor user motions and provide corresponding navigation. Other input techniques may also be utilized with the transition mechanisms described herein.","Described below are various techniques for providing transitions between pages viewed in a browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","207","207"]},"Content retrieval\/processing module  may retrieve a document or content from a network via a network interface  (e.g. from a remote web server) or a file system locally or remotely coupled via file system interface . In one embodiment, the content received may be a hypertext based document encoded in languages such as HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), XML (Extensible Markup Language), or other markup languages, etc.","Content retrieval\/processing module  can process (e.g. parse) a document to identify document elements and generate or build a DOM tree or DOM structure  out of the document elements. A document element may be a hypertext element such as an HTML tag in an HTML document. In one embodiment, DOM tree  may represent a topological or structural relationship among the document elements. Each node in DOM tree  of a document may correspond to one document element of the document. Document elements may include document content and\/or layout specifications, such as size attributes associated with HTML tags in an HTML document, for presenting the document content, e.g. via presentation module  to display a user interface rendering a web page on a display screen via user interface module .","In one embodiment, content retrieval\/processing module  may include a rendering engine to generate rendering information, such as layout parameters (e.g. sizing data of a rectangular area) for each node in DOM tree  for presenting a corresponding document. The rendering engine can make rendering decisions according to configurations including layout specifications in a document, user interface settings for application  and\/or other system settings, etc. A rendered DOM tree may represent web content such as a web page presented by a browser.","In one embodiment, application  may include transition module  that interacts with DOM interface module  to perform transitions between pages as described herein. Transition module  may include navigation module  to detect navigation events. Snapshot module  may generate and\/or manage snapshots that may be utilized as described herein. Mode configuration module  may allow a user to set parameters related to transitions, for example, a cache size to be used, a transition sensitivity, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"As a user accesses a page, the user may interact with the page in any manner known in the art. At some point, the user may choose to navigate away from the page. The user then provides a command to navigate away from the page, . Any of the various navigational techniques described herein may be utilized to navigate away from the page.","In response to the command to navigate away from the page, the browser (or other system component) causes a snapshot image of the page to be stored, . The snapshot is an image of the contents provided by the browser. The snapshot may be stored, for example, as a bitmap image or other type of image. The snapshot may be stored in a cache or other memory accessible by the browser.","In one embodiment, additional information related to the page may be stored with the snapshot. The additional information may be, for example, complexity information corresponding to the page at or near the time the snapshot was taken. The complexity information may be, for example, statistics corresponding to a render tree or a Document Object Model (DOM) tree, or a number of images, or other information.","The user may navigate to one or more pages after leaving the page. In one embodiment, each time a user navigates away from a page a snapshot is stored for that page. These snapshots are used when the user navigates back to the page, as describe in greater detail below.","When the user navigates back to the page, the user will provide a command to the browser, . This command may be any of the types of commands described herein. Further, the page may be accessed using a \u201cforward\u201d command or an embedded link, or any other mechanism of providing navigational commands.","In response to a command returning to the previously visited page, the browser retrieves the snapshot corresponding to the page and displays the snapshot in the browser, . The snapshot is displayed while the browser loads the page to be displayed, . As the page is loaded one or more characteristics corresponding to the page may be monitored, .","Various characteristics may be monitored. One or more of them may be utilized. In one embodiment, a complexity measurement may be utilized. In one embodiment, the complexity may be determined by the browser engine. In alternate embodiments, complexity may be determined by other components.","Complexity may be determined, for example, by the size of a render tree for the page, or by the size or number of levels in a Document Object Model (DOM) tree for the page, or by a size allocation corresponding to the page. As the page loads, the complexity may change. In one embodiment, a starting complexity value is maintained and subsequent complexity values are compared to the starting value to determine how complexity has changed. In one embodiment, when complexity has decreased to 50% of the original value, the loading page may be displayed.","In one embodiment, a render tree is analyzed to determine the complexity of the page being loaded. The render tree is very similar to the DOM tree in that it is a tree of objects, where each object can correspond to the document, elements or text nodes. The render tree can also contain additional objects that have no corresponding DOM node. These objects are \u201crenderers\u201d that contain specialized information on how to properly layout specific portions of the document. The render tree may provide a better result because it may more closely represent what a user actually sees on the screen at a given point in time.","Other characteristics may also be utilized. For example, an estimate of a loading time may be made based on the content of the page, a number of outstanding network requests may be monitored, the amount of memory consumed may be monitored, and\/or the number of images or image pixels may be monitored.","In one embodiment, a pre-selected period of time (e.g., 100 ms, 250 ms, 75 ms, 300 ms) after a page load is complete, the snapshot may be replaced by the loaded page. Some pages continue to provide new content after indicating that the page load is complete. In one embodiment, a variable time period may be utilized. The time period may be selected based on, for example, the size of the page, known conditions related to the page, the source of the page or some of the content, the amount of time required to load the page, etc.","When the monitored characteristics satisfy pre-selected conditions, the page may be displayed instead of the snapshot, . In one embodiment, an animated transition between the snapshot and the page may be provided. The pre-selected condition may be, for example, a specified decrease in complexity, a specified increase in complexity, or loading of a specified percentage of images, loading of a specified percentage of content, etc. In one embodiment, a pre-selected condition may be comparing a ratio of subsequent complexity to an original complexity, and when the ratio reaches a threshold the page is displayed.","In one embodiment, one of the pre-selected conditions may be that there are no outstanding network requests, or a period of time after there are no outstanding network requests. Combinations of one or more of these pre-selected conditions may also be used. For example, the page may be displayed rather than the snapshot when either a complexity criteria or no outstanding network requests criteria are met. Other combinations may also be supported.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","400","400","400","412","410"]},"Transition agent  includes memory , which represents a memory device and\/or access to a memory resource for storing data and\/or instructions. Memory  may include memory local to transition agent , as well as, or alternatively, including memory of the host system on which transition agent  resides. Transition agent  also includes one or more interfaces , which represent access interfaces to\/from (e.g., an input\/output interface, application programming interface) transition agent  with regard to entities (electronic or human) external to transition agent .","Transition agent  also includes transition engine , which represents one or more functions that enable transition agent  to provide the transitioning between pages as described herein. Example modules that may be included in transition engine  are navigation module , snapshot module , characteristic monitor  and rendering module . Each of these modules may further include other modules to provide other functions. As used herein, a module refers to routine, a subsystem, etc., whether implemented in hardware, software, firmware or some combination thereof.","Navigation module  operates to detect navigation events. Navigation module  may be configured to detect navigation inputs from various user interfaces including, for example, a touch screen, a control pad, a cursor control device, a keyboard, etc. Navigation module  may operate to initiate the transition mechanisms described herein in response to detecting a navigation event that causes the browser to return to a previously viewed page.","Snapshot module  operates to manage snapshots that may be utilized as described herein. Snapshot module  may cause snapshots to be taken in response to navigation away from a page and to retrieve snapshots for previously viewed pages. Snapshot module  may also manage memory locations used for storing the snapshots as well as managing other information (e.g., complexity information, image information) for snapshots.","Characteristic monitor  may operate to monitor and\/or track characteristics of interest for the page being loaded. These characteristics include, for example, complexity, memory usage, memory requirements, image information, network access requests, etc. In one embodiment, characteristic monitor  periodically, or continually, monitors these characteristics as the page is loaded. In one embodiment, characteristic monitor  may generate a signal when the monitored characteristics cross a pre-selected threshold. This signal may be utilized to cause the snapshot to be replaced with the page that may be fully or partially loaded.","Rendering module  operates to render images to be displayed by the browser. Rendering module  may be used to generate images representing the page, to generate the snapshot, and\/or to blend the page and the snapshot. Rendering module  may use any rendering techniques known in the art.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.
