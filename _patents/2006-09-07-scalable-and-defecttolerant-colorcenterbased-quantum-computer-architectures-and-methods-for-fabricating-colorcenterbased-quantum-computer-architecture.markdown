The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to quantum computer architectures, and in particular, to color-center-based quantum computer architectures that are both scalable and defect tolerant and methods for fabricating quantum computer architectures that are color center based.","Advancements in disciplines ranging from atomic physics to various branches of condensed matter physics are being employed to fabricate a variety of different diamond-based materials for use in many different technological applications. Diamond has a crystal lattice structure comprising two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices of carbon atoms.  shows a unit cell  of a diamond-crystal lattice. In , each carbon atom, represented by a sphere, is covalently bonded to four adjacent carbon atoms, each covalent bond is represented by a rod connecting two spheres. As shown in , a carbon atom  is covalently bonded to four carbon atoms -. In general, diamond has a number of potentially useful properties. For example, diamond is transparent from the ultraviolet to the far infrared of the electromagnetic spectrum and has a relatively high refractive index of about 2.42. Diamond may also be a suitable replacement for silicon in silicon-based semiconductor devices. For example, silicon has an electronic bandgap of about 1.12 eV and starts to show signs of thermal stress at about 100\u00b0 C., while diamond has a larger electronic bandgap ranging from about 5 eV to about 7 eV and a high Debye temperature ranging from about 1550\u00b0 C. to about 1930\u00b0 C.","Certain atomic-vacancy systems, called \u201ccolor centers,\u201d embedded in diamond may have potential applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing. For example, a nitrogen-vacancy (\u201cNV\u201d) center embedded in diamond is a type of color center that may be used to store a quantum bit of information.  shows an NV center embedded in a diamond-crystal lattice . The NV-center comprises a nitrogen atom  next to a carbon vacancy . The nitrogen atom  is covalently bonded to three carbon atoms -. The nitrogen atom  can also be located within the diamond-crystal lattice  at the positions occupied by carbons -. NV centers can be created in a nitrogen rich diamond by irradiation and subsequent annealing at temperatures above 550\u00b0 C. The radiation creates vacancies in the diamond and subsequent annealing causes the vacancies to migrate towards nitrogen atoms to produce an NV center. Alternatively, NV centers can be created in diamond using N ion implantation.","When an electromagnetic field interacts with an NV center, there is a periodic exchange, or oscillation, of energy between the electromagnetic field and the electronic energy levels of the NV center. Such oscillations, which are called \u201cRabi oscillations,\u201d are associated with oscillations of the NV center electronic energy level populations and quantum-mechanical probability amplitudes of the NV center electronic energy states. Rabi oscillations can be interpreted as an oscillation between absorption and stimulated emission of photons. The Rabi frequency, denoted by \u03a9, represents the number of times these oscillations occur per unit time (multiplied by the quantity 2\u03c0).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","sup":["3","3","3"],"sub":["2 ","1 ","2 ","23 ","i "],"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00007","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00008","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00009","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00010","he":"3.13mm","wi":"1.02mm","file":"US07546000-20090609-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}],"b":["122","124","126","128"]},"When spontaneous emission is taken into consideration, the state of the NV center is, in general, represented by a linear superposition of states:\n\n|\u03c8=|1|2|3\n\nwhere a, a, and aare probability amplitudes.

Photonic crystals are typically identified by the number of directions in which the dielectric pattern is periodic. For example,  illustrates an example of a one-dimensional photonic crystal. In , a photonic crystal  is composed of seven layers of two different dielectrics that alternate periodically in the z-direction. Unshaded layers - are composed of a first dielectric having a dielectric constant \u2208, and hash-marked layers - are composed of a second dielectric having a different dielectric constant \u2208. The layers are regularly spaced with a repeat distance called a \u201clattice constant,\u201d in the case of the lattice constant shown in , lattice constant a.  illustrates an example of a two-dimensional photonic crystal. The two-dimensional photonic crystal  comprises alternating layers of two different dielectrics, and is periodic in both the x-direction and the y-direction with two lattice constants a and b. Unshaded regions, such as region , are composed of a first dielectric having dielectric constant \u2208, and hash-marked regions, such as region , are composed of a second dielectric having a different dielectric constant \u2208. Photonic crystals can also be fabricated with repeating patterns in three dimensions. Three-dimensional photonic crystals can be fabricated using spheres, tubes, or other solid shapes comprising a first dielectric embedded in a slab comprising a second dielectric.","ER propagating in a dielectric can be characterized by electromagnetic waves comprising oscillating, orthogonal electric fields, {right arrow over (E)}, and magnetic fields, {right arrow over (H)}, and a direction of propagation, {right arrow over (k)}.

As a result, a two-dimensional photonic crystal can be designed and fabricated as a frequency-band stop filter to prevent the propagation of ER having frequencies within the photonic bandgap of the photonic crystal. Generally, the size and relative spacing of cylindrical columns control which wavelengths of ER are prohibited from propagating in the two-dimensional photonic crystal.

ER entering the area surrounding a waveguide or a resonant cavity experiences an exponential decay in amplitude, a process referred to as \u201cevanescence.\u201d As a result, a resonant cavity can be located within a short distance of a waveguide to allow certain wavelengths of ER carried by the waveguide to be extracted by the resonant cavity.

Depending on a resonant cavity Q factor, an extracted ER can remain trapped in a resonant cavity and resonate for a time before evanescing into the surroundings or backscattering into the waveguide.

As shown in , a photonic crystal , a microring , a ridge waveguide , and a portion of a bus waveguide  are fabricated in the transmission layer . The photonic crystal  includes a resonant cavity  that can be created by etching cylindrical holes that are smaller, or larger, than the rest of the holes used to define the photonic crystal . The resonant cavity  can also be fabricated with cylindrical holes that are the same shape and size as the cylindrical holes comprising the rest of the photonic crystal , but the locations of the holes defining the resonant cavity are shifted, as described above with reference to . The resonant cavity  is located directly above the color center . The etching and lithographic methods leave a similarly configured layer of TiO\/SiNi on top of each photonic device. Note that the cylindrical holes used to define the photonic crystal  extend into the diamond layer .  illustrates a cross-sectional view of the color center  located directly beneath the resonant cavity  that represents an embodiment of the present invention.","Next, using lithographic methods, a switch can be created at each photonic-chip node by implanting in the transmission layer  electron donating atoms to create an n-region and electron hole donating atoms to create a p-region, and by fabricating the electrodes on the top surfaces of the n- and p-regions, as described above with reference to .  illustrates a perspective view of a switch created in the patterned transmission layer shown in  that presents an embodiment of the present invention.

In other words, the photonic chips  and  can be made to provided more (or less) computational power, memory, or amount of mass storage by configuring each chip with a larger (or smaller) number of nodes. For example, methods of the present invention can be used to configure quantum computer architectures with an unlimited number of nodes.  illustrates a hypothetical photonic chip  with an array of 400 nodes that represents an embodiment of the present invention. In , boxes, such as box , represent nodes, such as node , in , or node , in . Horizontal lines, such as horizontal line , represent bus waveguides that can be coupled to optical fiber input\/output couplers.","The photonic chips  and  described above are also defect tolerant. In other words, the photonic chips  and  can be operated effectively even though a number of the nodes are not operational. Certain nodes may have defects, such as not having a color center, the cavity coupling is too weak, or their characteristics differ from that of the other nodes. The defective nodes can be turned off by changing the refractive index of each switch microring, as described above with reference to .  illustrates the photonic chip  with 5 defective nodes that represents an embodiment of the present invention. In , defective nodes are identified by \u201cXs.\u201d For example, \u201cX\u201d  identifies a defective node . Applying an appropriate voltage bias between a first electrode  and a second electrode  changes the resonance frequency of a microring  so that an electromagnetic wave cannot be transmitted by evanescent coupling between the bus waveguide  and the color center .","Although the present invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments, it is not intended that the invention be limited to these embodiments. Modifications within the spirit of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, rather than coupling a single bus waveguide to a single row of nodes, as shown in , the photonic device of a row of nodes can be rearranged so that a single bus waveguide can be couple to two rows of nodes. For example,  illustrates a photonic chip  with a single bus waveguide  that is coupled to two rows of nodes that represents an embodiment of the present invention.

In alternate embodiments of the present invention, the semiconductor material comprising the photonic devices may include high-index dielectrics, such as SiN. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, an optical multiplexer\/demultiplexer can be used to connect a single optical fiber input\/output connection to numerous bus waveguides in a photonic chip.  illustrates a photonic chip  comprising 28 nodes, such as node  and 4 bus waveguides - connected to a single optical fiber  via a photonic mutliplexer\/demultiplexer (\u201cMUX\/DEMUX\u201d)  that represents an embodiment of the present invention. The MUX\/DEMUX  can be comprised of waveguides or resonators in a photonic crystal, or optical fibers, that are controlled by electronic\/optical switches, such as a series of directional couplers or add\/drop resonators as represented in circle , and each bus waveguide is connected to a waveguide of the MUX\/DEMUX . The switches can be individually controlled so that particular electromagnetic waves can be selectively directed into the bus waveguide -. For example, switch  can be used to direct an electromagnetic wave to the bus waveguide  and not to the bus waveguide . In alternate embodiments of the present invention, an electrooptic material can be deposited directly on the surface of the switch microrings In each node a voltage applied by the electrodes causes a change in the refractive index of the microring.","The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the invention.
