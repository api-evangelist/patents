title: Kind classification through emergent semantic analysis
abstract: A goal of computer development is to understand the user and the data with which the user is engaged. If a better understanding of the user and their data can be accomplished, then additional information and features may be provided based upon the user's intent and interests. Accordingly, as provided herein, Kinds may be created as digital representations of everyday things. Kind classifications may be created to characterize the Kinds. The Kind classifications may be updated based upon user interaction to further characterize Kinds with which the user has interacted. For example, when a user writes an email about using orange peels as an air freshener, an orange Kind classification may be updated to reflect that an orange may be used as an air freshener. Kind feature vectors and user feature vectors may be created to represent the probabilities that the Kind or user relates to particular characteristics.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many users interact with computer resources daily. The user's experience of these computer resources may involve navigation, discovery, and interaction with data items (e.g., files, emails, images, web searches, etc.). For example, the user may access their work email or perform a web search using a mobile device. Unfortunately, the user's experience may be limited because the devices through which the user and computer resources interact may not understand the user's interests, detailed information of the data items with which the user interacts, and\/or the context with which the user interacts with the data items. For example, when a user checks their calendar for an upcoming trip through a work computer, the work computer may not understand the context of the user's interactions and thus may not understand that it may be advantageous to provide the user with additional information, such as itinerary information.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for updating a Kind classification based upon emergent semantic analysis is disclosed herein. A Kind may be interpreted as the digital representation of everyday things (e.g., a desk Kind may be a digital representation of a desk; an orange Kind may be a digital representation of an orange\u2014the color and\/or the fruit). A Kind classification may be interpreted as information defining the characteristics of a Kind through descriptors. Emergent semantic analysis may be interpreted as defining the meaning of a Kind through its observed use (e.g., user interaction within a computing environment). That is, a Kind classification of a Kind may be updated based upon user interaction with a data item associated with the Kind. For example, additional descriptors may be associated with the Kind classification based upon emergent semantic analysis. A descriptor may be interpreted as information characterizing the Kind associated with the Kind classification. In one example, descriptors may be characterizations determined based upon emergent semantic analysis techniques. In another example, descriptors may be derived from extracted features (e.g., extracted metadata of a file, execution of a Kind classification module).","Usage data relating to a Kind classification may be received. The usage data may correspond to user interaction with a data item associated with a Kind characterized by the Kind classification. For example, a user may send an email describing uses of an orange. The concept of an orange may be digitally represented as an orange Kind, wherein an orange Kind classification characterizes the orange Kind. The data item may be web content, local content, subscription content, shared content, a stream of data, and\/or other data content (e.g., files, emails, blogs, newsfeeds, etc.).","A descriptor may be associated with the Kind classification based upon the usage data. For example, a user may send an email describing the use of orange peels as an air freshener. An orange Kind classification characterizing an orange Kind (a digital representation of the orange) may be updated based upon the information within the email. In one example of updating the orange Kind classification, one or more descriptors may be derived from the email. For example, it may be apparent, through semantic analysis, that the orange Kind relates to air fresheners based upon an analysis of the email's text, thus a descriptor may be created characterizing the orange Kind as an air freshener. The one or more descriptors may be associated with the orange Kind classification, thus further characterizing the orange Kind based upon usage data of writing within the email.","It may be appreciated that classification modules may be executed upon data items to associate one or more descriptors with the Kind classification. For example, an image Kind classification module may be executed upon data items associated with an image Kind to further characterize the image Kind by associating additional descriptors with an image Kind classification. In another example, an audio Kind classification module may be executed upon data items associated with an audio Kind to further characterize the audio Kind by associating additional descriptors with an audio Kind classification.","A Kind feature vector may be associated with a Kind characterized by the Kind classification. For example, the Kind feature vector may be a data structure representation of the conceptual space within which the Kind digitally exists. One or more dimensions may be created within the Kind feature vector. A dimension, for example, may be indicative of a characteristic. Probabilistic values may be assigned to the one or more dimensions, wherein a probabilistic value is based upon the probability the Kind relates to a characteristic of the dimension. For example, an orange Kind feature vector may be created for an orange Kind. A fruit dimension, a color dimension, a vacation dimension, and\/or hundreds of thousands of other dimensions may be created within the orange Kind feature vector.","The dimensions may be assigned a probabilistic value based upon the probability the orange Kind relates to the characteristic (e.g., how probable is it that an orange relates to a fruit, how probable is it that an orange relates to a color, how probable is it that an orange relates to an air freshener). Probabilistic value, for example, may range from 0 to 1, wherein 1 is a high probability the Kind relates to the characteristic and 0 is a low probability the Kind relates to the characteristic (e.g., 0.9 may be assigned to the fruit dimension because of a high probability the orange Kind relates to a fruit and 0.04 may be assigned to the vacation dimension because of a low probability the orange Kind relates to a vacation). It may be appreciated that any range may be utilized in designating probabilistic values. In one example, the probabilistic values may be derived from one or more descriptors within the Kind classification. The Kind feature vector may be updated based upon usage data relating to the Kind classification. For example, an updated probabilistic value may be reassigned to one or more dimensions of a Kind feature vector.","A user feature vector may be created based upon one or more Kind vectors associated with the user. For example, a Kind feature vector may be associated with a user based upon user interaction and\/or ownership of data items having a Kind characterized by the Kind feature vector. One or more dimensions may be created within the user feature vector, wherein respective dimensions may be assigned a probabilistic value based upon the probability the user relates to a characteristic of the dimension. For example, a weighted sum may be performed across one or more Kind feature vectors to determine probabilistic values (e.g., summing probabilistic values of a particular dimension across one or more Kind feature vectors).","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A user's experience of computer resources may involve interacting with data items (e.g., web content, local content, subscription content, and\/or shared content). The user's experience may be enhanced by understanding the user's interests and classifying data items with which the user interacts. For example, if a user writes an email regarding the use of orange peels as an air freshener, then a digital representation of an orange (e.g., an orange Kind) may be classified as relating to an air freshener and\/or a home cleaning product. The user may also be classified as having an interest in air fresheners and\/or home cleaning products. This classification allows additional information and more advanced interactions to be presented to users.","Among other things, a technique for updating a Kind classification based upon emergent semantic analysis is provided herein. Usage data relating to a Kind classification may be received. In one example, a user may send an email describing the uses of an orange. In another example, a user may rename an image of a park. In yet another example, a user may create an audio file pertaining to a recent work meeting, wherein the user describes the audio file through metadata of the audio file. These are a few examples of a user interacting with data items (e.g., an email, an image, an audio file) associated with Kinds (e.g., an orange Kind, a park image Kind, an audio file Kind) characterized by Kind classifications (e.g., orange Kind classification, park image Kind classification, audio file Kind classification). The user interaction may be utilized in further characterizing associated Kinds by updating their respective Kind classifications with new descriptors. For example, a descriptor may be added to the orange Kind classification based upon a user describing uses of an orange within an email. A Kind feature vector may be created based upon the Kind classifications and its descriptors. One or more Kind feature vectors may be utilized in creating a user feature vector that may characterize a user's interests.","It may be appreciated that a feature vector (e.g., a Kind feature vector and\/or a user feature vector) may represent the conceptual space a Kind or a user occupies. A feature vector may be created based upon Mutual Information theory and dimensionality reduction techniques. In one example of creating a Kind feature vector, discriminating (salient) features for all Kind data may be determined and then evaluated against a Kind.","One embodiment of updating a Kind classification based upon emergent semantic analysis is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , usage data relating to a Kind classification may be received. For example, a user may write a text message regarding painting a room in their house orange. A digital representation of orange may exist as an orange Kind, wherein an orange Kind classification may characterize the orange Kind. The usage data may be the text message and the text therein may be extracted as features utilized in creating descriptors.","At , a descriptor may be associated with the Kind classification based upon the usage data. The descriptor may be created based upon analyzing the usage data using, for example, emergent semantic analysis techniques. For example, the text within the text message may be analyzed to determine the context within which the orange Kind is used (e.g., orange is a paint color). A paint color descriptor may be created to further characterize the orange Kind. The paint color descriptor may be associated with the orange Kind classification, thus characterizing the orange Kind as relating to a paint color. In this way, the orange Kind classification is updated based upon emergent semantic analysis of the user's text message. The orange Kind classification may be utilized in understanding the orange Kind (e.g., machine learning techniques may utilize the orange Kind classification to understand what an orange is).","It may be appreciated that the Kind classification may be updated based upon extracted features of a data item associated with the Kind characterized by the Kind classification. For example, a classification module may be executed upon the data item to extract features. The extracted features may be used in associating one or more descriptors with the Kind classification. In one example, an image Kind classification module may be executed upon a park image having a park image Kind characterized by a park image Kind classification. One or more descriptors may be associated with the park image Kind classification based upon extracted features (e.g., a color ratio feature, a color saturation feature, a shape feature, and\/or other features extracted from the park image). In another example, an audio Kind classification module may be executed upon a meeting audio file having a meeting audio Kind characterized by a meeting audio Kind classification. One or more descriptors may be associated with the meeting audio Kind classification based upon extracted features (e.g., a signal to noise ratio feature, a zero crossing feature, an f domain analysis feature, and\/or other features extracted from the audio file and\/or metadata).","A Kind feature vector may be associated with a Kind based upon a Kind classification characterizing the Kind. One or more dimensions may be created within the Kind feature vector. A dimension may represent a characteristic (e.g., fruit, color, cleaning product, air freshener, sports, etc.) that the Kind may or may not relate to in varying degrees. The one or more dimensions may represent up to and beyond millions of potential characteristics that the Kind may have a probability of relating to. Probabilistic values may be assigned to respective dimensions based upon the probability the Kind relates to a characteristic of a dimension (e.g., probabilistic values may be derived from a set of initial features and\/or descriptors). For example, a 0.80 probabilistic value may be assigned to a fruit dimension of an orange Kind feature vector because descriptors within an orange Kind may reveal that the orange Kind has a high probability of relating to a fruit. A 0.04 probabilistic value may be assigned to a vacation dimension because descriptors of the orange Kind may reveal that the orange Kind has a low probability of relating to a vacation. The Kind feature vector of a Kind may be analyzed to determine probabilities that the Kind relates to one or more characteristics. At , the method ends.","One embodiment of creating a feature vector is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a Kind feature vector may be created for a Kind using a set of initial features and one or more descriptors of a Kind classification characterizing the Kind. It may be appreciated that the set of initial features may be features extracted from a data item associated with the Kind (e.g., extract metadata from an image, HTML data, etc.). It may be appreciated that the set of initial features may be represented as one or more descriptors of the Kind classification, wherein the one or more descriptors are derived from the extracted features.","One or more dimensions may be created within the Kind feature vector, wherein a probabilistic value may be assigned to respective dimensions based upon the probability the Kind relates to a characteristic of the dimension. For example, a probabilistic value may be assigned based upon one or more descriptors of the Kind classification and\/or the set of initial features (e.g., features extracted from data items associated with the Kind).","The Kind feature vector may be updated based upon usage data relating to the Kind classification. In one example, a user may own an image file digitally represented by an image Kind that is characterized by an image Kind classification. The user may rename the image file to \u201cBirthday Party\u201d. A new descriptor characterizing the image file as a birthday party may be associated with the image Kind classification. A Kind feature vector associated with the image Kind may be updated based upon updated image Kind classification. For example, an event dimension, a party dimension, and a birthday dimension may be reassigned probabilistic values depicting an increase in the probability that the image relates to such dimensions.","It may be appreciated that other feature vectors may be created, such as a user feature vector. A user feature vector may be created for a user based one or more Kind feature vectors of Kinds associated with the user (e.g., Kinds digitally representing everyday things extracted from data items the user has interacted with). One or more dimensions may be created within the user feature vector. Probabilistic values may be assigned to respective dimensions based upon the probability the user relates to a characteristic of the dimension. For example, a weighted sum may be performed across the one or more Kind feature vectors to determine the probabilistic value of a dimension. That is, a probabilistic value for an air freshener dimension may be determined by summing probabilistic values of air freshener dimensions across the one or more Kind feature vectors associated with the user. If the user is associated with many Kinds relating to air fresheners (e.g., multiple Kind feature vectors have a high probabilistic value relating to air fresheners) then a high probabilistic value may be assigned to the air freshener dimension of the user feature vector.","The user feature vector may be analyzed to determine interests of the user (e.g., a high probabilistic value of a dimension may indicate the user has an interest in the characteristic of the dimension). For example, a sports dimension may be assigned a 0.63 probabilistic value within a user feature vector. This may indicate that the user has a high interest in sports (e.g., the user may blog about sports; the user may receive emails regarding sports; the user may subscribe to sports newsfeeds, etc.). In comparison, a cooking dimension may be assigned a 0.01 probabilistic value within the user feature vector. This may indicate that the user has little interest in cooking (e.g., the user may have interacting with a website once regarding how to cook wings for a sporting event).","The user feature vector may be updated based upon user interaction with a data item (e.g., web content, local content, subscription content, shared content, etc.). For example, the user may subscribe to a gardening newsletter. A garden dimension may be created within the user feature vector and assigned an appropriate probabilistic value. The user may begin to frequently participate in online discussions about gardening. An updated probabilistic value may be assigned to reflect a higher probability that the user relates to gardening. At , the method ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","306","312","306","308","304","306","308","308"]},"In one example, the usage data  may be a user writing a blog entry, a data item , about mixing drinks with orange juice. It may be determined that an orange Kind is comprised within the blog entry (e.g., the text is analyzed to determine the word orange is used within the blog entry). The orange Kind may comprise an orange Kind classification, the Kind classification , wherein the orange Kind classification characterizes the orange Kind through descriptors. For example, descriptor () may characterize the orange Kind as a fruit and descriptor () may characterize the orange Kind as a cleaning product. The descriptor component  may associate a new descriptor, a descriptor () , based upon the usage data  in which the user wrote about mixing drinks with orange juice. The descriptor ()  may characterize the orange Kind within the Kind classification  as being useful in mixing drinks. It may be appreciated that descriptor (), descriptor (), and\/or descriptor ()  may be derived from the usage data  and\/or extracted features of the data item .","The feature vector component  may be configured to create a Kind feature vector  based on one or more descriptors (e.g., descriptor (), descriptor (), and descriptor () ) associated with the Kind classification . It may be appreciated that one or more descriptors may have been derived from a set of initial features and\/or assigned by the descriptor component . One or more dimensions may be created within the Kind feature vector  based upon the one or more descriptors. For example, a fruit dimension, a cleaning product dimension, and a drink mixer dimension may be created within the orange based upon an orange Kind classification comprising descriptors relating to fruit, cleaning products, and\/or drink mixers. Probabilistic values may be assigned to respective dimensions within the orange Kind feature vector based upon the probability an orange Kind characterized by the orange Kind classification relates to a characteristic of respective dimension. For example, a probabilistic value of 0.8 may be assigned to the fruit dimension because there is a high probability that the orange Kind relates to a fruit. The probabilistic value may be created based upon one or more descriptors characterizing the orange Kind as a fruit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","408","408","410","402","1","404","406","1","404","1"]},"In one example, a weighted sum may be performed across the Kind feature vectors to create the user feature vector . One or more dimensions may be created within the user feature vector . Probabilistic values may be assigned to respective dimensions based upon the probability the user relates to a characteristic of a dimension. For example, a high probabilistic value (e.g., 0.75) may be assigned to an orange dimension if the user writes about oranges, receives emails regarding oranges, and has pictures of oranges. That is, a probabilistic value for a particular dimension within the user feature vector  may be derived by summing respective probabilistic values of a dimension across the one or more Kind feature vectors (e.g., sum orange dimensions from Kind feature vector ()  up to Kind feature vector (N)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","502","510","502","510","1","2"]},"User interaction  may be performed upon the park image file  by the user. For example, the user may rename the title of the park image file  to \u201cBasketball game in July\u201d. Usage data  may be derived from the user interaction  of renaming the title (e.g., the text of the renamed title may be extracted into the usage data  as a feature). A descriptor component  may associate a descriptor () sports  with the park image Kind classification  based upon the usage data . The descriptor ()  sports may characterize the park image Kind as sports because the usage data  may comprise a sports feature extracted from the text \u201cbasketball\u201d in the renamed title of the park image file  (e.g., the user characterized the park image file  as relating to sports through the user interaction ). The park image Kind classification  now characterizes the park image file  as an image, a park, and sports using descriptors (), (), and () respectively. The park image Kind classification  may be utilized in creating a park image Kind feature vector.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","604","602","604","602","606","604","602","602","604","606"]},"A descriptor component  may update a park image Kind classification  characterizing a park image Kind associated with the park image file  using the descriptor .

The email  may describe the audio file  (e.g., pertains to work meeting, regards sales training, etc.). A descriptor component  may utilize the usage data  to associate descriptors with the audio file Kind classification . The descriptor component  may extract features from the email  characterizing the audio file Kind. For example, based upon the text of the email , the descriptor component  may determine the audio file  pertains to a work meeting and regards sales training. The descriptor component  may also determine the audio file  is a conversation, which may be derived from the feature that the audio file  pertains to a work meeting. The descriptor component  may create one or more descriptors (e.g., descriptor () meeting , descriptor () sales training , and descriptor () conversation ) based upon the extracted features of the email . The audio file Kind classification  now characterizes the audio file Kind as an audio file, a meeting, sale training, and a conversation.
