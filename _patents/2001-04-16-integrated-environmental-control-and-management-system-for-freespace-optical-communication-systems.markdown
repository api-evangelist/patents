title: Integrated environmental control and management system for free-space optical communication systems
abstract: A method of managing a free-space optical network includes monitoring environmental and weather conditions in the vicinity of one or more free-space optical links in the network. Data is gathered by environmental condition instruments, such as visibility meters, and is used to assess whether atmospheric conditions have deteriorated to the point where operation of one or more free-space links might be in jeopardy. If data from an environmental condition instrument falls below a predetermined level, network data traffic is routed over an alternate communication path, which may include radio frequency (RF) paths, fiber optic cables, wire cables, or other free-space links.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to optical communication, and more specifically to free-space optical networking.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Free-space optical communications systems use high power laser sources to transmit beams of modulated light through free-space (air).","Such systems are capable of transmitting an enormous amount of information and can be used to interconnect network segments in complex networking infrastructures.","The laser beams that carry the information in a free-space optical communication system typically operate in the infrared spectral range. Disadvantageously, the scattering and absorption coefficients of infrared light beams passing through the atmosphere can be rather high and this can adversely affect the transmitted light, which can impact the system availability. This is especially true when small particles such as fog, steam, dust, or aerosol particles are present in the atmosphere.","In order to overcome these and other disadvantages, it would be highly desirable to manage a free-space optical network in a manner that avoids the adverse consequences that the environment\/atmosphere can have on the transmitted light beams. Thus, there is a need for a method and\/or system for providing such free-space optical network management.","The present invention advantageously addresses the needs above as well as other needs by providing a method of managing a free-space optical network. The method includes the steps of: directing network data traffic over one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network; monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; and routing the network data traffic through an alternate communication path in response to data obtained from the step of monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of managing a free-space optical network. The method includes the steps of: directing network data traffic over one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network; monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; attempting to adjust one or both of a transmission power and receive sensitivity of one or more of the free-space optical links in response to data obtained from the step of monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; and routing the network data traffic through an alternate communication path in response to a failure in the step of attempting to adjust.","In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a system for managing a free-space optical network. The system includes means for monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network, and means for routing network data traffic through an alternate communication path in response to data obtained from the means for monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of managing a free-space optical network that includes the steps of: directing network data traffic over one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network; monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; sending an alarm over the free-space optical network in response to data obtained from the step of monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; routing the network data traffic through an alternate communication path in response to the alarm; and rerouting the network data traffic over the one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network in response to additional data obtained from monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links.","In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of managing a free-space optical network that includes the steps of: directing network data traffic over one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network; monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; sending an alarm over the free-space optical network in response to data obtained from the step of monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links; selecting an alternate communication path for the network data traffic in response to the alarm; routing the network data traffic through the alternate communication path; re-evaluating the alternate communication path selection; and rerouting the network data traffic over the one or more free-space optical links in the free-space optical network in response to additional data obtained from monitoring one or more environmental conditions in a vicinity of at least one of the one or more free-space optical links.","A better understanding of the features and advantages of the present invention will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the invention and accompanying drawings which set forth an illustrative embodiment in which the principles of the invention are utilized.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding components throughout the several views of the drawings.","The following description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined with reference to the claims.","In order to manage a free-space optical network in a manner that avoids the adverse consequences of inclement weather and other difficult atmospheric conditions, there is needed a way to detect that atmospheric conditions have deteriorated to the point where the transmitted beams might be adversely affected. One way to detect such deterioration is to measure the received signal power at one end of a free-space link in order to determine whether or not there is any path attenuation. One complication with this approach, however, is that it is difficult to determine whether or not any decrease in receive power is due to weather conditions or due to an alignment problem or due to another possible failure of the system that might not be related to weather impact. For example, an alignment problem with one of the free-space transceivers can also reduce the received power.","Another way to detect deterioration of atmospheric conditions is to use visibility data. Specifically, small particles in the atmosphere, such as for example fog, steam, dust, or aerosol particles, impact visibility. Visibility data can be used to characterize an availability figure of a free-space optical link in a specific deployment area. Visibility data has been collected by government agencies for a long period of time, and airports are typically used as geographical reference points. Unfortunately, the visibility data at airport locations can be quite different from the weather conditions in downtown or business park areas where the actual installation of a free-space optical communication system typically takes place. These microclimate effects complicate the process of calculating reliable availability figures in areas that are not located close to airports with well-known visibility data.","Referring to , there is illustrated a free-space optical communication system or network  that incorporates a free-space optical network management system  made in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The network  includes several optical transceivers  mounted on several buildings  for communicating optical signals over several free-space links . The free-space links  are used to connect the multiple buildings  within a high-speed wireless optical network. A typical application for the network  is in a metropolitan area or a campus like environment.","By way of example, the optical transceivers  may use methods or comprise devices of the type disclosed in the following two United States patent applications, the entire contents of which are hereby fully incorporated into the present application by reference: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/065,685, filed Apr. 24, 1998, entitled TERRESTRIAL OPTICAL COMMUNICATION NETWORK OF INTEGRATED FIBER AND FREE-SPACE LINKS WHICH REQUIRES NO ELECTRO-OPTICAL CONVERSION BETWEEN LINKS, by inventor Heinz Willebrand; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/482,782, filed Jan. 13, 2000, entitled HYBRID WIRELESS OPTICAL AND RADIO FREQUENCY COMMUNICATION LINK, by inventors Heinz Willebrand and Maha Achour.","In general, the free-space optical network management system  automatically collects weather data and manages the free-space optical communication network  depending on current weather conditions. The management system  preferably uses the measurements of actual atmospheric and environmental conditions in the area of deployment in an automatic feedback and control system to manage the free-space optical network . This technique allows for taking microclimate effects into account. The management system  significantly increases the overall network  availability by using alternate or redundant routing paths  in case of a potential system loss due to environmental conditions. This improves the predictability of the availability of the network .","In order for the management system  to use measurements of actual atmospheric or environmental conditions in the area of deployment, one or more environmental condition instruments  are installed in the vicinity of one or more of the free-space links . For example, the environmental condition instrument  may be installed on one of the buildings , preferably a building in or near the center of the network . The environmental condition instrument  may comprise any type of instrument or sensor for measuring any type of atmospheric, environmental, weather or climate condition. For example, the environmental condition instrument  may comprise a visibility meter for measuring visibility data, a weather sensor for measuring wind speed and\/or wind direction, a pressure meter, a temperature sensor, etc. In environments with strong microclimate effects, multiple environmental condition instruments may be used and networked together through the management system  to improve the overall network  availability.","The one or more environmental condition instruments  collect measurement data corresponding to selected atmospheric or environmental conditions in the area of deployment and preferably provide this measurement data to the network . This way, the weather information collected by the environmental condition instruments  is accessible from a remote location. Thus, by providing the measurement data to the network , the measurement data is available \u201conline\u201d. By way of example, the environmental condition instruments  may be coupled to a micro-controller  via standard network connections such as RS232 or Ethernet. The micro-controller  is preferably coupled to the network  through a network monitoring\/management interface  and a main network interface . The main network interface  is used to route data traffic between the free-space optical communication network  and the alternate (or redundant) communication path .","The alternate communication path  may comprise many different types of communication paths. For example, the alternate communication path  may comprise an independent wireless system such as a radio frequency (RF) or microwave system, fiber optic based system, wire based system, leased line, etc. The alternate communication path  preferably comprises a type of communication path that is independent of the troublesome environmental conditions, i.e., a communication path that is not affected by the same environmental or weather conditions. The alternate communication path  may even comprise a different free-space link in a different geographic location that is not subject to the same environmental conditions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","202","204","206","208","210","200","102"]},"One such alternate communication path could be an RF communication path . By way of example, the RF communication path  may be implemented with RF transceivers ,  mounted on the optical transceivers , , respectively. By way of further example, the RF communication path  may be provided by devices of the type described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/482,782. Another such alternate communication path could be provided by a wire cable  that runs between the buildings , . Similarly, if there were a fiber optic cable running between the buildings , , it could also be used as the alternate communication path.","The alternate communication path may also make use of different modes of communication and\/or be routed to the destination in an indirect manner. For example, the network data traffic could be routed over a fiber optic cable  from building  to building . From there, the network data traffic could be routed over a free-space link  to building , and then over another free-space link  to the destination building . Use of the free-space links ,  may be possible if they are not affected by the same microclimate affecting the free-space link . This may be the case since the visibility meter  is installed on building , which could be more than two miles away from buildings , , . Additional visibility meters could be installed on one or more of the other buildings , ,  in order to more closely pinpoint the location of the adverse environmental conditions. If fiber optic cable, wire cable, RF communication paths, or some other type of communication path existed between buildings , , , then one or more of those modes of communication could be used to complete the alternate communication path instead of the free-space links , .","Referring to , there is illustrated an exemplary method of operation  for the free-space optical network management system  () in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The monitoring facility that implements the method  may be a standard network management software program, such as simple network management protocol (SNMP), or a hardware based management facility\/system. As indicated in step , the network data traffic is typically first directed over the optical path, i.e., one or more free-space links. The management system  can keep track of whether the optical path or an alternate path is currently being used by, for example, setting a variable or flag such as communication path (CP)=optical (OPT), as indicated in step .","While the network data traffic is being communicated over either the optical path (i.e., free-space links) or an alternate communication path, the management system  monitors or observes one or more environmental conditions in the vicinity of at least one of the free-space links, as indicate by step . Measurements of such conditions are taken by one or more environmental condition instruments that are preferably located in the vicinity of at least one of the free-space links. The data generated by the environmental condition instruments is provided online in the network . As part of the monitoring function of step , the micro-controller  preferably polls the environmental condition instruments and stores weather related information in a memory. If measurement data corresponding to selected ones of the environmental conditions falls below a predetermined level, the micro-controller  sends out an alarm (or trap) to the monitoring facility. For example, an alarm could be generated if visibility reaches a certain predefined minimum value. For the remainder of this discussion it will be assumed that a visibility meter is used as the environmental condition instrument(s), but it should be well understood that other types of instruments and meters may be used as described above.","The comparison of the measurement data to the predetermined level is illustrated in step  where it is determined whether or not the visibility as measured by the visibility meter is above a minimum level. If the visibility is not above the minimum level, then an alarm (or trap) is generated. When the monitoring facility receives an alarm, the management system  first checks to see if the optical (free-space) path is currently being used as the communication path for the network data traffic, as indicated by step . If so, then the management system  performs certain countermeasures to prevent the failure of the communication link.","In one embodiment of the present invention, one such countermeasure is to attempt to increase the transmission power or the receive sensitivity of one or more of the free-space optical communication links to improve the link budget. Increasing the power of the laser transmitter and\/or increasing the sensitivity of the laser receiver is one procedure that can be used to counteract the potential loss of the communication link due to adverse weather conditions. Thus, in step  the management system  checks to see if the free-space system even has such automatic power control. If so, then in step  the management system  checks whether or not the power level can be adjusted. Specifically, this power adjustment procedure may not be effective because the system has already reached its transmitter and\/or receiver limitation. If the power level or receive sensitivity can be adjusted, then such adjustment takes place in step  and control is passed back to the monitoring step .","If the free-space system does not have automatic power control, or the power level and receive sensitivity cannot be adjusted, the network traffic is routed or redirected through an alternate communication path. The management system  performs an alternate communication path selection method in step , an exemplary version of which is described in further detail below. In step  the network traffic is routed or redirected through the selected alternate communication path. The flag CP is set equal to ALTin step , where n indicates the selected alternate communication path. Monitoring of the visibility data then continues in step .","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the countermeasure performed by the management system  is to switch immediately to an alternate communication path without performing prior power or sensitivity adjustment. Therefore, in such alternative embodiment steps ,  and  would be eliminated and a \u201cYes\u201d response to step  would pass control directly to step .","After a power adjustment has been made or an alternate communication path has been activated, the management system  continues to monitor the environmental conditions in step . If measurement data collected by the visibility meter (or other environmental condition instrument) indicates that the environmental conditions are back to a level to where the free-space optical network  can function properly, the micro-controller notifies the monitoring facility. Thus, such notification is generated if in step  it is determined that the visibility is above the minimum level. If so, then in step  the management system  checks whether or not the optical (free-space) path is currently being used as the communication path for the network data traffic. If CP=ALT, then an alternate communication path is currently being used instead of the optical (free-space) path. In this scenario the management system  reactivates the optical path and redirects the network data traffic over the free-space links, as indicated by step . In step  the flag CP is set equal to OPT in order to indicate that the optical path is currently being used as the communication path.","If in step  the management system  determines that CP=OPT, indicating that the optical (free-space) path is currently being used as the communication path, then no change in the communication path is needed since visibility is above the minimum level, as determined by step . While no change in the communication path is needed, it may be desirable to adjust the power level or sensitivity of the free-space link. Specifically, if power level or sensitivity was previously adjusted in step  because the visibility was previously below the minimum level, then it may be desirable to re-adjust the power level or sensitivity once the visibility rises back above the minimum level. Such adjustments can be made in step . Furthermore, such adjustments may be desirable after switching back to the optical path from the alternate path, and therefore, control is passed from step  to step . It should be well understood, however, that step  is an optional feature of the present invention.","During the time that the network traffic is being routed through an alternate communication path, it may be desirable to re-evaluate the alternate communication path selection. Thus, if in steps  and  it is determined that visibility continues to be below the minimum level and that an alternate communication path is already being used for the network traffic, the selection of the specific alternate communication path can be re-evaluated in step . Such re-evaluation may be desirable in view of changes in data rate requirements of the network traffic, duration of the poor visibility or other inclement weather conditions, costs associated with the current alternate communication path, etc. By way of example, the method used for the re-evaluation step  may be similar to, or the same as, the alternate path selection method .","Referring to , there is illustrated an exemplary alternate communication path selection method  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method  starts at step . In step  the management system  determines whether or not any other free-space link(s) are available to the destination. If so, then in step  the management system  checks to see if these other free-space links are currently all operating. For example, these other free-space links may not be operating due to inclement weather conditions or other technical problems. Assuming that these other free-space links are all operating such that a complete path can be formed to the destination, then in step  they are selected as the alternate path. The method  ends in step  where control is passed to step  (FIG. ).","If there are no other free-space links to the destination or they are not all operational, control is passed to step . In step  the management system  determines whether or not there is more than one alternate path available. If not, then the only available alternate path is selected in step . If there is more than one alternate path available, then in step  the management system  determines whether or not a high data rate is required. If a high data rate is not required, then, for example, a radio frequency (RF) path can be selected as the alternate path in step . If a high data rate is required, then in step  a fiber optic cable, wire, or a high-speed RF path can be selected as the alternate path. Preferably, the least expensive alternate path is selected. In some embodiments, the high-speed RF path may have a higher data rate than the wire path.","It was mentioned above that the data generated by the environmental condition instruments is provided online in the network . If the free-space optical communication network  is coupled to other networks, such as for example the Internet, then the environmental condition data, such as visibility data, will be accessible from nearly anywhere in the world. This allows the free-space optical network management system  to reside or be controlled from remote locations. In alternative embodiments of the present invention many different free-space optical communication networks, perhaps located in one or more countries, could be managed\/controlled by one remote management system .","Thus, the free-space optical network management system and methods described herein use environmental, atmospheric, and\/or weather conditions, such as visibility data, to actively manage\/control the performance of free space optical links. Environmental condition instruments may be used within the free-space optical network to actively monitor the system and perform power adjustment within the system and\/or switch to an alternate or redundant networking path. The environmental information may be provided online, and the network management system may use the online environmental information to manage one or more free space optical communication systems from a remote location.","While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following more particular description thereof, presented in conjunction with the following drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
