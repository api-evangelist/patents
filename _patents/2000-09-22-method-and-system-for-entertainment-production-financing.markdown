{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a method and system for entertainment production financing. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system that simultaneously provides (1) the general public with an on-line investment opportunity to purchase securities whose return, if any, is based on the performance of entertainment productions distributed by major entertainment companies; (2) the general public with an on-line investment opportunity requiring only a very modest investment amount that is proportionate to the investor's financial capacity to absorb risk; and (3) major entertainment companies with the opportunity to secure significant amounts of guaranteed equity-based financing for a significant number of entertainment productions on a cost efficient basis through a system (described herein) involving a new source of equity capital from the general public which has not been available prior to this invention.","2. Related Art","The business of producing, distributing and exploiting entertainment productions, e.g., motion pictures, television and cable programming, music, videos, video games and digital entertainment programming (\u201cEntertainment Productions\u201d) is subject to a high degree of risk. This is because the cost structure for producing Entertainment Productions is high and heavily front end-loaded, whereas the revenue structure for the distribution and other exploitation of Entertainment Productions is back-end loaded and speculative (since it is highly dependent on public tastes and attitudes which are unpredictable and which are subject to sudden change for a variety of reasons, including the availability of other competing Entertainment Productions and other types of entertainment).","The production, distribution and exploitation of Entertainment Productions requires the commitment of multimillion dollar expenditures based largely on a preproduction subjective evaluation of the commercial potential of a proposed project (typically determined years before the completion and distribution of the project). These production costs, as well as the costs of marketing and distributing Entertainment Productions, have increased significantly in recent years and at a rate faster than the general rate of increase in revenues generated from the distribution and other exploitation of Entertainment Productions. This is because of a multiplicity of factors beyond the control of producers of Entertainment Productions, including ever-increasing compensation demands of creative and artistic talent, scarcity of commercially viable intellectual properties, intense-competition among producers and distributors of all forms of entertainment products, the increasing number of entertainment products, and the increasing diversity of different types of entertainment, all vying for the leisure time spending of the consuming public.","As a result of these and other fluctuating, unpredictable and subjective factors, a significant percentage of Entertainment Productions annually produced and distributed by major entertainment companies (as well as smaller independent production companies) are unprofitable after taking into account the relevant production costs, distribution fees, distribution, marketing and promotional expenses, contingent compensation payable to creative and artistic talent, amounts payable under applicable union agreements and interest expenses.","In order to manage the risk inherent in the business of producing and distributing Entertainment Productions, and in particular, motion pictures, the major entertainment companies have resorted to a wide variety of risk mitigation strategies, principally the \u201cPortfolio Strategy,\u201d and the \u201cRisk Transfer Strategy.\u201d The \u201cPortfolio Strategy\u201d is based on historical performance of a large number of Entertainment Productions over a long period of time. This strategy assumes that there is a high degree of statistical probability that if a major entertainment company distributes a sufficient number of Entertainment Productions (i.e., a \u201cPortfolio\u201d) on a continuous basis over a long enough period of time, the entertainment company will, on average over the long-term, derive enough aggregate profits generated by the proportionately fewer of its profitable Entertainment Productions in its Portfolio to at least absorb the cumulative losses generated by the proportionately greater number of unprofitable Entertainment Productions in its Portfolio.","Because the Portfolio Strategy mitigates, but does not transfer, risk, the major entertainment companies have consistently sought to finance a portion of the production cost of their Entertainment Productions (principally motion pictures) on a risk-sharing basis through a wide-variety of financing transactions. These transactions, referred to as \u201cRisk Transfer Strategy Transactions,\u201d are designed to shift economic risk of loss of one or more Entertainment Productions to investors in exchange for a share of the potential economic benefit generated by the commercial success of the particular Entertainment Productions financed.","Historically, and because of practical market considerations and cost and other constraints on the ability of equity arrangers to efficiently and economically access and aggregate capital for the financing of Entertainment Productions to the general public, the opportunity to invest in these Risk Transfer Strategy Transactions has been limited to strategic and institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Risk Transfer Strategy Transactions have been unavailable to the general public for investments in small amounts. Moreover, only a small portion of the general public, meeting certain financial standards, have been able to invest in Portfolio Strategy Transactions, which still required minimum investments of several thousand dollars and a payment period of several years to realize a potential return of the investment.","Thus, to date, major entertainment companies have been deprived of the ability to utilize modest investments made by large numbers of the general public as a source to provide financing to fund the cost of Entertainment Productions. Likewise, the general public has been deprived of the opportunity to invest very modest amounts in securities which would pay returns based on the performance of one or more Entertainment Productions produced and distributed by major entertainment companies and also on an economic basis proportionate to the investors' financial capacity to absorb risk.","The present invention provides for a system pursuant to which, on a guaranteed long-term commitment basis, a group of two or more major entertainment companies (\u201cParticipating Entertainment Companies\u201d) will create and sell separate contractual interests (\u201cContractual Interests\u201d) relating to a large number of Entertainment Productions produced and distributed by such Participating Entertainment Companies\u2014each providing for a contractual indexed return based on the performance of the underlying Entertainment Production\u2014to a third party entity (the \u201cFinancing Entity\u201d). The Financing Entity, in turn, preferably will create and sell separate mirror contractual interests (\u201cMirror Contractual Interests\u201d)\u2014each preferably mirroring the payout terms of a Contractual Interest purchased by the Financing Entity from a Participating Entertainment Company\u2014to another entity, such as an affiliate of the Financing Entity (the \u201cOperating Entity\u201d) which will \u201csecuritize\u201d these Mirror Contractual Interests (as described below). In an alternative embodiment, the Financing Entity will directly \u201csecuritize\u201d Contractual Interests in the same manner.","In the preferred embodiment, the Operating Entity will create securities based on the Mirror Contractual Interests in the form of \u201cParticipation Trust Units\u201d (as defined below). These Participation Trust Units will be sold in small denominations (e.g., $50\u2013$100 per Participation Trust Unit) to the general public utilizing data processing equipment and a communications network, preferably the Internet. In the preferred embodiment, sales of Participation Trust Units will be made through a website (the \u201cAffiliated Website\u201d), operated by or on behalf of the Operating Entity, and optionally through other authorized websites. In the alternative embodiment, the Financing Entity will create securities based on Contractual Interests in the form of Participation Trust Units, which will be sold in the same manner.","Each Contractual Interest for each Entertainment Production will provide for the Participating Entertainment Company to receive a fixed cash payment (preferably a fixed percentage of the production cost of such Entertainment Production) from the Financing Entity and to pay a contingent amount determined pursuant to a payout schedule (the \u201cPayout Schedule\u201d) based upon the relationship between the production cost of a particular Entertainment Production and a specified performance index. In the case of an Entertainment Production which is a motion picture, the Contractual Interest will provide for the Participating Entertainment Company that distributes the motion picture to pay an amount (the \u201cPayout Amount\u201d) preferably determined by reference to the relationship between the production cost of such motion picture and the cumulative total U.S. and Canadian \u201cBox Office Gross Receipts\u201d generated by such motion picture (i.e., the performance index for motion pictures) as set forth in the Payout Schedule. The Payout terms of the Contractual Interest between each Participating Entertainment Company and the Financing Entity, and the corresponding Mirror Contractual Interest between the Financing Entity and the Operating Entity, preferably will be identical.","All other material terms of each Contractual Interest and each corresponding Mirror Contractual Interest preferably will also be identical except that the Financing Entity will only receive the purchase price of the Mirror Contractual Interest from the Operating Entity to the extent that proceeds from the sale of Participation Trust Units relating to such Mirror Contractual Interests are sufficient to pay such purchase price\u2014i.e., the Financing Entity (not the Operating Entity) will bear the risk that sales of Participation Trust Units will not generate sufficient proceeds to recoup the amounts paid by the Financing Entity to the Participating Entertainment Companies for Contractual Interests.","In the preferred embodiment, the Operating Entity will establish a business trust or other arrangement (a \u201cParticipation Trust\u201d) to hold each Mirror Contractual Interest that the Operating Entity purchases from the Financing Entity and will thereupon sell Participation Trust Units in such Participation Trust to members of the general public as noted above. In an alternative embodiment, the Financing Entity will establish a Participation Trust for each Contractual Interest that the Financing Entity purchases from each Participating Entertainment Company and will thereupon sell Participation Trust Units in each such Participation Trust to members of the general public in the same manner. In this disclosure, the term \u201cParticipation Trust Unit\u201d means an interest in an individual Participation Trust entitling the holder thereof to a proportionate share (based on the ratio of the number of units in such Participation Trust owned by such holder to the total number of units in such Participation Trust outstanding) of the proceeds received by the Participation Trust on account of the Mirror Contractual Interest held (or Contractual Interest, as applicable) by such Participation Trust.","In the preferred embodiment, the Operating Entity preferably will be obligated to pay an amount equal to the proceeds of the sale of Participation Trust Units in a particular Participating Trust to the Financing Entity on account of the purchase price of the Mirror Contractual Interest held by such Participation Trust; and, correspondingly, the Financing Entity preferably will be obligated to pay to the Operating Entity (which, in turn, preferably will be obligated to pay to the applicable Participating Trust) an amount equal to the Payout Amount payable by the Participating Entertainment Company to the Financing Entity with respect to the Entertainment Production to which the Mirror Contractual Interest relates.","In an alternative embodiment, the Financing Entity preferably will retain the proceeds from the sale of Participation Trust Units to recoup the Purchase Price of Contractual Interests; and, correspondingly, the Participating Entertainment Company preferably will be obligated to pay to the Financing Entity (which, in turn, preferably will be obligated to pay to the applicable Participation Trust) an amount equal to the Payout Amount payable by the Participating Entertainment Company on account of Contractual Interests.","The Financing Entity preferably will conduct its business pursuant to a financial plan that allows for the Financing Entity to borrow from financial institutions, and obtain equity, to fund the cost of Contractual Interests. This allows the Financing Entity and the Entertainment Companies to enter into long-term agreements covering a substantial number of Contractual Interests relating to a substantial number of Entertainment Productions over a significant period of time (i.e., several years). As a result, the Financing Entity is able to create and sell Mirror Contractual Interests to the Operating Entity; and the Operating Entity is then able to create and sell to the general public, utilizing data processing equipment and a communications network, preferably the Internet, Participation Trust Units covering Mirror Contractual Interests.","The ability to sell Participation Trust Units over the Internet will also drive traffic to the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites). This will allow the Operating Entity to access a potentially large investor base on an on-going cost efficient basis in order to sell Participation Trust Units (and thus raise capital to defray the cost of Mirror Contractual Interests and, correlatively, Contractual Interests) and to also offer commerce and promotional opportunities associated with the Entertainment Productions, as well as other entertainment products of the Participating Entertainment Companies and other companies, and to offer the opportunity for companies to advertise on the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites).","1. Introduction","The present invention applies to the financing of all forms of Entertainment Productions, including motion pictures, television and cable programming, music, videos, video games, and all forms of digital programming. For illustrative purposes, and not by way of limitation, this detailed description of the preferred embodiments at times shall refer to Entertainment Productions that are theatrical motion pictures distributed by \u201cMajor Studios\u201d.","2. Principal Financial Elements","There are four general, principal financial elements that underlie the present invention and that, in the view of the inventors, have not heretofore been combined in the manner of the preferred embodiments to create a method and system for financing Entertainment Productions.","These four financial elements are as follows.\n\n","The Loan Commitment and the Equity Commitment are preferable for obtaining the Purchase Commitment and the Sale Commitment. The Purchase Commitment and the Sale Commitment likewise are preferable for obtaining the Loan Commitment and the Equity Commitment. These commitments, in turn, provide the basis for the securitization of Participation Trusts by the Operating Entity in the preferred embodiment or the Financing Entity in an alternative embodiment.","3. Securitization of Participation Trusts","A Participation Trust will be established for each Contractual Interest and Participation Trust Units will be sold, preferably in $50\u2013$100 denominations, to members of the public, preferably over the Internet through the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites). The purchase price of individual Participation Trust Units can be made payable by credit card or optionally through an account established with the Affiliated Website. The Operating Entity (or the Financing Entity, as applicable) will \u201csecuritize\u201d each Participation Trust in a manner designed to comply with Federal and State securities laws.","In the case of sales of Participation Trust Units governed by United States securities laws, units in each Participation Trust will be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and otherwise qualified for sale under applicable State securities laws preferably pursuant to a master registration statement process to be negotiated with the SEC (and State Blue Sky authorities) under which an \u201cevergreen\u201d master registration statement (setting forth the overall Participation Trust structure and general terms and conditions of the offering, including all general risk factors and disclosures) would be filed and maintained on a current basis with the SEC (and applicable State Blue Sky authorities) and would be supplemented for each Participation Trust. A prospectus for the offering of units in each Participation Trust would be delivered to each investor, preferably on-line over the Internet through the Affiliated Website.","4. Nature of Participation Trust Units","Each holder of Participation Trust Units (\u201cHolder\u201d) will have a contractual right to receive a proportionate share (based on the ratio that the number of Participation Trust Units owned by such Holder in the applicable Participation Trust bears to the total number of Participation Trust Units issued by such applicable Participation Trust) of the Participation Payout received by the applicable Participation Trust on account of the applicable Mirror Contractual Interest (or Contractual Interest, as applicable), less certain fees and expenses.","The Holder of any Participation Trust Units, the Operating Entity and the Financing Entity will not have any copyright or ownership interest, or other property right, in any Output Film that is related to any Participation Trust, Mirror Contractual Interest or Contractual Interest.","5. Sales and Marketing of Participation Trust Units","In the preferred embodiment, Participation Trust Units will be marketed and sold by the Operating Entity, preferably on-line over the Internet through the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites) for its own account. In an alternative embodiment, Participation Trust Units will be marketed and sold by the Financing Entity in the same manner. As noted above, the Financing Entity will bear the risk that the sale of a number of Units in any Participation Trust may not generate proceeds sufficient to enable the Financing Entity to recoup the amount paid to the Entertainment Company for the Contractual Interest that relates to the Mirror Contractual Interest (or Contractual Interest, as applicable) held by the Participation Trust (a \u201cShortfall\u201d). To enable the Financing Entity to manage the risk of and minimize Shortfalls for, the entity (the \u201cSelling Entity\u201d) that sells Participation Trust Units (i.e., preferably the Operating Entity or, alternatively, the Financing Entity) will have the right (1) to determine the price of Participation Trust Units (which may include a margin over the cost of the related Contractual Interest), (2) to sell Participation Trust Units in packages (as described below) and (3) to create a \u201cspread\u201d on Participation Payouts on the better-performing Participation Trusts.","6. Packaging of Participation Trust Units","In order to manage the risk of inventory losses, the Selling Entity preferably will, from time to time as needed, \u201cpackage\u201d Participation Trust Units relating to two or more underlying Output Films\u2014i.e., couple for sale two or more separate Participation Trust Units relating to separate underlying Output Films\u2014in order to balance to the maximum extent feasible its total inventory of unsold Participation Trust Units (i.e., to insure to the maximum extent feasible that the ratio of sold Participation Trust Units relating to each underlying Output Film to the unsold Participation Trust Units with respect to the same underlying Output Film remains constant). Composition of the packages of Participation Trust Units can be determined by the Selling Entity and optionally can vary on a daily, hourly or other periodic basis as necessary.","7. Pricing of Participation Trust Units","The price of each Participation Trust Unit (or Package of Participation Trust Units) preferably will be determined by the Selling Entity to enable the Selling Entity to sell the maximum amount of Participation Trust Units, which in turn will allow the Selling Entity to pay the maximum amount on account of the purchase price of Contractual Interests and corresponding Mirror Contractual Interests. This in turn, will allow the Financing Entity to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, the equity generated from the sale of Participation Trust Units to public investors (and, correlatively, utilize, to the least extent possible, its own resources) to defray the cost of Contractual Interests. The price of each Participation Trust Unit (or package of Participation Trust Units) can be posted on the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites) and optionally vary on a daily, hourly or other periodic basis depending upon market considerations.","8. Financing Objectives and Benefits","The cost and Payout Schedule for each Contractual Interest and each corresponding Mirror Contractual Interest preferably will be designed to achieve the following objectives:\n\n","The payment schedule for each Participation Trust Unit (or package of Participation Trust Units) is preferably posted on the Affiliated Website (or optionally other authorized websites) and will enable each prospective purchaser of each Participation Trust Unit (or package of Participation Trust Units) to determine with specificity prior to the time of purchase the exact amount of return on investment such purchaser will realize at any given level of indexed performance (i.e., at any given level of total U.S. and Canadian box office receipts) achieved by the Output Film underlying any particular Participation Trust.","Each Participating Entertainment Company will preferably make the Participation Payout payment on each Contractual Interest sold to the Financing Entity on a date soon after the initial theatrical release date of the underlying Output Film. The Operating Entity (or, alternatively, Financing Entity) preferably will make correlative payments to each Participation Trust. In turn, correlative payments preferably will be made by each Participation Trust to each holder of Participation Trust Units in proportion to such holder's interest in such Participation Trust.","10. Accounting and Audit Rights","The accounting obligations of the Participating Entertainment Companies, and the audit rights of the Financing Entity, with respect to Contractual Interests are determined through negotiations between the Financing Entity and the Participating Entertainment Companies within customary motion picture industry parameters.","Holders of Participation Trust Units will not have the right to audit any of the Participating Entertainment Companies and none of the Participating Entertainment Companies will have any accounting obligations to any Holders of Participation Trust Units.","11. User Experience and Content","The user experience at the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites) will preferably provide access, excitement, opportunity and information. Preferably, visitors to the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites) will feel that they are accessing a unique and exclusive experience; that they are on the ground floor of movie projects and industry information; and that they can be active participants in a film financing experience. Unique information with respect to underlying Output Films preferably will be available and continuously updated in compliance with applicable securities laws, such as U.S. Federal and State securities laws. As information and underlying Output Films change, the Selling Entity will be able to change its packages and prices in relation to investor demand. Furthermore, individual investors will have the opportunity to pit themselves against other investors and to track their performance and skills. For example, there could be publicity for those \u201cmini-moguls\u201d interested in displaying their track record and investment acumen and success. There optionally will be opportunities to build content around investment successes, such as the \u201cMini-Mogul Hall of Fame,\u201d and sponsored trips to Hollywood. Premiere invitations and screening tickets to selected individuals can also be part of the Affiliated Website (or optionally other authorized websites) offerings, as can walk-on roles, studio passes and award show tickets. In general, Participating Entertainment Companies will be able to provide compelling and exclusive content early on in the development and production process of Output Films.","Visitors to Affiliated Websites (and optionally other authorized websites) interested in purchasing Participation Trust Units preferably will be presented with information that will help them to determine their decisions in compliance with applicable securities laws, such as U.S. Federal and State securities laws. Output Films optionally can be searched and selected by date, genre, actor, director, producer, or writer, to name just a few categories. Other searchable information optionally can include script synopses, talent attachments, anticipated principal photography dates, and anticipated release dates. To further build the suspense and excitement, Participation Trust Units preferably may only be made available during limited windows of time, strategically determined to maximize the perceived value of certain packages. Weekly box office performance of Output Films can be shown. Other information can include a library of old and new reviews, and historical box office data.","12.

Information appliances  can access a service provider, such as an Internet service provider, either directly or via a network connection, which can be telephone, cable, or other wireless systems. In general, the teaching of this invention may be employed in conjunction with any suitable type of information appliance device  that is capable of communicating with other components of a communications network, and which includes one or more user interfaces for enabling a user to input information, view or otherwise perceive presented (e.g., displayed) information, and select or otherwise manipulate such presented information.","As described above, client information appliances () . . .

Each client information appliance  has an associated communications link  to connect the client information appliance  with an associated service provider, such as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) , or an Internet Access Provider (IAP). Alternatively, a local area network (LAN), local exchange carrier (LEC), Digital Services Line (DSL) or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) could be used. In , each client information appliance  is depicted as being connected to a unique ISP; plainly it is equally possible, and will often be the case, that several client information appliances are connected to the same ISP. Communication links  connect the ISPs  to the network . Each client information appliance , through its ISP, can transmit data to and receive data from the network , in ways that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","Network  is any network of inter-connectable computers. In the present invention, network  preferably is the Internet with World-Wide-Web capabilities. The World-Wide-Web provides access to Internet information and services by using hypertext to organize, search and present information to a user.","Transaction server  is connected to the Internet  via Internet Service Provider  and communication links  and . The server  is for example, a computer or group of computers that facilitate the transmission, storage, and reception of information and other data between different points.","From a hardware standpoint, in this disclosure a server computer, such as server , will typically include one or more components, such as one or more microprocessors (also referred to as \u201ccontrollers\u201d) (not shown), for performing the arithmetic and\/or logical operations required for program execution. A server computer will also typically include disk storage media  (also referred to as a \u201cmemory\u201d), such as one or more disk drives for program and data storage, and a random access memory, for temporary data and program instruction storage .","From a software standpoint, a server computer also contains server software (not shown) resident on the disk storage media, which, when executed, directs the server computer in performing its data transmission and reception functions. The server software runs on an operating system, for example Windows 2000 Advanced Server\u2122 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond Wash.), which is also stored on the disk storage media. Server computers are offered by a variety of hardware vendors, can run different operating systems, and can contain different types of server software, each type devoted to a different function, such as handling and managing data from a particular source, or transforming data from one format into another format.","The server  and the associated memory  and  collectively referred to as  stores various operating programs and routines for controlling server operations. One of the programs that could be stored in memory  is web server software, for example Microsoft Internet Information Server (\u201cIIS\u201d) (or later versions thereof), running on a Windows platform.","Transaction server  contains a stored program that generates the data for the Affiliated Website (and optionally other authorized websites; these and the Affiliate Website are referred to generically as the \u201cWebsite\u201d) and which, when displayed on client information appliances , permit the user to select Participation Trust Units to purchase. The Website data are delivered across the Internet  to users' browser programs. The transaction server  receives electronic information from client information appliances  regarding those Participation Trust Units which a user, using an associated client information appliance , wishes to purchase. A user, after viewing the Website, can select one or more of the Participation Trust Units described on the Website.","The Website has a portion that permits a user to make such purchases after acknowledging that they have read and understand related prospectus information. The purchases are preferably done by a user sending a credit card account number or bank account number, which preferably are encrypted prior to transmission, to the transaction server.

For example, web pages can be combinations of text and tags using a coding system called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which are typically stored on network servers and then delivered across the networks to user's browser programs. The HTML tags serve a number of functions. Some mark portions of the text control how the user's browsers will format text before it is viewed. Other HTML tags represent pieces of additional content that is retrieved and brought to the browsers. This information can be compiled into web pages before a user views them.","Static elements, such as standard text may be stored directly as text in the HTML source text, while other elements, like images and music may all be stored in separate files on the same server or they may be stored at remote geographic locations on separate servers.","HTML tags can be used to bring pictures, movie or video content, sound content, text or any combination thereof to the web page .","Web page  of the Affiliated Website includes entertainment production information that relates to, for example, upcoming movie productions. The web page  is typically designed to display the information in a desired format. Web developers can use a computer program, such as Java\u2122 to create dynamic, real-time web pages to display information received from partner studios. Java\u2122 supports programming on the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets, which are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun Microsystems Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add interactive content to web documents. Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator\u2122) by copying code from the server to the client information appliance.","Alternatively, products from Microsoft\u2122 such as ActiveX\u2122 enable developers and web designers to build dynamic content for a web site. For example, ActiveX Controls, which are small, fast components, enables developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages.
