{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This document generally describes methods and systems for detecting content on a social network.","The present disclosure generally relates to providing detecting content contained on a social network of users. A social network can be an online system that provides a forum for users who are geographically separated from each other to interact with one another. Social networks can be aimed at different aspects of social interaction, such as friendship and business networking.","In general, a user of a social network has a profile page that is customizable by the user. A user can post content, such as text, images, and video, to its profile page. Detection of content that has been posted to profile pages on a social network (e.g., to identify inappropriate content) has included manual review of profile pages.","This document describes techniques, methods, and systems for detecting content contained on a social network of users. In general, content pertaining to a particular subject of interest can be detected on a social network based upon links between users of a social network. A link among users of a social network can be any appropriate sort of connection between two or more users of a social network, such as an explicit acquaintance relationship (e.g., designation as friends, colleagues, fans, blog feed followers, etc.), an implicit acquaintance relationship (e.g., friends in common, messages sent between users, viewing another user's profile page, etc.), a common group membership (e.g., membership in a group related to a particular interest, membership in a group related to a particular geographic area, etc.), participation in a common activity (e.g., users posting messages to the same forum, users playing an online game together, etc.), etc.","Users that share a link on a social network may share similar interests and may post content related to similar subjects on their profile pages. Using information regarding content on a social network that has already been identified as pertaining to a particular subject of interest and links between users, the described techniques, methods, and systems can detect content on the social network that likely also pertains to the particular subject of interest.","In one implementation, a computer-implemented method includes receiving at a first server system information related to users of a social network site hosted on a second server system, and determining by the first server system a social network graph for at least a portion of the social network from the received information, the graph including a plurality of nodes connected by links, each node corresponding to a user that is registered with the social network and that has a profile page on the social network. The method can also include identifying first nodes from the plurality of nodes as including content associated with a particular subject of interest, and seeding the identified first nodes with first scores that indicate profile pages for the identified first nodes are positively identified as including content associated with the particular subject of interest. The method can additionally include determining second scores for second nodes of the plurality of nodes based on propagation of the first scores from the first nodes to the second nodes using the links of the social network graph, where each of the determined second scores corresponding to a second node indicates a likelihood that a profile page for the second node contains content associated with the particular subject of interest; and providing by the first server system the determined second scores for the second nodes.","In another implementation, a system for detecting profile pages on a social network as including content associated with a particular subject of interest includes one or more servers and an interface for the one or more servers that is configured to receive information related to users of a social network site hosted on a second server system. The system can also include a social graph linking module configured to determine a social network graph for at least a portion of the social network from the information received by the interface, the graph including a plurality of nodes connected by links, each node corresponding to a user that is registered with the social network and that has a profile page on the social network. The system can additionally include a score seeding component that identifies first nodes from the plurality of nodes as including content associated with a particular subject of interest and that seeds the identified first nodes with first scores that indicate profile pages for the identified first nodes are positively identified as including content associated with the particular subject of interest. The system can further include an iterative score propagation module that is configured to determine second scores for second nodes of the plurality of nodes based on propagation of the first scores from the first nodes to the second nodes using the links of the social network graph, where each of the determined second scores corresponding to a second node indicates a likelihood that a profile page for the second node contains content associated with the particular subject of interest. The system can also include a profile content detection module configured to provide the determined second scores for the second nodes.","In another implementation, a system for detecting profile pages on a social network as including content associated with a particular subject of interest includes one or more servers and an interface for the one or more servers that is configured to receive information related to users of a social network site hosted on a second server system. The system can also include a social graph linking module configured to determine a social network graph for at least a portion of the social network from the information received by the interface, the graph including a plurality of nodes connected by links, each node corresponding to a user that is registered with the social network and that has a profile page on the social network. The system can further include a score seeding component that identifies first nodes from the plurality of nodes as including content associated with a particular subject of interest and that seeds the identified first nodes with first scores that indicate profile pages for the identified first nodes are positively identified as including content associated with the particular subject of interest. The system can additionally include means for detecting profile pages on a social network as including content associated with a particular subject of interest that is configured to determine second scores for second nodes of the plurality of nodes based on propagation of the first scores from the first nodes to the second nodes using the links of the social network graph, where each of the determined second scores corresponding to a second node indicates a likelihood that a profile page for the second node contains content associated with the particular subject of interest. The system can also include a profile content detection module configured to provide the determined second scores for the second nodes.","Particular embodiments can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Content can be detected on a social network with greater efficiency. Instead of relying upon manual review of the pages of a social network, pages that likely contain content can be quickly located based upon links between users of the social network. A greater amount of content can be located on a social network in less time than under traditional manual review. Additionally, detection of content on the social network using links between users permits for a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, detecting content based on links between users of a social network can have greater accuracy and efficiency than other automated techniques, such as content-based detection techniques.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","This document describes techniques, methods, and systems for detecting content contained on a social network of users. Social networks (e.g., FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, ORKUT, TWITTER, LINKEDIN, YOUTUBE, etc.) provide an electronic environment within which users can interact with one another. Users of a social network generally have at least one corresponding profile page. A user of a social network can customize his\/her profile page on the social network. User customization of a profile page can include posting images, text, videos, graphics, games, interactive applications, etc. Depending on the social network, user profile pages and the customized content contained therein can be viewed by other users and\/or the general public. Generally, users are able to add content to their profile pages for other users to see without the content having to first be accurately classified (e.g., tagged) as pertaining to a particular subject and\/or approved by the social network. While this is desirable for users of a social network, it can be problematic for social networks.","For example, a social network may desire to provide advertising that is related to the content on a user's profile page. However, without a designation (e.g., content tag, content classification, etc.) associated with customized content added by users, the social network may not be able to accurately provide such content-related advertising. In another example, users of a social network may post content that is illegal (e.g., content violating copyright law, content violating penal statutes, etc.), inappropriate for minors (e.g., pornography, \u201cR\u201d or \u201cNC-17\u201d rated videos, adult content, etc.), in contravention of an end user licensing agreement (EULA), etc. Attempts by a social network to remove and\/or filter content that is illegal, age inappropriate, in violation of EULA, etc. can be stifled by a lack of accurate classifications for user-added content.","Social networks can attempt to detect the potentially problematic content through content analysis. However, detecting content pertaining to a particular subject of interest (e.g., advertisement-related content, illegal content, content that is inappropriate for minors, content in violation of EULA, etc.) on a social network by analyzing the content itself can be a difficult task given the large amount of ever-changing user-posted content that is contained on a social network. Additionally, detecting content through content analysis can be complicated by the large amount of image-based content (e.g., photos, graphics, videos, games, etc.) on a social network for which detection is less accurate and more processor-intensive.","This document discloses various improved techniques, methods, and systems for detecting content that pertains to a particular subject of interest based upon links among users of a social network. The various disclosed techniques, methods, and systems can utilize links between users of a social network to detect profile pages that likely contain content of interest. A link among users of a social network can be any sort of connection between two or more users of a social network, such as an explicit acquaintance relationship (e.g., designation as friends, colleagues, fans, blog feed followers, etc.), an implicit acquaintance relationship (e.g., friends in common, messages sent between users, viewing another user's profile page, etc.), a common group membership (e.g., membership in a group related to a particular interest, membership in a group related to a particular geographic area, etc.), participation in a common activity (e.g., users posting messages to the same forum, users playing an online game together, etc.), etc.","Users that share a link may be likely to have common interests and may be likely to post content to their profile pages related to similar topics. Links for a user with a profile page containing content known to pertain to a particular subject of interest can indicate that the profile pages of other linked-to users are likely to also contain content that pertains to the particular subject of interest. Links among users of a social network can be used to propagate classifications (e.g., advertisement-related content, illegal content, inappropriate content for minors, etc.) for content that has already been identified as pertaining to a particular subject of interest to other content for which a classification is unknown.","For instance, a first user and a second user that are designated as friends on a social network may be friends based upon a set of common interests (e.g., the first user and the second user are both interested in tennis). If the first user adds content to its profile page that is related to sports, then the friendship (link) between the first user and the second user can indicate that the profile page of the second user is likely to contain content related to sports as well. A sports classification can be propagated from the first user to the profile page of the second user based upon the friendship link between the two users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","102","102","104"]},"The social network servers  can host any variety of social networks. For example, the social network servers  can host a friendship-oriented social network (e.g., FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, ORKUT, etc.), a business-oriented social network (e.g., LINKEDIN, etc.), a blog-oriented social network (e.g., TWITTER, etc.), etc. The social network servers  store an array of information regarding content posted to and activity on the social network, including links (e.g., friendship, fan, blog feed follower, friends in common, etc.) established between users. As described above, links between users can be established explicitly (e.g., friendship) and implicitly (e.g., common group membership) between users. The social network servers  are informed of established explicit relationships between users (e.g., the social network servers  are notified when a user accepts another user's friend request). The social network servers  can additionally determine implicit links between users based upon a variety of information, such as existing links between users and user activity on the social network (e.g., page views, forum posts, social group participation, etc.).","Links between users of the social network can be assembled into a graph of the social network . In the example graph  that is depicted, the nodes labeled U-U represent users of the social network. The nodes for users U-U are connected by links. In this example, the links indicate that a user of the social network has a relationship (explicit or implicit) with another user of the social network. For instance, user U has a relationship with users U, U, and U, as indicated by the links that connect the node for user U to the nodes for users U, U, and U.","The social network servers  provide social network links  for users of the social network to the content detection server . As described above, the content detections server  uses the links to detect content on the social network of users.","Additionally, the content detection server  receives information  regarding profiles that have been positively identified as containing content associated with a particular subject of interest from an identified profile repository . The content detection server  uses the received information  in conjunction with the links  to detect content on the social network. The received information  can be specific to a particular subject of interest (whereas the links  can be generic). For instance, if the content detection server  is attempting to identify profile pages that likely contain content associated with downhill skiing, the identified profile repository  can provide pages of the social network already identified as containing content related to downhill skiing. The identified profile repository  can include information regarding associations between users of the social network and one or more of a variety of subjects of interest, such as music, sports, adult content, content in contravention of a EULA, etc. In the depicted example, the information  indicates that the profile page associated with the user U has been identified having content associated with the particular subject of interest.","The identified profile repository  can be populated with identified profiles in a variety of ways. For example, profiles can be identified and added to the repository  based upon manual review of profile pages (e.g., profile manually reviewed by social network administrator in response to being flagged by other users), based upon a user adding content that is known\/verified to pertain to a particular subject (e.g., user selects \u201cshare on social network\u201d link\/button on a news website regarding a news article verified by the news website as pertaining to a particular subject), based upon the profile having previously been identified by the content detection server , etc.","For instance, assume user U for the social network visits a website \u201cwww.classicalmusic.org\u201d and selects a link\/button to share a promotional video for an upcoming concert on the social network. The \u201cwww.classicalmusic.org\u201d website can provide verification that the promotional video that is being shared on user U's profile page does in fact pertain to classical music. For instance, meta-data (e.g., tags) associated with the promotional video can be analyzed to verify content associated with the video. In another example, labels can be provided by the classicalmusic.org website that can be used to verify content when seeding nodes of a social graph (as described below in further detail). Based upon such verification, the user U can be positively identified as having content associated with classical music and can be added to the identified profile repository  with such an association.","To detect content on the social network, the content detection server  can construct a graph, similar to the graph , using the received links . The constructed graph can be used to identify relationships that may exist between users of the social network as indicated by links between users. For example, referring to the graph , the users U and U may have similar content on their profile pages based upon the link that connects the nodes for the two users.","Using the received information  that identifies user U has having a profile page that contains content associated with a subject of interest, the content detection server  can seed the node associated with the user U with a score (). The score can indicate that the profile page of the user U contains content associated with the subject of interest. As depicted in social graph , the node for user U is seeded with a score (as represented by the shading of U).","The content detection server  can propagate the seeded score to other users of the social network using the links as depicted in the graph  (). Scores can be propagated to other users of the social network in a variety of ways, as described in more detail below. Generally, a the propagated score for a user that shares direct links with users that have been identified as having profile pages containing content associated with the particular subject of interest will likely be greater than a propagated score for a user that does not share any direct links with any identified users. For instance, a score propagated from user U to user U will likely be greater than a score propagated from user U to U based upon the direct link between users U and U and the indirect link between users U and U.","As depicted in the example graph , the nodes for users U and U are shaded in addition to the node for user U. The shading for users U and U indicates that a high score (in relation to the other nodes in the graph ) was propagated from the node U. The high score was propagated to users U and U based upon user U and U sharing a direct link with the identified user U. Although the user U shares a direct link with the identified user U as well, a high score is not propagated to the user U. In this simplified example, user U does not receive a propagated high score based upon only a third of the links for U being to an identified node (the node for user U), whereas at least half of the links for users U and U are to an identified node (U). The user U may be linked to user U for reasons unrelated to the particular subject of interest, as evidenced by the majority of its links being to user that are not identified as having a profile page with content associated with the subject of interest.","Based upon the propagated scores, the profiles for users U and U can be identified as likely containing content associated with the particular subject (). The content detection server  can determine whether a propagated score indicates a likelihood of a profile page containing content associated with the particular subject of interest using a variety of techniques, such as a propagated score threshold (e.g., scores greater than the threshold indicate the associated profile page is likely to contain the content of interest), selecting the nodes with the top N scores (e.g., top 2 nodes, top 1% of nodes, etc.), etc.","The content detection server  provides the identified profiles U and U as output (). The identified profiles U and U can be provided to a client that requested content detection on the social network. For example, the social network servers  can request content be detected by the content detection server  for a variety of reasons (e.g., identify content in contravention of the EULA, etc.) and can be provided with information identifying users U and U. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the request from the social network servers , a variety of actions can be taken with regard to users U and U (e.g., target for advertising, lock or restrict access to profile pages, etc.).","In another example, an advertiser's request to target ads at users having content related to a particular topic can be routed to the content detection server . Such a request may come a variety of sources, such as directly from the advertiser (not depicted), through another server (not depicted) that provides opportunities to advertise to users of the social network, etc. The information regarding the identified users U and U can be used to target those users with advertising on behalf of the advertiser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["150","154","152","152","154","154","102","154","152","106","116","120","152","102"],"i":["a","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d"]},"As described above, profile pages for users of a social network can vary greatly depending on the social network (e.g., friendship network, business networking, etc.) and the type of content users are permitted to post. The profile pages -are presented as simplified examples of profile pages. Each of the profile pages -corresponds to one of the users U-U. As demonstrated by the varied fields of the profile pages -(e.g., page presents videos and page presents photos), the type of content presented on a profile page can vary depending on user configuration of the profile page.","Similar to the graphs presented above with regard to , the graph  provides links between the nodes that indicate a relationship (explicit or implicit) between two or more of the users. For example, as indicated in the \u201cFriends\u201d section on the profile page for the user U, a link between the user U and U is a friendship link.","Extending the example from  regarding user U being identified as having content a profile page with content associated with a particular subject of interest, the photos -are indicated as being \u201cknown content\u201d\u2014meaning the photos -are known to positively pertain to the particular subject. However, the question marks (\u201c?\u201d) provided in content - for profile pages and -indicate that a subject associated with the content - is unknown (e.g., no tag associated with the content) or unverified (e.g., the validity of a tag associated with the content has not been confirmed by a reputable source). For instance, a subject associated with the videos -posted on the user U's profile page are unknown, a subject associated with the blog  (which may contain a variety of content such as text, hyperlinks to other content, photos, videos, games, etc.) posted on the user U's profile page is unknown, and a subject associated with the photos -posted on the user U's profile page is unknown.","A content detection server, such as the content detection server  described above, can resolve at least some of the uncertainty associated with the subject associated with the content - by performing the content detection techniques described above and below with regard to the graph . For example, as demonstrated above with regard to , the links between users can indicate that the profile page for user U is likely to contain content (e.g., the photos -) associated with the particular subject of interest.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A"],"b":["200","200","100","200","202","202"]},"To detect content on a social network, the content detection system  interacts with a social network server system  over a network  (e.g. a LAN, a WAN, the Internet, an intranet, a wireless connection, a communicative coupling, etc.). Similar to the social network servers  described above with regard to , the social network server system  can host the social network for which the content detection server system  is attempting to detect content.","The content detection server system  receives a request to locate content on the social network hosted by the social network server system  at an input\/output (I\/O) interface . The request can specify a particular subject of interest (e.g., advertising-related content, adult content, etc.) to be located on the social network. The I\/O interface  can be any variety of interface capable of communicating with other computing devices over the network , such as a wireless network card, an Ethernet card, a telephone modem, etc. The content detection server system  can receive the request from a variety of sources, such as the social network server system , a client computer , etc. The client computer  (e.g., laptop, desktop computer, cell phone, PDA, etc.) can be various entities, such as an advertiser, an advertising server system, a backend computing system for the social network server system, an owner of intellectual property (e.g., copyright holder), a government agency (e.g., law enforcement attempting to locate illegal activity on the social network, etc.), etc.","To process the request, the content detection server system  obtains links between users of the social network from the social network server system . Among a variety of other data regarding the social network hosted by the social network server system , the links between users can be stored in a social network data repository  (e.g., database, file system, etc.). A link management module  that is part of the social network server system  can retrieve the links between users from the social network data repository  and provide them to the content detection server system  through the network  using an I\/O interface . The I\/O interface  can be similar to the I\/O interface .","The content detection server system  can additionally receive information regarding profile pages (or other pages) of the social network that are positively identified as pertaining to the subject of the request. Such information can be retrieved from a repository of identified profiles  (e.g., database, file system, etc.) over the network . In some implementations, the repository of identified profiles  is part of or connected to the social network server system . In some implementations, the repository of identified profiles  is part of or connected to the content detection server system . In other implementations, the repository of identified profiles  is accessible over the network  as part of a freestanding system (e.g., a database server system, a file server system, etc.).","Using a social network graph linking module , the content detection server system  constructs a graph from the received links between users of the social network. The graph can include nodes that correspond to users of the social network and links that connect the nodes, similar to the graphs described above with regard to . A score seeding component  can seed nodes that have been positively identified as pertaining with requested subject (as indicated by the information received from the repository of identified profiles ) with a score that indicates such an identification (e.g., step  described above with regard to ).","An iterative score propagation module  can propagate the seeded scores to other nodes of the created social graph based upon the links between users of the social network (e.g., step  described above with regard to ). A variety of propagation techniques can be used by the iterative score propagation module . In one example technique, the iterative score propagation module  propagates scores from the seeded nodes (the nodes identified as pertaining to the particular subject of interest) along each of the links for the seeded nodes to other nodes. A score that is propagated to a node can be based upon the number of neighbors for the node (e.g., the number of other nodes connected to the node by links in the social graph). For example, a score propagated to a node can be the sum of the scores for each of the neighbor nodes divided by the number of neighbor nodes. Referring to the social graph  described above with regard to , if a score for the node U is seeded as 100, using the described example technique, a score propagated from U to U is 500 (500=100 (sum of scores for neighbor nodes)\/2 (number of neighbor nodes for U (U and U))).","Scores can iteratively be propagated across the links of the social graph. For example, the score for node U can then be propagated to the nodes that are connected to it by links of the social graph\u2014the score for U can be propagated to the node U (and in some implementations to U). Iterative propagation of scores throughout the social graph can continue until a sufficient number of iterations have been reached for the social graph (e.g., 1 iteration, 2 iterations, 4 iterations, 7 iterations, etc.). The sufficient number of iterations can be based upon a variety of factors, such as the size of the social graph, whether the scores have reached a level of near-stasis (e.g., the scores for nodes are changing by a negligible amount with each successive iteration), characteristics of social network (e.g., friendship-oriented social network where links generally represent a more significant relationship among users (e.g., friendship), a business-networking social network where links represent less significant relationships among users (e.g., acquaintance relationship)), etc.","A score dampening component  can be used to adjust scores for nodes based upon the proximity of nodes (to which a score was propagated) to the seeded nodes. Nodes that are further away from a seeding node in the social network graph can have their scores dampened (decreased) by a greater amount than nodes that are closer to the seeding node. For instance, a first node that did not receive a score until the third iteration of score propagation can have its score dampened by a greater amount than a second node that received a score in the first iteration. Nodes that are further away from a seeding node can be less likely to have content related to the subject of interest (e.g., subject received with the request) than nodes that are closer to the seeding node.","One example technique that can be used by the score dampening component  includes multiplying the propagated score by a dampening value (e.g., a number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) that is inversely related to the number of iterations (also referred to as node depth) at which a score was propagated to a node. For example, a first node that has a depth of one (score propagated to the first node in the first iteration) can be dampened using a greater dampening value than a second node that has a depth of three (score propagated to the second node in the third iteration)\u2014meaning the score for the first node will be dampened (decreased) less than the score for the second node.","The dampening value can be computed in a variety of manners. For example, the dampening value can be a dampening factor to the power of the depth for a node (dampening value=dampening factor ^ node depth). As described above, the depth for a node is the iteration at which a score is first propagated to the node. The dampening factor can be a value that is less than 1.0 (e.g., 0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.75, 0.6, 0.5, etc.). The dampening factor can vary for a social network depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of social network, the type links between users in the social graph (e.g., explicit acquaintance relationships, implicit acquaintance relationships, etc.), a likelihood that users of the social network that are not directly connected with by a link indicate something about each other (e.g., a likelihood of content pertaining to the particular subject of interest being present on a distant user's profile page), etc.","A score boosting component  can be used to boost (increase) a score for a node based upon the number of links between the node and other nodes. For two nodes that have the same score, the node that has a greater number of links can have its score be boosted by a greater amount. A node for a user with a greater number of links can be more likely to have content associated with the particular subject of interest on the user's profile page than a node for a user with fewer links. A variety of techniques for boosting can be used. The boosting technique used for a social network can depend upon a variety of factors, such as the number of users on the social network, the propensity\/ease with which users establish links to one another, the type of links that users establish with one another on the social network (e.g., explicit friendship relationships versus implicit acquaintance relationships), the number of links among users on the social network, the particular subject of interest, the type of social network (e.g., friendship-oriented, blog-oriented, etc.).","One example boosting technique employs a function that uses a logarithmic relationship between the number of links for a node and the amount by which a score is boosted. By using a function with a logarithmic relationship, the function is able to account for large variations (e.g., variations by a factor of 10, 100, 1000, etc.) in the number of links that may be present for users.","The example function can be: score(node)=score(node)*(((log (number of neighbors)\/log(denominator))*(multiplier\u22121))+1). The \u201cscore(node)\u201d can be the score for a node during\/after propagation and\/or dampening of scores for the node. The \u201cnumber of neighbors\u201d can be a number of nodes to which the node being boosted is linked. The \u201cdenominator\u201d can be a value that represents an enormous number of links for a user on a social network (e.g., 1,000; 10,000; 100,000; 1,000,000; etc.). The denominator can vary from each social network base upon a variety of factors, such as a number of users, a number of links between users, the greatest number of links for a single users, the ease with which links can be established between users, etc.","The \u201cmultiplier\u201d can be a fixed number (e.g., 0.1, 0.25, 0.67, 1.10, 1.25, 1.4, 1.9, 2.5, etc.) or a determined value. For instance, the multiplier can be a value determined by the following function: multiplier(node)=numerator\/score(node). The numerator can be a value such that nodes with relatively small scores will receive a greater multiplier than nodes that have relatively large scores. For example, if scores range from 0 to 10,000 for nodes, then the numerator may be a value such as: 100; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 2,500; 5,000; 10,000; 20,000; etc. In some implementations, the multiplier can be the minimum value of a fixed number multiplier and a determined value multiplier for each node. For example, using a fixed number multiplier of 0.25, then multiplier(node)=numerator\/score(node) is used when the computed multiplier less than 0.25, otherwise the fixed number multiplier is used (e.g., when the computed multiplier is greater than or equal to 0.25).","A content detection module  examines propagated scores (that may have been dampened and\/or boosted) for nodes of the graph to determine a likelihood that a profile page associated with each of the nodes contains content associated with the particular subject (e.g., step  described above with regard to ). The content detection module  can identify pages of the social network that are likely to contain content associated with the particular subject of interest based upon a variety of factors, such as a comparison between a score for the page and a threshold score, a comparison between a score for the page and scores for other nodes, etc. A threshold score can be selected for a social network based upon various factors, such as a purpose behind identifying content on the social network (e.g., to provide advertisements to users, to locate users that will be deleted for having posted illicit content, etc.). For instance, a threshold score for advertisements can be lower than a threshold score for detecting illicit behavior.","The content detection module  can provide information regarding the identified profile pages to the social network server , to the client , or any other device may have requested that the content detection server system  detect content on the social network. The social network server system  can receive and process the identification information with a identified profile processing module . Depending on the particular subject of interested requested (e.g., content related to advertising, adult content, content in violation of a EULA, etc.), the identified profile processing module  can perform various operations, such as targeting a user for advertising on the social network, restriction and\/or deletion of a user's account on the social network, etc.","In some implementations, the social network server system  and the content detection server system  are part of the same system. In such implementations, the social network graph can be updated by the social network graph linking module  with current information (e.g., \u201creal time\u201d data) regarding users and links as they change on the social network. Using the social network graph updated with current information, the system can detect content on the social network in real time by updating the scores for nodes on the social graph as it changes. The system can continuously detect content on the social network with a real time social network graph and updated node scores using the score seeding component , the iterative score propagation module , the score dampening component , the score boosting component , and the profile content detection module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1A and 2"],"b":["300","300","102","202","300","102","202"]},"The technique  begins at step  by receiving information related to users of a social network. The received information can include a variety of information, such as links between users of the social network (e.g., explicit acquaintance relationships, implicit acquaintance relationships, common group memberships, etc.), profile pages positively identified as having content associated with a particular subject of interest, etc.","A social network graph that includes nodes and links can be determined from the received information (). For example, a social graph similar to the social graph , as described above with regard to , can be determined from the received information. In some implementations, the links of the social graph may be weighted according to a variety of factors, such as a type for each link (e.g., explicit acquaintance relationship, implicit acquaintance relationship, etc), a duration of the link (e.g., friendship link established two years ago), a frequency of interaction between the users connected by the link (e.g., a user frequently views status updates that appear from another user designated as a friend on the social network), etc. Weights can be assigned to links when creating the social graph, for example, by the social network graph linking module  described above with regard to .","Weighted directional links can be used to further indicate which profile pages of the social graph are likely to contain content associated with the particular subject of interest. For example, if the profile page for user U is identified as being associated with adult content (an example particular subject of interest), a link between users U and U that has a greater weight than a link between users U and U can provide an indication that a profile page for user U is more likely associated with adult content than a profile page for user U.","First nodes can be identified from the plurality of nodes contained in the social network graph as including content associated with a particular subject of interest (). The first nodes can be identified in a variety of ways, as described above with reference to  and the described repository of identified profiles . The identified first nodes can be seeded with a first score (). The first score can be a score that is indicative of positive identification. For instance, if scores for nodes range from 0.0 to 1.0 and a score of 0.0 represents a 0% likelihood an associated profile page contains content pertaining to the particular subject of interest and a score of 1.0 may represent a 100% likelihood, then the first nodes can be seeded with a score of 1.0. A variety of score ranges can be used, such as 0-100, \u2212100-100, 0-10,000, etc.","Referring to  as an illustrative example, the social network graph  can be determined (step ) based upon received social network links (step ) for the users U-U. The node for user U can be identified, based upon information received from the identified profile repository  (step ), and seeded with a score (step ) indicative of positively identified content.","In some implementations, nodes that are associated with pages that are likely to contain content associated with the particular subject of interest but which have not yet been positively identified can be included in the group of first nodes. For example, nodes that are associated with profile pages that have been computed to have a high likelihood (e.g., greater than 75% chance of containing content associated with the particular subject of interest, etc.) can be included in the group of first nodes. The likelihood a profile page contains content associated with the particular subject of interest can be determined from the described techniques. Such nodes can be seeded with the first score (the same score as positively identified nodes) or a score that is less than the first score (e.g., a score that corresponds to a likelihood that the node contains content associated with the particular subject of interest).","Second scores for second nodes in the determined graph can be determined based upon the scores of the first nodes and the links connecting the second nodes to the first nodes (step ). The second scores for the second nodes can indicate a likelihood that the second nodes contain content associated with the particular subject of interest. Referring to  again, a likelihood that profile pages associated with the nodes U and U-U (the second nodes) can be determined based upon the links of the graph  that connect to the node U (the first node).","A variety of techniques can be used to propagate scores from a first node to the second nodes. In one example technique, scores are propagated from first nodes to the second nodes based upon a number of other nodes to which each second node is linked. As described above with regard to the iterative score propagation module , a second node can receive a score that is a weighted mean of the scores for each node to which the second node is linked. The weighted mean can include scores for the first nodes to which the second node is linked as well as to other nodes (e.g., nodes to which a score has not yet been propagated).","A determination can be made as to whether more iterations of the step  should be performed (). The number of iterations performed can be based upon a variety of factors, such as the size of the social graph, the number of users on the social network, the type of social network, empirical data regarding a sufficient number of iterations, etc. If there are more iterations to perform, then the step  is repeated and scores are propagated further across the social graph.","If there are no additional iterations to perform, then the second scores for the second nodes can be dampened (). Dampening can be performed in a manner similar to the dampening performed by the score dampening component , as described above with regard to . A second score for a node can be dampened based upon the number of iterations it took for an owner score to reach the node (e.g., the depth of the node). For example, if an owner score was propagated to user U in a first iteration and to user U in a third iteration, the score for the user U can be dampened (e.g., decreased) by a greater amount than the score for the user U.","The second scores can also be boosted (). Boosting can be performed in a manner similar to the boosting performed by the score boosting component , as described above with regard to . Score boosting can be used in a variety of instances, such as when a relatively large number of links (in relation to links for other nodes in the social graph) are associated with a node. For example, for a first node and a second node with the same determined scores, if the first node has more links than the second node, the first node can be more likely to have content associated with the particular subject of interest. Score boosting can be based upon a number of links associated with a node. For example, a user that has a profile page containing content associated with a subject of interest may try to gain more attention for the content by establishing links with other users. Boosting can be used to account for such behavior that may indicate the presence of content associated with a particular subject.","A portion of the second nodes can be identified as positively including content associated with the particular subject of interest (). The second nodes can be identified based upon their owner scores, as determined in the previously described steps. For instance, a second node can be positively identified if the second node has an owner score that exceeds a threshold score. The threshold score can be based upon a variety of factors, such as analysis of empirical data associated with various threshold scores, a purpose behind detecting content on the social network (e.g., advertising, locating illegal activity, etc.), etc.","The identified second nodes can be provided to a variety of entities (). For example, the positively identified second nodes can be provided to a social network server system (e.g., the social network server system ), to a repository of identified profiles (e.g., the repository of identified profiles ), etc. In some implementations, scores for the second nodes are provided in addition\/instead of information regarding positive identification.

The provided information can regard links between users of the social network. The information can pertain to some or all of the users of the social network. For instance, information regarding a sub-graph (e.g., a group of users on the social network with many connections to each other and few to users outside of the group) of the social network can be provided. The information can be provided to a content detection server system, such as the content detection server system , as described above with regard to . In conjunction with the information relating to users of the social network, a request to identify content pertaining to a particular subject of interest can be provided.","Information regarding first users of the social network that have been identified as having profile pages containing content associated with the particular subject of interest can be provided ().

The action can vary depending on the particular subject of interest. For instance, if the particular subject of interest is related to advertising content, then the action may involve displaying an advertisement associated with the particular subject on a profile page of one of the second users. In another example, if the particular subject of interest is adult content that violates a EULA for the social network, the action can involve removing the content from the second users' profile pages, deleting\/disabling the second users' profile pages, etc. In some instance, the action can involve submitting the profile pages for the second users to a queue of profile pages for manual content review.

Establishing a link to the second user can include expressly performing an action with regard to the link (e.g., accepting a friend request from the second user, subscribing to the second user's blog feed, etc.) or implicitly performing an action with regard to the link (e.g., becoming a member of a group to which the second user is also a member). In some implementations, the link can be established without any action by the first user client . Alternatively, the second user client  (a client for the second user of the social network) may establish a link with the first user in a similar fashion (time ).","At time , the first user client  posts content (e.g., image, video, text, game, etc.) to a profile page for the first user.

As described above, the links can represent a variety of relationships among users of the social network, such as explicit acquaintance relationships (e.g., friendship), implicit acquaintance relationships (e.g., participation in the same forum), common social group memberships, etc. For example, the node for user D is connected to the node for user A by a link that indicates the user D has, at the very least, some tangential connection to the user A. As indicated by the shading for the nodes and , the corresponding users A and C have been identified as having profile pages that contain content associated with a particular subject of interest (e.g., music, sports, news, adult content, content in violation of a EULA, etc.).","A chart  depicts propagation of scores for each node on the social graph  through four iterations.

For example, a depth for nodes -for users D-F is one based upon a score being propagated to each of these nodes in the first iteration. A depth for nodes and -is two based upon a score being propagated to each of these nodes in the second iteration. The depth can be used to dampen each of the scores. As described with regard to the score dampening component , the score for each node can be dampened by a factor ^ depth of the node\u2014nodes that have a greater depth are dampened more than nodes that have a smaller depth. Using an example factor of 0.9 for illustrative purposes, the score for the node that has a depth of 1 is dampened from 6,500 to 5,850 (6,500*(0.9^1)=5,850). In contrast, the score for the node that has a depth of 2 is dampened from 6,500 to 5,265 (6,500*(0.9^2)=5,265). A greater score for the node results based upon its proximity to the two seeded nodes and \u2014the node is more likely to have content associated with the particular subject of interest than the node ","As further depicted in the chart , the dampened scores are boosted. The example boosting is based upon a number of neighbor nodes for each of the nodes and -(the scores for nodes and can be excluded from boosting and dampening). A node that has a greater number of neighbors can be boosted by a greater amount (e.g., percentage) than a node having a smaller number of neighbors. A number of neighbors for a node can provide an indication of whether the node will contain content associated with the particular subject of interest. The scores are boosted using the following example function (described in further detail above with regard to the score boosting component ): score(node)=score(node)*(((log(number of neighbors)\/log(100,000))*multiplier)+1). In this example, the multiplier is set to 0.25.
