{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to display systems, and more particularly to display systems with active shutter glasses.","Traditionally, active shutter glasses include an optical stack that includes an active display element between two filtering and polarizing elements. Further, the two filtering and polarizing elements are arranged so an angle of polarization when a shutter of the active shutter glasses is open matches a polarization of a display.","For example, active shutter glasses designed for use with a computer display are usually horizontally polarized, and active shutter glasses designed for use with a television display are usually diagonally polarized.","Thus, in the context of the current example, when the active shutter glasses designed for use with the computer display are used to view the television display, an intensity of a visible signal is reduced since an angle of polarization of light exiting the television display is different from an angle of polarization of the active shutter glasses designed for use with the computer display.","There is thus a need for addressing these and\/or other issues associated with the prior art.","A system, method, and computer program product are provided for determining an angle of polarization for a display device. Further, a polarization associated with shutter glasses is rotated the determined angle for viewing the display device utilizing the shutter glasses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102","100","104","104"]},"The computer system  also includes a graphics processor  and a display  in the form of a liquid crystal display (LCD), digital light processing (DLP) display, liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) display, organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, plasma display, or other similar display. In one embodiment, the graphics processor  may include a plurality of shader modules, a rasterization module, etc. Each of the foregoing modules may even be situated on a single semiconductor platform to form a graphics processing unit (GPU).","In the present description, a single semiconductor platform may refer to a sole unitary semiconductor-based integrated circuit or chip. It should be noted that the term single semiconductor platform may also refer to multi-chip modules with increased connectivity which simulate on-chip operation, and make substantial improvements over utilizing a conventional central processing unit (CPU) and bus implementation. Of course, the various modules may also be situated separately or in various combinations of semiconductor platforms per the desires of the user.","The computer system  may also include a secondary storage . The secondary storage  includes, for example, a hard disk drive and\/or a removable storage drive, representing a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, a compact disk drive, etc. The removable storage drive reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit in a well known manner.","Computer programs, or computer control logic algorithms, may be stored in the main memory  and\/or the secondary storage . Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system  to perform various functions. Main memory , secondary storage  and\/or any other storage are possible examples of computer-readable media.","Further included is a pair of shutter glasses  capable of being worn on a face of a user. While the shutter glasses  are shown to include two elongated members for supporting the same on the face of the user, it should be noted that other constructions (e.g. member-less design, head strap, helmet, etc.) may be used to provide similar or any other type of support. As further shown, the shutter glasses  also include a right eye shutter  and a left eye shutter .","Both the right eye shutter  and left eye shutter  are capable of both an open orientation and a closed orientation. In use, the open orientation allows more light therethrough with respect to the closed orientation. Of course, such orientations may be achieved by any desired mechanical, electrical, optical, and\/or any other mechanism capable of carrying out the above functionality.","For control purposes, the shutter glasses  may be coupled to a stereo controller  via a cable  (or without the cable  in a wireless environment). As an example, in the wireless environment, the shutter glasses  may be in communication with an emitter coupled to the stereo controller , the communication bus , etc. The stereo controller  is, in turn, coupled between the graphics processor  and the display  for carrying out the functionality to be set forth hereinafter. While the stereo controller  is shown to reside between the graphics processor  and the display , it should be noted that the stereo controller  may reside in any location associated with the computer system , the shutter glasses , and\/or even in a separate module, particularly (but not necessarily) in an embodiment where the graphics processor  is attached to a separate interface [e.g. universal serial bus (USB), etc.] on the computer system . In one embodiment, the display  may be directly connected to the computer system , and the stereo controller  may further be directly connected to the computer system  via a USB interface. Still yet, the stereo controller  may comprise any hardware and\/or software capable of the providing the desired functionality.","Specifically, in some embodiments, the right eye shutter  and left eye shutter  are controlled to switch between the closed orientation and the open orientation. As an option, the right eye shutter  and left eye shutter  of the shutter glasses  may be controlled such that the right eye shutter  and left eye shutter  simultaneously remain in the closed orientation for a predetermined amount of time.","In addition to and\/or instead of the foregoing technique, the stereo controller , the display , and\/or any other appropriate hardware\/software associated with the computer system  may be equipped with functionality for adapting the display  in a way that enhances a viewing experience when display content is viewed utilizing the shutter glasses .","For example, in one embodiment, the architecture and\/or functionality of the various following figures may be implemented in the context of the host processor , graphics processor , a chipset (i.e. a group of integrated circuits designed to work and sold as a unit for performing related functions, etc.), and\/or any other integrated circuit for that matter. Still yet, the architecture and\/or functionality of the various following figures may be implemented in the context of a general computer system, a circuit board system, a game console system dedicated for entertainment purposes, an application-specific system, and\/or any other desired system.","For example, the system  may take the form of a desktop computer, lap-top computer, and\/or any other type of logic. Still yet, the system  may take the form of various other devices including, but not limited to, a personal digital assistant (PDA) device, a mobile phone device, a television, etc.","Further, while not shown, the system  may be coupled to a network [e.g. a telecommunications network, local area network (LAN), wireless network, wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, peer-to-peer network, cable network, etc.) for communication purposes.","More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional architectures and features with which the foregoing framework may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user.

See operation . In the context of one embodiment, the display device may include a computer display monitor, an internal display panel of a portable device, a television display, a device capable of projecting images in sequence for transmission to at least one viewer equipped with shutter glasses, or any other display such as the display  of . In another embodiment, the display device may emit light that is polarized. As an example, the display device may include at least one polarizing layer that may polarize the emitted light. Optionally, each type of display device may polarize the emitted light at a particular angle or orientation. For example, the light emitted from a computer display may be diagonally polarized. As another example, the light emitted from a television display may be horizontally polarized. Further, as still yet another example, the light emitted from the display device may be polarized at any angle or orientation.","In yet another embodiment, the angle of polarization for the display device is determined based on the display device.

Additionally, as an option, the EDID may indicate the angle of polarization for the display device. Furthermore, as yet another option, the angle of polarization for the display device may be predetermined based on the type of the display device. Optionally, based on the type of the display device, the angle of polarization may be determined for the display device.

Further, as another example, each manufacturer and model of the display device may be associated with a particular angle of polarization.","Additionally, in one embodiment, the angle of polarization for the display device may be determined utilizing an algorithm. In the context of the current embodiment, the algorithm may include presenting a plurality of images to a user via the display device and changing an angle of polarization associated with shutter glasses (i.e. a shutter glasses assembly) for each image. Furthermore, in the context of the current embodiment, the angle of polarization for the display device is determined based on the user's feedback for each presented image and the angle of polarization associated with shutter glasses.","Further, the image may optionally include a color image (e.g. a solid color image of any color) such as a white image, a red image, a blue image, a yellow image, a green image, etc. Additionally, as another option, the image may include any combination of colors, patterns, shapes, graphics, etc. Optionally, the user's feedback may include at least one subject indicator that a current image being presented is brighter, dimmer, clearer, and more distorted than a previous image or a previous setting. For example, the determined angle of polarization for the display device may include the angle of polarization associated with shutter glasses that provides the brightest and clearest image to the user.","In addition, the shutter glasses may optionally include active shutter glasses (e.g. where polarization elements of the active shutter glasses are capable of being kept in a constant state in order to emulate operation of passively polarized glasses), stereo glasses, etc. For example the shutter glasses may include the shutter glasses  of , etc. As another option, the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses may be changed in fine increments (e.g. 0.5\u00b0, 1\u00b0, 1.5\u00b0, etc.), coarse increments (15\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 25\u00b0, etc.), or any other increment. Further, as yet another option, a search algorithm (e.g. a binary search, etc.) may be utilized for changing the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses.","Furthermore, in another embodiment, based on the user's feedback for each image, the determined angle of polarization for the display device may include the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses that results in the brightest and\/or clearest image. Optionally, the determined angle of polarization for the display device may be stored. Additionally, the determined angle of polarization for the display device may be stored in a memory, a register, a cache, a database, a disk, etc. For example, the determined angle of polarization for the display device may be stored in the database in association with the EDID of the display device.","Additionally, in yet another embodiment, the user may indicate the type of the display device. As an option, the user may indicate that the type of the display device is a computer display, a television display, etc. Further, as another option, the user may indicate the type of the display device via a switch (e.g. a switch with positions to indicate auto detect, computer display monitor, internal display panel, television display, etc.) on the shutter glasses, a switch on an emitter (e.g. a wireless emitter such as an infrared emitter, an electromagnetic emitter, etc.) associated with the shutter glasses, software associated with the shutter glasses, etc. As still yet another option, the emitter may include any device that is capable of transmitting information, instructions, data, etc. to the shutter glasses.","In still yet another embodiment, the angle of polarization for the display device may be determined utilizing a light sensor. Optionally, the light sensor may include any light sensor capable of measuring the brightness, clarity, color, luminosity, etc. of an image. Furthermore, as an option, the light sensor may be located behind a shutter of the shutter glasses. For example, the light sensor may be located behind an optical stack of a shutter of the shutter glasses. Furthermore, as yet another example, the light sensor may be attached to the optical stack, located a distance behind the optical stack, etc.","For example, the light sensor may provide an indication of the brightness for each image presented without any user feedback. As another option, the determined angle of polarization for the display device may include the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses that provides the brightest image to the light sensor. For example, for each image presented and for each angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses, the light sensor may measure a luminance of light transmitted through the optical stack of the shutter glasses and provide feedback that is utilized to determine the angle of polarization for the display device.","Furthermore, an angle of polarization associated with shutter glasses is rotated to the determined angle of polarization for improving at least one aspect of viewing the display device utilizing the shutter glasses. See operation . Thus, the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses may be set to the determined angle of polarization for the display device. As noted above, rotating the angle of polarization associated with shutter glasses to the determined angle of polarization improves at least one aspect of viewing the display device utilizing the shutter glasses, such as a brightness, clarity, etc. viewed by a user utilizing the shutter glasses to view an image displayed by the display device.","In one embodiment, the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses may be changed by changing the angle of polarization of the optical stack for each shutter of the shutter glasses to match the angle of polarization for the display device. As an option, the shutter glasses may be constructed to block transmission of light when a specific charge is applied. As another option, the shutter glasses may be constructed to rotate the polarization of the light and therefore permit the transmission of the light when the specific charge is applied.","In another embodiment, the shutter glasses may include an optical stack for a left eye shutter and an optical stack for the right eye shutter. Further, in the context of the current embodiment, each optical stack may include at least two display elements and at least two filtering and polarizing elements. As another option, each optical stack may be arranged with a first display element in front of a first filtering and polarizing element, and a second display element behind the first filtering and polarizing element and in front of a second filtering and polarizing element. For example, each optical stack may be arranged in order of the first display element, the first filtering and polarizing element, the second display element, and the second filtering and polarizing element.","In yet another embodiment, each display element may include a liquid crystal display (LCD) that is capable of changing a polarization of light. Optionally, the first display element and the second display element may be of the same type or of a different type. As another option, the LCD changes the polarization of the light based on a voltage applied to the LCD. As yet another option, an angle of rotation of the polarization of the light for the LCD may be based on the voltage applied to the LCD. For example, the angle of rotation of the polarization of the light for the LCD may be proportional to the voltage applied to the LCD.","In still yet another embodiment, each filtering and polarizing element may permit a transmission of light in one axis. Additionally, as an option, each filtering and polarizing element may rotated 90\u00b0 from each other. Furthermore, as another option, an LCD element located between each filtering and polarizing element may twist the angle of the light that passes through the LCD element. For example, when each filtering and polarizing element is rotated 90\u00b0 from each other, an eye shutter of the shutter glasses may be altered between transparent and fully opaque by applying a charge to an LCD element between each filtering and polarizing element, which causes an angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the LCD element to rotate 90\u00b0 from the angle of the first filtering and polarizing element thereby allowing transmission of the light through the second filtering and polarizing element.","Furthermore, as yet another option, each filtering and polarizing element may be at a same angle as each other. As another example, when each filtering and polarizing element are at the same angle as each other, an eye shutter of the shutter glasses may be altered between transparent and fully opaque by applying a charge to the LCD element between each filtering and polarizing element, which causes an angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the LCD element to rotate 90\u00b0 from the angle of the first filtering and polarizing element thereby blocking the light through the second filtering and polarizing element.","In one embodiment, the polarization associated with the shutter glasses may be rotated to the determined angle of polarization utilizing the first display element of each shutter. As an option, the polarization may be rotated to the determined angle by altering a voltage applied to the first display element of each shutter. For example, the angle of polarization of each shutter of the shutter glasses may be changed to the determined angle of polarization by altering the voltage applied to the first display element of each optical stack to match the determined angle. Furthermore, as another example, rotating the angle of polarization of each first filtering and polarizing element to match the angle of polarization for the display device results in the light emitted by the display device passing through all of the filtering and polarizing elements of an open shutter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","200","300"]},"In one embodiment, as shown in , an optical stack  includes a first display element , a first filtering and polarizing element , a second display element , and a second filtering and polarizing element . For example, as illustrated in , the first filtering and polarizing element  includes a horizontal polarization and the second filtering and polarizing element  includes a vertical polarization. However, the first filtering and polarizing element  and the second filtering and polarizing element  may include any polarization angle.","As an option, the first display element  may be configured to rotate an angle of polarization of light emitted from the display device  to match a polarization angle of the first filtering and polarizing element . Further, as another option, an amount of rotation of the angle of polarization of the light by the first display element  may be controlled via a voltage applied to the first display element . Additionally, as yet another option, the angle of the rotation of the light transmitted through the first display element  may be proportional to voltage squared (V).","Optionally, applying additional voltage to the first display element  may increase the angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the first display element . Additionally, as another option, applying less voltage to the first display element  may decrease the angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the first display element . For example, when the angle of polarization of the light emitted from the display device  is set at 45\u00b0, the polarization angle of the emitted light may be rotated 45\u00b0 to match the angle of polarization of the first filtering and polarizing element  by applying a lower than normal voltage to the first display element .","In another embodiment, the first filtering and polarizing element  may transmit light based on the angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the first display element  and the angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the first filtering and polarizing element . For example, an amount of light transmitted through a filtering and polarizing element may be defined by the following formula:\n\n*cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8)\n\nWhere in the preceding formula, Lis an input luminance of the light, \u03b8is an angle of polarization of the light, \u03b8is an angle of polarization of the filtering and polarizing element, and Lis a resulting luminance of the light from the filtering and polarizing element. In the context of the preceding formula, the luminance of the light is a measure of an intensity, brightness, etc. of the light. Therefore, as illustrated in the preceding formula, the luminance of the light input to the first filtering and polarizing element  is reduced proportional to the difference in the angle of polarization of the light input to the first filtering and polarizing element  and the angle of the first filtering and polarizing element .\n","Additionally, in yet another embodiment, the first filtering and polarizing element  may transmit light to the second display element . As an option, the second display element may rotate the angle of polarization of the light to match an angle of polarization of the second filtering and polarizing element . For example, when a voltage is applied to the second display element , the second display element  may rotate the angle of polarization of the light to match the angle of polarization of the second filtering and polarizing element  in order to allow the light to be transmitted through the second filtering and polarizing element . Additionally, as yet another example, when a voltage is applied to the second display element , the second display element  may rotate the angle of polarization of the light to be 90\u00b0 out of phase with the angle of polarization of the second filtering and polarizing element  in order to prevent the light from being transmitted through the second filtering and polarizing element .","Furthermore, in yet another embodiment, the angle of polarization of the light emitted from the display device  may be rotated by the first display element  to match the angle of polarization of the first filtering and polarizing element  in order to provide full luminosity of the light emitted from the display device  through the optical stack  to a viewer . Additionally, in one embodiment, based on an angle of polarization determined for the display device , the voltage applied to the first display element  may be changed in order to rotate the angle of polarization of the light transmitted through the first display element  to match the angle of polarization of the first filtering and polarizing element .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["400","400","400"]},"As shown in operation , an identifier for a display device is received.

See operation . Optionally, the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses is incremented for each image presented. As another option, a search algorithm may be utilized to determine the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses for each presented image. For example, a binary search algorithm may be utilized in changing the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses for each presented image. As still yet another option, the angle of polarization associated with the shutter glasses may be changed by varying a charge to a front display element for each shutter of the shutter glasses to rotate a polarization of light transmitted by each front display element.","In addition, as shown in operation , user feedback is received for the presented image.
