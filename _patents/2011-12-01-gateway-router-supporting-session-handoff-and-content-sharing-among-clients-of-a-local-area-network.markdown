No. 61\/540,895, titled SMART ROUTER, filed Sep. 29, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","On-premises wireless routers provide wireless local area network (LAN) access to client devices in both home and business environments. These wireless routers are typically connected to a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet via a high capacity wired or wireless communications link to provide client devices of the LAN with high-speed access to network resources of the WAN. These wireless routers serve as gateways or access points for multiple client devices to concurrently access wide area networks.","A gateway router supporting session hand-off and content exchange among clients of a LAN is disclosed. The gateway router is positioned at a boundary between the LAN and a WAN. A network communications session is established by the gateway router for a first client device of the LAN with a network device of a WAN. The gateway router associates the first client device with a client identity, obtains state information for the network communications session for the first client device, and stores the state information for the network communications session in a profile of the client identity.","The gateway router receives a request to associate a second client device with the client identity through permissions or as a client device member of the client identity. The gateway router associates the second client device with the client identity responsive to the request. The gateway router establishes continuation of the network communications session on the second client device with the network device via the gateway router based, at least in part, on the state information for the network communications session stored in the profile of the client identity associated with the second client device.","Claimed subject matter, however, is not limited by this summary as other examples may be disclosed by the following written description and associated drawings.","A gateway router is described that supports session hand-off and content sharing among clients of a local area network. The gateway router may capture a session state of a user at a first client device to enable the user to continue the session at a second client device. The gateway router further enables content such as files, web links, or other data resources to be shared between client devices. For example, if a user desires to share information with another user of the LAN, the first user can select a graphical user interface on a client device to share information, may navigate the client device to a locally served web interface hosted by the gateway router, or may push a notification to the other user's client device via the gateway router.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","140","150","160","170","110","180","190","110","190","140","150","190","180","110","110"]},"Gateway router  includes a communication interface  to support wired and\/or wireless communications between client devices of LAN  and network devices of WAN .

Gateway router  may further include volatile memory, which may be used in combination with non-volatile memory of storage device  by processor  to execute instructions .","Instructions  may include or take the form of software and\/or firmware. For example, instructions  may form part of an operating system of gateway router , an application program, a software component such as a plug-in, or other suitable instruction set, or combination thereof. In some implementations, functionality provided by gateway router  may be supported, at least in part, by associated (e.g., paired) instructions (e.g., software or firmware) executed at a client device of LAN  and\/or associated instructions (e.g., software or firmware) executed at a network device of WAN  (e.g., server device  or network appliance ). As one example, an operating system or application program of client device  of LAN  may operate in combination with software of gateway router . As another example, software of a peer gateway router (e.g., peer gateway router ) and\/or network server device (e.g., server device ) of WAN  may operate in combination with software of gateway router .","Storage device  of gateway router  may include a data store . Information may be stored at and\/or retrieved from data store  by processor . Such information may include client identity information or other suitable data resources. An example client identity is described in greater detail with reference to . In contrast to traditional data caches, storage device  of gateway router  may additionally or alternatively contain short term information such as session data, and\/or permanent or long term information such as profile information and data resources or objects such as data dictionaries, or renderable content such as chunks of movie data or other media content. Accordingly, gateway router  may include volatile storage such as RAM, non-volatile storage such as FLASH memory, a hard drive, etc.","Client devices  and  may take the form of a personal computer, mobile computing device, mobile communications device (e.g., Internet enabled phone), television set-top box, or other suitable electronic device. As one example, a client device, such as client device , may include a processor  to execute instructions  held in storage device . Instructions  may include or take the form of software and\/or firmware. For example, instructions  may form part of an operating system of client device , an application program, a software component such as a plug-in, or other suitable instruction set, or combination thereof. In some implementations, instructions  of client device  may be configured to operate in coordination with or may be paired with instructions  of gateway router .

Another network device, such as network appliance , may be positioned along a communications path between gateway router  and one or more server devices of server farm . Network appliance  may take the form of a load balancer, application delivery controller, or other suitable network device. Network appliance  may include a processor  to execute instructions  held in storage device . Instructions  may include or take the form of software and\/or firmware. For example, instructions  may form part of an operating system of network appliance , an application program, a software component such as a plug-in, or other suitable instruction set, or combination thereof. Instructions  of network appliance  may be configured to operate in coordination with or may be paired with instructions  of gateway router . Storage device  may include a data store . Information may be stored at and\/or retrieved from data store  by processor .","Computing system  may include other gateway routers, such as peer gateway router . In some implementations, peer gateway router  may be identical to previously described gateway router . For example, peer gateway router  may provide LAN access for one or more client devices. Peer gateway router  may be a nearby\/local gateway router for the same or nearby premises as gateway router , and may provide LAN  in combination with gateway router . In this implementation, peer gateway router  and gateway router  may communicate via LAN . Alternatively, peer gateway router  may be located at a different premises that is remote from gateway router  and may provide a separate LAN to respective client device. In this implementation, peer gateway router  may communicate with gateway router  via WAN .","Gateway router  may use a client identity to define an association of information that includes a profile, a user account representing a human user, and one or more device identifiers representing respective client devices.  is a schematic diagram depicting an example client identity  according to one disclosed embodiment. Client identity  or portions thereof may be stored at a data store of a gateway router (e.g., data store  of gateway router ), at a data store of a network service accessible to the gateway router via a communications network (e.g., WAN ), and\/or at a data store of a client device (e.g., data store  of client device ).","Client identity  may include a user account  having user credentials . User credentials  may be used by the gateway router to authenticate user account  (e.g., via a log-in process). Client identity  may include one or more device identifiers  corresponding to one or more respective client devices. Device identifiers  may include any suitable identifier that enables the gateway router to distinguish client devices from each other. As one example, a device identifier may include a MAC address of a client device. As another example, a device identifier may include or may be based on an identifier of an application program or operating system of a client device. In some implementations, the gateway router may enable users to name client devices, for example, by associating a user assigned name with a device identifier. Because client identity  may include two or more device identifiers corresponding to two or more client devices, an individual user may be associated with two or more client devices by client identity . Conversely, an individual client device may be associated to two or more users, for example, by the inclusion of a device identifier of the client device in two or more different client identities.","Client identity  may include a profile . Profile  may include or otherwise indicate files , sessions , permissions , and\/or user data . Files  may include one or more of the following: (1) files uploaded to the gateway router by client identity , (2) files sent to client identity  by another client device or user account of a different client identity, (3) an index of files stored at each of the client devices corresponding to device identifiers . User data  may include biographical information (e.g., user profile name, user profile picture, user preferences, etc.) and\/or other suitable information for a user represented by user account .","Sessions  may include state information  for network communications sessions and\/or application program sessions. The state information  may be used by the gateway router and\/or a client device to continue an existing session at the client device. State information  may include, for example, a browser cookie or a web cookie. However, other forms of state information may be supported, including state information for application programs.","Permissions  may include one or more permission indicators for client identities, user accounts, device identifiers, etc. Permissions  may be referenced by the gateway router to determine whether a particular user represented by a user account or client device represented by a device identity is able to view or access information of profile , such as files , sessions , user data , etc. Accordingly, permissions  may be defined at the device level, user level, or client identity level which, as previously described, may include an association of a user with one or more client devices. Permissions  may also specify whether access has been granted individual data resources such as a particular file of files , a particular session of sessions , or particular user data of user data . As one example, a user  represented by user account  may permit another user  represented by a different client identity to view or access files . As another example, user  may permit any user to view or access sessions  via a particular client device, such as client device .","A user may register a user account or a particular client device at the gateway router to create a client identity.  depicts a use scenario where user  registers or otherwise creates user account  at the gateway router in which user  is represented by user credentials . User credentials  may be used by first user  across any computing platform to access information in client identity  or services provided by the gateway router. User  may also own or operate client devices  and . Client devices  and  may be registered with the gateway router in which client devices  and  are represented by respective device identifiers . User  may share content of profile  between client devices  and  via the gateway router. User  may additionally share the content of profile  with other client devices through which first user  has provided user credentials  to the gateway router.","Information stored in profile  such as state information  and files  may also be shared with user  via permissions . For example, user  may grant permission to user  associated with client identity  via permissions  to share session state and\/or files with client devices through which user  has been authenticated by the gateway router. For example, user  may access session state and\/or files of profile  from client device  owned by first user , or from client device  that is owned by another user. First user  may also grant permission to a client device  associated with client identity  via permissions  to share session state and\/or files with any user of client device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","300","110"]},"At , the method may include establishing a network communications session for a first client device of a LAN with a network device of a WAN via the gateway router. As one example, the network communications session may include communications between software components at the transport layer, which is Layer 4 according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The network communications session may alternatively include an application program session at the application layer, or Layer 7 in the OSI model. Alternatively, other the network communications session may be at another layer, such as the network layer, or may be a combination of a network communications session and an application program session.","At , the method may include associating the first client device with a client identity. As previously described, the first client device may be associated with a client identity via a device identifier or by a user account of a user operating the first client device. For example, the client identity may include a collection of device identities corresponding to respective client devices. The collection may include a first device identifier defined, at least in part, by an identifier of the first client device, and a second device identifier defined, at least in part, by an identifier of a second client device.","As one example, the first client device may be associated with the client identity by storing a device identifier received from the first client device with the client identity at a storage device of the gateway router. As another example, the first client device may be associated with the client identity by sending an identifier received from the first client device to a network service accessible to the gateway router via the wide area network. The network service may be configured to store the identifier with the client identity at a remote storage device accessible to the network service.","Prior to or during the process of establishing a network communications session, a user may actively register the client identity with the gateway router (or a network service accessible to the gateway router via the WAN) by providing a device identifier of the first client device to the gateway router and\/or by creating a user account at the gateway router that is portable across different client devices. In some implementations, the gateway router may register or passively detect the client identity by detecting a device identifier of the first client device and\/or by passively detecting a user account of the user without requiring that the user actively register with the gateway router. As one example, an operating system of a client device may require that a user log-in to a user account of the operating system. User credentials provided by the user for logging-in to the user account of the operating system may be authenticated by the client device, and an indication of the authentication may be sent to the gateway router to also authenticate the user at the gateway router.","At , the method may include obtaining state information for the network communications session for the first client device. As one example, the state information may be obtained at an application layer (Layer 7) of a network communications session in the OSI model. For example, the gateway router may obtain and store browser cookies or web cookies sent between the client device and a network device of the WAN. As another example, application programs at the client device may report their state to the gateway router via an application program interface (API).","In some implementations, the state information for the network communications session may be obtained by the gateway router passively monitoring communications between the first client device and a network device of the WAN without terminating the communications. In some implementations, the state information for the network communications session may be obtained by the gateway router serving as a proxy for communications between the first client device and a network device of the WAN. In this implementation, the gateway router may terminate connections for communications between clients and the network device of the WAN.","At , the method may include storing the state information for the network communications session in a profile of the client identity. As one example, the state information may be stored in the profile at a storage device of the gateway router. Additionally or alternatively, the state information may be stored in the profile of the client identity by the gateway router sending the state information to a network service accessible to the gateway router via the WAN. The network service may be configured to store the state information at a remote storage device accessible to the network service. This approach may be referred to as \u201ccloud\u201d based storage.","At , the method may include receiving a request to associate a second client device with the client identity. In some implementations, the request to associate the second client device with the client identity may be received from the first client device. As one example, the request may take the form of a permission for the second client device to access the state information for the client identity. As another example, the request may take the form of a request to add or associate a device identifier of the second client device to the client identity. The gateway server may associate the second client device with the client identity responsive to the request.","In some implementations, the request to associate the second client device with the client identity may be received from the second client device. The gateway router may be configured to associate the second client device with the client identity based on the permissions set at the client identity. Alternatively, the gateway router may be configured to forward the request to the first client device responsive to receiving the request from the second client device. The gateway router may receive a response (e.g., as a permission) from the first client device confirming or denying the forwarded request. The gateway router may be configured to associate the second client device with the client identity if the response from the first client device confirms the forwarded request, and may be configured to deny association of the second client device with the client identity if the response from the first client device denies the forwarded request.","As yet another example, the request to associate the second client device with the client identity may be received from the second client device as user credentials. The gateway router may be configured to authenticate the user credentials of the request received from the second client device against user credentials of a user account of the client identity or of a user account permitted to access the profile by permissions. The gateway server may be configured to associate the second client device with the client identity if the user credentials are authenticated against the user credentials of the client identity or of a user account of the permissions, and may be configured to deny association of the second client device with the client identity if the user credentials are not authenticated against the user credentials of the client identity or of the permissions.","The second client device may be associated with the client identity using a similar approach described with respect to the first client device. As one example, the second client device may be associated with the client identity by storing a device identifier received from the second client device with the client identity at a storage device of the gateway router. As another example, the second client device may be associated with the client identity by sending an identifier received from the second client device to a network service accessible to the gateway router via the wide area network. The network service may be configured to store the identifier with the client identity at a remote storage device accessible to the network service.","At , the method may include establishing continuation of the network communications session on the second client device with the network device of the WAN via the gateway router based, at least in part, on the state information for the network communications session stored in the profile of the client identity associated with the second client device. For example, the state information may include a browser cookie or web cookie, or other suitable data resource from which session state may be identified.","As previously described, multiple devices owned or controlled by a user of the LAN may be registered with the gateway router. When a user uses a browser program of a first client, the state information (e.g., browser session state and cookies) for that user are saved at the gateway router. If, for example, the user discontinues or sets down a first client device with a set of browser windows open in multiple tabs, the state of those tabs may be saved at the gateway router. When the user connects to the gateway router with a second client device and launches the browser, the gateway router communicates the same tabs to the second client device, and coordinates cookie proxying so that the cookies are transmitted to the second device. Thus, a user browsing a webpage for products on a first client device wouldn't necessarily be required to re-login with a username and\/or password on the second client device in order to purchase the products via the second device. Instead, the user could push a button, browse to the gateway router to pick up, or just be configured to \u201ccontinue sessions\u201d. Some or all of the states of the browser windows may be accessible on any client device. A user watching a broadcast television stream on a first display device wouldn't be required to remember the address\/channel when picking up the same stream at a different display device. If the cookies have saved the user's state, the user is enabled by the gateway router to resume at the same place the user left off at via the client second device.","As another example, software applications or application programs operating at client devices may maintain state across the client devices via the gateway router. While the applications may not necessarily speak HTTP or other specified communications protocol, the applications may access APIs on the gateway router that enables different client devices to report their state to the gateway router. The applications may access the state of other client devices. A collection of such APIs in a gateway router may provide an operating system for a home or business, where each client device may be a registered, trusted device, used by an authorized user, and may be integrated with other client devices of the user or associated with each other via the gateway router. A seamless user experience may be achieved online and in media consumption across client devices even with the reality of device proliferation. One example of such an API of the gateway router is described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","400","110"]},"At , the method may include receiving a data resource from a first client device at the gateway router over a local area network established by the gateway router. A data resource may include a file, a hyperlink, a URL or URI, an application program or portion thereof, application session state information, network communications session state information, etc.","At , the method may include obtaining permission to share the data resource received from the first client device with a second client device of the LAN. In some implementations, the permission may be obtained from the first client device or from a client identity stored at the gateway router with which the first client device is associated. For example, a request for the data resource may be received at the gateway router from the second client device. The gateway router may forward the request to the first client device, and receive the permission from the first client device as a response to the forwarded request.","In some implementations, the permission may be obtained from the second client device or from the client identity stored at the gateway router with which both the first and the second client device is associated. For example, the permission may be received or authenticated at the gateway router from the second client device in the form of user credentials. The gateway router may authenticate the user credentials against access control information for the data resource stored in a client identity at the gateway router.","In some implementations, the data resource (e.g., file) may be stored in or associated with a profile of a client identity at a storage device of the gateway router. The profile may correspond to a profile associated with the second client device or the first client device (e.g., in a scenario involving a transfer between different client identities), or both the first and second client devices (e.g., in a scenario involving a transfer between client devices within the same client identity).","At , the method may include sending the data resource from the gateway router over the LAN to the second client device responsive to the permission. If permitted by permissions set by a client identity associated with the first client device, the gateway router sends the data resource from the gateway router to the second client device by retrieving the data resource from a storage device of the gateway router responsive to a request received from the second client device for the data resource. As one example, the request received from the second client device may include a request to access the contents of an inbox or other data repository.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","500","110"]},"In some implementations, the gateway router may enable data syncing between client devices sharing a profile of a client identity. For example, a first client device may belong to a user, and may have a number of applications, media content, and session state information stored thereon. The user may purchase or otherwise acquire a second client device, and may then configure the second client device with the applications, media content, and session state information of the first client device via the gateway router.","At , the method may include associating two or more client devices of a LAN established by the gateway router with a client identity. As previously described, the two or more client devices may be associated with a client identity as permissions to access aspects of the profile of the client identity or as members of the client identity (e.g., owned by the same user). At , the method may include identifying data resources stored on each of the two or more client devices associated with the client identity. For example, the gateway router may poll client devices of the LAN to identify data resources stored at each client device. The gateway router may maintain an index (e.g., a file index, an application index, etc.) of the data resources of each client device. The index may be stored in a profile associated with a client identity.","At , the method may include synchronizing the data resources among the two or more client devices associated with the client identity by copying one or more instances of the data resources between the two or more client devices over the local area network via the gateway router. Synchronization may be performed by the gateway router responsive to a request by one of the client devices associated with the client identity, or automatically responsive to identification of a data resource stored on one client device of the client identity not present on another client device of the client identity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Client device  is shown presenting graphical user interface (GUI) . An example user (e.g., Sally) may, for example, log-in to a gateway router interface presented as a GUI via client device  to access information stored in a profile of the client identity at the gateway router. As one example, user Sally may be represented by a client identity that takes the form of a user account. For example, user Sally may access a user account by providing user credentials (e.g., username and\/or password) to the gateway router via client device . As another example, user Sally may be represented by a client identity that takes the form of a device identifier of client device  through which user Sally accesses the gateway router.","GUI  includes an existing sessions list . Sessions list  may be presented as a selectable \u201cSessions\u201d tab as depicted, for example, in . Sessions list  provides an indication of existing network communications sessions associated with the client identity. For example, the client identity may have previously established network communications sessions via client device  or another client device associated with the client identity. Accordingly, these network communications sessions may have been previously established between client device  (or another client device associated with the client identity) and a network device of the WAN. Sessions list  may include one or more selectors (e.g., links) that indicate the existing network communications sessions available to the user. The existing network communications sessions may be represented by one or more Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) or other suitable Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).","User Sally may continue an existing network communications session from client device  by selecting a corresponding selector indicating an existing network communications session from sessions list . For example, responsive to selection of a network communications session from session list , the gateway router may establish continuation of the network communications session for client device  with a network device of the WAN based, at least in part, on state information stored in a profile of the client identity. User Sally may establish a new communications session, for example, by selecting selector  (e.g., \u201cNew Session\u201d).","GUI  further includes a selector  (e.g., \u201cView other user's sessions\u201d) that enables a user to view network communications sessions of other client identities or user accounts. For example, another client identity (e.g., user Mark) may have granted the client identity (e.g., user Sally) permission to view and\/or access network communications sessions of user Mark. User Mark's sessions list may be presented in a similar format to previously described sessions list . For example, user Sally may continue an existing communications session initially established by user Mark by selecting the communications session from user Mark's session list. User Sally may similarly manage permissions via the gateway router to enable other client identities (e.g., user Mark) to view and\/or access existing network communications sessions established by user Sally.","GUI  includes a files list . Files list  may be presented as a selectable \u201cFiles\u201d tab as depicted, for example, in . Files list  provides an indication of files associated with the client identity. For example, the client identity (e.g., user Sally) may have previously uploaded a file to the gateway router via client device  or another client device associated with the client identity. Files list  may include one or more selectors (e.g., links) that indicate the files associated with the client identity. These files may include, for example, image files (e.g., .jpg), word processing files (e.g., .doc, .xls, etc.), instructions set files (e.g., .js), among other suitable file types. A user may navigate between GUI  and GUI . For example, selection of \u201cFiles\u201d tab in GUI  by the user causes the gateway router to send information to client device  to present GUI , which includes a list of files .","GUI  further includes a selector  (e.g., \u201cUpload new file\u201d), which enables user Sally to upload a new file from client device  to the gateway router via the LAN. The uploaded file may be associated with the client identity (representing user Sally as a user account and\/or client device  as a device identifier) by the gateway router storing the uploaded file in the profile of the client identity. Files list  may be updated at GUI  to include the uploaded new file. GUI  provides an example of how a user may browse the contents of a storage device to select a file located at client device  to be uploaded to the gateway router. The gateway router may cause the client device to display a window of available data resources by which the user may select a data resource (e.g., a file) to send to the other client profile, client device, or user account.","GUI  further includes a selector  (e.g., \u201cQuick send\u201d), which enables user Sally to send a file to another client identity (e.g., another user represented by a user account and\/or another client device represented by a device identifier). Responsive to selection of selector , files that are sent to another client profile associated with a target client identity may be stored in the client profile of the target client identity at the gateway router where the files may be retrieved by the target client identity (e.g., user or client device) associated with the target client profile. Alternatively, the file may be sent (e.g., pushed) to a user or client device associated with the target client identity via email, SMS, or other suitable communications format.","GUI  further includes a selector  (e.g., \u201cSync\u201d), which enables user Sally to synchronize files across two or more client devices associated with her user account as previously described, for example, with reference to . For example, user Sally may transfer data, including files, applications, session state information, etc. among her client devices via the gateway router to update the data resources at each client device.","GUI  further includes a selector  (e.g., \u201cview files of others\u201d) that enables a user to view and\/or access files of other client identities. For example, another client identity (e.g., user Mark) may have granted the client identity (e.g., user Sally) with permission to view and\/or access files of user Mark. User Mark's files list may be presented in a similar format to previously described files list . For example, GUI  includes a files list  for user Mark's files available to user Sally. User Sally may manage permissions via the gateway router to enable other client identities (e.g., user Mark) to view and\/or access files uploaded to the gateway router by user Sally.","The GUIs of  may be accessed by users via a special purpose application program dedicated to controlling and managing the gateway router, or via a multi-purpose application program such as web browser or file browser. For example, these GUIs may be presented in a webpage viewing region of a browser, or in a menu system of the browser. As yet another example, the GUIs of  may be presented in a menu system or task bar of an operating system of a client device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 1","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["110","100"]},"The example GUIs of  may be accessed by users in a number of ways, such as the through one or more of the previously described APIs. As one example, a user may navigate a client device to a well-known URI, or capture DNS. As another example, a user may enter a URL or URI (e.g., such as a malformed, but easy to remember URI) in a browser address bar (e.g., such as \u201cROUTER\u201d or \u201cSHARE\u201d). The gateway router may be configured to intercept the DNS query and interpret the query as a SHARE command. In response to the SHARE command, the gateway router may be configured to serve a SHARE interface (e.g., one or more of the GUIs of ) back to the client device that enables the user to share information with another user and\/or client device of the LAN.","In some implementations, the gateway router can be configured to listen for commands, and serve GUIs in response to requests (e.g., the SHARE request) from a client device. For example, the gateway router may be associated with a number of functions, such as \u201cSHARE\u201d, \u201cSETTINGS\u201d, \u201cPICKUP SESSION\u201d, etc. Each function may cause the gateway router to return a different functional interface to the client device or another client device of the LAN to be displayed to a user. For example, the SHARE GUI may include a list of other connected client devices, enabling a user to select a client device or user with which to share a data resource such as a hyperlink. The gateway router may be configured to insert a notification for destination users in a communication stream to enable sessions to be selectively maintained by the destination user. This feature may be implemented as browser buttons, selectors, or controls, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9"]},"It will be appreciated that according to the communication flow of , when a user starts a new browsing session from a new client device, or from a registered client device after a period of registered device inactivity, the gateway router may be configured to intercept the request, and prompt the user for the user credentials of the user account, and then passes the request and appropriate set of cookies to the destination website responsive to authentication of the user credentials.","The captive portal page with log-in interface can also function as way to switch between authorized users on registered client devices and to access existing user sessions. Those users may be prompted to acknowledge the existing sessions (e.g., \u201ctap-to-continue\u201d) or may be required input additional user credentials. One example of a user credentials selection interface is illustrated in . Upon selection of an appropriate username, which may be password\/biometrically protected if desired, a customized menu may served by the gateway router to the requesting client device showing cached sessions for the user from sessions initiated by the user on all client devices of the user's client identity that have connected through the gateway router. The user can then select to view an existing session, in which case the state of the cached webpage will be displayed, and cookies downloaded to the requesting device, so that any subsequent requests from that webpage will properly be sent to the network server of the WAN through the gateway router.","Once a user is registered, the gateway router may also provide a router interface for users to access the gateway router to logoff from the existing user session, or to access other existing sessions of other client identities.  illustrates an example of such an interface, and various alternative mechanisms for accessing the interface. Generally, it is preferable for the gateway router interface to be as unobtrusive as possible during the user browsing experience, but accessible when needed. To that end, the gateway router may be configured to receive search bar entries, or address bar entries, that, when they contain a matching term, such as \u201crouter\u201d or \u201crtr\u201d, for example, cause the gateway router to not send the search request or DNS query on to a remote server\/DNS server. Rather, the gateway router may be configured to \u201ceat\u201d these requests and in response display the interface shown at the right in , which includes various links to access existing sessions. In addition, a dedicated router interface selector icon may be provided proximate the address field\/search field in the address\/search bar. Selection of the icon may be configured to cause the interface at the right in  to be displayed. This bar, may be served by native programs on the client device, and may be scrolled in from off screen by a user to be unobtrusive. Alternatively or in addition, the gateway router may be configured to insert code into the web page code received from a network device of the WAN, to cause a router interface selector to be displayed in a dedicated field proximate the web page, or within the web page itself. This dedicated field may be transparent until tapped\/mouse-over, or could \u201cfly in\u201d or scroll in from off screen when tapped\/mouse-over, so as to be as unobtrusive as possible.","It should be understood that the embodiments herein are illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them.
