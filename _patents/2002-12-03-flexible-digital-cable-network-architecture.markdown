{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to cable networks, and more particularly to a digital cable network architecture that provides improved flexibility for customers, service providers and\/or manufacturers.","Cable system operators charge monthly fees for various services. Cable systems can be implemented using analog and\/or digital networks. The analog cable networks typically offer limited services such as basic channels and premium channels. In addition to basic services, the digital cable networks offer expanded services including one or more of the following: electronic program guides (EPGs), premium channels, impulse pay-per-view (IPPV), video-on-demand (VOD), interactive sports, game shows, web access and features such as e-mail, chat, and instant messaging, interactive games, and\/or services such as shopping (television commerce, or \u201cT-Commerce\u201d), home banking, and personal video recorders (PVR).","Some customers may attempt to fraudulently obtain one or more of the cable services. To maintain revenues, service providers must be able to reduce fraudulent access. The ability to cut off and\/or to identify the location of customers who have fraudulently obtained the cable services would help to reduce fraudulent access.","Service providers must also be able to provide service provisioning in a cost effective manner. In analog cable networks, service provisioning is an expensive process. Referring now to , an analog cable network  includes a cable service provider  that generates cable signals over cable . Cable drops -, -, . . . , and -provide the cable signals to cable boxes -, -, . . . , and -at customer locations. One or more analog filters  are added to each of the cable drops  at the customer locations to disable or filter out one or more premium channels if the customer is not a subscriber. When a subscription change is requested, the cable service provider  must dispatch a crew to the customer location. The crew adds or removes the filters , which remove or add, respectively, a premium channel. The cost of dispatching the crew must be included in the price of the premium channel, which increases the cost to the consumer.","OpenCable\u2122 is a standard that has been defined by cable operators to provide digital cable-ready devices using a common platform. Referring now to , the OpenCable\u2122 standard defines a host , which is typically a set top box - or an integrated television -. The set top box - is typically connected to a television or monitor . A POD module , which is removable from the host , provides security and user authentication. The POD module  contains functionality that is associated with a proprietary conditional access system of a local cable provider or multiple system operator (MSO) . The POD module  is provided by the MSO  and is typically implemented using a PCMCIA or PC card. The POD module  may communicate with the MSO  using an in-band channel - and\/or an out of band (OOB) channel - over the cable .","One goal of OpenCable\u2122 is to provide portability. A consumer who purchases the host  for one cable system can relocate to another cable system and use the same host . OpenCable\u2122 also seeks to lower the cost of service provisioning and to reduce fraudulent access. The OpenCable\u2122 Applications Platform (OCAP\u2122) specifications (OC-SP-OCAP1.0-I04-021028 and OC-SP-OCAP2.0-I01-020419) which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, provides an open interface between the manufacturer's operating system (OS) and the various applications that will run within the host . Currently, developers of interactive television (iTV) applications must rewrite their programs for each proprietary platform. OCAP\u2122 provides a standard application programming interface (API) to allow applications to be deployed on all hosts .","To allow portability, encryption and security are separated from the host  and are located in the POD module . When inserted into the host , the POD module  decodes encrypted content from the cable provider .","OpenCable\u2122 provides channel-based service provisioning. When the consumer requests a premium channel or other resource, the POD module  sends a message to the cable provider . If the consumer subscribes to the premium channel or other resource, the cable provider  sends an entitlement message (EMM) back to the POD module . If the EMM is received, the host  is granted access. For premium channels, the granularity of control provided by OpenCable\u2122 is at the level of a physical channel. In other words, the premium channel is either enabled or disabled.","OCAP\u2122 also specifies a mechanism for detecting fraudulent and\/or compromised receivers in hosts. A certificate, a signature file and hash files are embedded in the receiver of the host. The hash file enumerates a list of hash values for memory blocks in the receiver. A monitor application (MA) reads the blocks of data over a data bus and computes the hash value. The MA compares the computed hash value to the hash value specified in an encrypted file. The MA takes appropriate action such as terminating service and sending notification to the MSO when a mismatch occurs.","There are several disadvantages with the foregoing mechanism for preventing fraudulent receivers. First, the hash file is embedded in the receiver. The contents of the hash file cannot be easily changed without reprogramming the receiver. Secondly, the MA computes the same hash value every time. Hackers can monitor the host data bus for hash calculations. Over time, hackers will figure out the hash function since the computation would be very predictable. In addition, the API for the OCAP\u2122 specification has been published, which includes API's for reading the contents of the flash memory. In summary, the entire firmware is exposed using this approach and the likelihood of fraudulent access is significantly increased.","Additionally, the OpenCable\u2122 standards define a resource manager (RM) that manages system resources such as tuning, audio\/video decodings, graphics plane and background devices. Once programmed, the RM manages resource contention based on predefined default rules that cannot be changed without reprogramming the host.","A digital cable network architecture and services method according to the invention includes a cable medium and a plurality of hosts that include a receiver. A policy file store contains policy files having at least one of a service provider section, a consumer section, and a manufacturer section that can be updated by at least one of the service provider, a consumer and a receiver manufacturer, respectively. A service provider that is associated with the policy file store provides digital cable services over the cable medium to the hosts and downloads monitor applications and policy files to the hosts over the cable medium. The MAs use the service provider section, the consumer section, and\/or the manufacturer section of the policy file to alter resource contention, alter service provisioning at levels below a channel level, and\/or alter fraudulent receiver identification calculations.","In other features, the service provider manages the MAs located on the hosts based on MA versions. The service provider includes a policy file manager that manages the policy files based on policy file versions. A resource manager manages host resources including at least one of tuning resources, audio\/video decoding resources, graphics resources and backplane resources. When resource contention occurs, the resource manager communicates with the MA, which reads the service provider section for resource contention rules. The resource manager resolves the resource contention based on the resource contention rules.","In still other features, when the consumer requests access to a cable channel, the MA reads the consumer section of the policy file and makes an access decision based on the consumer section. The consumer section of the policy file allows access decisions to be based on at least one of channel identification, spending limits, time of day, and violence content.","In yet other features, a computer includes a web browser. A web server communicates over the distributed communications system with the web browser. A policy file manager communicates with the web server and the computer to allow the service provider, the consumer, and\/or the receiver manufacturer to remotely edit the service provider section, the consumer section and the manufacturer section, respectively, of the policy file.","In still other features, the MA has access to at least one of privileged application programming interfaces (APIs) including application filtering, application upgrade, system reboot, resource conflict, event handling, error handling and system functions. An event manager communicates with the MA and that includes an event\/application table. The MA overrides the event\/application table to enforce the policy file.","Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements.","The present invention discloses an open architecture for digital cable services. A monitor application (MA) is periodically updated by the MSO. The MA accesses a policy file (PF) that includes customer, MSO and\/or manufacturer sections. These sections can be changed by the customer, the MSO, and the manufacturer, respectively. The policy file allows the customer, the MSO and the manufacturer to customize their respective interfaces without requiring the host, the receiver, etc. to be reprogrammed.","For example, the customer can use the customer section of the PF to provide additional content, time and\/or monetary control, such as time of operation, program content, gaming content, channels, dollars spent and other details, on levels below the channel level that is currently provided. For example, the MSO can use the MSO section of the PF to update resource contention defaults as situations, business relationships or other conditions dictate. For example, the manufacturer can use the manufacturer section of the PF to alter platform validation calculations over time to avoid fraudulent use by hackers.","Referring now to , a digital cable network  provides digital cable services to a plurality of hosts -, -, . . . , and -. The hosts  can be set-top boxes, integrated TVs, or any other type of host. The hosts  include removable POD modules -, -, . . . , and -, which handle security and encryption. The POD modules  connect the hosts  to the MSO by a cable medium  using in-band and out-of-band channels - and -, respectively. The hosts  may optionally include a web browser .","The MSO  includes a policy file (PF) manager , that manages a PF data store  containing PFs for hosts in the digital cable network . Each PF preferably includes one or more sections. A first or customer section of the PF is for the customer. For example, the customer may use the customer section to provide service provisioning with additional granularity. An optional second section of the PF is for the MSO. For example, the MSO may use the MSO section to define resource permission settings for host applications and to resolve resource contention between host applications. An optional third section of the PF is for the manufacturer. The manufacturer section may be used to periodically modify fraud identification techniques. The sections of the PF can be modified for each host  by the respective section \u201cowner\u201d. In other words, the manufacturer can modify the manufacturer section, the customer can modify the customer section, and the MSO can modify the MSO section.","The MSO, the customer, and\/or the manufacturer may access the PF in several different ways. Computers  that include a web browser  can access the PF over a distributed communications system  such as the Internet. A web server  associated with the MSO interfaces with the PF manager  to change the PF. Hosts  with web browsers  may access the PF using a cable modem over the cable  and\/or using other Internet access methods. When changes are made to the PFs stored in the PF manager , the MSO  pushes the PF to the corresponding host . Alternatively, the MSO  notifies the host  that a new PF version is available. The MSO preferably encrypts the PF using an encryption device  and sends the PF using head end gear . Other services  described above are also provided on the cable  through the head end gear .","Referring now to , the host  is shown in more detail. When initially connected to the digital cable network  and before receiving (or having) a resident MA (MA) , the host  is controlled by an executive application (EA)  stored in memory , which may include read only memory, FLASH memory or any other suitable electronic data storage.","A receiver  monitors an extended applications information table (XAIT)  in the memory . The MSO  notifies the receiver  of a current version of the MA  using the XAIT . The receiver  detects a mismatch between a current MA version (or no MA) and the current MA version in the XAIT . If a version mismatch occurs, the receiver  reads a virtual channel table (VCT) , which identifies a physical channel for receiving the MA . The receiver  tunes to the specified physical channel and receives the MA . The MSO  broadcasts the MA  in a continuous loop, at predetermined times, or in any other suitable fashion on the specified channel. After receiving the MA  and storing the MA in FLASH, the host  begins operating using the MA .","The MSO  may push a PF to the host  when the MA is downloaded. Alternately, the MA  may include a routine to automatically download a current PF when a new MA or new MA version is downloaded and stored in FLASH. The MSO  also automatically downloads the PF to the host  whenever changes are made to the PF. The MSO  preferably encrypts the PF using the encryption device  before transmission. The MA  decrypts the PF and stores the PF (as shown at ) in the memory .","The MSO  may optionally notify the receiver  of a current version of the PF using the XAIT . When the receiver  detects a mismatch between a current version of the PF  (or no PF) and the current PF version in the XAIT , the receiver  contacts the MSO  and requests the newer PF version. The MSO  sends the newer PF version to the MA , which decrypts the PF and begins operating with the newer PF version. Alternately, when changes to the PF are made by the manufacturer, the MSO and\/or the consumer, the MSO  can automatically download the new PF to the MA .","A customer may select a cable channel, games or other content using a remote control (RC)  (which generates a signal that is received by RC receiver ). The customer may also select a cable channel, games or other content using a panel control  on a display , the set top box -, or the integrated TV -. The customer may also adjust audio outputs  and interface with other input\/output devices  using the same or other controls.","A resource manager  manages host resources  such as a tuner , a graphics plane , an audio\/video decoder , background devices  and any other resources. The resource manager  manages contention for the resources  by applications  such as the electronic program guide (EPG), premium channels, impulse pay-per-view (IPPV), video-on-demand (VOD), interactive sports, game shows, web access and features such as e-mail, chat, and instant messaging, interactive games, and\/or services such as shopping (television commerce, or \u201cT-Commerce\u201d), home banking, and personal video recorders (PVR). An event manager (EM)  handles events using one or more tables, as will be described further below. In , the PF  may include an MSO section , a manufacturer section , a customer section , and\/or other sections.","Referring now to , an example illustrating service provisioning according to the prior art is shown. The RC  sends a change channel request, which is received by the RC receiver . The change channel request is transmitted over the data bus to the event manager . The event manager  includes a table of applications, such as the EPG -, APP and APP, that have registered for the change channel event. The event manager  transmits the change channel event to the EPG -, APP and APP.","The EPG - requests the tuner  if needed from the RM . If the EPG - already has the tuner  resource, the EPG - calls the tuning API. Before the POD decodes the channel that is tuned, the POD  (which listens for tuning APIs) sends a request_channel_access message for the appropriate channel to the MSO . If approved, the MSO  sends the EMM back to the POD , which decodes the channel. If the EMM is not received, the channel is tuned but is not decoded. As was described above, this service provisioning method provides access on a channel level only.","Referring now to , an example illustrating service provisioning according to the present invention is shown. The MA  consults the PF  before granting access to the channel . The MA  has access to privileged API's such as application filtering and upgrade, system reboot, resource conflict, event handling, error handling and system functions. In a preferred embodiment, the PF is XML-based program and is downloaded via the POD OOB connection into FLASH memory. The MA is Java-based. While XML and Java are disclosed, any other suitable languages can be used.","The MA  is an unbound application with privileges. The MA  manages the life cycle of all OCAP\u2122 applications, including itself. The MA  provides resource contention, registers unbound applications with an applications database, validates the starting all applications, identifies system errors, and reboots the system. The MA  can change copy protection bits and output resolution using OCAP\u2122 interfaces. The MA  may also filter user input events and change their value before sending them to their final destination. Therefore, the MA  can enable and disable keys on the RC  or other controls , which will enable and disable functions.","In , the RC  sends a change channel request, which is received by the RC receiver . The change channel request is transmitted over the bus to the event manager . The event manager  includes a table of applications that have registered for the change channel event. The MA  can override the APP\/Event table in the event manager . While the table shown in  shows the table including MA  for the channel change event instead of EPG, APP and APP, the table need not be overwritten as shown. The MA  may simply override the current values in the table or otherwise disable the EM for these events and applications.","The event manager  transmits the change channel event to the MA . The MA  consults the PF . If the PF  allows the customer to select the channel (and\/or other content and\/or other resource), the MA forwards the channel change event to the EPG -. Alternatively, the MA can instruct the EM to forward the change channel event directly to the EPG -. Operation continues as described above with respect to .","Referring now to , with reference to , the present invention also allows resource access to be controlled by the MA  and PF . Before granting access to a resource, the MA  checks the PF . If the PF  allows the application  access to the resource, the MA  sends an access_approved signal back to the RM . Otherwise, the MA  sends an access_denial signal to the RM .","The MA  also resolves resource contention based on the PF . The application - may currently have a resource such as the tuner , the graphics plane , the audio\/video decoder , the background devices  and\/or any other resource. The application - may request the resource(s) that are currently being used by the application -. The application - may currently have a resource such as the tuner , the graphics plane , the audio\/video decoder , the background devices  and\/or any other resource. The application - may request the resource(s) that are currently being used by the application -. The MA  and the PF  resolve the conflicts.","The MA  and the PF  may resolve the resource contention based on business relationships. In other words, the MSO  may define the MSO section  of the PF  to resolve resource contention in favor of a business partner. For example, when a first application requests a resource to tune to a particular channel such as Speed\u2122 and another application such as the browser requests the tuner for another reason (and\/or already has the resource), the first application will receive the resource.","Referring now to , exemplary methods for downloading MAs and PFs are shown generally at . Control begins with step . In step , control determines whether the host includes a resident MA. If not, control runs the executive application (EA) in step . In step , control checks the XAIT and VCT and downloads the MA from the MSO on the designated channel. Step  may be performed by having the host send the MSO a need_MA message. The MSO responds to the need_MA message by sending the MA. The host stores the MA in memory and then loads the MA into FLASH memory in step . If the MA is already resident, control runs the MA in step .","In step , the host may determine whether the PF is the latest version. If a version match does not occur, the host takes steps to download the PF in step . Step  may be performed by having the host send the MSO a need_latest_PF message. The MSO responds to the need_latest_PF message by sending the latest PF version. The host stores the PF in memory and loads the PF into flash memory. Alternatively, the MSO may automatically send the PF when changes to the PF occur.","Control continues with step  where the host determines whether the MA is the latest version (typically using the XAIT). If the MA is not the latest version, the host tunes to the channel identified in the VCT and downloads the latest MA version in step . Steps  and  may be performed in a manner that is similar to steps  and  described above. The host manages resources using the MA and PF in step .","Referring now to , steps of a method for managing resource contention using the PF  is shown generally at . Control begins with step . In step , control determines whether an application (APP) has requested a resource. If not, control loops back to step . If the APP requests a resource, control continues with step  where the RM determines whether there is contention for the resource. If not, the RM grants the application the resource in step  and continues with step . Otherwise, the RM sends a message to the MA in step . The MA, in turn, leads the PF to determine whether the resource contention is resolved by the PF in step . For example, the MSO section of the PF may resolve the contention based on business relationship criteria.","In step , the MA sends the resource contention resolution to the RM. The MA may resolve the contention and\/or send a not_covered message if the PF does not address the contention. In the not_covered case, the RM may resolve the resource contention using a default rule. In step , the RM resolves the contention.","Referring now to , the RM also checks with the PF before granting access to a resource even when there is no contention, shown generally at . In step , the RM checks with the MA (which checks with the PF) to determine whether the PF allows the application to use the resource. If not, the RM denies the resource to the application in step .","The PF and MA according to the present invention allow finer control over service provisioning and improved resource contention in the digital cable network  of . The PF and MA allow service provisioning with finer granularity than the channel level provided by the OCAP\u2122 specification.","Referring now to , an example implementation is shown. A single consumer residence includes STB, STBand STB. STBis located in a controlled environments such as the parents bedroom. STBis located in one child's bedroom. STBis located in another child's bedroom.","Service provisioning according to the present invention allows control beyond the channel level. In particular, STBis granted full access to basic channels, three premium channels and games all at times by the MSO and customer PF. STBand STBare granted full access to all basic channels three premium channels and games at all times by the MSO as well. However, the customer PF limits access of STBto basic channels during certain times, to some premium channels during certain times, and to other premium channels during certain times and for games with no violent content. The customer PF limits access of STBto basic channels during certain times, to some premium channels during certain times at certain ratings levels, and to all games during certain times. The customer may also define spending limits for total services and\/or individual services.","As can be appreciated by the foregoing, the digital cable system according to the present invention offers finer granularity of control. The digital cable system allows the creation of tiers of service. The MA can be used to collect usage statistics, which can be used by the consumer for service provisioning. For example, the consumer can set spending limits for pay-per-view or gaming services and\/or total time watched from anywhere on the Internet. Program ratings levels can also be controlled by the consumer.","In addition, the MSO can remotely disable or reboot the host. For example, the MSO can disable or reboot the host when the customer as an unpaid bill, the policy file has been compromised, the host is under some kind of intrusion, or the MSO does not receive the heartbeat of the MA. In addition, when a consumer has multiple hosts, billing detail can be defined for each host.","Referring now to , a MA  according to the prior art includes a fraud control module  that includes a hash function generator and that stores a hash value. The MA  reads a certificate, signature and hash file  that is embedded in a receiver  over a data bus . The hash file  enumerates a list of hash values for blocks of information within the receiver . A hash function generator  of the MA  reads blocks of data over the data bus  and computes the hash value. The fraud control module  compares the computed hash value to a hash value  in an encrypted file. The MA  takes appropriate action such as terminating service and sending notification to the MSO when a mismatch occurs.","Referring now to , a fraudulent access identification method according to the prior art is shown at . Control begins in step . In step , control waits for a fraud_check request to be made by the MA, the MSO or the manufacturer and\/or the fraud_check request may be time based or event based. If the fraud_check request is received, the MA reads blocks of data over the data bus and computes the hash value in step . In step , the MA compares the computed hash value with the hash value stored in an encrypted file. In step , control determines whether there is a match. If not, in step  the MA takes appropriate action such as but not limited to terminating service, contacting the MSO, or any other suitable action. Otherwise, the MA takes no action in step .","As can be appreciated, by sending data over the exposed data bus  and by repeatedly computing the same hash function in the MA , the conventional system has an increased probability of being fraudulently accessed by hackers.","Referring now to , the MA  includes a fraud control module  that generates a fraud request. The receiver  includes a hash function generator  that generates hash values using one or more hash functions. The memory blocks that are used by the hash function generator  may also be varied. The hash function generator  receives the hash function request over the data bus . The hash function generator  generates the hash function using memory blocks in memory . The hash function generator  generates a hash value that is transmitted to the fraud control module . The fraud control module  in the MA  compares the generated hash value with a hash value that is stored in encrypted form in either the MA  or the PF . The hash value may be stored in the manufacturers section of the PF .","Referring now to , a fraudulent access identification method according to the present invention is shown at . Control begins in step . In step , control waits for a fraud_check request to be made by the MA, the MSO or the manufacturer and\/or the fraud_check request may be time based or event based. If the fraud_check request is received, the MA sends a message to the receiver to compute the hash value and transmit the resulting hash value to the MA in step . In step , the MA compares the computed hash value with the hash value stored in an encrypted file and\/or in the PF. In step , control determines whether there is a match. If not, the MA in step  takes appropriate action such as but not limited to terminating service, contacting the MSO, or any other suitable action. Otherwise, the MA takes no action in step .","As can be appreciated, by reducing data transmission over the exposed data bus  and shielding the hash function computation in the receiver, the fraudulent access identification system according to the present invention has a reduced probability of being fraudulently accessed by hackers.","Referring now to , the MA  includes the fraud control module  that generates the fraud request. The receiver  includes the hash function generator  that generates multiple different hash functions. The hash function generator  receives the hash function request over the data bus .","The MA sends a hash function selector identifying one of a plurality of hash functions implemented in the receiver and\/or a data selector for selecting the memory blocks to use. The hash function selector and data selector can be randomly selected from the possible hash functions and data blocks. The hash function generator  generates the hash function using the selected hash function and selected memory blocks in memory . The hash function generator  generates the hash value that is transmitted to the fraud control module . The fraud control module  in the MA  compares the generated hash value with the hash value that is stored and that corresponds to the hash value selector and data selector that is used. The hash value, the hash function identification and\/or memory blocks may be stored in the MA , the PF  and\/or in the manufacturers section of the PF .","Referring now to , a fraudulent access identification method according to the present invention is shown at .

If not, the MA in step  takes appropriate action such as but not limited to terminating service, contacting the MSO, or any other suitable action. Otherwise, the MA takes no action in step .","As can be appreciated, increasing the number of hash functions and changing the memory block numbers will increase the complexity of the hash value calculation and reduce the likelihood of fraudulent access.","Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented in a variety of forms.
