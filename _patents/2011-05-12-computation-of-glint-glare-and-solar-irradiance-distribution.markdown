{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Due to environmental concerns pertaining to the use of fossil fuels in connection with generating electric power, including the non-renewability of such fossil fuels and carbon emissions and other pollutants generated when fossil fuels are burned, an increasing amount of research and funding has been directed towards systems that utilize renewable energy sources to generate electric power. These systems include solar power plants, wind turbines, geothermal power systems, and the like. An exemplary solar power system is a solar power tower (which can also be referred to as a central tower power plant, a heliostat power plant, or a power tower). A solar power tower utilizes an elevated central receiver to collect focused solar radiation from a plurality of reflectors (also referred to as collectors), such as heliostats. Solar radiation is reflected from the reflectors and concentrated at the central receiver, where a fluid is heated. The heating of the fluid can cause a turbine to be driven to generate electric power. Problems can arise, however, when the concentrated solar radiation is not relatively uniformly distributed across the surface of the central receiver. For instance, \u201chot spots\u201d are undesirable on the surface of the central receiver, as damage to the central receiver may occur if too much solar radiation is concentrated at any one portion of the central receiver.","Several techniques have been developed that are utilized to measure irradiance on the surface of a central receiver of a solar power tower. An exemplary conventional method requires the use of a water-cooled flux gauge or calorimeter (a sensor) that is affixed to the surface of the central receiver. This sensor is employed to obtain a measurement of irradiance at the location of the sensor. An electronic image of the surface of the central receiver can then be captured, and intensity values of pixels of the image can be calibrated based at least in part upon irradiance measured by the sensor. This approach, however, requires the utilization of the aforementioned sensor, which can be relatively expensive and difficult to calibrate.","Another conventional approach utilizes a CCD camera to measure the irradiance distribution on the surface of the receiver from a dish concentrator. Instead of using a flux gauge or calorimeter, however, the total power from the dish collector is calculated and utilized to calibrate pixel values of an image captured by way of the CCD camera. This approach requires that an entirety of a beam is captured by the receiver. In operation, a solar power tower can be surrounded by hundreds or thousands of reflectors\u2014therefore, it is impractical to expect no spillage of concentrated light outside of the surface area of the central receiver.","Yet another exemplary conventional approach for computing an irradiance distribution across the surface of a central receiver is the utilization of a flux scanner that can measure their radiance distribution from an entire heliostat field. A flux scanner comprises flux sensors that are included in a long wand that is configured to rotate in front of the central receiver. A remote video camera is used to capture images of the reflected irradiance from the wand as such wand is rotated, and the sensors in the wand are used to calibrate pixel values corresponding to the Lambertian surface of the wand. The resulting recorded images of the wand while rotated in front of the receiver are stitched together to yield a flux map of the irradiance distribution at the aperture of the central receiver line.","Yet another exemplary conventional approach for determining irradiance distribution across the surface of a central receiver of a solar power tower includes the use of a flux measurement system that comprises an infrared camera that measures the surface temperature of the central receiver, and the irradiance distribution across such receiver can be inferred based upon the surface temperature. Utilizing this approach, many processes and parameters must be known to calculate the irradiance distribution across the surface of the central receiver. These include the thermodynamic properties of the fluid that is to be heated, properties of the materials of the central receiver, and heat loss due to radiation and convection. Uncertainty in these parameters and processes and associated parameters that impact these processes, such as ambient temperature and wind speed, can contribute to uncertainties in the calculated irradiance distribution.","Furthermore, as mentioned above, solar receivers are generally surrounded by numerous reflectors (heliostats, mirrored troughs, or dish concentrator facets). From certain perspectives, this reflection of solar radiation can result in an unintended side effect: solar glare. Assessment of the potential hazards of glint and glare from concentrating solar power plants is an important requirement to ensure public safety. Glint can be defined herein as a momentary flash of light, while glare is defined as a more continuous source of excessive brightness relative to the ambient lighting. There is currently no cost effective solution in place to obtain a measure of glint or glare caused by reflectors, receivers, or other components utilized in concentrating solar power systems such as power tower systems, linear concentrator systems (e.g., parabolic troughs or linear Fresnel) and dish\/engine systems.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Described herein are various technologies pertaining to computing a solar irradiance distribution across a surface area of a receiver in a solar power tower or other concentrating solar power system. Additionally, described herein are various technologies pertaining to computing a metric that is indicative of glint and\/or glare emitted from an entity such as a heliostat, a heliostat field, a mirrored trough, a mirrored trough field, a dish concentrator, a receiver, a window, or the like. With more particularity, a solar irradiance distribution across the surface area of a receiver can be computed free of the utilization of one or more sensors applied to the surface of the receiver. Instead, the solar irradiance distribution can be computed through utilization of an electronic image of the receiver in the concentrating solar power system and an electronic image of the Sun.","Electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from the Sun is reflected off of numerous reflective entities, such as heliostats, and concentrated at a receiver, such as a central receiver on the solar power tower. A camera, which may be a video camera or still camera, can be employed to capture an electronic image of the Sun, wherein the electronic image of the Sun has a plurality of pixels that have a plurality of intensity values. Pursuant to an example, to avoid saturation of pixel values, a filter can be employed to attenuate light received at the lens of the camera. This filter may be a physical filter that can attenuate light captured by the digital camera, or may be an electronic filter that performs such attenuation. The digital camera (or another digital camera) can be employed to capture an image of the receiver as solar radiation is concentrated onto the receiver by the reflective entities. Again, a filter that is substantially similar to the filter utilized when capturing the electronic image of the Sun can be employed when capturing the electronic image of the receiver that is receiving concentrated solar radiation. The image of the receiver that receives the concentrated solar radiation also comprises a plurality of pixels that have a corresponding plurality of intensity values. An irradiance distribution on the surface of the receiver can be computed for locations of the receiver that are captured by pixels in the electronic image of the receiver.","Accordingly, a solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the receiver can be computed, and this irradiance distribution can be utilized to identify \u201chot spots\u201d on the surface of the receiver. A hotspot can indicate locations on the receiver where solar radiation is more highly concentrated than at other locations on the surface of the receiver. Again, this solar irradiance distribution can be computed based at least in part upon pixel values of the electronic image of the Sun and pixel values of the electronic image of the receiver in the concentrating solar power system.","With more specificity, one or more digital cameras may be configured to capture respective images of the Sun and of the receiver. Additionally, a value for a direct normal irradiance at a time that the electronic image of the Sun was captured can be obtained, for instance, from a measurement device at the solar power tower. Furthermore, image analysis techniques can be utilized to compute a radius of the Sun in pixels as captured in the electronic image of the Sun. In another exemplary embodiment, a human can identify a center of the Sun in the electronic image of the Sun as well as an edge of the Sun, and a number of pixels between the center of the Sun and the edge of the Sun in the electronic image of the Sun can be identified. Moreover, a value of reflectivity of the receiver can be computed, estimated, or otherwise received. Furthermore, the angle subtended by the Sun can be received, and the irradiation on the receiver captured by pixels in the electronic image of the receiver can be computed based at least in part upon the values of the pixels in the electronic image of the receiver and the electronic image of the Sun as well as the aforementioned other parameters. Furthermore, these pixels can be mapped to physical space corresponding to the receiver.","Additionally, similar techniques can be utilized in connection with computing values for glint and\/or glare emitted from a reflective source, such as a heliostat field, a mirrored trough field or other suitable reflective source. One or more digital cameras can be utilized to capture an image of the Sun as well as an image of the reflective entity that reflects solar radiation received from the Sun. An amount of power per unit area emitted by the Sun can be known and can be correlated to the pixels in the image of the Sun. Pixel values in the image of the Sun can be summed and translated such that the pixel values correspond to an amount of power per unit area (Watts\/m). Pixel values in the image of the reflective entity may also be summed and can be scaled against the pixel values in the captured image of the Sun. In other words, based at least in part upon the values of the pixels in the image of the Sun and the values of the pixels in the image of the reflective entity, an amount of power per unit solid angle emitted from the reflective entity can be computed. Thereafter, an amount of power that is received through the pupil of an eye of an individual can be computed based at least in part upon a known size of the pupil and the amount of power per unit solid angle emitted from the reflective entity. This value of power received at a human eye is indicative of an amount of glint or glare caused by solar reflection from the reflective entity.","Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached Figs. and description.","Various technologies pertaining to computing an irradiance distribution across the surface of a receiver of a concentrating solar power system as well as various technologies pertaining to computing glint and\/or glare emitted from a reflective entity will now be described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals represent like elements throughout. In addition, several functional block diagrams of exemplary systems are illustrated and described herein for purposes of explanation; however, it is to be understood that functionality that is described as being carried out by certain modules may be performed by multiple modules. Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something, and is not intended to indicate a preference.","With reference now to , an exemplary system  that facilitates computing at least one of solar irradiance distribution across a receiver or glint and\/or glare emitted from a reflective entity is illustrated. The system  comprises a first camera  and a second camera . The first and second cameras  and  are digital cameras that capture images in electronic format. Pursuant to an example, the cameras  and  may be CCD cameras, CMOS cameras, or other suitable cameras in which the pixel value scales linearly with the received irradiance. Furthermore, the cameras  and  may be cameras that are configured to capture still pictures and\/or cameras that are configured to capture video. In an exemplary embodiment, at least one of the cameras  or  may be included in a portable computing device, such as a portable telephone, a portable media player, a tablet computing device, or the like. Additionally, both cameras  and  may be included in a portable computing device such that the camera  is configured to point in a first direction and the camera  is configured to point in a second direction. Alternatively, rather than utilizing two cameras, a single one of the cameras  or  can be employed as will be described below.","The first camera  can be positioned to capture an image of the Sun . Accordingly, the first camera  can generate an electronic image of the Sun  that comprises a plurality of pixels that have a plurality of intensity values corresponding thereto. To avoid saturating the pixel values, a filter can be utilized in connection with the first camera  to attenuate light captured by the first digital camera  when pointed at the Sun . For instance, the filter may be a material that is placed over the lens of the first digital camera . Additionally or alternatively, the first digital camera  can have an electronic filter corresponding thereto that electronically attenuates light captured by the first camera  when capturing an image of the Sun .","The system  may further comprise a second camera  that is pointed at an entity . For instance, the entity  may be a receiver in a solar power tower. In another example, the entity  may be a heliostat, a plurality of heliostats, a mirrored trough, a plurality of mirror troughs, or some other reflective entity. While several examples are provided herein that describe the entity  as being a central receiver in a solar power tower, it is to be understood that the entity  may be any suitable receiver that can be utilized in any suitable concentrating solar power system, and the examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. The second digital camera  can also utilize a filter (similar to the filter utilized by the first digital camera  when capturing the image of the Sun ) when capturing the digital image of the entity . In another example, the second digital camera  may utilize a filter that is different from the filter used by the first digital camera , where differences between the filters are known (e.g., differences in magnitude of attenuation can be known). Additionally, the first digital camera  and the second digital camera  may have identical settings (zoom, shutter speed, resolution, etc.) when capturing the images of the Sun  and the entity , respectively. The electronic image of the entity  comprises a plurality of pixels that have a plurality of intensity values corresponding thereto.","The system  additionally comprises a computing apparatus  that receives the electronic image of the Sun  generated by the first digital camera  and the electronic image of the entity  generated by the second digital camera , and computes at least one of solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  or glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity  based at least in part upon the values of the pixels of the received electronic images. In other words, the computing device  can include computer-executable instructions that can cause an irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  and\/or glare\/glint emitted from the entity  to be computed based at least in part upon pixel values of the image of the Sun and the image of the entity , respectively. Additional detail pertaining to the instructions that may be included in the computing device  will be provided below.","As mentioned above, while the system  shows the two digital cameras  and , it is to be understood that the system  may comprise a single digital camera. For instance, the system  may comprise the digital camera  but not the digital camera . In such an embodiment, the first digital camera  can be positioned to capture an electronic image of the Sun  and may thereafter be positioned to capture an electronic image of the entity . Alternatively, the image of the Sun may be captured at a previous point in time and utilized numerous times in connection with computing irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  and\/or glint\/glare emitted from the entity .","In another exemplary embodiment, the first digital camera  may be a video camera that is positioned on a mechanism that causes the first digital camera  to track the position of the Sun  as the Sun crosses the sky. The second digital camera  may also be a video camera that is configured to continuously capture video of the entity . The computing device  can receive video from the first digital camera  and the second digital camera  and can periodically or on demand compute at least one of the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity .","In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the computing device  may comprise at least one of these digital cameras  or . For instance, the computing device  may be a mobile telephone, a mobile media device, a mobile gaming console, a tablet computing device, or some other mobile computing device that includes at least one camera. The mobile computing device may be positioned such that the camera therein captures an image of the Sun  and may thereafter be repositioned such that the camera captures an image of the entity . The mobile computing device  may then compute the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity  based at least in part upon the values of pixels of the electronic images of the Sun  and the entity  captured by the mobile computing device.","In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the computing device  may be a mobile computing device that comprises both the first digital camera  and the second digital camera , wherein positions of the digital camera  and  are alterable relative to one another. Accordingly, the mobile computing device  can cause the first digital camera  to capture an image of the Sun  while the second digital camera  substantially simultaneously captures an electronic image of the entity . The computing device  may then compute one of the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity  based at least in part upon the values of pixels in the images captured by the first digital camera  and the second digital camera .","In another exemplary embodiment, the computing device  may be in communication with the digital cameras  and\/or  by way of a local area network. Thus, for example, the first digital camera  and\/or the second digital camera  (if the system  comprises both digital cameras  and ) can comprise wireless antennas that are utilized to wirelessly transmit images to the computing device  (or an intermediate computing device in communication with the computing device ). Responsive to receipt of the electronic images, the computing device  can compute one of the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity  based at least in part upon the pixel values in the electronic images captured by the first digital camera  and the second digital camera .","In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the electronic images of the Sun  and the entity  can be uploaded to the computing device , which can have a browser executing thereon. The user of the computing device  may then utilize a browser to access a web-based service that facilitates performing the computation of the one of solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  and\/or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity . Alternatively, the digital cameras  and  may be included in a device that comprises a client-side application that can communicate with a web-based service that is configured to receive the image of the Sun  and the image of the entity  and compute the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity . Other architectures that facilitate computing the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the entity  and\/or the glint and\/or glare emitted from the entity  are contemplated by the inventors and are intended to fall under the scope of the hereto appended claims.","With reference now to , an exemplary system  that facilitates computing solar irradiance distribution across a surface of a central receiver on a solar power tower is illustrated. The system  comprises a solar power tower  that comprises a central receiver . The central receiver  is configured to receive concentrated solar radiation from a plurality of reflective entities. Accordingly, the system  may comprise a heliostat  that reflects radiation emitted from the Sun to concentrate the solar radiation at the central receiver . Pursuant to an example, the central receiver  can be surrounded by a plurality of reflective entities such as heliostats, mirrored troughs or the like. These reflective entities can be positioned such that they each reflect solar radiation received from the Sun  and concentrate such solar radiation at the central receiver . A shape of the central receiver  may be arbitrary (planar, cylindrical, etc.).","As described above, the first digital camera  can capture an electronic image of the Sun  and the second digital camera  can capture an electronic image of the central receiver  as the central receiver  is irradiated with concentrated radiation from the heliostat  (and\/or other reflectors). The computing device  can compute a solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the central receiver  based at least in part upon values of the pixels of the images captured by the digital cameras  and . In addition to receiving the electronic images from the digital cameras  and , the computing device  can additionally receive a direct normal irradiance (DNI) corresponding to the Sun  at a time when the electronic image of the Sun  was captured. For instance, this DNI can be obtained through utilization of a sensor that is proximate to the solar power tower . In addition, the computing device  can be configured to perform image analysis on the image of the Sun  captured by the first digital camera  to ascertain a radius of the Sun in pixels. Still further, the computing device  can receive data that is indicative of reflectivity of the central receiver  across the surface of the central receiver . This data that is indicative of reflectivity can be estimated based upon properties corresponding to materials of the central receiver  and\/or can be computed through utilization of images captured by the first digital camera  and the second digital camera  as will be described in greater detail below. Additionally, the computing device  can receive an angle at the iris of the first digital camera  that is subtended by the Sun . Based at least in part upon these parameters, the computing device  can compute the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the central receiver .","With more particularity, the computing device  can be configured to compute, for each pixel in the electronic image of the central receiver  captured by the second camera , an irradiance value on the surface of the central receiver  at such respective pixels. Thereafter, if desired, the pixels can be mapped to spatial regions on the surface of the collector  based at least in part upon an angle of the second camera  with respect to the central receiver  as well as shape of the central receiver . An irradiance distribution map corresponding to the surface of the central receiver  can then be generated and, for instance, visualized to a user. Gradients of values in the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the central receiver  can be analyzed to locate a nonuniformity of irradiance across the surface of the central receiver . This can indicate the existence of \u201chot spots\u201d that may exist on the surface of the central receiver . Existence of a \u201chot spot\u201d on the surface of the central receiver  can indicate that some diagnostic systems are desirably executed with respect to re-aligning one or more concentrators.","Additional detail pertaining to the computing of the solar irradiance distribution across the surface of the central receiver  is now provided. An image of the Sun  captured by the first digital camera  can be utilized to calibrate both the magnitude of a pixel value and a subtended angle of each pixel. For instance, neutral density filters can be applied to the camera lens of the first digital camera  to prevent saturation of, for example, the CCD of a CCD camera during exposure. Reference images of the Sun  captured by the digital camera  can serve two purposes: 1) to provide a quantified irradiance reference so that pixel values can be scaled to power (Watts) using a measured DNI; and 2) to provide a spatial reference to quantify the subtended angle (and size) of the physical image. The subtended angle of the Sun is approximately 9.4 mrad. So long as the zoom of the second camera  is held as being the same as the first camera  (or the zoom is held constant if the first digital camera  is utilized to capture both the image of the Sun  and the image of the central receiver ), then the subtended angle of other images can be obtained by comparison to the image of the Sun captured by the first digital camera .","Details pertaining to pixel conversion utilizing Sun calibration will now be provided. Referring briefly to , a reflection of irradiance on a relatively small portion of a diffuse receiver (e.g., the central receiver ) towards the second digital camera  is illustrated. A pixel i on a raw grayscale image of the central receiver  captures an elemental portion of the central receiver , A[m], which can receive an irradiance E[W\/m] from a heliostat field or other concentrator. For instance, the central receiver  can be assumed to be a Lambertian (diffuse) reflector with a reflectivity of \u03c1.","In a CCD camera, the CCD response due to irradiance at this pixel can be expressed in arbitrary voltage units per pixel area V[volts\/px], where volts represents the pixel value, and px denotes the unit length of a pixel. As described herein, this recorded signal Vcan be converted to irradiance E[W\/m] incident on the surface of the central receiver  A[m] imaged by the pixel i. An equation for the irradiance at pixel i can be derived by first considering the irradiance incident on the CCD. By definition, the radiant intensity [W\/sr] from a diffuse reflection is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the line of sight of the camera. Accordingly, the irradiance on the pixel E[W\/px] is given by the following algorithm:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","CCD_W"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["I","N"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"cos","mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03a9"}]},{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"px","mn":"2"}}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"N ","b":["204","204","204","104","204"],"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The radiant intensity in the normal direction Iin Eq.

Oftentimes, a receiver may have a tubular surface, and accordingly it is desirable to compute reflectivity across the tubular surface of the receiver. To compute such reflectivity of the tubular surface, reflectivity of a heliostat or facet, \u03c1, can be estimated or measured. Thereafter, an image of the heliostat or facet beam on the receiver can be captured, where the entirety of the beam is visible in the image (without spillage). An image of the receiver can then be captured without the beam, using the same camera settings as were used when capturing the image of the heliostat or facet beam on the receiver. An image of the Sun can be captured or retrieved, again with the same camera settings. The reflectivity of the tube across the surface can be computed based at least in part upon the captured images.","When capturing an image of the tubular receiver with the camera, positioning of the camera can be taken into consideration. Specifically, the camera is desirably a distance from the tubular receiver such that the entire hemi-cylindrical receiving surface of each tube is visible to the camera. If the camera is too close, the tubes may block regions of neighboring tubes from view, which can result in inaccuracies in an average reflectivity calculation. Similar inaccuracies may result from an incorrect viewing angle; if the camera views the tubular receiver at an angle, then the plane containing the line of sight and the receiver normal should be parallel to the receiver tubes. Otherwise, the tubes may block regions of neighboring tubes from view. The derivation described below assumes an acceptable camera position. Additionally, if a cylindrical tube receiver comprises multiple flat panels facing different directions, then a photograph of each panel can be obtained with the camera position adjusted for each panel.","Eqs.

For example, if the central receiver  is cylindrical, a user may benefit from knowing the angular position along the central receiver  circumference that corresponds to a certain irradiance point of interest that corresponds to a pixel in the image of the central receiver . The computing device  can be configured with instructions that convert pixel lengths on the horizontal and vertical axes of an irradiance map into spatial dimensions on the central receiver , measured in meters or degrees.","In general, the meters per pixel conversion factor is not constant, as it can be affected by the perspective of the camera that was utilized to capture the image of the central receiver . For instance, if a photographer who was standing on the ground obtained a photograph of the central receiver  mounted on top of the tower , the conversion of vertical pixels to meters along the height of the central receiver  must consider that the meters per pixel conversion factor for a pixel at the top of the image will be larger than at the bottom of the image. Similarly, for the conversion of horizontal pixel lengths to meters along the width of a flat-panel central receiver , the meters per pixel for a point closer to the camera will be smaller than for a point further from the camera. If the central receiver  is cylindrical, the center of the image will correspond to a smaller subtended angle per pixel than at the edge of the image.","Turning now to , a diagram  that illustrates computation of subtended angle per pixel when the central receiver  is in the form of a cylinder is illustrated. Here, the camera  is positioned to capture an image of the central receiver , which is cylindrical in shape. The camera  is a distance d from a cylindrical receiver of radius R. It can be noted that d and R need not be known when capturing the image of the central receiver . One pixel in the CCD of the camera  corresponds to an angle \u03c6 of incoming light. It may be desirable to determine the angles subtended by the center of the central receiver  on its surface (\u03b3, \u03b3, . . . ). Referring briefly to , a triangle  that illustrates the angles subtended by the center of the central receiver  on its surface is illustrated.","From the Law of Sines, the following can be

Furthermore, rather than being a reflective concentrator, the entity may be a receiver.","The system  additionally comprises the first digital camera  that captures an electronic image of the Sun  and the second digital camera  that is configured to capture an electronic image of the reflective entity. The computing device  is in communication with the first digital camera  and the second digital camera  and receives the electronic image of the Sun  generated by the first digital camera  and the electronic image of the reflective entity (one or more concentrators in the concentrator field ) captured by the second digital camera . The computing device  includes computer-executable instructions for computing glint and\/or glare based at least in part upon values of pixels in the electronic image of the Sun  and values of pixels in the electronic image of the reflective entity. The glint and\/or glare computed by the computing device  may then be output to a user. In a particular embodiment, a single mobile computing device such as a mobile telephone can be utilized to capture an image of the Sun  (or receive a previous image of the Sun ) and capture an image of the reflective entity. The portable computing device may then be configured to compute the glint and\/or glare based at least in part upon the pixel values of the image of the Sun  and the pixel values of the image of the concentrators .","The computed glint and\/or glare at computing device  can be mapped to one or more ocular safety metrics. For instance, an ocular safety metric may identify an amount of solar radiation received at the human eye at a particular subtended source angle that can cause permanent eye damage (retinal burn), potential for temporary after image (flash blindness), and low potential for temporary after image. If the irradiance received by the human eye is sufficiently large for a given subtended source angle, permanent eye damage from retinal burn may occur. It can be noted that as the subtended source angle increases, a safe retinal irradiance threshold decreases due to the increased size of the retinal image area and hence the increased energy applied to the retina area. Various ocular safety metrics have been presented, and all of such metrics and are contemplated for utilization in connection with the system .","Models for computing retinal irradiance for various types of reflective entities will now be described. Retinal irradiance [W\/m] can be calculated from a total amount of power entering the pupil of the human eye and the retinal image area. The diameter dof the image projected onto the retina (assuming circular images) can be determined from the source angle (\u03c9), which can be calculated from the source size (d), radial distance (r) between the eye and the source, and the focal length of the eye (f\u22450.017 m) as follows:\n\n\u2003\u2003(47)\n\nwhere \u03c9=d\/r.\n","Eq.

The power can then be divided by the retinal image area and multiplied by a transmission coefficient, \u03c4(\u02dc0.5), for the ocular media (to account for absorption of radiation within the eye before it reaches the retina) to yield the following expression for the retinal irradiance:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0143"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00049","num":"00049"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","r"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["E","c"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["d","p"],"mn":"2"},{"mi":["d","r"],"mn":"2"}]}}},{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"."}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"48"}}]}}}}},"Now described are analytical methods for calculating the irradiance caused by specular and diffuse reflection of solar radiation as a function of distance and other characteristics of the source. Specular reflections occur from polished mirror-like surfaces so that the reflective angle is equal to the incident angle relative to the surface normal. Diffuse reflections occur from uneven or rough surfaces that scatter the incident radiation such that the radiance is uniform in all directions. Described first will be an analytical model corresponding to specular reflections. Direct specular solar reflection from mirrors can cause glint and glare hazards when heliostats, for instance, are in standby positions reflecting Sun at locations other than the receiver. Specular solar reflections from heliostats, dishes and parabolic troughs can cause glint and glare hazards when the collectors are in off-axis positions (e.g., when moving from a stowed position to a tracking position). For parabolic troughs, glint and glare from specular reflections can also occur when the Sun is low in the horizon and align with the axis of the trough causing reflected rays to spill from the end of the trough.","With reference to , geometry of specular solar reflections from a focused mirror is illustrated. An analytical model of beam irradiance resulting from specular solar reflections from a point-focus mirror can be derived with the following assumptions: (1) uniform Sun intensity; (2) round, focused, continuous surface mirrors; (3), no cosine losses, off-axis aberrations or atmospheric attenuation; and (4), uniform intensity in beam cross section.","These assumptions will generally produce the largest beam irradiance, but the assumption of uniform Sun intensity averages the intensity over the entire beam.
