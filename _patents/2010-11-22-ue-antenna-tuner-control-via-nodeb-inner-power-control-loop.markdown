{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/263,129, filed Nov. 20, 2009, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates to controlling the power of wireless communication devices that include variable antenna impedance matching circuitry and communicate with base transceiver stations (BTSs).","Antenna tuner units (ATUs) are employed in user equipment (UE) such as mobile terminals in order to maintain good link quality between base transceiver stations (BTSs) and the UE. In particular, an ATU is usable to match antenna input impedance with the output impedance of a power amplifier (PA). ATUs are especially useful when the UE is a mobile terminal communicating with a BTS, since the antenna of the mobile terminal can experience voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) changes that may range from near 1:1 to 3.5:1 as the position of the antenna relative to the user's body changes. For example, antenna input impedance often experiences relatively large changes as portions of the user's body move within the near field of the antenna. These relatively large antenna input impedance changes typically result in a large reflected power, which limits the total radiated power (TRP) to less than a desired maximum amount of TRP.","Unreliable power control due to antenna impedance fluctuations is problematic for third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) UEs such as mobile terminals because standards for 3G and 4G UE include relatively strict power control accuracy constraints. What is needed is a UE antenna tuner control system and methods that utilize a BTS inner power control loop, and in particular utilize a Node-B inner power control loop.","The present disclosure provides a user equipment (UE) antenna tuner control system and methods that utilize a base transceiver station (BTS) inner power control loop, and in particular utilize a Node-B inner power control loop. The UE antenna tuner control system and method of the present disclosure include an antenna impedance matching algorithm and a power amplifier (PA) input drive control that are digitally controlled by the BTS. Therefore, each UE having a digitally controllable antenna tuner unit (ATU) and operating within a network that is controllable by the BTS will have increased power efficiency.","The PA input drive control is for adjusting the power delivered by the PA. The antenna impedance matching algorithm is for determining the amount and direction of impedance change needed to provide an optimal impedance match between the PA and antenna that comprise the UE. The antenna impedance matching algorithm combined with the PA input drive control enables a convergence over time such that the ATU of the UE is optimally set to provide an increased delivered power.","One advantage of the UE antenna tuner system of the present disclosure is that additional power control loops beyond the inner power control loop are unnecessary. Since only the inner power control loop is needed, a possibility of loop instability due to interactivity between power control loops is eliminated. Moreover, by providing the inner power control loop with an ability to synchronize control of both the ATU and the power delivered by the PA, concerns about instability for continuous power transmission networks such as third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) networks are reduced.","Another advantage of the UE antenna tuner system of the present disclosure is that a directional coupler and a mismatch power detector are not needed as elements of the UE. As such, manufacturing costs of other power control and sensing circuitry on board the UE are reduced due to simplifications brought about by the elimination of the directional coupler and the mismatch power detector.","The elimination of the directional coupler and the mismatch power detector is made possible by measuring power delivered by the UE to the BTS based upon the inner power control loop's uplink and by measuring power delivered to the UE from the BTS based upon the inner power control loop's downlink. Both measurements of delivered power are usable by the antenna impedance matching algorithm to digitally tune the ATU of the UE such that the power delivered by the BTS and the power delivered by the UE are both optimized for a full duplex communication session in which a transmit (TX) frequency and a receive (RX) frequency for the full duplex communication session are different.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate the scope of the present disclosure and realize additional aspects thereof after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments in association with the accompanying drawing figures.","The embodiments set forth below represent the necessary information to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments and illustrate the best mode of practicing the embodiments. Upon reading the following description in light of the accompanying drawing figures, those skilled in the art will understand the concepts of the disclosure and will recognize applications of these concepts not particularly addressed herein. It should be understood that these concepts and applications fall within the scope of the disclosure and the accompanying claims.","Power control is implemented for code division multiple access (CDMA) and long term evolution (LTE) based cellular network systems. The primary goal of power control in such systems is to transmit signals in both an uplink direction and a downlink direction using the lowest possible power levels while maintaining a requested quality of service (QoS) for a user equipment (UE) in communication with a base transceiver station (BTS). However, determining appropriate transmitter levels for the uplink direction and the downlink direction is a sophisticated task due to a dynamic variation of the radio frequency (RF) environment between the UE and the BTS in communication. For example, a signal quality between the UE and the BTS can be affected in both directions by system level interference, reduced power available to the UE due to battery drain, and\/or the mobility of the UE relative to the BTS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26"]},"The receiver front end  receives information-bearing RF signals from one or more remote transmitters provided by a BTS (not shown). The ATU  tunes the antenna  to enhance the reception of an RF signal captured by the antenna . A low noise amplifier (LNA)  amplifies the RF signal. A filter circuit  minimizes broadband interference in the RF signal, while a downconverter  downconverts the filtered, received RF signal to an intermediate or baseband frequency signal, which is then digitized into one or more digital streams. The receiver front end  typically uses one or more mixing frequencies generated by the frequency synthesizer .","The baseband processor  processes the digitized received signal to extract the information or data bits conveyed in the received signal. This processing typically comprises demodulation, decoding, and error correction operations. As such, the baseband processor  is generally implemented in one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).","On the transmit side, the baseband processor  receives digitized data, which it encodes for transmission, from the control system . The encoded data is output to the RF transmitter section , where it is used by a modulator  to modulate a carrier signal that is at a desired transmit frequency. PA circuitry  amplifies the modulated carrier signal to a level appropriate for transmission from the antenna . The power amplifier (PA) circuitry  provides gain for the signal to be transmitted under control of power control circuitry , which is preferably controlled by the control system  using an adjustable power control signal (V). The ATU  tunes the antenna  to match the output impedance of the PA circuitry  to the input impedance of the antenna . In this way, the RF power of the modulated signal transmitted from the antenna  will be efficiently transmitted. The ATU  may be controlled by two digital general purpose input\/output (GPIO) signals. One signal GPIO (T\/R SWITCH) switches the ATU  between tuning the antenna  for transmission and reception. Another signal GPIO (ANT. TUNER) is usable to adjust tuning elements (not shown in ) of the ATU .","The power control circuitry  adjusts the bias for the PA circuitry  to maintain a desired output power under varying conditions, such as decreasing battery voltage and\/or fluctuating voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), etc. The control system  may also provide a transmit enable signal (TX ENABLE) to effectively enable the PA circuitry  during periods of transmission.","A user may interact with the mobile terminal  via the interface , which may include interface circuitry  associated with a microphone , a speaker , a keypad , and a display . The interface circuitry  typically includes analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, amplifiers, and the like. Additionally, the interface circuitry  may include a voice encoder\/decoder, in which case it may communicate directly with the baseband processor .","The microphone  will typically convert audio input, such as the user's voice, into an electrical signal, which is then digitized and passed directly or indirectly to the baseband processor . Audio information encoded in the received signal is recovered by the baseband processor  and converted into an analog signal suitable for driving the speaker  and the interface circuitry . The keypad  and the display  enable the user to interact with the mobile terminal , inputting numbers to be dialed, address book information, or the like, as well as monitoring call progress information.","As illustrated in , a cellular network  experiences a near-far effect due to a UE  that is located far from a BTS , a UE  that is located at an intermediate distance from the BTS , and a UE  that is located near to the BTS . All signals transmitted from the UE , the UE , and the UE , and received by the BTS  would ideally have the same power level. However, if the UE , the UE , and the UE  each transmits at a power level that is appropriate for the nearby UE , the BTS  will potentially not be able to receive a usable signal level from the far-away UE . Alternately, if the nearby UE  transmits a signal at a power level appropriate for the far away UE , BTS  reception of signals transmitted from the intermediately distant UE  and the far away UE  will potentially by interrupted by interference from the signal transmitted from the nearby UE . This problem is known as the near-far effect. As a result of the near-far effect, users of the UE , the UE , the UE , and other UEs (not shown) cannot transmit signals at fixed power levels and expect reliable communication with the BTS  and other BTSs (not shown) that make up a modern cellular network, such as the cellular network . Various factors, such as fading variations and other signal-power variations caused by radio wave propagation physics contribute to the near-far effect.","Optimally efficient uplinks to the BTS  occur when the RF signal power from each of the UEs , , and  appears to be equal regardless of significant differences in range from the BTS  that exist for the UEs , , and . This equality in received signal strength provides for an optimal signal to interference ratio (SIR), which theoretically allows the BTS  to decode a maximum number of transmissions within the cellular network . However, in reality, a radio channel used for uplink to the BTS  is unstable. Therefore, RF signal power transmitted from the each of the UEs , , and  must be accurately and dynamically controlled.","Mature investigations pertaining to efficient RF signal power control have resulted in many RF signal power control algorithms that achieve efficient RF signal power control for uplinks from UEs such as the UEs , , and . Most of these traditional RF signal power control algorithms distribute the responsibility of RF signal power control to BTSs, such as the BTS . Traditionally, each BTS, such as the BTS , tracks and updates RF signal power levels received from UEs such as the UEs , , and .","In contrast, an optimally efficient downlink from the BTS  to the UEs , , and  must be handled differently. RF signals transmitted by the BTS  are orthogonal. RF signals that are mutually orthogonal do not in theory interfere with one another. However, it is difficult if not impossible to achieve complete orthogonality in typical communication environments for the cellular network . For example, RF signal reflections off of structures (not shown) within the cellular network  may cause non-orthogonal interference even in the case of a single BTS, such as the BTS . Moreover, RF signals transmitted from other BTSs, such as BTSs similar to the BTS  are non-orthogonal, and thus increase interference levels with the cellular network . Interference caused by RF signals that are non-orthogonal is particularly problematic for a CDMA system in which neighboring cells use an RF carrier signal of the same frequency. As a result of the interference caused by RF signals that are non-orthogonal, a power control for efficient downlink of RF signals is necessary.","Open loop power control and closed loop power are available for RF power control for downlink of RF signals. A UE, such as the UE , using open loop power control estimates an RF signal strength transmitted from the BTS  by measuring a received power level of the pilot signal of the BTS  in a downlink RF transmission from the BTS . The UE  then adjusts its RF power level to be inversely proportional to the received power level of the pilot signal of the BTS . Consequently, the UE  will transmit a relatively lower power RF signal in response to a relatively higher received power level of the pilot signal of the BTS . The responsiveness of open loop power control is relatively responsive. However, a problem exists in that the interference estimate made by the UE  is based upon the received power level of the pilot signal of the BTS , which can be of a different frequency than the frequency transmitted by the UE . This problem is particularly evident in the case of frequency division duplex (FDD), which uses uplink and downlink frequencies that are different by a duplex frequency offset. As a result, uplink and downlink fast fading on different RF signal carriers do not correlate, which results in less accurate power control based on averaging the received power level of the pilot signal of the BTS .","Nevertheless, open loop control achieves good results for universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access-time division duplex (UTRA-TDD) that uses a common frequency for both uplink and downlink. The good results for open loop control using a TDD mode are due to a strong correlation between the processing of fading for both the uplink and downlink RF signal transmissions. However, a wideband CDMA-frequency division duplex (WCDMA-FDD) system only uses open loop power control to provide an initial power setting of UEs, such as the UEs , , and , at the beginning of a communication session between the UEs , , and  and the BTS . An open loop power control tolerance is \u00b19 dB for normal environmental conditions for the cellular network , and \u00b112 dB for extreme environmental conditions for the cellular network .","Closed loop power control typically provides more accurate power control for UEs than open loop power control. In a typical closed loop power control technique, the BTS  makes use of uplink and downlink RF transmissions to measure the quality of the RF signals passed between the BTS  and the UEs , , and . The results of the quality measurement of the RF signals are sent from the BTS  to the UEs , , and  so that the UEs , , and  can adjust their respective RF signal power levels based upon the quality of the RF signals received by the BTS .","A UMTS terrestrial radio access-frequency division duplex (UTRA-FDD) mode of operation for the cellular network  uses a fast closed loop power control technique for both uplink and downlink RF signal transmissions. In the UTRA-FDD mode, a received SIR is measured over one UTRA-FDD time slot (TS), which has a duration of about 667 microseconds. For the uplink, a digital process algorithm executed by the BTS  determines whether or not to increase or decrease the power transmitted by any one of the UEs , , and .","A transmission power control (TPC) command having a TPC_cmd value with a number of transmit control bits is transmitted within each TS during an uplink or a downlink to individual ones of the UEs , , and  to convey commands for each of the UEs , , and  to either increase or decrease the power of their respective RF signal transmissions. For example, when the BTS  receives an RF signal from one of the UEs , , and , the BTS  will compare a measured signal level of the received RF signal with a threshold value that is predefined. If the measured RF signal level for the received RF signal exceeds the threshold value, the BTS  will send a decrease power TPC_cmd value to the UE . Alternately, the BTS  will send an increase power TPC_cmd value to the UE  if the measured RF signal level is lower than the threshold level.","During downlink transmissions, the UEs , , and  will report received RF signal levels for RF signals transmitted from the BTS . The digital process algorithm executed by the BTS  uses received RF signal level reports from the UEs , , and  to determine when the RF signal power of the BTS  needs an increase or decrease to maintain high quality communication between the individual ones of the UEs , , and  and the BTS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["60","62","60","64","66","66","66","68","70","68","66","68"]},"The TPC commands multiplexed with the BTS DOWNLINK SIGNAL are transmitted over a DOWNLINK RADIO CHANNEL to be received by a demultiplexer (DEMUX) . The DEMUX  separates the BTS DOWNLINK SIGNAL from the TPC commands, sending the latter to control the PA  and sending the former to a decoding function block  that decodes the BTS DOWNLINK SIGNAL to output a UE DOWNLINK SIGNAL. An information exchange comprising SIREST and TPC commands between the UE  and the BTS  make up an INNER LOOP. The INNER LOOP allows control loop power adjustments that maintain transmitted RF power levels from the UE  that will keep the received SIR estimates substantially equal to the SIR Target value. The power control frequency of the INNER LOOP is 1500 Hz in order to provide timely power adjustments.","If the SIR Target value results in a low quality bit stream carried by the UE UPLINK SIGNAL over the UPLINK RADIO CHANNEL, then the SIR Target value should be increased. The SIR Target value is fixed based upon a block error ratio (BLER) or bit error ratio (BER). The SIR Target value is set by the OUTER LOOP in order to match a required BLER. An optimal SIR Target depends on the speed of the UE  towards or away from the BTS  as the UE  traverses a multipath profile. Thus, the OUTER LOOP is usable to maintain the quality of communications at the level of a bearer service quality requirement, while transmitting as low a level as possible from both the UE  and the BTS . The OUTER LOOP is also responsible for setting the SIR Target at the BTS  for each individual uplink under the power control of the INNER LOOP. The SIR Target is updated for each UE, such as the UE  according to an SIREST uplink quality that preferably include BLER and\/or BER measurements for each Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection. The RRC connection is responsible for controlling the configuration of UMTS radio interface Layers  and . The OUTER LOOP also provides for a downlink power control that allows a receiver of the UE  to converge to a required BLER that is set by a Radio Network Controller (RNC).","As shown in the table of , a transmitter of the UE  is typically adapted to change the output power transmitted by the UE  in step sizes of 1 dB, 2 dB and 3 dB. Changes in the output power provided by the BTS  occur during TSs that immediately follows a TPC command.","A first algorithm ALGORITHM for power control using the INNER LOOP requests a transmit power decrease if the SIREST is greater than the SIR Target. In contrast, the first algorithm for power control using the INNER LOOP requests a transmit power increase if the SIREST is less than the SIR Target. It is to be understood that a change in the transmitter output power for a UE such as the UE  is made in response to a single TPC command via a TPC_cmd value.","A second algorithm ALGORITHM for power control only updates every fifth TS in order to simulate smaller power update steps relative to the update steps of the ALGORITHM. The transmit power of the UE  is reduced by 1 dB if five TPC commands in a row have a TPC_cmd value requesting a power decrease. In contrast, the transmit power of the UE  is increased by 1 dB if five TPC commands in a row have a TPC_cmd value requesting a power increase. If no power increase or decrease is requested, the transmit power of the UE  will remain unchanged.","The transmit power of the DOWNLINK RADIO CHANNEL () for the UE  is determined by the cellular network  (). A power control step size can have four values, which are typically 0.5 db, 1 dB, 1.5 dB, and 2 dB. However, regulations for a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) only mandate support for a 1 dB power control step size. Support for other power control step sizes is optional.","The UE  generates TPC commands to control the transmit power of the BTS . The UE  transmits the TPC commands to the BTS  in a TPC field of an uplink dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH). The BTS  adjusts the downlink power of the DPCCH and the dedicated physical data channel (DPDCH) upon receiving the TPC commands from the UE .","In a soft handover state in which the UE  is traveling between cells of a cellular network such as the cellular network  (), the transmit power of the UE  is adjusted by selecting the most suitable TPC command received from various BTSs, such as the BTS . In a case in which the UE  has simultaneous radio links with other BTSs besides the BTS , the UE  will receive more than one TPC command from the other BTSs independently. The received TPC commands may provide conflicting power control instructions to the UE . A basic approach to resolving the conflicting power control instructions is for the UE  to comply with the TPC command that calls for the least amount of transmit power.","A site selection diversity technique (SSDT) is another approach to resolving TPC command conflicts. The basic principle of SSDT is that the BTS with the highest signal level is dynamically selected by the UE  to be the only transmitting BTS. As a result, any other BTSs that have simultaneous radio links to the UE  will cease their DPDCH transmissions. As a result, the transmit power of the UE  will be adjusted based upon the TPC commands of the BTS with the highest signal level as determined by the UE .","During an inter-frequency handover from the BTS  to another BTS, the UE  must be given time to make the necessary measurements on the different WCDMA carrier frequency. In this compressed mode, the transmissions of the BTS  and the UE  are ceased for a predefined period to provide enough time for inter-frequency measurements. As a result, the adjustments of transmit power for both the UE  and the BTS  are problematically halted. In order to resolve this problem during uplink, the UE  is allowed to increase or decrease transmit power using step sizes that are larger than typically called for in order to reach a desired SIR Target as swiftly as possible.","While power control of the UE  and the BTS  using the power control algorithms described above are relatively well developed, problems remain in that factors other than power levels that affect signal quality are present during a typical communication session between the UE  and the BTS . For example, as illustrated in , a VSWR variation seen for an antenna  of a UE  in a flip phone form typically ranges from about 1:1 to about 6:1. The Smith chart of  shows the impedance of the antenna  relative to a reference plane  (). An impedance mismatch for the antenna  caused by a non-50 ohm impedance generates an impedance mismatch loss. The mismatch loss can be as high as 3 dB for a VSWR of 6:1. Due to such a high loss, the power transmitted by the UE  is degraded and the received signal level at a BTS such as the BTS  () is reduced. Other problems caused by the impedance mismatch loss include an increased noise figure and reduced battery life for the UE .","Relatively large VSWR changes can be seen at the antenna  depending on how a user handles the UE .  illustrate two examples of how the VSWR for the antenna  is affected by user handling.  is a graph of VSWR versus time for low band 900 MHz transmission from the antenna . In the example of , the UE  of , and C was alternately lifted from and placed onto a table five times. Notice that the VSWR for the antenna  changes from around 1:1.4 when the UE  is off of the table to around 1:2.8 when the UE  is on the table. In the example of , the fingers of a user were rapidly moved about the antenna . Notice that the VSWR is seen to change rapidly at a rate that is around 200 milliseconds.","The problem of relatively large VSWR changes is becoming more challenging as advances in cellular networks are requiring the support of larger bandwidth ranges within a single UE, such as the UE  (). For example, the preferred bandwidth range to be supported will cover 700 MHz through 2600 MHz for a single UE, such as the UE . Note that even with such a wide bandwidth range, antenna efficiency and radiated gain must remain within ranges that provide reliable communication between BTSs and UEs.","In order to counter the problems caused by antenna impedance mismatches, most antenna tuning techniques incorporate an ATU and a baseband (BB) power controller that both reside within a UE.  is a block diagram of a UE  according to the prior art. The UE  is in communication with a BTS  having a BTS antenna . The UE  includes a BB power controller  for controlling a transceiver output power adjusting function . The BB power controller  sends a signal to the transceiver output power adjusting function  based on downlink TPC commands received from the BTS . In turn, the transceiver output power adjusting function  controls the amount of output voltage and\/or bias current that is delivered to a PA  from a switcher power supply . The PA  includes power amplifier stages (PASs) PAS and PAS. An amplified RF signal output from the PA  is directed through an RF front end module (FEM)  to an automatic antenna tuning system  that is coupled to a UE antenna .","The automatic antenna tuning system  is made up of a directional coupler  that passes the majority of an amplified RF signal into an ATU  while directing a sample of the amplified RF signal into a mismatch detector . An ATU control unit  receives a mismatch signal from the mismatch detector . The ATU control unit  uses the mismatch signal to adjust a matching network of the ATU  to generate a mismatch correction signal that automatically optimizes an impedance match between the UE antenna , the FEM , and the PA . In this way, there will be a reduced negative impact on the transmission performance of the UE  as a user  inadvertently changes the VSWR of the UE antenna  during operation of the UE . However, it is important to note that the automatic antenna tuning system  is independent of an inner loop power control such as used with the INNER LOOP between the UE  and the BTS  of . While a certain amount of independence is positive in some control systems, the opposite is true in this case because the automatic antenna tuning system  is relatively slow compared to an inner loop power control for 3G and 4G continuous transmission systems that have TS periods of around 0.667 milliseconds. Further still, the automatic antenna tuning system  relies on the directional coupler , the mismatch detector , and the ATU control unit , all of which add to the design and production costs of the UE .","An example of potential network degradation due to the independence of the automatic antenna tuning system  can be demonstrated with the following scenario. In reference to , assume a VSWR changes at the UE antenna  from 1:1 to 2.5:1. As a result, the BTS  will see a change of about \u22121 dB in the power delivered by the UE . Further, assume that the VSWR change starts at a TS boundary of 0.667 ms. Also assume that the response of the automatic antenna tuning system  is slower than 0.667 ms, and assume that a convergence algorithm of the antenna tuning takes about 0.677 ms to measure the change of VSWR to find an optimum adjustment for the matching network. Meanwhile, the inner loop power control will request that the UE  increase its output power by +1 dB via a TPC equals up command. However, the automatic antenna tuning system  will independently apply its correction to the matching network of the ATU , which results in a change of about +1 dB. The UE  also will apply a power change of +1 dB, thus resulting in a +2 dB change of delivered power increase versus the previous TS. Such action will result in a lack of accuracy necessary for reliable communication between the UE  and the BTS . Worse, there is a potential for creating instabilities of the inner power control loop.","Another potential problem pertains to a degradation of the detection of an impedance mismatch. Such a problem can be created by the presence of a near-by transmitter that leaks an interference signal into the UE antenna . The interference signal may superimpose onto an internally reflected signal that needs to be measured due to a load mismatch at the UE antenna . The superimposing interference signal would likely lead to erroneous impedance mismatch correction attempts by the automatic antenna tuning system .","The present disclosure provides solutions for the above described problems associated with prior art antenna tuning techniques. In particular, the present disclosure provides a novel antenna tuning control scheme that adds an antenna control algorithm ALGORITHM to an inner loop power control similar to that used with the INNER LOOP between the UE  and the BTS  of .","Turning now to , a communication system  and a UE  that is in accordance with the present disclosure are illustrated. The UE  is in communication with a BTS  having a BTS antenna . The UE  includes a first baseband (BB) power controller  for controlling a transceiver output power adjusting function . The first BB power controller  sends a signal to the transceiver output power adjusting function  based on downlink TPC commands received from the BTS , which applies the ALGORITHM or the ALGORITHM. In turn, the transceiver output power adjusting function  controls the amount of output voltage and\/or bias current that is delivered to a PA  from a switcher power supply . An amplified RF signal output from the PA  is directed through an RF FEM  to an automatic antenna tuning system  that is coupled to a UE antenna .","The automatic antenna tuning system  includes a forward power coupler  that passes the majority of an amplified RF signal into an ATU  while directing a sample of the amplified RF signal into a forward power detector . A second BB power controller  receives an output of the forward power detector  along with an input from the ALGORITHM. The second BB power controller  outputs a pair of ATU control signals CTRL and CTRL, which are based on inputs from the ALGORITHM along with an output of the forward power detector . As shown in , the ATU control signals CTRL and CTRL adjust variable capacitors VC and VC that make up the ATU . An inductor L is coupled to the variable capacitors VC and VC in a PI network configuration.","In operation, the only power measurement made by the UE  is a forward power measurement that is similar to the forward power measurements conducted by most 3G and 4G applications. The forward power measurement is used as a control input into the second BB power controller  so that the second BB power controller  can avoid exceeding a predetermined maximum power limit. The forward power measurement is reported to the BTS .","During operation, the ALGORITHM and\/or the ALGORITHM are used by the INNER LOOP POWER CONTROL to adjust the output power of the UE  via the transceiver output power adjusting function . The UE  informs the BTS  of a maximum forward power limit if the output power of the PA  as detected via the forward power detector  reaches a maximum output power. If the maximum forward power limit has been reached, the BTS  will command the UE  to switch to the ALGORITHM INNER LOOP POWER CONTROL mode.","At this point in time, the BTS  remains in communication with the UE  via the TPC commands. However, while processing the ALGORITHM, the UE  will use the TPC commands to adjust the antenna tuning control, while maintaining constant forward output power for the PA . The TPC commands received by the second BB power controller  in the form of \u201cUp\u201d and \u201cDown\u201d power control messages and used for inner power loop control are preferably in accordance with high speed packet access (HSPA) standards and\/or long term evolution (LTE) standards. If a TPC command is \u201cUp,\u201d the antenna tuning is adjusted in a random direction. The change in the antenna tuning will either increase the delivered output power by reducing the reflected power from an antenna mismatch or will decrease the delivered output power by inadvertently increasing the reflected power due to the antenna mismatch. If the BTS  sees that the output power of the UE  has decreased instead of increasing, the BTS  will command the UE  to increase output power via the TPC command set as \u201cUp.\u201d However, the BTS  will also indicate that the direction of the antenna tuning control must be changed on the next TS. Thus, on the next TS, the antenna tuning control would be set on the right direction to result in an increased delivered power by reducing the reflected power due to the antenna mismatch. If the BTS  determines that the delivered power is still below a predetermined target, the BTS  will continue sending the TPC command for \u201cUp\u201d until the measured power at the BTS  meets the predetermined target.","Once the BTS  verifies that the delivered power for the UE  meets the predetermined target, the BTS  will command the UE  to switch back to ALGORITHM or ALGORITHM, and thus to stop operating in ALGORITHM INNER LOOP POWER CONTROL mode. In this way, the antenna tuning setting commanded by the BTS  may not have reach an optimum setting, but at least the current setting increases the delivered power by the UE  to an amount commanded by the BTS .","If the output of the UE  decreases after a previous increase, the BTS  will command the UE  to cease operating the ALGORITHM during a subsequent TS. This case is due to the limited range of the antenna tuning for the given VSWR at which the antenna is operating. A previous antenna control value will be maintained by the second BB power controller  after the ALGORITHM ceases.","It is important to note that during the execution of the ALGORITHM, the UE  will provide power steps on each TS, but will not meet the relative gain accuracy requirements, since the antenna tuning control cannot precisely predict the gain changes. However, no gain inaccuracy problem is created because the UE  is usually far enough away from the BTS  that a request by the BTS  for more output power from the UE  will not be impacted by the near-far effect.","The power delivered (Pdel) by the UE  is estimated by taking the difference between the forward power (Pfwd) and the reverse power (Prev). Therefore, the Pdel=Pfwd\u2212Prev=Pfwd*(1\u2212|\u0393|) where \u0393 is the reflection coefficient, and \u0393 is function of the antenna load and the antenna control settings for the variable capacitor VC and the variable capacitor VC ().","The ALGORITHM controls the antenna tuning such that the ATU  is adjusted to provide an increase of the power delivered by the UE . An unknown step value may be used to change the antenna control settings for the variable capacitor VC and the variable capacitor VC. However, the PI filter configuration made up of VC, VC and L is preferably implemented such that an unknown step does not exceed a predetermined limit such as will result in a 1 dB change. While this constraint might not necessarily provide the optimum matching settings that maximize the delivered power from the UE  for an individual TS, it is sufficient to increase the delivered power during a given TS.","As the ALGORITHM continues to issue TPC commands over subsequent TSs, the antenna tuning is again slightly adjusted such that the delivered power from the UE  is increased. In this way, the antenna tuning provided by ALGORITHM will converge to optimum settings for the variable capacitor VC and the variable capacitor VC over several TSs. The latest variable capacitor VC and variable capacitor VC set are preferably maintained after the BTS  commands the UE  to operate in the ALGORITHM or ALGORITHM modes where the output power control is implemented by adjusting the drive input level of the PA  using the transceiver output power adjusting function .","ALGORITHM and ALGORITHM are usable with the inner loop power control to adjust a forward power output of the PA  with a relatively precise gain step. In comparison, the ALGORITHM is usable with the inner loop power control to reduce reverse power by adjusting the ATU . Advantageously, no precise gain step is required for the ALGORITHM in order to increase UE power delivered to the BTS . Moreover, the ALGORITHM reduces a typical need to over-design the PA  to make up for reverse power losses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 9A"],"b":["3","136","116","114","3","200","202","136","204","206","208","210"]},"The Node-B also determines if the UE delivered power to Node-B for the new TS (TXUEDEL_NODE(n+1) is greater than or equal to a target power level (TXUEDEL_NODEBTARGET) (step ).

As a result, the number of tuning elements making up the ATU  may need to be increased if switchable capacitors and inductors are used in place of continuous tuning elements such as variable capacitance diodes. Using a relatively large number of switchable tuning elements for the ATU  may be undesirable in some cases due to a relatively high cost of implementation. One method to reduce the number of tunable elements is to perform antenna tuning adjustments at every frame or at a frame multiple rather than at each TS. This method would allow a phase jump larger than 30 degrees, but smaller than 60 degrees, which would be acceptable in more and less cases.","Another complexity addressed by the present disclosure pertains to duplex communication systems that require optimization of antenna tuning for both the transmitter and receiver of the UE . In a duplex communication system, the receive frequency is at a different frequency than the transmit frequency. For some bands, like UTMS Band , the duplex frequency offset is very large, equal to 400 MHz. By comparison, the duplex frequency offset for UTMS Band  is only 190 MHz. Thus, an optimization of the tunable element settings for the ATU  for a given transmit frequency would likely not yield an optimization of the tunable elements settings for the ATU  for an offset receive frequency. One solution would be to adapt the ATU  for broadband tuning to create optimized tuning peaks for both the TX and RX frequencies. However, in some cases broadband tuning would result in undesirably complex filter circuit topologies.","A different method for solving the duplex communications issue involves using the ALGORITHM to measure the power level delivered to the UE  at the receive frequency. In this case, the ALGORITHM averages measured received power levels at both the UE  and the BTS  to determine an average link power level. The average link power level can be determined by a logarithmic averaging of a linear averaging. Alternately, some weighting can be introduced if the TX frequency is to be more favored than the RX frequency. This averaging method preferably has a sampling period that is applied every two TSs rather than each TS. In this way, the UE  reports received power levels to the BTS  using the DOWNLINK RADIO CHANNEL. In this way, the BTS  can make determinations for TPC commands based upon both an uplink power level and a downlink power level for the same ATU settings.","The ALGORITHM, including averaging for both an uplink power level and a downlink power level, can be simulated for various loads, noise levels, and path losses.
