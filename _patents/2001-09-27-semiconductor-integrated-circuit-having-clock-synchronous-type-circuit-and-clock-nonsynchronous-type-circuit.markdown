title: Semiconductor integrated circuit having clock synchronous type circuit and clock non-synchronous type circuit
abstract: A clock non-synchronous type circuit performs data read operation on the basis of a read control signal. After a lapse of a predetermined delay time, read data is read out from the clock non-synchronous type circuit. The read data is latched in selected one of N latch circuits. A latch circuit is selected on the basis of a control signal instead of a clock signal. The control signal represents that read data is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit, and hence a latch circuit is always selected after read data is output.

With this achievement, an overall system can be mounted on one chip by mounting a plurality of functional blocks on the chip.","Under the circumstances, a semiconductor integrated circuit has also been implemented, which is formed by mounting, on one chip, a clock synchronous type circuit that operation synchronously with a clock signal and a clock non-synchronous type circuit that operates asynchronously with a clock signal.","In a semiconductor integrated circuit on which both a clock synchronous type circuit and clock non-synchronous type circuit are mounted, since data cannot be directly exchanged between the clock synchronous type circuit and the clock non-synchronous type circuit, a storage circuit (latency control circuit) capable of setting a so-called latency is placed between the two circuits.","In this case, \u201clatency\u201d indicates a latency period between the instant at which data is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit and the instant at which the data is input to the clock synchronous type circuit, and is generally expressed by the number of clocks (letting one period of a clock signal be one clock).","Data is therefore exchanged between the clock synchronous type circuit and the clock non-synchronous type circuit through the storage circuit.","According to the aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor integrated circuit comprising a clock non-synchronous type circuit for performing data read operation on the basis of a read control signal and outputting read data from a data output node asynchronously with a clock signal, a clock synchronous type circuit for receiving the read data through a data input node in synchronism with the clock signal, a plurality of data storage circuits connected in parallel between the data output node and the data input node, a first transfer timing determining circuit for selecting one of the plurality of data storage circuits and transferring the read data output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit to the selected one data storage circuit, and a second transfer timing determining circuit for selecting one of the plurality of data storage circuits and transferring the read data stored in the selected one data storage circuit to the clock synchronous type circuit. The first transfer timing determining circuit transfers the read data on the basis of a first control signal representing that the read data is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit. The second transfer timing determining circuit transfers the read data on the basis of a second control signal synchronous with the clock signal.","A semiconductor integrated circuit according to the aspect of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","1. Reference Example","A storage circuit for setting a latency will be described first.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"This example is based on the premise that the latency is set to \u201c3\u201d. In general, to realize a latency \u201cN (N is a natural number)\u201d by a storage circuit, the storage circuit must have (N\u22121) latch circuits. In this example, therefore, a storage circuit  for determining a latency has two latch circuits (L, L) .","More specifically, the two latch circuits  are connected in series between the data output node of a clock non-synchronous type circuit  and the data input node of a clock synchronous type circuit . A switching circuit (S)  is connected between the data output node of the clock non-synchronous type circuit  and the latch circuit (L) . A switching circuit (S)  is connected between the latch circuit (L)  and the latch circuit (L) . A switching circuit (S)  is connected between the latch circuit (L)  and the data input node of the clock synchronous type circuit .","Transfer timing determining circuits (G, G G)  are arranged in correspondence with the switching circuits (S, S, S) . The transfer timing determining circuit (G)  generates a control signal PSi for controlling the switching circuit (S)  on the basis of a clock signal Clock. The transfer timing determining circuit (G)  generates a control signal PSo for controlling the switching circuit (S)  on the basis of the clock signal Clock. The transfer timing determining circuit (G)  generates a control signal PO for controlling the switching circuit (S)  on the basis of the clock signal Clock.","A read control signal READ for controlling the read operation of reading data from the clock non-synchronous type circuit  is input to the clock non-synchronous type circuit . This read control signal READ is, for example, generated from the clock signal Clock and synchronous with the clock signal Clock.","In the above storage circuit, when, for example, a predetermined delay time td determined by the performance of the clock non-synchronous type circuit  has elapsed since the leading edge of the read control signal READ, read data RD is output from the data output node of the clock non-synchronous type circuit . This delay time td is irrelevant to a period tclk or frequency fclk (=1\/tclk) of the clock signal Clock, and data transfer may not be reliably performed depending on the relationship in magnitude between the two values.","The relationship between the delay time td and the period tclk of the clock signal Clock will therefore be described below with reference to the timing charts of , , , and .","(1) td<tclk",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Assume that the period tclk of the clock signal Clock is longer than the delay time td. In this case, after the read data RD (=D, D, D) are output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit , the read data RD can always be stored in the storage circuit  (QRi) in accordance with the control signal PSi generated from the first clock.","Since the control signal PSo generated from the second clock rises (\u201cL\u201d\u2192\u201cH\u201d) after the control signal PSi generated from the first clock, the read data RD (=D, D, D) can be properly transferred to a node QRo. Therefore, the read data RD can be accurately transferred to the clock synchronous type circuit  while a predetermined latency (\u201c3\u201d in this example) is ensured.","(2) td>tclk",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Assume that the period tclk of the clock signal Clock is shorter than the delay time td, i.e., the operating frequency is increased.

That is, in this case, the read data RD cannot be accurately transferred to the clock synchronous type circuit  while a predetermined latency (\u201c3\u201d in this example) is ensured.","Note that the read data RD is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit  the predetermined delay time td after the leading edge of the read control signal READ. The switching circuits S, S, and S respectively transfer the read data RD from the input side to the output side in response to the leading edges of the control signals PSi, PSo, and PO.","Note that the problem in the case of td>tclk can be solved by obtaining the ratio (td\/tclk) of the delay time td to the period tclk of the clock signal Clock in advance and inhibiting the use of the control signal PSo for determining a transfer timing in accordance with this ratio.","At this time, since it is known in advance that the control signal PSo is not used, the storage circuit shown in  must be changed into the storage circuit shown in  by decreasing the number of latch circuits in the storage circuit  by one.","In the storage circuit having the arrangement shown in , however, when a control signal PS is made to rise after one clock signal Clock immediately after an edge A of the read control signal READ is output, a new problem arises in the case of td<tclk (when the operating frequency decreases).","The relationship between the delay time td in the storage circuit in FIG.  and the period tclk of the clock signal Clock will therefore be described below.","(1) td>tclk",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00055","num":"00055"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"If the period tclk of the clock signal Clock is shorter than the delay time td (1\u2266td\/tclk<2), the level of the control signal PS for storing the read data RD in the storage circuit  rises (\u201cL\u201d\u2192\u201cH\u201d) after skipping one clock signal Clock immediately after the read control signal READ is input.","Since one clock signal Clock immediately after the read control signal READ is input is skipped, the read data RD (=D, D, D) are always stored in the storage circuit  after the data are output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit .

The read data RD read out from the clock non-synchronous type circuit  is not synchronous with the clock signal Clock, and hence the clock synchronous type circuit  cannot determine the input timing of the read data RD.","In the storage circuit according to the fourth embodiment, the time td between the instant at which the read control signal READ is supplied to the clock non-synchronous type circuit  (the read control signal READ rises) and the instant at which the read data RD is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit  is estimated in detail, and the clock synchronous type circuit  determines the input timing of the read data RD on the basis of this time td.","This time td is, however, not always constant, and varies due to various factors, e.g., the parasitic capacitance produced in a signal line. For this reason, if the read data RD (D) is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit  before the control signal PIe rises, no problem arises. If, however, the control signal PIe rises before the read data RD (D) is output from the clock non-synchronous type circuit , erroneous data (undefined) may be input to the storage circuit .","In contrast to this, in the storage circuits (latency control circuits) according to the first to third embodiments, the input timing of read data is determined by the control signal RLPLS.  shows the storage circuit according to the third embodiment.","Therefore, read data from the clock non-synchronous type circuit  can always be accurately distributed to the latch circuits in the storage circuit  and input to the clock synchronous type circuit  in synchronism with the clock signal Clock regardless of the relationship between the period (frequency) tclk of the clock signal Clock and the time td between the instant at which read operation is started (the read control signal READ rises) and the instant at which read data is output.","The control signal RLPLS is a signal representing that the read data RD is output. The control signal RLPLS always rises from \u201cL\u201d to \u201cH\u201d after the read data RD is output regardless of whether the data read time td is shortened as shown in , or the data read time td is prolonged as shown in FIG. .","By generating the control signals PIe and PIo on the basis of the control signal RLPLS instead of the clock signal Clock, therefore, data can always be accurately transferred from the clock non-synchronous type circuit to the clock synchronous type circuit regardless of whether the data read time td varies while the operating frequency tclk remains constant.","As has been described above, according to the first to third embodiments, data can be accurately transferred even if the data read time td remains constant and the operating frequency tclk varies to become td>tclk or td<tclk, or the data read time td varies due to some reason while the operation frequency remains constant.","Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00010","num":"00010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
