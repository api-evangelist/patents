More particularly, the disclosure relates to a web-based imaging system and method with which network services associated with a local device can be accessed and utilized.","As computer technology has advanced, the role of computers in our daily lives has expanded, as has the need for various peripheral or supporting devices. One typical peripheral device used with computers is a printer, which generates hard copies of electronic data. The types and capabilities of available printers have similarly been expanding, resulting in a wide variety of printers with a range of printing capabilities, performance, and price.","One significant expansion in the use of computer technology is the networking of computers. Networking computers together allows the computers to communicate with one another as well as with other devices, such as printers. As computer networks, such as the Internet, continue to develop, there is increasing demand for additional and improved functionalities that draw upon and exploit the full computing potential of computer networks.","The present disclosure relates to a system and method for accessing network services. In one arrangement, the system and method pertain to obtaining an address of a network service from a local device via a direct connection, and facilitating designation of the network service address as a default destination such that a user browser can be redirected directly to the network service when an appropriate command is received.","The present disclosure further relates to an imaging extension stored on a computer-readable medium. In one arrangement, the imaging extension comprises logic configured detect when a client device is directly connected to a local device, logic configured to obtain an address of a network service associated with the local device via the direct connection, and logic configured to designate the network service address as a default destination.","Moreover, the present disclosure relates to a direct connection manager stored on a computer-readable medium. In one arrangement, the manager comprises logic configured detect when a client device is directly connected to a local device, logic configured to obtain an address of a network service associated with the local device via the direct connection, and logic configured to instruct a user personal imaging repository to designate the network service address as a default destination.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following specification, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Disclosed is a system and method for accessing network services. The system can have a distributed architecture with which a user can maintain imaging data. In a such an arrangement, the user may access a network-based or web-based imaging service that enables the user to access the imaging data in the user's personal imaging repository, as well as arrange the imaging data as desired. Once the arrangement has been selected, a document can be stored in the user's personal imaging repository and, if desired, accessed and used by a destination service associated with a local device.","To facilitate description of the inventive system and method, example systems are discussed with reference to the figures. Although these systems are described in detail, it will be appreciated that they are provided for purposes of illustration only and that various modifications are feasible without departing from the inventive concept. After the description of the example systems, examples of operation of the systems are provided to explain the manners in which the network services can be accessed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","100"]},"The personal imaging repository  provides image storage facilities that typically are personalized for the individual imaging client . The imaging repository  can be located in various different places. For example, the repository  can be maintained on one or more computing devices associated with the imaging client , imaging source(s) , or imaging destination(s) . Alternatively, the repository  can be maintained on a separate computing device (e.g., server) that the imaging client , imaging source(s) , and imaging destination(s)  can access. The imaging data in the imaging repository  can be any type of printable data, such as text, graphics, frames of video or animations, pictures, combinations thereof, and so forth.","Once imaging data are stored in the personal imaging repository , the imaging client  can select data from the repository that is to be communicated to the imaging destination(s)  for some form of processing or manipulation. By way of example, the data are communicated to the image destination(s)  for printing. Where the imaging destination(s)  are adapted for printing, they may comprise any of a wide variety of printing devices that are capable of generating hard copy documents, such as printers, multifunction peripherals (MFPs), plotters, services managing printing devices, and so on.","As will be apparent from the discussions that follow, the above-described manner of operation provides a high degree of personalization to the imaging client . Specifically, in that the client's personal information can be accessed and utilized with any participating service (e.g., web site) used by the client, each service can be customized for the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","202","204","202","206","208","202","206","208"]},"The network  represents one or more data distribution networks that can be used to communicate data and other information (e.g., control information) between or among various computing devices. Examples for the network  include the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a public or private wide area network (WAN), and combinations thereof. The network  can further include various different types of networks, including wired and\/or wireless portions, employing any of a wide variety of different communications protocols including public and\/or proprietary communications protocols.","During operation, the user can operate a network browser  executing on the imaging client device  to interact with imaging services ,  executing on the network servers  and . As used herein, the term \u201cservices\u201d refers to software and\/or firmware components that can execute on one or more computing devices and which provide one or more particular functionalities to the imaging client device  such as imaging data selection and arrangement, data manipulation, printing, and so forth. As indicated in , the network browser  can receive network content  from one or more of the network servers  and . This content  typically includes various components such as, for example, text, graphics, and various commands (e.g., hypertext mark-up language (HTML), Java\u2122, JavaScript\u2122, etc.) and\/or applications (e.g., Java\u2122 applets). In use, the content  can, in some arrangements, facilitate communication with a personal imaging repository  so that the servers  and  can access data stored in the repository. Examples of the ways in which this communication can be facilitated are described below with reference to .","The network server  executes an imaging source service  that, among other things, allows the user to interact with his or her personal imaging repository . The imaging source service  may actually provide multiple services that can be accessed. In some embodiments, these different services can provide different functionalities. For instance, one service may be responsible for graphic storage and retrieval while another service may be responsible for merging graphics in a single document. By accessing these services with the network browser , the user can select or identify imaging data that are to be stored as graphics in a graphic store  of the personal imaging repository . These graphics can be stored as individual files and generally can comprise any data capable of being represented as a two dimensional graphic. As is discussed below, the individual graphics in store  can be used as individual images that can be printed on appropriate print media, or multiple individual graphics can be compiled together as a single image for printing.","Irrespective of whether multiple graphics are to be used, the imaging source service  can be used to arrange the graphic(s) on a visual representation of a document to be created. Once the arrangement has been selected, the imaging source service  can store the arrangement as a composition (i.e., a composition image) in a composition store  of the personal image repository . It is to be noted that, although the graphic store  and the composition store  are illustrated as two separate stores, multiple such stores may exist in the system  and one or more graphic stores may be combined with one or more composition stores. Additionally, one or more of these stores  and  may be implemented on the imaging client device , one or more of the servers  or , or another designated computing device (not shown).","Once the graphics and composition have been selected, the image data can be processed or otherwise manipulated by accessing an imaging destination service  that executes on the network server . Where one or more hard copy documents are to be generated, this service  can comprise a print service with which the document(s) can be printed. In such a scenario, a print request is communicated to the imaging destination service  and, upon receipt of the print request, the network server  interacts with the graphic store  and composition store  to retrieve the data needed to complete the print job. Once these data are retrieved, the network server  interacts with one or more printing devices (not shown) to which the server is coupled (directly or indirectly) to generate the hard copy document(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"As indicated in , the system  includes an imaging client device . The imaging client device  comprises a web browser  that is adapted to access web content  derived from an imaging source service  and an imaging destination service  of web servers  and , respectively. The web content , like content , typically comprises text, graphics, and various commands. The commands can comprise one or more sets of executable instructions that are downloaded into the browser  to perform a service requested by the user. These instructions can be written in any suitable language including, for instance, HTML, Java\u2122, JavaScript\u2122, C-sharp, or other appropriate language. A variety of different functionalities can be served by the executable instructions. For example, the web content  normally includes executable instructions for causing target graphics, i.e. graphics provided by an accessed web site, to be displayed to the user.","In the embodiment shown in , the executable instructions are further used to access a personal imaging repository . These instructions typically comprise system-wide generic access instructions  that call on methods of an imaging extension  to access the personal imaging repository  and perform various web imaging operations. These instructions  are designated as \u201cgeneric\u201d because they are independent of the configuration of the user's personal imaging repository . As is discussed in greater detail below, the generic access instructions  can be used to, for example, add a graphic to a default graphic store  of the personal imaging repository , or add a new composition to a default composition store  of the repository.","As is further indicated in , the imaging extension  can form part of the browser . Although this arrangement is shown in the figure and described herein, the imaging extension  can, alternatively, be provided outside of the browser , for instance on a different device. Irrespective of its location, however, the imaging extension  is configured to respond to the execution of the generic access instructions  by generating\/mapping to corresponding imaging client specific commands of the user. The imaging extension  typically is implemented as one or more application programming instructions (APIs) that, preferably, act as interfaces in accordance with a system-wide standard.","When executed, the generic access instructions  cause imaging extension calls (e.g., API calls) to be issued which, in turn, cause the imaging extension  (e.g., APIs) to access to the user's personal imaging repository . The web content  therefore uses the imaging extension  as a gateway to access the user's personal imaging repository . Generally speaking, the APIs can comprise sets of methods for establishing a destination for redirecting the browser  based on some form of received redirection initiation. In such circumstances, the process normally comprises receiving a redirection initiation to redirect the browser , retrieving a direct or indirect reference to a destination, and then causing the browser to browse to that destination. It will be recognized that there are many other ways (both in hardware and software) to implement this same functionality.","In some arrangements, the imaging extension  is configured to prevent the web content  (i.e., the executable instructions from one or more web services), from arbitrarily accessing the user's personal imaging repository . This restricted access can be imposed upon the web content  using a variety of methods. For example, an imaging extension API can be configured to only accept references from the web content  that were previously provided by the imaging extension . In such a scenario, the content  cannot arbitrarily supply references when calling the imaging extension API. Therefore, in order to access the user's personal imaging repository , the web content  must first obtain references using the imaging extension API.","The imaging extension  can be used to access one or more user profiles  that is\/are stored in a user profile store  of a server  of the personal imaging repository . By way of example, the imaging extension  can be directed to the user profile  with a uniform resource locator (URL), pointer, socket, or other backroom detail. In addition, the imaging extension  can be configured to detect when the client device  is directly \u201cconnected\u201d with a local device. For instance, the imaging extension  may be configured to detect when wireless communications (e.g., via radio frequency (RF) or infrared (IR transmissions)) have been established between the client device  and a local device. In such a case, the imaging extension  can further be configured to note the address of a network service associated with the local device so as to facilitate access to the service.","The user profile  typically includes references to all or a portion of the personal imaging repository  for that user profile. For instance, as shown in , the user profile  can include a reference  to a default graphic store, a reference  to a default composition store, and a reference  to a default composition. In addition, the user profile  can contain other information particular to the user such as the location (i.e., address) of a preferred imaging destination (e.g., an imaging home page) that the user may wish to access by default (e.g., when a \u201cprint\u201d command is selected). In addition, the user profile can contain the location (i.e., address) of a temporary imaging destination that is used to temporarily override the preferred imaging destination, where appropriate. For instance, where the user wishes to print to a local printing device that is web-enabled, the user may wish to designate the address (e.g., URL) of a printing service associated with the printing device to more directly access the service. In use, the user profile  functions as a service that uses appropriate methods to create, modify, access, and cancel profiles. Accordingly, the imaging extension  maps to the appropriate methods (i.e., makes use of the methods) in the user profile  to obtain the reference to various repository items such as the default graphic store  and the default composition store .","Like the user profile store , the default graphic store  and default composition store  can reside on separate servers  and . It will be understood, however, that one or more of the stores could reside on a single machine, if desired. As indicated in , the default graphic store  is used to store various graphics, such as graphics ,  and . These graphics can be stored in substantially any format. For example, these formats can comprise PDF, JPEG, PostScript, TIFF, GIF, BMP, etc. In addition, the default graphic store  can include one or more APIs. Therefore, in contrast to merely providing for graphic storage, the graphic store  can also provide services used to create, retrieve, and\/or manipulate graphics. Furthermore, the default graphic store  can communicate with the web content of various web services. For example, the imaging destination service  can submit queries to the default graphic store  (via the extension ) to request that one or more graphics be transmitted to the service in a desired arrangement.","The default composition store  stores various compositions, such as compositions  and , which can be used to arrange the selected graphics. Like the user profile store  and default graphic store , the default composition store  can also comprise various APIs that can access graphics from the graphic store, manipulate the graphics, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","300","400","302","304","306","400","320","324","336","346","400","312","316","300","400","302","300","402","404","404","406","304"]},"In addition to the above-noted differences, the servers  and  are provided with different software in the system  to permit alternative modes of operation. By way of example, the web server  can execute an imaging source service , which includes web content  and an imaging extension . Similarly, the web server  can execute an imaging destination service  that includes web content  and an imaging extension . Like the web content of the system , the web content  and web content  typically comprise text and graphics that can be downloaded into the user's browser . Unlike the system , however, generic access instructions need not be downloaded into the browser  in that the browser does not comprise its own imaging extension. Such an arrangement is advantageous where the client device  has limited storage capacity (e.g., for PDAs, mobile telephones). Instead, as identified above, the services  and  include their own imaging extensions  and  that can be used to access the user's personal imaging repository . By way of example, the content  and  comprise server-side code including one or more of PHP script, Java\u2122 Servlets, Java\u2122 server pages (JSPs), active server pages (ASPs), etc.","Each of the imaging extensions  and  typically has a configuration that is similar to that of the imaging extension . Therefore, the imaging extensions  and  can comprise one or more APIs that, when executed, access to the user's personal imaging repository . Again, the APIs can comprise sets of methods for establishing a destination for redirecting the browser  based on some form of received redirection initiation. The APIs can implement, for instance, a URL, pointer, socket, or other backroom detail to facilitate the redirection.","The manner in which the personal imaging repository  is accessed by the services in the system  will now be discussed with reference to an example scenario. In this example, the user browses to the imaging source service  using the web browser  of the client device . Upon reaching the service , web content  is executed to generate web pages that are downloaded to the web browser  (as content ). Once this occurs, the browser  is redirected by the content  to the authentication service  that resides on the web server . Typically, this is accomplished by the web content  by generating a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) redirect that, when downloaded to the browser , causes the browser to redirect to an address (e.g., URL) identified in the header entry. Web content is then downloaded to the web browser  and the user is provided with an opportunity to complete an authentication procedure that identifies both the user's identity and the location of the user's personal imaging repository . The authentication procedure can, for example, comprise entry of authentication information, such a user name and password, that has been registered with the authentication service , for example, in a previous session. This information can be entered in a web page generated by the server . In an alternative arrangement, the authentication procedure can comprise the reading of a user identification card, which includes storage media (e.g., magnetic strip) that contains the user's authentication information. Persons having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many other authentication alternatives exist.","Once the authentication procedure is successfully completed by the user, the browser  is again redirected, this time back to the imaging source service . The redirection address (e.g., URL) used to revisit the imaging source service  contains information that identifies the user and information identifying the user's personal imaging repository  (e.g., with a further URL). To avoid continual redirection back and forth, a \u201ccookie\u201d can be stored on the client device  that permits the authentication service  to validate the user's identity without requiring a further log in. Once this information is possessed by the imaging source service , the service can, when appropriate, make calls to its imaging extension  (e.g., API calls) to command the imaging extension to access the user profile store  of the personal imaging repository . Through this access, the imaging source service  can be used by the user to, for instance, select or identify imaging data to be stored as graphics in the default graphic store .","When the imaging destination service  is accessed, for example through redirection from the imaging source service , various content is downloaded to the web browser . The imaging destination service  can then access the default graphic store  and default composition store  such that the graphics to be printed can be accessed and their arrangement on the document obtained.","As noted above, the imaging client device  does not include an imaging extension in the embodiment of . The device  can, however, include a direct connection manager  that is configured to detect when a direct connection has been established with a local device. For instance, the direct connection manager  can determine that the client device  is directly connected to a local web-enabled printing device. In such a case, the direct connection manager  can further be configured to provide the address (e.g., URL) of a network service associated with the local device to the personal imaging repository  (i.e., user profile ) to permit the user to more directly access the service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["302","302","302","500","502","504","506","508","510","512"]},"The processing device  can include any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU) or an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the client device , a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip), a macroprocessor, one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a plurality of suitably configured digital logic gates, and other well known electrical configurations comprising discrete elements both individually and in various combinations to coordinate the overall operation of the client device . The memory  can include any one of a combination of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, etc.)) and nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, etc.).","The one or more user interface devices  comprise those components with which the user can interact with the client device . For example, where the client device  comprises a personal computer (PC), these components can comprise a keyboard and mouse. Where the client device  comprises a handheld device (e.g., PDA, mobile telephone), these components can comprise function keys or buttons, a touch-sensitive screen, a stylus, etc. The display  can comprise a computer monitor or plasma screen for a PC or a liquid crystal display (LCD) for a handheld device.","With further reference to , the one or more I\/O devices  are adapted to facilitate direct connection of the client device  to another device (e.g., a local printing device) and may therefore include one or more serial, parallel, small computer system interface (SCSI), universal serial bus (USB), IEEE 1394 (e.g., Firewire\u2122), and\/or personal area network (PAN) components. The network interface devices  comprise the various components used to transmit and\/or receive data over a network (e.g., network  in ). By way of example, the network interface devices  include a device that can communicate both inputs and outputs, for instance, a modulator\/demodulator (e.g., modem), wireless (e.g., radio frequency (RF)) transceiver, a telephonic interface, a bridge, a router, network card, etc. As will be appreciated by persons having ordinary skill in the art, the network interface devices  can, like the I\/O devices , be used to facilitate direct connection of the client device  to another device (e.g., a local printing device).","The memory  normally at least comprises an operating system  and a web browser . The operating system  controls the execution of other software and provides scheduling, input-output control, file and data management, memory management, and communication control and related services. As noted above with reference to , the web browser  comprises software and\/or firmware that is used to access various services over a network (e.g., Internet) and, therefore, download content from various different sources. Where the web browser  is configured as indicated in , the browser can comprise an imaging extension . However, it will be understood that where the system is arranged as indicated in , the imaging extension  need not be provided in the browser . As is further identified in , the client device  can, optionally, include a direct connection manager  that, as described above in relation to , is capable of detecting when the client device is directly connected to another device (e.g., a local printing device) and sharing this information with the personal imaging repository . The manager , where provided, can comprise an independent software and\/or firmware module designed for this purpose or can comprise part of other software and\/or firmware that are used to facilitate communications with the other device.","The architecture of the various servers shown in  are typically similar to that described above with reference to . Therefore, separate figures are not provided for these servers. Regardless, however, persons having ordinary skill in the art will recognize the various different architectures that could be used for the construction of the servers.","Various software and\/or firmware has been described herein. It is to be understood that this software and\/or firmware can be stored on any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with any computer-related system or method. In the context of this document, a computer-readable medium denotes an electronic, magnetic, optical, or other physical device or means that can contain or store a computer program for use by or in connection with a computer-related system or method. These programs can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d can be any means that can store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","The computer-readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a nonexhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium include an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM, EEPROM, or Flash memory), an optical fiber, and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM). Note that the computer-readable medium can even be paper or another suitable medium upon which a program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.","Example systems having been described above, operation of the systems will now be discussed. In the discussions that follow, flow diagrams are provided. It is to be understood that any process steps or blocks in these flow diagrams represent modules, segments, or portions of code that include one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. It will be appreciated that, although particular example process steps are described, alternative implementations are feasible. Moreover, steps may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrently or in reverse order, depending on the functionality involved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","102","602"]},"At this point, or earlier in the flow, the client device  can communicate with the local device, as indicated in block . Through this communication, the address (e.g., URL) of a network service associated with the device, e.g., hosted by the device, can be obtained. It is noted that the address may be provided in any of a wide range of protocols, including common protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) that operate over TCP\/IP networks (i.e., Internet networks) as well as other protocols such as OBEX and those yet to be invented. Examples of the manner in which this information is obtained are described below. By way of example, the service comprises a web site that is served by an embedded server of the local device. Once the address of the network service has been obtained, the user can browse directly to the service using the client device , as indicated in block . Referring now to , an example of use of an imaging source  to create and\/or identify data is provided. The imaging source  can have various different arrangements. By way of example, the imaging source  can simply comprise a local application (e.g., word processing application) that executes on the client device . In another example, the imaging source  can comprise a network-based (e.g., web-based) service with which data can be created, identified, and\/or arranged by the user. Where the imaging source  comprises a network-based service, the user may access the source with a browser . In such a scenario, the service typically comprises a web site that is accessed via the Internet.","Irrespective of its configuration, the imaging source  is first accessed by the user, as indicated in block . The operation from this point forward may, however, depend upon whether the imaging source  is a local application or a network-based service. Referring to block , if the imaging source  is not a network-based service, flow continues down to block  described below. If, on the other hand, the imaging source  is a network-based service, flow continues to block  at which the imaging source  downloads content  into the user browser. As noted above, this content  normally includes various text and\/or graphics that are displayed to the user to facilitate interfacing between the user and the service. As described above with reference to , this content  can, optionally, include generic access instructions  that call on methods of an imaging extension  of the browser  to perform various web imaging operations.","After the imaging source  has been accessed, the source can receive entry or identification of data (i.e., graphics), as indicated in block . For example, the imaging source  can receive data manually entered by the user via the user interface devices  of the client device . Alternatively, the user can identify the location of data (e.g., a formerly created document) that resides in memory  of the client device  or in a network-accessible location remote from the device memory. Once the data have been received and\/or identified, it can be determined whether further data are to be entered and\/or identified, as indicated in decision element . If further data are to be entered and\/or identified, flow returns to  at which these data are received. If no further data are to be entered and\/or identified, however, flow continues on to block  at which the received data, as well as the arrangement (i.e., composition) of the data, are stored within the personal imaging repository . More specifically, the data can be stored within the graphic store  and the arrangement of the data can be stored within the composition store . Although the data and arrangement (i.e., imaging data) have been described as being stored in separate \u201cstores,\u201d persons having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the data and their arrangement could be stored within a single \u201cstore.\u201d","Where the imaging source  is a network-based service, storage of the imaging data can be facilitated through use of the imaging extension  stored in the user browser  and\/or an imaging extension  stored on web server . In the former case, the content  downloaded to the browser  makes a call (e.g., API call) to the imaging extension  to, in turn, cause a call to be made to the user profile store  that contains the user profile . Through this call, the default graphic store  can be accessed and various graphics can be stored therein.","In the example system  of , storage of the imaging data is accomplished through use of the imaging extension . In particular, when the imaging source  was first accessed, the user's browser  can have been redirected by the content  downloaded into the browser to an authentication service and the user provided with an opportunity to complete an authentication procedure that identifies both the user's identity and the location of the user's personal imaging repository . Once the authentication procedure has been successfully completed, the browser  is again redirected and the user information, or at minimum the location of the user profile , is supplied to the destination (e.g., printing) service. With this information, the service can then access the user's personal imaging repository  by making a call to the imaging extension  to command the imaging extension to make a call to the user profile store  of the personal imaging repository . Although use of an imaging extension is specifically identified, persons having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that, alternatively, the service can directly call the user profile store . In such a case, the service can, for instance, use a collection of stubs that are configured to call various elements of the personal imaging repository .","It is to be noted that the graphic store  and\/or composition store  can, in some arrangements, form part of or be supported by the imaging source . Accordingly, where the imaging source  comprises a local application, the stores ,  may be located within memory  of the client device . Where the imaging source  comprises a network-based service, the stores ,  may be located on one or more servers that are accessible over the network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"Beginning with block , direct connection between the client device  and the local printing device is established. This connection can be facilitated by wire (e.g., through a USB cable) or wirelessly (e.g., through RF or IR transmission). In addition, the connection can have been established in various different ways. For instance, the connection can have been established due to an initial communication transmitted from the client device  to the printing device in response to a user command or automatically as a consequence of the proximity between the client device and the printing device. In another scenario, the connection can have been established by an initial communication sent by the printing device. For example, the printing device can be configured to issue periodic communications (e.g., pings) to determine if client devices capable of communicating back are within range.","In any case, the connection can then be detected, as indicated in block . Which component detects this connection may, however, depend upon the configuration of the underlying system. For example, where the system is configured as that shown in , the connection may be detected by the imaging extension  stored on the client device . Alternatively, where the system is configured as that shown in , the connection may be detected by the direct connection manager  described above. Irrespective of which component detects the connection, flow continues to decision element  at which it is determined whether the printing device is network-enabled, i.e., whether its printing services can be accessed with a browser. If not, the printing service must be accessed in a more conventional manner and flow is terminated. If the device is network-enabled, however, flow continues to block  at which the address (e.g., URL) of the printing service is obtained by the imaging extension  or the direct connection manager . This service may be hosted by the local printing device. Notably, however, this address may be that of a remote service responsible for representing the local printing device. By way of example, this information can be obtained by querying the printing device. Alternatively, where the printing device is configured for such operation, the printing device can have automatically provided this information in one of the communications it previously sent to the client device .","At this point, the address can be stored as a current temporary print destination, as indicated in block , and the temporary print destination designated as the current default destination as indicated in block . The nature of these steps may again depend upon the configuration of the system. For example, where the system is configured as indicated in , the imaging extension  can maintain an internal record of the current default destination such that, when called upon by the generic access instructions  that are downloaded into the browser , the user's browser  will be redirected directly to the print service of the local print device when a \u201cprint\u201d command is selected. Where the system is configured as indicated in , the direct connection manager  can have communicated with the personal imaging repository , e.g., the user profile , to instruct it that the current default destination is the print service of the local printing device and provide its address, in effect overriding the preferred printing destination stored within the repository.","With reference to decision element , the default destination will continue to be the temporary print destination (i.e., the print service of the local printing device) until such time when the direct connection between the client device  and the local printing device is severed. At that time, flow continues to block  at which the designation of the temporary print destination as the default destination is removed. Normally, the removal of the designation entails the reverse of the procedure used in block . Accordingly, where the system is configured as shown in , the imaging extension  will note that the temporary print destination no longer is to be used as the default and, where the system is configured as shown in , the direct connection manager  will communicate the same to the personal imaging repository .","With the process described in relation to , the user will be able to directly access the printing service of the local printing device.  describes an example of operation from this point on. Beginning with block  of , the imaging destination  (i.e., printing service) is first accessed. By way of example, the process can have been initiated by selecting \u201cprint\u201d from a network-based imaging service. With the entry of this command, the printing service can be accessed by way of the imaging extension , which now has the address of the printing service (), or the imaging extension , which can obtain the address of the printing service from the personal imaging repository  (). Once the printing service is accessed, it downloads content  into the user's browser , as indicated in block . This content  normally includes various text and\/or graphics that are displayed to the user to facilitate interfacing between the user and the service. Where the system is arranged as shown in , the content  can also include generic access instructions  that call on methods of the imaging extension  of the browser  so that the user's personal imaging repository  can be accessed. Where the system is arranged as shown in , the imaging extension  of the imaging destination can be used to access the personal imaging repository . In this latter case, the imaging extension  knows the location of the personal imaging repository  from information provided to the imaging destination with, for example, a redirection address (e.g., URL).","Next, the printing service accesses the imaging data (e.g., document) that are to be printed, as indicated in block . Where the imaging source  comprises a local application that executes on the client device , this access can be facilitated by entry by the user of the location of a document to be printed. Alternatively, where the imaging source  comprises a network-based service, access can be gained by automatic reference to the user's personal imaging repository  using an imaging extension  or . Assuming the user had just created and\/or identified the document(s) using a network-based service, the imaging data comprises the default graphics and default composition that were stored by the network-based service.","At this point, the printing service retrieves the imaging data (i.e., document), as indicated in block . Once the imaging data have been retrieved, printing service can prompt the user to select the desired printing options, as indicated in block . Typically, this prompting is effected with an interface (e.g., graphical user interface (GUI)) in the form of one or more web pages that are presented to the user with the browser . After the various selections have been entered by the user, the user selections can be received, as indicated in block , and a print job is initiated, as indicated in block .","While particular embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in detail in the foregoing description and drawings for purposes of example, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that variations and modifications thereof can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention can be better understood with reference to the following drawings.
