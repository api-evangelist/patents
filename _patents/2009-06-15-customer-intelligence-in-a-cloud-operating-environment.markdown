title: Customer intelligence in a cloud operating environment
abstract: Computer-readable media, computer systems, and computing devices for providing customer intelligence data to a developer of an application that runs on a cloud operating environment associated with an online services provider. The online services provider collects customer information about customers, each of whom is identified by a customer ID. A developer uploads an application, having a corresponding application ID, and manages the application using resources associated with the cloud operating environment. An analysis module creates a three-way mapping between the application ID, customer IDs corresponding to customers that use the application, and customer intelligence data associated with the customer IDs. Using this mapping, the system presents the developer with customer intelligence information based on the customer intelligence data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Developers write applications to make money. When those applications run, developers expect to understand their customers, either through direct market research or via instrumentation of their code to understand usage trends. This customer intelligence information can be invaluable to a developer in understanding how best to serve its customers, thereby maximizing its profits. Many developers seek to understand the higher-order \u201chuman level\u201d information associated with their customers. This level of information would allow the developers to provide much more precise targeting (\u201cnarrowcasting\u201d) of their applications and services to make runtime decisions around providing a wholly unique and customized experience on a customer-by-customer basis. Examples of this \u201chuman level\u201d information (referred to throughout as a component of \u201ccustomer intelligence information\u201d) include: age, gender, home address, interests, commercial intent, and the like.","However, no matter how much instrumentation the developer places in the code, the developer will not know anything more about the customers than the customers themselves are willing to divulge. Many customers are unwilling to provide information due to privacy concerns, distrustfulness, or a simple lack of time. Thus, generally developers make do with the \u201cphysical level\u201d information they can glean from the computing infrastructure. This includes metrics such as geographic location of the customer's IP address, browser language settings, timestamps, and the like.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in isolation as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Embodiments of the present invention provide customer intelligence information to a developer or other user associated with a cloud services platform. According to embodiments, developers do not need to write additional code to enable the features described herein. By drawing upon the demographic and other rich customer intelligence that is often collected by service platform providers, the service providers can enhance the experience of developers who write and\/or run applications on a cloud services platform.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a three-way mapping between the unique ID of the customer, the demographic and other \u201chuman level\u201d customer intelligence data associated with that customer and the unique ID of the developer's application. Graphical representations of aggregations and other metrics associated with the data can be presented in a variety of forms. By enabling access to and creative delivery of this rich customer intelligence data, the developer can better make informed decisions about the features or direction of their applications and services. Moreover, the mapping allows for performing these analyses without compromising the privacy of individual customers since the service provider generally cannot uniquely identity a specific user without violating its own contractual and other legal obligations.","The subject matter of embodiments of the invention disclosed herein is described with specificity to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover, although the terms \u201cstep\u201d and\/or \u201cblock\u201d may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed, the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.","Embodiments of the invention described herein include systems and methods for providing customer intelligence information to a developer of an application running on a cloud services platform. In a first illustrative embodiment, a set of computer-executable instructions provides an exemplary method of providing rich customer intelligence information associated with an application running in a cloud operating environment, the cloud operating environment being associated with a service platform comprising a plurality of resources. Embodiments of the method include presenting a developer with a user interface that includes selectable options for displaying customer intelligence information associated with the application. The developer can select options and specify or request an application identifier (ID) corresponding to the application. In embodiments of the invention, customer intelligence data corresponding to customers that use the application is retrieved and mapped to the application ID and correlated customer IDs. The data is analyzed according to the developer's requests and the results are presented on a display. In embodiments of the invention, the results can be displayed as text, tables, graphs, charts, and other graphics.","In a second illustrative embodiment, a set of computer-executable instructions provides an exemplary method of providing rich customer intelligence information associated with an application running in a cloud operating environment, the cloud operating environment being associated with a service platform comprising a plurality of resources. Customer intelligence data is collected and stored in a storage medium. An application ID is received from a developer, another user, an application, an application ID generator, or some other entity. Upon receiving a request for customer intelligence information associated with the application ID, program modules identify the customer IDs corresponding to customers that have utilized the application and map these customer IDs to the application ID. The customer IDs (at some point in time) are mapped to customer intelligence data. Aggregation parameters can be specified by a developer, and in return, the developer can be provided with a visual representation of customer intelligence information on a display.","In a third illustrative embodiment, a computing device is provided that facilitates providing customer intelligence information associated with an application running in a cloud operating environment. In embodiments, the computer system includes a storage medium having a number of program modules embodied thereon. When executed by a processor, the modules include a mapping module that communicates with a data store through a network.
