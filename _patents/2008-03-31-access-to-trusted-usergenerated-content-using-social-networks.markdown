title: Access to trusted user-generated content using social networks
abstract: A method to access trusted user generated content (UGC) is provided. User registration information containing one or more identities is obtained. Each identity corresponds to an internet social network that is facilitated by one of a plurality of social network sites. The social relationships are collected using the provided user identities at the different social network sites and user extended social networks are created for each user by joining the social relationships collected. Then, UGC is collected from the plurality of social network sites and the collected UGC is correlated with the extended social networks. The correlated UGC is filtered according to the user configuration of a user making a request, and then the results are presented to the requesting user. A search function is provided to obtain information on demand, or alternatively, a user receives feeds of information according to configured information regarding the user's extended social network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to methods, computer programs and systems for providing User-Generated Content (UGC), such as ratings and reviews, which is trusted by internet users.","2. Description of the Related Art","Internet users are interested in user generated content, such as product and service ratings and reviews, but performing a comprehensive search for such content requires significant effort and time. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine what content is trustworthy. Today, user generated content is fragmented across many websites. For example, ratings and reviews for hotels are available from Yahoo!\u2122 Travel, Frommer's\u2122, Expedia\u2122, etc. In the restaurant area, ratings and reviews are available from Yahoo!\u2122 Local, Yelp\u2122, etc. In the online shopping area, product ratings and reviews are available from Yahoo!\u2122 Shopping, Epinions\u2122, CNET\u2122, etc.","There is no easy method of searching across these siloed sites. For example, a user interested in information about San Francisco hotels has essentially two options: searching for \u201cSan Francisco hotel reviews\u201d on a web search engine such as Yahoo!\u2122, or searching individual websites containing travel information, such as Yahoo!\u2122 Travel and TripAdvisor\u2122. The first option requires filtering out irrelevant entries in the search result. The second option is time consuming because it requires searching a plurality of websites, one at a time. Furthermore, the second option requires that the user be aware of all the major websites for the particular area of interest, such as travel or hotels in the examples mentioned above.","Additionally, there are vast amounts of available user generated content, complicating the problem of finding the right information because of the stringent filtering required to get relevant information. For example, if a user is looking for dining ideas in San Francisco, where should the user start? There are reviews for hundreds to thousands of restaurants and tens of cuisine styles in San Francisco on each of the major content sites. If the user is looking for general ideas, the search criteria is left wide open making it difficult for a search mechanism to find the desired information according to the user intent.","Another problem confronting a user looking for ratings and reviews is that ratings and reviews are essentially anonymous. For each review, there is usually a username shown, but typically the content reader does not know the identity associated with a username and therefore there is no basis on which to judge the trustworthiness of the author and her reviews. User-generated content can be very biased. For example, typically only residents with negative experiences post on apartment rating sites. In contrast, some hotel review sites have been known to have hotel staff anonymously post positive comments about their own hotels.","Another aspect of getting good UGC is that the information posted is only as good as the level of expertise of the author. To be up-to-date in certain areas, users must spend considerable effort to keep up with a product or service category. For example, tech gadgets and fashion are two areas that require significant time, research effort, and taste, to keep up-to-date with trends. Most people do not have the time required to keep up with the changes. However, people often have friends that have the expertise desired and whose opinion is highly valued. Today, there is no easy way to access content generated by a user's friends. The only way is to email links identifying content locations.","It is in this context that embodiments of the invention arise.","The problems previously described can be solved by using social networks, such as Yahoo!\u2122 Mash\u2122, Yahoo!\u2122360, Facebook\u2122 or Myspace\u2122, to organize user generated content currently fragmented across many web sites.","Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, computer programs and systems to access trusted User Generated Content (UGC). Information from social networks is used to identify user's extended social networks that encompass multiple social networks. UGC is provided to internet users based on the extended social networks of the user and the user's social peers.","It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, such as a process, an apparatus, a system, a device or a method on a computer readable medium. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below.","In one embodiment, a method to access trusted user generated content (UGC) is provided. The method includes receiving user registration information that has one or more identities for each user. Each identity corresponds to a social network that is facilitated by one of a plurality of social network sites. Then, collecting the social relationships corresponding to the identities for each user in the plurality of social network sites, and creating user extended social networks for each user by joining the social relationships collected. The method further includes, collecting UGC from the plurality of social network sites and correlating the collected UGC with the extended social networks. The method filters the correlated UGC according to a user configuration of a requesting user, and provides content that is available for presentation on a display.","In another embodiment, a search function is provided to obtain information on demand. In another embodiment, users subscribe to feeds of information according to configured information regarding the user's extended social network.","Other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","In the internet arena, social networks are online social structures for communities of people who share interests and activities, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others, and which necessitates the use of software. Internet social networks are often implemented by internet social network service providers that build and verify the social networks. Most services are primarily web based and provide a collection of various ways for users to interact, such as chat, messaging, email, video, voice chat, file sharing, blogging, discussion groups, etc.","The main types of social networking services are those which contain: directories of some categories, such as former classmates; means to connect with friends, usually containing self-description pages; and recommender systems linked to trust. Some examples of social networking sites are Yahoo! Groups\u2122, MySpace\u2122, Bebo\u2122, Facebook\u2122, Hi5\u2122, Google's Orkut\u2122, and Friendster\u2122.","A method to access trusted user generated content (UGC) is provided. User registration information containing one or more identities is obtained. The identities correspond to different internet social networks that are facilitated by social network service providers, where each service is associated with an internet social network site. The social relationships in each social network are collected using the provided user identities and user extended social networks are created for each user by joining the social relationships collected. Joining social relationships includes identifying the multiple identities of a single user in the different social networks and then merging the user's social networks into one extended social network that includes all the relationships scattered throughout the different social networks.","Then, UGC is collected from the plurality of social network sites and the collected UGC is correlated with the extended social networks, including identifying the owners of content according to the extended social networks of registered users. The correlated UGC is filtered according to the user configuration of a user making a request, and then the results are presented to the requesting user. The results can be shown to the user in a variety of ways, such as on a display using a web browser, email, instant messaging, etc. The display can be, for example, part of a computer system or a mobile phone.","A search function is provided to enable users to obtain information on demand. Alternatively, users can subscribe to feeds of information according to a configuration regarding the user's extended social network.","In another embodiment, a system to access trusted UGC includes a plurality of social network sites, and a registration server to receive user registration information. The registration information including one or more identities for each user in a plurality of social network sites. The system also includes a crawler to collect UGC and social relationships corresponding to the identities for each user from the plurality of social network sites, and a user metadata database that contains user extended social networks. The user extended social networks are created by joining the collected social relationships, and the collected UGC is correlated with the extended social networks.","The system further includes a user content database including the UGC obtained by the crawler, a search engine to filter the correlated UGC, and a display to provide the content to the requesting user.","It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","112","114","116","122","124","126","128","130","122","124","128","130","124","122","126","126","124","130"]},"Extended Social Network Server  allows users to register their identities from the different social networks and merge the different social groups into one large extended social network. More details on the architecture of Extended Social Network Server  are shown below with respect to .","Users create content in the different social network sites. Ratings, reviews, and wishlists are some of the popular ways of creating user generated content. For example, in the areas of photo sharing and blogs, Flickr\u2122 and Xanga\u2122 both have built-in social networks. To share Flickr\u2122 photos or Xanga\u2122 blogs, potential viewers need to be registered users and need to either be flagged as friends of the author or have subscribed to the author's content on each site. This procedure must be repeated on every closed content system. In contrast, according to one embodiment, the social relationship only needs to be registered once. In the example mentioned above, each user registers his Flick\u2122 and Xanga\u2122 identities and the sharing happens automatically. Furthermore, a user's friends are not required to register on Flickr or Xanga in order to subscribe to updates of the user's content. Once the relationship is established once, all the content generated by a user in any social network site is made available to her friends, or in other words, all those that are linked to the user via any social network.","Typically users access content via browser  running on a computer display . In other embodiments, content may be available via a mobile phone, laptop, handheld computer, etc., via browser, email, blogs, feeds, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","5","204","206","208","210","212","214","216","218","202","202","202","218"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":"120"},"Initially users register  in the Extended Social Network Server. In another embodiment, the extended social network structure is implemented on top of an existing social network site, and thus registration would not be required for those users that are already part of the social network site.","Each user registers her identities in one or more social sites. In , User  registers  id  for Social Network , id  for Social Network , and id  for Social Network . Users can subscribe to feeds of content according the user's interests, or do ad-hoc searches on the user generated content across all or any subset of the user generated content hosting websites known to the system. Ongoing feeds of information are saved in the system as Access Rules , which define parameters related to authoring, category, keywords, site, origin, etc.","Privacy is an important consideration for many users. The system allows the user (owner of user generated content) to specify what and to whom to share. In one embodiment, sharing is specified by the following parameters: content, sharing target, and identification option. The content component specifies a subset of the user's content and can include all content, content in a given category (e.g. all my restaurant reviews), or content in one site (e.g. all my Yelp reviews). Sharing target specifies the friends to share the given content with, e.g. \u201call friends of friends\u201d, \u201call friends\u201d, or \u201cAlice and Bob\u201d. Identification option specifies whether to display the content owner's identity to the sharing target. Suppose Bob is sharing his yelp.com reviews with Alice. If Bob chooses not to share his identity, then Alice will see Bob's yelp.com reviews marked as reviews of a friend. Also, if Alice searches for content authored by Bob, then no results will be returned. If Bob chooses to share his identity, then Alice will see Bob's identity associated with Bob's reviews.","These limitations on sharing are stored as Share Rules . Additionally, rules can enable sharing within a category of content generated by the user, such as \u201cmake public all my book purchases,\u201d or impose specific restrictions on what can not be shared, such as \u201cdo not share my purchase on a book related to cancer in Yahoo! Shopping.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["402","404","406","408","410","412","414","416","418","420"]},"Search options can be entered via pull-down menus (, , , , and ), input fields (, , and ), buttons (), etc. In other embodiments, search options can be provided in different formats, according to the requirements of the developer.  shows a search window that can be used both for searching content or subscribing to feeds. In other embodiments, search windows for on-demand searching have different interfaces than feed subscription windows. A user requesting \u2018monthly\u2019 in frequency  field will cause the Extended Social Network Server to create a feed subscription for the user. On the other hand, a user selecting \u2018Search now\u2019 will cause the Server to perform an instant search according to the given parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["424","422","426","422","2","123","2"]},"Within content , the UGC is displayed following the headers.

Crawler  accesses the different social networks and finds the friends of the registered user. The information is joined together to form an extended social network, as described below with respect to . Crawler  also accesses content sites searching for content. For each piece of content retrieved, the site specific author identity (e.g. yelp id of the author of a yelp review) is extracted and associated with the content. Crawler  also schedules itself to crawl regularly in order to detect new content. Some content sites have Application Program Interfaces (API) that can be used to retrieve content rather than running a brute force web crawl on the site. The content found by crawler  is stored in User Content database .","Search\/Browse Engine  provides a user interface to search or browse the UCC collected by the crawler. In a first mode, Search\/Browse Engine  performs general searches of UGC that do not make use of the user's social network. Search\/Browse Engine  works with the full collection of UGC collected by the crawler. The user may perform keyword queries (e.g. \u201cSan Francisco hotels\u201d, \u201capple iphone\u201d), optionally include parameters such as categories (e.g. hotels), content creation date (e.g. 6 month old or less), site sources (e.g. only Y Travel and Yelp), etc., as previously described with respect to . If the UGC is shared by a friend, the friend's identity is shown next to the content.","In a second mode, Search\/Browse Engine  only searches UGC produced by the user's social network. The user has the option of being more or less restrictive (e.g. friends of friends, or only specific immediate friends). It should be noted that in this mode, the system would only show content that has been shared by the content-producing friend with this user.","Subscription Server  enables users to subscribe to content and receive feeds containing UGC of interest. Interest can be indicated by a keyword query (e.g. \u201cSan Francisco hotels\u201d, \u201capple iphone\u201d), a category (e.g. hotels), a social network range (e.g. all content, all friends, specific friends), and site or sites. After the crawler completes a regularly scheduled crawl, the subscription server  executes all the user interest requests. If a given request produces new content results, the new results are saved in a database, or transmitted to the subscriber.","Subscription Server  can also generate recommendations using collaboration techniques. Traditional collaborative filtering techniques work by finding users among a large set of users deemed to be \u201csimilar\u201d to the requester, and then looking at what the \u201csimilar\u201d users prefer to make recommendations to the requester. For example, Yahoo! Music compares music preferences and ratings from millions of users in order to compute recommendations. These millions of users are anonymous, and hence untrustworthy. A person is often more interested in recommendations from known people rather than recommendations from strangers. Subscription Server  is able to efficiently narrow down the set of users to be used for recommendation computation to those users relatively close to the requester in real life (e.g. friends, or friends of friends). Hence, recommendations may be more relevant, as well as more authoritative. For example, it is more relevant if friends of a requester suggest that the requester might like Jay-Z, than if millions of anonymous Yahoo! Music users suggest that the requester might like Jay-Z.","Subscription server  can also compute trend information by analyzing user activities. For example, a user may be alerted than two of her friends recently wrote reviews about restaurant X in San Francisco, or that Transformers is the highest rated movie by the user's friends.","The Extended Social Network Server  shown in  can also generate behavioral data. The components previously described rely on user generated content that is publicly available on the Internet. If Server  is operated by the same entity as a content website, then Server  can leverage non-publicly available behavioral information logged by the content website servers. If Server  has access to product reviews in a shopping site, then Server  can access user behavior data in shopping site, such as product purchase or page-viewing history. Server  utilizes this information and makes the information available to users in the social network of a given user. For example, the system could show trends (three friends recently looked at the Apple iPhone product page), and the system would allow users to do searches related to purchasing in the shopping site (find friends who have purchased the Apple iPhone). This is also available for non-user generated content sites. For example, if users allow sharing their news story browsing history, then the system can recommend news stories to other users based on user friends' browsing histories.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["112","114","116","112","114","116","456","112","123","114","116"]},"Below each user, those users that have been registered as friends are placed. For example, Bob has friends Al, Carl, and Dan, all of them in the same social network . Additionally, some users have created content that is associated with their id, such as Bob's UGC . In this case, users Bob, Al, Carl and Pam have registered into the extended social network. Pam has two ids, Pam and Pam but wishes to keep her identity Pam private so Pam only registers Pam.","Crawler  shown in  collects the different relationships for the registered users and joins them together under the unique identity, as seen in user metadata  table. For example, Bob has registered identity Bob from Facebook  (noted as F.Bob) giving his password (\u201cwhocares\u201d), and Bob from Yahoo! Groups . Al has registered identities Al from Yahoo! and All from Google Groups.","During the join process, the system uses the information related to multiplicity of identities from users, and their social networks, to create an extended social network. Here, Bob's network includes Carl (that has registered and listed all his identities, so there is no need to list all of Carl's identities), F.Hugh (found in Facebook, but since Hugh has not registered, the identity from Facebook is used), Al (registered), and Y.Dan (unregistered user found in Yahoo). Pam's network consists only of Al, which was found in Google. Pam is not in the system; therefore Pam has privacy with respect to that identity. F.Hugh was found because he is a friend of Bob in Facebook, resulting in F.Hugh being added to the system, and F.Hugh's network in Facebook is also recorded (Carl and Lee). It should be noted, that this example assumes that the system is not symmetrical, that is, a friend of a user does not imply that friend has user as a friend. Or simply put, just because Hugh is a friend of Bob does not mean that Bob is a friend of Hugh. In another embodiment, the relationships are symmetrical, and in our example it would mean that Bob would be added as one of the friends of Hugh because Hugh is a friend of Bob.","In another embodiment, users can identify their friends when registering if the crawler does not have access to existing relationships in the social networks. In another embodiment, the user provides the password used for each of the different identities to enable the crawler to access their information in the social network.","In addition to the User Metadata, the user also collects UGC  via Crawler , as described previously. The content is correlated to the owners according to the identities and relationships available in user metadata .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["702","112","114","116"]},"In operation , a crawler collects the social relationships corresponding to the identities registered in operation  by accessing the social network sites. The collected information is processed in operation  and extended social networks are created, as previously described with respect to user metadata  in .","The crawler collects UGC in operation  by accessing the social network sites. As previously mentioned, the crawler may use an API or a brute force scan to gather the UGC. In operation , the user information and the UGC collected is correlated, attributing authorship to registered users independently of where the content was created, and giving access to other users, independently of where their social relationship was established.","Users define what kind of UGC they wish to access and the UGC is filtered according to their definitions in operation . Access can be made on demand, or feeds of information can be delivered to requesting users periodically. The filtered content is then presented to the requesting user in operation , such as for example in a browser window of the user's computer.","Embodiments of the present invention may be practiced with various computer system configurations including hand-held devices, microprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers and the like. The invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a wire-based or wireless network.","With the above embodiments in mind, it should be understood that the invention can employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems. These operations are those requiring physical manipulation of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared and otherwise manipulated.","Any of the operations described herein that form part of the invention are useful machine operations. The invention also relates to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus can be specially constructed for the required purpose, or the apparatus can be a general-purpose computer selectively activated or configured by a computer program stored in the computer. In particular, various general-purpose machines can be used with computer programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required operations.","The invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium is any non-transitory data storage device that can store data, which can be thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the non-transitory computer readable storage medium include hard drives, network attached storage (NAS), read-only memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, magnetic tapes and other optical and non-optical data storage devices. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium can also be distributed over a network-coupled computer system so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.","Although the method operations were described in a specific order, it should be understood that other housekeeping operations may be performed in between operations, or operations may be adjusted so that they occur at slightly different times, or may be distributed in a system which allows the occurrence of the processing operations at various intervals associated with the processing, as long as the processing of the overlay operations are performed in the desired way.","Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications can be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
