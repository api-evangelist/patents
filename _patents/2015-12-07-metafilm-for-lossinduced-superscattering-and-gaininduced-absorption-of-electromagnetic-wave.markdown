title: Metafilm for loss-induced super-scattering and gain-induced absorption of electromagnetic wave
abstract: A metafilm is provided for operating on a photon at a defined wavelength, for super-scattering, absorption, and for laser absorber switch. The metafilm includes dimers and a conductive substrate for embedding the dimers in an array. Each dimer comprises a pair of a gain element and a loss element. The substrate, and the gain and loss elements have complex permittivity values. The metafilm super-scatters (e.g., lases) the photon in response to increasing the imaginary component of either the substrate or the loss element, and absorbs the photon in response to increasing the imaginary component of the gain element.

In particular, the invention involves substrate dissipation and an array of dimers in which a \u201cdimer\u201d is defined as a structure formed from a complementary pair of similar sub-units. Each dimer is composed of one loss element and one gain element. The loss and gain elements have the same geometry and the same real part of the permittivity, but the opposite imaginary part of the permittivity.","In a pioneering work, Bender and colleagues proved that non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time () symmetry may exhibit entirely real spectrum below a phase transition (symmetry breaking) point. See C. M. Bender et al.: Real Spectra in Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians having PT Symmetry\u201d, 80 5243 (1998) and C. M. Bender et al.: \u201cComplex Extension of Quantum Mechanics\u201d, 89 270401 (2002). Inspired by this emerging concept, in the past decade there has been a growing interest in studying -symmetric Hamiltonian in the framework of optics where the  complex potential in quantum mechanics is translated into a complex electrical permittivity profile satisfying \u2208(r)=\u2208*(\u2212r) in optical systems.","In optics, most of the -symmetric structures are realized by parallel waveguides or media with alternating gain and loss either along or across the propagation direction. The periodic spatial modulation of gain and loss in photonics and plasmonics structures has led to many intriguing phenomena such as nonreciprocal light propagation and invisibility, power oscillations, coherent perfect absorptions, loss-induced transparency, nonreciprocal Bloch oscillations, optical switching, unidirectional tunneling, loss-free negative refraction, and laser absorbers.","The -symmetric systems are a subset of open quantum systems for which the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, and the eigenvalues are complex in general. The unique properties associated with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are exceptional points and spectral singularities, one being a branch point singularity associated with level repulsion and symmetry breaking. The existence of the exceptional point has been observed in microwave experiments. See S. Longhi: \u201cSpectral singularities and Bragg scattering of complex crystals\u201d, 81 022102 (2010), and M. G. Moharam et al.: \u201cRigorous coupled-wave analysis of planar-grating diffraction\u201d, 71 811 (1981). Spectral singularity is related to scattering resonance of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and manifests itself as giant transmission and reflection with vanishing bandwidth. Exceptional points and spectral singularities possess interesting electromagnetic properties and have attracted much attention.","Conventional schemes for electromagnetic amplification yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a high gain metafilm for super-scattering, absorbing, and laser absorber switching. A metafilm is provided for operating on a photon at a wavelength, including an electrically conductive substrate, and a plurality of dimers. The substrate has a planar surface, a sub-wavelength thickness and a first complex permittivity. The dimers are disposed in a planar array on the planar surface. Each dimer has a sub-wavelength period and includes loss and gain elements separated by a sub-wavelength distance. Each element has a sub-wavelength span and a sub-wavelength width along said planar array. The loss element has a second complex permittivity. The gain element has a third complex permittivity.","The first, second and third complex permittivities respectively include first, second and third real components, and respectively include first, second and third imaginary components. The second and third real components are equal. The second imaginary component is higher than the third imaginary component. In response to increasing either the first imaginary component or the second imaginary component, the metafilm super-scatters the photon. In response to increasing the third imaginary component, the metafilm absorbs the photon. In response to increasing the third imaginary component the metafilm switches from photon release to photon absorption by increasing the third imaginary component. In response to increasing the secondary imaginary component, the metafilm switches from photon absorption to photon release.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Exemplary embodiments provide techniques for -symmetric loss-induced lasing (also called super-scattering) and gain-induced absorption, as described in \u201cLoss-induced super-scattering and gain-induced absorption\u201d, accepted for publication in . The term \u201closs\u201d refers to dissipation from adjusting the imaginary portion of the permittivity that is greater than zero. The inventive concepts contrast with conventional processes for loss-induced absorption and gain-induced amplification.","Amplified transmission and reflection of a finite bandwidth are shown to occur at the same wavelength when the electromagnetic wave is incident on a periodic array of -symmetric dimers embedded in a metallic film. Remarkably, this phenomenon vanishes if the metallic substrate is lossless while other parameters remain unchanged. When the metafilm is adjusted to the vicinity of a spectral singularity, tuning substrate dissipation to a critical value can lead to supper scattering in stark contrast to that expected in conventional systems.","The -synthetic plasmonic metafilm acts as a lasing -spaser: a planar source of coherent radiation. The metallic dissipation provides means to couple light out of the dark modes of the -spaser. Above a critical gain\/loss coupling, the metafilm behaves as a meta-gain medium (with the meta-gain atoms) composed from -plasmonic dimers. This phenomenon implies that super radiation is possible from a cavity that has gain elements by tuning the cavity dissipation to a critical value. Another technique for enabling the -synthetic plasmonic metafilm to become a laser is by tuning the loss element of the dimers near the exceptional point (EP). The -synthetic plasmonic metafilm can also become an absorber by tuning the gain element of the dimers near the EP. Similarly, the -synthetic plasmonic metafilm can also become a laser absorber switch by tuning the loss and gain elements near the EP.","Parity-time synthetic materials represent a novel class of metamaterials with novel electromagnetic properties arising from a delicate balance between loss and gain elements. Global -symmetry is a demanding condition. Systems with local -symmetry are easier to implement than global. An array of -symmetric dimers in which each gain\/loss pair possesses local -symmetry with respect to its own center enables emission in the real spectrum in the desired parameter region. Except for compensating loss with gain, active plasmonic materials offer an ideal platform for studying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the electromagnetic domain at the sub-wavelength scale.","Most studies on -symmetric structures employ analytical models based on either one-dimensional scalar Helmholtz equation or two-dimensional scalar paraxial wave equation. For plasmonic metamaterials having sub-wavelength \u201cmeta-atoms\u201d as resonators, the above analytical descriptions are not applicable. Nevertheless, the plasmonic metafilms are complex quantum systems with strong coupling and in general can be described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.","The spaser concept proposed by Bergman et al. in \u201cSurface Plasmon Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\u201d, 90 (2) 027402 has led to Zheludev et al. in \u201cLasing Spacer\u201d, 2, 351-354 suggesting \u201clasing spaser\u201d fueled from the dark modes of the spaser via structural symmetry breaking. Experiments towards this concept have been reported. This disclosure examines electromagnetic properties of -synthetic plasmonic metafilm, which is composed of a planar array of coupled -symmetric dimers. The exemplary structure can exhibit the super-scattering effect by control of plasmonic substrate dissipation in both forward and backward directions. Steering the metafilm to the vicinity of a singular region of the system while tuning the substrate dissipation to a critical value can produce substantially amplified waves radiated from both sides of the metafilm. The exemplary device behaves as a lasing -spaser. The large gain is drawn from the dark modes of the -spaser via metallic dissipation, which breaks the  symmetry and couples light out of the -spaser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","150","120","160","120","150","110"]},"The plasmonic metafilm  satisfies the local  symmetry with respect to the x directions, i.e.,\n\n\u2208()=\u2208*(\u2212)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nfor \u0394x\/2<|x|<b+\u0394x\/2, where \u0394x is separation distance between the elements. This structure  cannot be described by the paraxial wave equation due to the abrupt change of electromagnetic (EM) field at the metal-dielectric interfaces. Maxwell's equations are numerically solved based on rigorous coupled-wave analysis. Numerical approaches can handle more complicated structures and guide engineering designs to search for the appropriate parameter combination. This is important for practical implementation of the extraordinary properties predicted by analytical theory.\n","Theoretical Approach: In view , a -symmetric dimer  represents a unit cell composed of gain  and loss  sub-wavelength elements embedded within the thin metafilm . The dimers  and the metafilm  have the same thickness, i.e., the metallic mesh is filled with gain\/loss elements. The unit cell repeats in the x-y plane with the same period in both directions to form the array.","The dimer elements  and  have complex permittivity values, as does the metafilm . The real coefficient \u2208\u2032 of the relative permittivity of the loss and gain elements is fixed at 3.6 throughout the disclosure. The imaginary coefficient \u2208\u2033 varies, but satisfies:\n\n\u2208\u2033=\u2212\u2208\u2033\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nto ensure the local -symmetry. The permeability is unity (\u03bc=1) for all the materials. The period p=3.5 \u03bcm, the dimer length a=2.5 \u03bcm and width b=1.0 \u03bcm are fixed throughout the disclosure. However, the device functions are not limited by these values, which merely provide an example for demonstration. The general expression of the complex conjugate permittivity for the gain and loss elements is given by:\n\n\u2208=\u2208\u2032+\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nis such that the condition \u2208\u2033>0 represents the loss element, and \u2208\u2033<0 represents the gain element. The incidence wave is p-polarized with the electric field parallel to the x-z plane. Bender relates this as: P:x\u2192x, p\u2192\u2212p. T:x\u2192x, p\u2192\u2212p, i\u2192\u2212i, followed by eqn. (4).\n","For infrared -synthetic materials, the dispersion of metal, aluminum (Al) in this case, cannot be neglected.

The frequency dependent permittivity of Al was taken from the real part of Drude model given by eqn. (4). In the lossless case, T+R=1 (energy conservation), which is clearly demonstrated in . An increase of the transmission is accompanied by a decrease of the reflection and vice versa. The peaks and valleys of the transmittance and the reflectance repeat periodically with the variation of the thickness of the film. The metafilm  behaves effectively like a low-Q Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity below 9 \u03bcm. The upper and lower surfaces of the metafilm  serve as the reflection mirrors of the Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity, while the thickness of the metafilm serves as the length of the cavity. Above 12 \u03bcm, the metafilm  behaves towards a perfect electric conductor (PEC).","The EM scattering is investigated from a plasmonic thin-film having balanced gain\/loss elements. The -synthetic plasmonic metafilm  no longer behaves as a Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity. To demonstrate the effect of the substrate dissipation, the transmittance and reflectance of the metafilm  is investigated with and without plasmonic dissipation in the presence of the balanced gain\/loss dimers . The upper left panel in  shows the transmittance and reflectance of the EM wave normally incident on the -synthetic lossless plasmonic metafilm  of which the dispersion is given by the real part of Drude model in eqn. (4). The relative permittivity of the loss\/gain dimers  is given by \u2208=3.6(1\u00b1i0.06).","Clearly, the sum of the transmittance and reflectance is close to unity, i.e., T+R=1. Overall the metafilm  performs as a conventional lossless medium where the maximum transmission is accompanied by the minimum reflection, and vice versa. This behavior can be understood as the sub-wavelength dimers  have balanced gain\/loss profile and are embedded in the metafilm  as a lossless substrate .","The situation changes dramatically when the plasmonic substrate dissipation is taken into account as shown in the upper right panel of  where the giant transmittance and reflectance occur at the same wavelength, unlike conventional media where one increases at the expense of the other. This peculiar property can be analyzed through the scattering parameters Sand Sthat have a common denominator Mas shown by eqns. (12) and (13).","When the denominator of Sand Svanishes, both transmittance and reflectance approach infinity as long as Mis finite. The lower panels  and  in  show the magnitude of Mand Mwith and without the substrate dissipation described by the Drude model in eqn. (4). Without the substrate dissipation in the lower left panel , both magnitude of Mand Mare large at the wavelength about 8.88 \u03bcm, which explains the null in the transmittance and the peak in the reflectance in the upper left panel . Upon activation of substrate dissipation in the lower right panel , the magnitude |M| vanishes at the wavelength about 8.92 \u03bcm, whereas the magnitude |M| is finite. Thus, both transmission and reflection approach infinity.","Here, the spectral singularities are manifested as the dissipation-induced super-scattering. This dissipation-induced super-scattering is also observed when varying the thickness of the metafilm  at the fixed wavelength \u03bb=6 \u03bcm as illustrated in the upper panels  and  of  with the corresponding analysis of the transfer matrix elements given in the lower panels  and  of .","Without the substrate dissipation, the metafilm  behaves as a conventional medium, where the peak of the transmittance is accompanied by the valley of the reflectance and vice versa in the upper left panel .

The dissipation provides a coupling mechanism for the spaser to radiate into the far field. Without the dissipation, the -spaser cannot lase and behaves as a lossless thin film. The spaser generates strong coherent local field, but the photons are trapped inside the dark modes which cannot radiate without a proper coupling mechanism. Here the loss is introduced into the cavity as metallic dissipation, which naturally enters the plasmonic dark modes and turns them into radiative modes, and thus releases the trapped photons.","The top and bottom surfaces of the metafilm  provide the required feedback for lasing. This feedback mechanism is observable from  that shows the Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity effect. The metafilm  as a whole functions as a high-quality active resonator. The -spaser is coupled to the far field through transforming dark modes into radiative modes by metallic dissipation of the metafilm .","Numerical studies indicate that super-scattering occurs in the vicinity of an exceptional point (EP). In the absence of substrate dissipation, the metafilm  satisfies -symmetry with balanced gain and loss arranged in the anti-symmetric distribution of the imaginary portion of the permittivity. The two eigenstates are forward and backward waves. Their constructive and destructive interferences modify transmission and reflection, as well as lasing and absorption. An EP is characterized by coalescence of both eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors, thereby reducing the system to one dimension.  exemplifies wavelength variation of the eigenvalues and associated eigen-functions in the neighborhood of the EP, indicated by the bifurcation point at wavelength \u03bb=8.968 \u03bcm, where both eigen-parameters coalesce.","The presence of such an EP can have a dramatic effect on the EM property of the system. Around the EP, lasing can be induced either by adding substrate dissipation, or else by increasing the loss of the dimers  without adding the substrate dissipation. The former effect of adding substrate dissipation effect is shown in . The latter effect of increasing the dimer loss is shown in  for the transmission coefficient at different dimer losses with a fixed gain. The transmission increases with increasing loss until reaching a maximum where lasing occurs at a loss of \u03b4=0.43.","The corresponding poles of a scattering matrix in a complex wavelength plane is shown in  for different losses of the dimers . Increasing the loss moves the pole up towards the real axis. Lasing occurs when the pole reaches the real axis, i.e., (\u03bb)=0. In a similar vein, gain-induced infrared absorption around the EP is shown in  by varying gain of the dimers  with a fixed loss. The numerical study indicates that maximum absorption can be achieved for a gain at \u03b4=0.5. Negative absorption can result from the net gain.","Without substrate dissipation, the sum of transmittance and reflectance remains unity, and the net amplification is zero in the output signals. The periodic dimers  provide an array of twin resonators on the metafilm  that serves as the substrate. An incident wave with the electric field E parallel to the short edge of the rectangular elements that can excite a localized cavity mode inside the element. The -synthetic design sustains a localized gain-type plasmon and loss-type plasmon within a unit cell. The substrate dissipation can modify the waveguide mode of the substrate and transform the dark mode of the substrate into the radiative mode as shown in . Hence the dissipation provides a mechanism to couple light out of the system, and the -synthetic medium behaves as a planar source of coherent radiation. These elements as dimers  can constitute holes in the metafilm .","An array of sub-wavelength holes in the metallic substrate, i.e., metafilm , supports surface plasmon resonances.  shows the real and imaginary portions of the normalized mode propagation constant in the absence of dissipation. This shows a complex propagation constant as dash lines  with the effective mode index greater than unity, and thus cannot be accessed from the free space. Therefore, the photons are trapped in the dark mode. When adding substrate dissipation, the mode propagation constant becomes real and less than unity shown by the solid lines . This mode can be excited by a free space plane wave. Consequently, when this mode is lased, the structure  will radiate into the far field. The dark mode of the metafilm  in the absence of the dissipation becomes the radiative mode, which can couple to the external field, in the presence of the dissipation. The points  coincide with the radiative branch lines  indicating that super-scattering results from exciting and lasing to the radiative plasmonic mode. This radiative branch can be accessed by a free space plane wave, such as for transmission as a function of wavelength for different incident angles, as shown for similar conditions in .","Substrate dissipation provides a technique to couple radiation of the -synthetic metafilm  into the far field. With super-scattering, the transmitted and reflected electric field experiences a phase shift, which is typical behavior at the resonance. In the absence of dissipation, the photons remain trapped in the dark modes that cannot radiate without a proper coupling mechanism. The substrate dissipation breaks the -symmetry and transforms the dark mode into the radiative mode so as to couple the light out of the metafilm  to release the trapped photons.","The EP related phenomena, such as resonant frequency, are sensitive to the parameters of these systems. Therefore, the EP offers a preferred mechanism for low-threshold or fast switch. This can be applied to an ultra-sensitive sensor to detect small variation of the parameter. The upper panels  and  in  show transmission and reflection of the normally incident wave at different thicknesses of the metafilm . The lasing frequency can be tuned by a small variation of the thickness while maintaining other parameters unchanged.","The interplay between loss and gain can enable loss-induced lasing and gain-induced absorption in the -synthetic plasmonic metafilm  near the EP. The super-scattering has a finite bandwidth that increases the possibility of detecting resonance related to a spectral singularity. The scattering property of an optical system can be controlled by background dissipation. Adding substrate dissipation is equivalent to introducing loss into a cavity. Exemplary embodiments provide a strategy to control the phase of -symmetry using background loss and to control the radiation of the dimer  using cavity dissipation. The effect of introducing gain into materials provides more than loss compensation. The interplay between loss and gain can transform the -synthetic metafilm  into a laser or absorber. This exemplary device can also be designed as a laser absorber switch.","This disclosure demonstrates a new type of plasmonic laser and absorber based on the -symmetry, lasing -spaser and gain-induced absorber. The super-scattering has a finite bandwidth that increases the detection possibility for spectral singularity related resonances. The exemplary result implies that the scattering properties of optical systems may be controlled by the background dissipation, and thereby provides a new strategy to control the phase of the -symmetry using the background loss, and to control the super radiation from a cavity by tuning the cavity dissipation.","The effect of introducing gain into materials is more than loss compensation. The interplay between the loss and gain surface plasmons in the dimers  leads to the meta-gain atoms (-surface plasmon-dimers), which transform the -synthetic metafilm  into a meta-gain medium. The exemplary embodiments exhibiting effective responses demonstrate capabilities of practical -synthetic materials. The \u03c0-phase jump of the electric field at the super-scattering can be used to design a two-state system, a new modulation scheme, and potentially manipulating light in free space using the concept of -symmetry. The narrowband resonant thin-films enable applications in designs for notch filter, sensor, and optical switch.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
