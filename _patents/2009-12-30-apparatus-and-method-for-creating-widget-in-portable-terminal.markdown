More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for directly creating a widget format that a user wants.","That is, the present invention provides an apparatus and a method for allowing a common user to create a widget without difficulties, which typically only can be created by a widget specialized software company or a professional developer.","Recently, as portable terminals have been drastically developed, they are being used by men and women of all ages as necessities and also are used as media for wireless voice communication and information exchange.","At the beginning, portable terminals were recognized as tools for just wireless voice communication, but as their technologies are developed, service providers and portable terminal manufacturers have competitively developed products (or services) in order to distinguish them from others.","For example, the portable terminals are being developed as multimedia devices capable of providing different functions such as a phone book, short message service (SMS), E-mail, morning call, an MP3 player, scheduling, a digital camera, and wireless internet service, so that a variety of services can be provided.","In addition, as web 2.0 technology has been extensively used in the portable terminals, a certain widget of a personal computer for providing an additional function is being applied to the portable terminals.","The widget is a service provided from a mobile communication provider and is used to organize a screen of a portable terminal. For example, a dog may run around or a weather forecast may be checked in advance through a downloaded weather widget on the screen of the portable terminal.","In relation to the widget, a user needs to complete a simple widget resource disposition through a basic resource editor, and also needs to directly code eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and java script. However, this method makes utilizing a widget difficult for a user who has no coding experience. That is, the widget is typically created by widget specialized software companies such as portals.","Additionally, the widget only has a limited available service such as displaying of information set by a user and providing an application shortcut function and information of the portable terminal. Accordingly, when a user of the portable terminal wants to display information using a user preference applied setting value, the information is displayed through setting information (e.g., fonts fixed by a widget), which is set during creating of the widget and not by user preference of the portable terminal.","Accordingly, in order to resolve the above limitation, an apparatus and a method allowing a user to create a widget to which user preference is applied without difficulties are required.","To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, it is a primary aspect of the present invention to solve at least the above problems and\/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for creating a widget in a portable terminal.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for applying user preference when a widget is created in a portable terminal.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for creating a widget in a portable terminal through a drag and drop method by a user.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for creating a widget of a portable terminal includes a widget creating unit generating a tag of data corresponding to a building block that a user selects on a widget creating screen that includes building blocks necessary for widget creation.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for creating a widget of a portable terminal includes determining a building block that a user selects on a widget creating screen including building blocks necessary for widget creation, generating a tag of data corresponding to the determined building block; and generating a widget code including the building block and the tag.","Before undertaking the DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION below, it may be advantageous to set forth definitions of certain words and phrases used throughout this patent document: the terms \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201ccomprise,\u201d as well as derivatives thereof, mean inclusion without limitation; the term \u201cor,\u201d is inclusive, meaning and\/or; the phrases \u201cassociated with\u201d and \u201cassociated therewith,\u201d as well as derivatives thereof, may mean to include, be included within, interconnect with, contain, be contained within, connect to or with, couple to or with, be communicable with, cooperate with, interleave, juxtapose, be proximate to, be bound to or with, have, have a property of, or the like.

The widget creating unit  allows a user to directly create a desired widget.","In more detail, when a user of the portable terminal creates a widget, the controlling unit  instructs the widget creating unit  to display a widget creating screen for outputting data necessary for widget creation, such that a user can create a widget.","Next, the controlling unit  determines a building block that a user selects among building blocks that constitute a widget that a user of the portable terminal creates and also determines property information such as font types and font sizes constituting a widget.","Accordingly, the controlling unit  creates a widget by generating widget codes that include tags for property information to which user personality is applied in a corresponding building block. The widget code means a code that can request data related to a corresponding building block.","The widget creating unit  receives an instruction from the controlling unit  and outputs a widget creating screen in order to allow a user to directly create a widget. At this point, a user of the portable terminal creates a widget by selecting items necessary for creating the widget from the widget creating screen through a drag and drop method.","The memory unit  includes ROM, RAM, and flash ROM. The ROM stores micro codes of a program and various reference data for processing and controlling the controlling unit .","The RAM is a working memory of the controlling unit  for storing temporary data generated during various program executions. Additionally, the flash ROM stores various updatable data for archive such as a phone book, sent messages and received messages.","The input unit  includes a plurality of function keys such as 0 to 9 number key buttons, a menu button, a cancel button (or, a delete button), a OK button, a call button, an end button, an internet connection button, navigation key (or, a direction key) buttons, and letter input key buttons, and also provides key inputted data (e.g., a widget creating request) corresponding to a user pressed key to the controlling unit . Additionally, the input unit  includes a touch input unit for sensing a touch input and senses a touch input of a user and then, provides the sensed touch input to the controlling unit .","The display unit  displays state information generated during an operation of the portable terminal, the limited number of letters, and a plurality of moving or still pictures. The display unit  uses a color Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) device.","The widget engine , as mentioned above, includes an API mapping unit  and an API calling unit , and drives widgets created by the widget creating unit .","When the widget engine  senses a request for executing a widget created by a user, it processes the request by mapping an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) API corresponding to the request to call a corresponding OEM API.","The API mapping unit  of the widget engine  maps an instruction for a widget executing method (e.g., a phone book searching method) into the OEM API (i.e., API corresponding to a mapping widget execution) and then delivers it to the API calling unit . Accordingly, the API calling unit  calls the OEM API that controls phone book information, that is, an internal function of the portable terminal. Next, the API calling unit  generates a calling result of the OEM API and then delivers it to the API mapping unit , and the API mapping unit  provides data that a user requests using the calling result delivered from the API calling unit .","That is, the API mapping unit  manages data necessary for widget creation as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) tags, and links them with a corresponding API.","Although the role of the widget creating unit  may be performed herein by the controlling unit  of the portable terminal, its configuration and operations are just one example for convenience of description and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It is apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, all of these may be configured to be processed in the controlling unit .","The above is described with respect to an apparatus for creating a widget of a portable terminal to which user preference is directly applied according to the present invention, and a method for creating a widget to which user preference is directly applied to using the above apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring to , the portable terminal determines whether a widget creating event occurs or not in step . Here, the widget creating event is an event for directly creating a widget by a user of the portable terminal.","If the widget creating event does not occur in step , the portable terminal proceeds to step  to perform a corresponding function (e.g., a standby mode).","On the contrary, if the widget creating event occurs in step , the portable terminal proceeds to step  to display a widget creating screen, and then proceeds to step  to select a building block for widget creation.","Here, the widget creating screen is a screen where data necessary for widget creation are outputted to create a widget directly and simply by a user of the portable terminal, i.e., an authorized tool execution screen for widget creation. Additionally, the building block means blocks constituting a widget created by a user of the portable terminal, and includes a weather information block, a schedule managing block, and an address block.","Next, the portable terminal proceeds to step  to convert data related to a corresponding building block into one appropriate for widget creation and proceeds to step , and then generates a widget code related to a corresponding building block. That is, step  is a step for generating a code to request data related to a corresponding building block.","Next, the portable terminal proceeds to step  and then determines whether widget creation is completed or not.","If the widget creation is not completed in step , the portable terminal proceeds to step  and then repeats the above operations until the widget creation is completed. That is, the portable terminal repeats the above operations until all building blocks that a user wants to add to a widget are created.","In addition, if the widget creation is completed in step , the portable terminal terminates this algorithm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Referring to , the portable terminal determines whether a widget creating event occurs or not in step .
