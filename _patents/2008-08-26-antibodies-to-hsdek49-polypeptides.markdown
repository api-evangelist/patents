to a \u201cSequence Listing\u201d listed below, which is provided as a text file. The text file contains a document entitled \u201cPS902P1D1-SeqList.txt\u201d (3,646,557 bytes, created Jun. 27, 2008), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to human secreted proteins\/polypeptides, and isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding said proteins\/polypeptides, useful for detecting, preventing, diagnosing, prognosticating, treating, and\/or ameliorating immune disorders and diseases. Antibodies that bind these polypeptides are also encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the invention are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polynucleotides, polypeptides, and\/or antibodies. The invention further encompasses screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The present invention further encompasses methods and compositions for inhibiting or enhancing the production and function of the polypeptides of the present invention.","The immune system is an intricate network of cells, tissues and soluble molecules that function to protect the body from invasion by foreign substances and pathogens. The major cells of the immune system are lymphocytes, including B cells and T cells, and myeloid cells, including basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. In addition to these cellular components of the immune system, soluble molecules\u2014such as antibodies, complement proteins, and cytokines\u2014circulate in lymph and blood plasma, and play important roles in immunity.","The immune system can be subdivided into the acquired and innate immune systems. The cells of the innate immune system (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells) are not antigen specific and their action is not enhanced by repeated exposure to the same antigen. The cells of the acquired immune system (B and T cells) are antigen specific. Repeated exposure of B and T cells to an antigen results in improved immune responses (memory responses) produced by these cell types. The cells and products of the acquired immune system can recruit components of the innate system to mount a focused immune response. For a more extensive review of the immune system, see 4th edition, Ed. William Paul, Lippincott-Raven Pub. (1998).","An immune response is seldom carried out by a single cell type, but rather requires the coordinated efforts of several cell types. In order to coordinate an immune response, it is necessary that cells of the immune system communicate with each other and with other cells of the body. Communication between cells may be made by cell-cell contact, between membrane bound molecules on each cell, or by the interaction of soluble components of the immune system with cellular receptors. Signaling between cell types may have one or more of a variety of consequences, including activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Activation and differentiation of immune cells may result in the expression or secretion of polypeptides, or other molecules, which in turn affect the function of other cells and\/or molecules of the immune system.","Molecules which stimulate or suppress immune system function are known as immunomodulators. These molecules, which include endogenous proteins (e.g., cytokines, cytokine receptors, and intracellular signal transduction molecules), molecules derived from microorganisms, and synthetic agents, may exert their modulatory effects at one or more stages of the immune response, such as antigen recognition, stimulation of cytokine production and release, and\/or activation\/differentiation of lymphocytes and myeloid cells Immunomodulators may enhance (immunoprophylaxis, immunostimulation), restore (immunosubstitution, immunorestoration) or suppress (immunosuppression, immunodeviation) immunological functions or activities.","Immunomodulatory compounds have many important applications in clinical practice. For example, immunosuppressing agents (which attenuate or prevent unwanted immune responses) can be used to prevent tissue rejection during organ transplantation, to prevent Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn, or to treat autoimmune disorders. A mechanism of action common to many immunosuppressants is the inhibition of T cell activation and\/or differentiation. Antilymphocyte antibodies have also been used to attenuate immune system functions. Currently-used immunosuppressive agents can produce a number of side effects which limit their use. Among the most serious secondary effects include kidney and liver toxicity, increased risk of infection, hyperglycemia, neoplasia, and osteoporosis (see, e.g., Freeman, Clin. Biochem. 24(1):9-14 (1991); Mitchison, Dig. Dis. 11(2):78-101 (1993)).","Immunostimulants, which enhance the activity of immune cells and molecules, comprise another class of immunomodulatory agents with important clinical applications. Such applications include, for example, the treatment of immunodeficiency disorders (e.g. AIDS and severe combined immunodeficiency), chronic infectious diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis, papillomavirus, and herpesvirus), and cancer. An important class of endogenous immunostimulants is the cytokines. These soluble signaling molecules are produced by a number of cell types, and are critical to the regulation of the immune response Immunostimulatory mechanisms can include proliferation, differentiation and\/or activation of immune cells or progenitors of immune cells. For example, interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds to IL-2 receptors on T lymphocytes and induces proliferation and differentiation. Another cytokine, interferon alpha, stimulates the immune system through a variety of mechanisms, including activation of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Interferon alpha also induces the expression of antiviral proteins (see Chapter 509Edition, Eds. Hardman, Limbird, Molinoff, Ruddon, and Gilman, McGraw Hill (1996)). Limitations of current immunostimulant therapies include anaphylaxis, pulmonary edema, and renal toxicity, to name a few.","The discovery of new human immune related polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by them, and antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions which are useful in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and\/or prognosis of disorders of the immune system, including, but not limited to, autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and multiple sclerosis), immunodeficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia), chronic infections (e.g., HIV, viral hepatitis, and herpesvirus), and neoplastic disorders. See, e.g. \u201cImmune Activity\u201d section infra. Additionally, immune related molecules would be useful as agents to boost immune responsiveness to pathogens or to suppress immune reactions, for example as is necessary in conjunction with organ transplantation.","The present invention relates to novel secreted proteins. More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel secreted polypeptides. Novel polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human polynucleotides, polypeptides, and\/or antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for detecting, preventing, diagnosing, prognosticating, treating, and\/or ameliorating immune diseases and disorders. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The present invention further relates to methods and\/or compositions for inhibiting or enhancing the production and function of the polypeptides of the present invention.","Description of Table 1A","Table 1A summarizes information concerning certain polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The first column provides the gene number in the application for each clone identifier. The second column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201cClone ID:\u201d, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A. Third column, the cDNA Clones identified in the second column were deposited as indicated in the third column (i.e. by ATCC\u2122 Deposit No:Z and deposit date). Some of the deposits contain multiple different clones corresponding to the same gene. In the fourth column, \u201cVector\u201d refers to the type of vector contained in the corresponding cDNA Clone identified in the second column. In the fifth column, the nucleotide sequence identified as \u201cNT SEQ ID NO:X\u201d was assembled from partially homologous (\u201coverlapping\u201d) sequences obtained from the corresponding cDNA clone identified in the second column and, in some cases, from additional related cDNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually three to five overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X. In the sixth column, \u201cTotal NT Seq.\u201d refers to the total number of nucleotides in the contig sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X.\u201d The deposited clone may contain all or most of these sequences, reflected by the nucleotide position indicated as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (seventh column) and the \u201c3\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (eighth column) of SEQ ID NO:X. In the ninth column, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Start Codon.\u201d Similarly, in column ten, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the predicted signal sequence is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of First AA of Signal Pep.\u201d In the eleventh column, the translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as \u201cAA SEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d although other reading frames can also be routinely translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.","In the twelfth and thirteenth columns of Table 1A, the first and last amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the predicted signal peptide is identified as \u201cFirst AA of Sig Pep\u201d and \u201cLast AA of Sig Pep.\u201d In the fourteenth column, the predicted first amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the secreted portion is identified as \u201cPredicted First AA of Secreted Portion\u201d. The amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the last amino acid encoded by the open reading frame is identified in the fifteenth column as \u201cLast AA of ORF\u201d.","SEQ ID NO:X (where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y (where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used, for example, to generate antibodies which bind specifically to proteins containing the polypeptides and the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table 1A and\/or elsewhere herein","Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X, and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a human cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC\u2122, as set forth in Table 1A. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited plasmid can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited plasmid in accordance with known methods","The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular plasmid can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.","Also provided in Table 1A is the name of the vector which contains the cDNA plasmid.

The first column of Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provide the gene numbers in the application for each clone identifier. The second column of Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provide unique clone identifiers, \u201cClone ID:\u201d, for cDNA clones related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A and\/or Table 1B. The third column of Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provide unique contig identifiers, \u201cContig ID:\u201d for each of the contig sequences disclosed in these tables. The fourth column of Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provide the sequence identifiers, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d, for each of the contig sequences disclosed in Table 1A and\/or 1B.","Table 1B.1","The fifth column of Table 1B.1, \u201cORF (From-To)\u201d, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:X that delineates the preferred open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the amino acid sequence shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1B.1 as SEQ ID NO:Y (column 6). Column 7 of Table 1B.1 lists residues comprising predicted epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by each of the preferred ORFs (SEQ ID NO:Y). Identification of potential immunogenic regions was performed according to the method of Jameson and Wolf (CABIOS, 4; 181-186 (1988)); specifically, the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) implementation of this algorithm, embodied in the program PEPTIDESTRUCTURE (Wisconsin Package v10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wisc.). This method returns a measure of the probability that a given residue is found on the surface of the protein. Regions where the antigenic index score is greater than 0.9 over at least 6 amino acids are indicated in Table 1B.1 as \u201cPredicted Epitopes\u201d. In particular embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes described in Table 1B.1. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly. Column 8 of Table 1B.1 (\u201cCytologic Band\u201d) provides the chromosomal location of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Given a presumptive chromosomal location, disease locus association was determined by comparison with the Morbid Map, derived from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM\u2122. McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.) 2000. If the putative chromosomal location of the Query overlaps with the chromosomal location of a Morbid Map entry, an OMIM identification number is disclosed in Table 1B.1, column 9 labeled \u201cOMIM Disease Reference(s)\u201d. A key to the OMIM reference identification numbers is provided in Table 5.","Table 1B.2","Column 5 of Table 1B.2, \u201cTissue Distribution\u201d shows the expression profile of tissue, cells, and\/or cell line libraries which express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first code number shown in Table 1B.2 column 5 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue\/cell source identifier code corresponding to the key provided in Table 4. Expression of these polynucleotides was not observed in the other tissues and\/or cell libraries tested. The second number in column 5 (following the colon), represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:X) was identified in the corresponding tissue\/cell source. Those tissue\/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are \u201cAR\u201d designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of P dCTP, using oligo(dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after \u201c[array code]:\u201d represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and\/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and\/or specific tissue and\/or cell expression.","Description of Table 1C","Table 1C summarizes additional polynucleotides encompassed by the invention (including cDNA clones related to the sequences (Clone ID:), contig sequences (contig identifier (Contig ID:) contig nucleotide sequence identifiers (SEQ ID NO:X)), and genomic sequences (SEQ ID NO:B).

Tables 1D.1 and 1D.2 describes the use of FMAT technology, inter alia, for testing or demonstrating various biological activities. Fluorometric microvolume assay technology (FMAT) is a fluorescence-based system that provides a means to perform nonradioactive cell- and bead-based assays to detect activation of cell signal transduction pathways. This technology was designed specifically for ligand binding and immunological assays. Using this technology, fluorescent cells or beads at the bottom of the well are detected as localized areas of concentrated fluorescence using a data processing system. Unbound fluorophore comprising the background signal is ignored, allowing for a wide variety of homogeneous assays. FMAT technology may be used for peptide ligand binding assays, immunofluorescence, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and bead-based immunocapture assays. See, Miraglia S et. al., \u201cHomogeneous cell and bead based assays for high throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology,\u201d Journal of Biomolecular Screening; 4:193-204 (1999). In particular, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) to activate signal transduction pathways. For example, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides to upregulate production of immunomodulatory proteins (such as, for example, interleukins, GM-CSF, Rantes, and Tumor Necrosis factors, as well as other cellular regulators (e.g. insulin)).","Tables 1D.1 and 1D.2 also describe the use of kinase assays for testing, demonstrating, or quantifying biological activity. In this regard, the phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues (e.g. Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine) on cell-signal transduction proteins provides a fast, reversible means for activation and de-activation of cellular signal transduction pathways. Moreover, cell signal transduction via phosphorylation\/de-phosphorylation is crucial to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes (e.g. proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, etc.). Accordingly, kinase assays provide a powerful tool useful for testing, confirming, and\/or identifying polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) that mediate cell signal transduction events via protein phosphorylation. See e.g., Forrer, P., Tamaskovic R., and Jaussi, R. \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Measurement of INK, ERK, and p38 Kinase Activities\u201d Biol. Chem. 379(8-9): 1101-1110 (1998).","Description of Table 1E","Polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. One such biological activity which may be tested includes the ability of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention to stimulate up-regulation or down-regulation of expression of particular genes and proteins. Hence, if polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention exhibit activity in altering particular gene and protein expression patterns, it is likely that these polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may be involved in, or capable of effecting changes in, diseases associated with the altered gene and protein expression profiles. Hence, polynucleotides, polypeptides, or antibodies of the present invention could be used to treat said associated diseases.","TaqMan\u00ae assays may be performed to assess the ability of polynucleotides (and polypeptides they encode) to alter the expression pattern of particular \u201ctarget\u201d genes. TaqMan\u00ae reactions are performed to evaluate the ability of a test agent to induce or repress expression of specific genes in different cell types. TaqMan\u00ae gene expression quantification assays (\u201cTaqMan\u00ae assays\u201d) are well known to, and routinely performed by, those of ordinary skill in the art. TaqMan\u00ae assays are performed in a two step reverse transcription\/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the first (RT) step, cDNA is reverse transcribed from total RNA samples using random hexamer primers. In the second (PCR) step, PCR products are synthesized from the cDNA using gene specific primers.","To quantify gene expression the Taqman\u00ae PCR reaction exploits the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae DNA Polymerase to cleave a Taqman\u00ae probe (distinct from the primers) during PCR. The Taqman\u00ae probe contains a reporter dye at the 5\u2032-end of the probe and a quencher dye at the 3\u2032 end of the probe. When the probe is intact, the proximity of the reporter dye to the quencher dye results in suppression of the reporter fluorescence. During PCR, if the target of interest is present, the probe specifically anneals between the forward and reverse primer sites. AmpliTaq Fold DNA Polymerase then cleaves the probe between the reporter and quencher when the probe hybridizes to the target, resulting in increased fluorescence of the reporter (see Figure 2). Accumulation of PCR products is detected directly by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of the reporter dye.","After the probe fragments are displaced from the target, polymerization of the strand continues. The 3\u2032-end of the probe is blocked to prevent extension of the probe during PCR. This process occurs in every cycle and does not interfere with the exponential accumulation of product. The increase in fluorescence signal is detected only if the target sequence is complementary to the probe and is amplified during PCR. Because of these requirements, any nonspecific amplification is not detected.","For test sample preparation, vector controls or constructs containing the coding sequence for the gene of interest are transfected into cells, such as for example 293T cells, and supernatants collected after 48 hours. For cell treatment and RNA isolation, multiple primary human cells or human cell lines are used; such cells may include but are not limited to, Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts, Aortic Smooth Muscle, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, HepG2, Daudi, Jurkat, U937, Caco, and THP-1 cell lines. Cells are plated in growth media and growth is arrested by culturing without media change for 3 days, or by switching cells to low serum media and incubating overnight. Cells are treated for 1, 6, or 24 hours with either vector control supernatant or sample supernatant (or purified\/partially purified protein preparations in buffer). Total RNA is isolated; for example, by using Trizol extraction or by using the Ambion RNAqueous\u2122-4PCR RNA isolation system. Expression levels of multiple genes are analyzed using TAQMAN, and expression in the test sample is compared to control vector samples to identify genes induced or repressed. Each of the above described techniques are well known to, and routinely performed by, those of ordinary skill in the art.","Table 1E indicates particular disease classes and preferred indications for which polynucleotides, polypeptides, or antibodies of the present invention may be used in detecting, diagnosing, preventing, treating and\/or ameliorating said diseases and disorders based on \u201ctarget\u201d gene expression patterns which may be up- or down-regulated by polynucleotides (and the encoded polypeptides) corresponding to each indicated cDNA Clone ID (shown in Table 1E, Column 2).","Thus, in preferred embodiments, the present invention encompasses a method of detecting, diagnosing, preventing, treating, and\/or ameliorating a disease or disorder listed in the \u201cDisease Class\u201d and\/or \u201cPreferred Indication\u201d columns of Table 1E; comprising administering to a patient in which such detection, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment is desired a protein, nucleic acid, or antibody of the invention (or fragment or variant thereof) in an amount effective to detect, diagnose, prevent, treat, or ameliorate the disease or disorder.

The fourth column shows the ATCC\u2122 deposit designation for each library clone as indicated by the deposit information in Table 6.","The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used throughout this specification.","In the present invention, \u201cisolated\u201d refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered \u201cby the hand of man\u201d from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be \u201cisolated\u201d because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term \u201cisolated\u201d does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide\/sequences of the present invention.","In the present invention, a \u201csecreted\u201d protein refers to those proteins capable of being directed to the ER, secretory vesicles, or the extracellular space as a result of a signal sequence, as well as those proteins released into the extracellular space without necessarily containing a signal sequence. If the secreted protein is released into the extracellular space, the secreted protein can undergo extracellular processing to produce a \u201cmature\u201d protein. Release into the extracellular space can occur by many mechanisms, including exocytosis and proteolytic cleavage.","As used herein, a \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID NO:Y or a fragment or variant thereof (e.g., the polypeptide delineated in columns fourteen and fifteen of Table 1A); a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X (as described in column 5 of Table 1A and\/or Table 1B) or the complement thereof; a cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID: (as described in column 2 of Table 1A and\/or Table 1B and contained within a library deposited with the ATCC\u2122); a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 (EXON From-To) of Table 1C or a fragment or variant thereof; or a nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 of Table 1C or the complement thereof. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences, the coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a molecule having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention as broadly defined (obviously excluding poly-Phenylalanine or poly-Lysine peptide sequences which result from translation of a polyA tail of a sequence corresponding to a cDNA).","In the present invention, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO:X is deposited at Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (HGS) in a catalogued and archived library. As shown, for example, in column 2 of Table 1B, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (identifier generally referred to herein as Clone ID:). Each Clone ID is unique to an individual clone and the Clone ID is all the information needed to retrieve a given clone from the HGS library. Table 7 provides a list of the deposited cDNA libraries. One can use the Clone ID: to determine the library source by reference to Tables 6 and 7. Table 7 lists the deposited cDNA libraries by name and links each library to an ATCC\u2122 Deposit. Library names contain four characters, for example, \u201cHTWE.\u201d The name of a cDNA clone (Clone ID) isolated from that library begins with the same four characters, for example \u201cHTWEP07\u201d. As mentioned below, Table 1A and\/or Table 1B correlates the Clone ID names with SEQ ID NO:X. Thus, starting with an SEQ ID NO:X, one can use Tables 1A, 1B, 6, 7, and 9 to determine the corresponding Clone ID, which library it came from and which ATCC\u2122 deposit the library is contained in. Furthermore, it is possible to retrieve a given cDNA clone from the source library by techniques known in the art and described elsewhere herein. The ATCC\u2122 is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC\u2122 deposits were made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent procedure.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length.

Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6\u00d7SSPE (20\u00d7SSPE=3M NaCl; 0.2M NaHPO; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 \u03bcg\/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1\u00d7SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5\u00d7SSC).","Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and\/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.","Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA+ sequences (such as any 3\u2032 terminal polyA+ tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).","The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length.

In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).","\u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d refers to a polynucleotide sequence described in column 5 of Table 1A, while \u201cSEQ ID NO:Y\u201d refers to a polypeptide sequence described in column 10 of Table 1A. SEQ ID NO:X is identified by an integer specified in column 6 of Table 1A. The polypeptide sequence SEQ ID NO:Y is a translated open reading frame (ORF) encoded by polynucleotide SEQ ID NO:X. The polynucleotide sequences are shown in the sequence listing immediately followed by all of the polypeptide sequences. Thus, a polypeptide sequence corresponding to polynucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:2 is the first polypeptide sequence shown in the sequence listing. The second polypeptide sequence corresponds to the polynucleotide sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:3, and so on.","The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching.

SEQ ID NO:X is identified by an integer specified in column 4 of Table 1B. The polypeptide sequence SEQ ID NO:Y is a translated open reading frame (ORF) encoded by polynucleotide SEQ ID NO:X. \u201cClone ID:\u201d refers to a cDNA clone described in column 2 of Table 1A and\/or 1B.","\u201cA polypeptide having functional activity\u201d refers to a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with a full-length (complete) protein. Such functional activities include, but are not limited to, biological activity (e.g. activity useful in treating, preventing and\/or ameliorating immune diseases and disorders), antigenicity (ability to bind [or compete with a polypeptide for binding] to an anti-polypeptide antibody), immunogenicity (ability to generate antibody which binds to a specific polypeptide of the invention), ability to form multimers with polypeptides of the invention, and ability to bind to a receptor or ligand for a polypeptide.","The polypeptides of the invention can be assayed for functional activity (e.g. biological activity) using or routinely modifying assays known in the art, as well as assays described herein. Specifically, one of skill in the art may routinely assay secreted polypeptides (including fragments and variants) of the invention for activity using assays as described in the examples section below.","\u201cA polypeptide having biological activity\u201d refers to a polypeptide exhibiting activity similar to, but not necessarily identical to, an activity of a polypeptide of the present invention, including mature forms, as measured in a particular biological assay, with or without dose dependency. In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention).","Tables","Table 1A","Table 1A summarizes information concerning certain polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The first column provides the gene number in the application for each clone identifier. The second column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201cClone ID:\u201d, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A. Third column, the cDNA Clones identified in the second column were deposited as indicated in the third column (i.e. by ATCC\u2122 Deposit No:Z and deposit date). Some of the deposits contain multiple different clones corresponding to the same gene. In the fourth column, \u201cVector\u201d refers to the type of vector contained in the corresponding cDNA Clone identified in the second column. In the fifth column, the nucleotide sequence identified as \u201cNT SEQ ID NO:X\u201d was assembled from partially homologous (\u201coverlapping\u201d) sequences obtained from the corresponding cDNA clone identified in the second column and, in some cases, from additional related cDNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually three to five overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X. In the sixth column, \u201cTotal NT Seq.\u201d refers to the total number of nucleotides in the contig sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X.\u201d The deposited clone may contain all or most of these sequences, reflected by the nucleotide position indicated as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (seventh column) and the \u201c3\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (eighth column) of SEQ ID NO:X. In the ninth column, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Start Codon.\u201d Similarly, in column ten, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the predicted signal sequence is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of First AA of Signal Pep.\u201d In the eleventh column, the translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as \u201cAA SEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d although other reading frames can also be routinely translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.","In the twelfth and thirteenth columns of Table 1A, the first and last amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the predicted signal peptide is identified as \u201cFirst AA of Sig Pep\u201d and \u201cLast AA of Sig Pep.\u201d In the fourteenth column, the predicted first amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the secreted portion is identified as \u201cPredicted First AA of Secreted Portion\u201d. The amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the last amino acid encoded by the open reading frame is identified in the fifteenth column as \u201cLast AA of ORF\u201d.","SEQ ID NO:X (where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y (where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used, for example, to generate antibodies which bind specifically to proteins containing the polypeptides and the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table 1A and\/or elsewhere herein","Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X, and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a human cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC\u2122, as set forth in Table 1A. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited plasmid can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited plasmid in accordance with known methods","The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular plasmid can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.","Also provided in Table 1A is the name of the vector which contains the cDNA plasmid.

corresponding to the clone identifier. The second column in Table 1B.1 and Table 1B.2 provides a unique \u201cClone ID:\u201d for the cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1B.1 and Table 1B.2. This clone ID references the cDNA clone which contains at least the 5\u2032 most sequence of the assembled contig and at least a portion of SEQ ID NO:X as determined by directly sequencing the referenced clone. The referenced clone may have more sequence than described in the sequence listing or the clone may have less. In the vast majority of cases, however, the clone is believed to encode a full-length polypeptide. In the case where a clone is not full-length, a full-length cDNA can be obtained by methods described elsewhere herein. The third column in Table 1B.1 and Table 1B.2 provides a unique \u201cContig ID\u201d identification for each contig sequence. The fourth column in Table 1B.1 and Table 1B.2 provides the \u201cSEQ ID NO:\u201d identifier for each of the contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Table 1B.","Table 1B.1","The fifth column in Table 1B.1, \u201cORF (From-To)\u201d, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d that delineate the preferred open reading frame (ORF) shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1B.1, column 6, as SEQ ID NO:Y. Where the nucleotide position number \u201cTo\u201d is lower than the nucleotide position number \u201cFrom\u201d, the preferred ORF is the reverse complement of the referenced polynucleotide sequence. The sixth column in Table 1B.1 provides the corresponding SEQ ID NO:Y for the polypeptide sequence encoded by the preferred ORF delineated in column 5. In one embodiment, the invention provides an amino acid sequence comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide encoded by the portion of SEQ ID NO:X delineated by \u201cORF (From-To)\u201d. Also provided are polynucleotides encoding such amino acid sequences and the complementary strand thereto. Column 7 in Table 1B.1 lists residues comprising epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by the preferred ORF (SEQ ID NO:Y), as predicted using the algorithm of Jameson and Wolf, (1988) Comp. Appl. Biosci. 4:181-186. The Jameson-Wolf antigenic analysis was performed using the computer program PROTEAN (Version 3.11 for the Power MacIntosh, DNASTAR, Inc., 1228 South Park Street Madison, Wis.). In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, at least one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes as described in Table 1B. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly.","Column 8 in Table 1B.1 provides a chromosomal map location for certain polynucleotides of the invention. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Each sequence in the UniGene database is assigned to a \u201ccluster\u201d; all of the ESTs, cDNAs, and STSs in a cluster are believed to be derived from a single gene. Chromosomal mapping data is often available for one or more sequence(s) in a UniGene cluster; this data (if consistent) is then applied to the cluster as a whole. Thus, it is possible to infer the chromosomal location of a new polynucleotide sequence by determining its identity with a mapped UniGene cluster.","A modified version of the computer program BLASTN (Altshul, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990), and Gish, and States, Nat. Genet. 3:266-272) (1993) was used to search the UniGene database for EST or cDNA sequences that contain exact or near-exact matches to a polynucleotide sequence of the invention (the \u2018Query\u2019). A sequence from the UniGene database (the \u2018Subject\u2019) was said to be an exact match if it contained a segment of 50 nucleotides in length such that 48 of those nucleotides were in the same order as found in the Query sequence. If all of the matches that met this criteria were in the same UniGene cluster, and mapping data was available for this cluster, it is indicated in Table 1B under the heading \u201cCytologic Band\u201d. Where a cluster had been further localized to a distinct cytologic band, that band is disclosed; where no banding information was available, but the gene had been localized to a single chromosome, the chromosome is disclosed.","Once a presumptive chromosomal location was determined for a polynucleotide of the invention, an associated disease locus was identified by comparison with a database of diseases which have been experimentally associated with genetic loci. The database used was the Morbid Map, derived from OMIM\u2122 and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.) 2000; If the putative chromosomal location of a polynucleotide of the invention (Query sequence) was associated with a disease in the Morbid Map database, an OMIM reference identification number was noted in column 9, Table 1B.1, labeled \u201cOMIM Disease Reference(s). Table 5 is a key to the OMIM reference identification numbers (column 1), and provides a description of the associated disease in Column 2","Table 1B.2","Column 5, in Table 1B.2, provides an expression profile and library code:count for each of the contig sequences (SEQ ID NO:X) disclosed in Table 1B, which can routinely be combined with the information provided in Table 4 and used to determine the tissues, cells, and\/or cell line libraries which predominantly express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first number in Table 1B.2, column 5 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue\/cell source identifier code corresponding to the code and description provided in Table 4. The second number in column 5 (following the colon) represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence was identified in the corresponding tissue\/cell source. Those tissue\/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are \u201cAR\u201d designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of P dCTP, using oligo (dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after \u201c[array code]:\u201d represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and\/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and\/or specific tissue and\/or cell expression.

Fluorometric microvolume assay technology (FMAT) is a fluorescence-based system which provides a means to perform nonradioactive cell- and bead-based assays to detect activation of cell signal transduction pathways. This technology was designed specifically for ligand binding and immunological assays. Using this technology, fluorescent cells or beads at the bottom of the well are detected as localized areas of concentrated fluorescence using a data processing system. Unbound fluorophore comprising the background signal is ignored, allowing for a wide variety of homogeneous assays. FMAT technology may be used for peptide ligand binding assays, immunofluorescence, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and bead-based immunocapture assays. See, Miraglia S et. al., \u201cHomogeneous cell and bead based assays for high throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology,\u201d Journal of Biomolecular Screening; 4:193-204 (1999). In particular, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) to activate signal transduction pathways. For example, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides to upregulate production of immunomodulatory proteins (such as, for example, interleukins, GM-CSF, Rantes, and Tumor Necrosis factors, as well as other cellular regulators (e.g. insulin)).","Tables 1D.1 and 1D.2 also describe the use of kinase assays for testing, demonstrating, or quantifying biological activity. In this regard, the phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues (e.g. Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine) on cell-signal transduction proteins provides a fast, reversible means for activation and de-activation of cellular signal transduction pathways. Moreover, cell signal transduction via phosphorylation\/de-phosphorylation is crucial to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes (e.g. proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, etc.). Accordingly, kinase assays provide a powerful tool useful for testing, confirming, and\/or identifying polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) that mediate cell signal transduction events via protein phosphorylation.

One such biological activity which may be tested includes the ability of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention to stimulate up-regulation or down-regulation of expression of particular genes and proteins. Hence, if polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention exhibit activity in altering particular gene and protein expression patterns, it is likely that these polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may be involved in, or capable of effecting changes in, diseases associated with the altered gene and protein expression profiles. Hence, polynucleotides, polypeptides, or antibodies of the present invention could be used to treat said associated diseases.","TaqMan\u00ae assays may be performed to assess the ability of polynucleotides (and polypeptides they encode) to alter the expression pattern of particular \u201ctarget\u201d genes. TaqMan\u00ae reactions are performed to evaluate the ability of a test agent to induce or repress expression of specific genes in different cell types. TaqMan\u00ae gene expression quantification assays (\u201cTaqMan\u00ae assays\u201d) are well known to, and routinely performed by, those of ordinary skill in the art. TaqMan\u00ae assays are performed in a two step reverse transcription\/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the first (RT) step, cDNA is reverse transcribed from total RNA samples using random hexamer primers. In the second (PCR) step, PCR products are synthesized from the cDNA using gene specific primers.","To quantify gene expression the Taqman\u00ae PCR reaction exploits the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae DNA Polymerase to cleave a Taqman\u00ae probe (distinct from the primers) during PCR. The Taqman\u00ae probe contains a reporter dye at the 5\u2032-end of the probe and a quencher dye at the 3\u2032 end of the probe. When the probe is intact, the proximity of the reporter dye to the quencher dye results in suppression of the reporter fluorescence. During PCR, if the target of interest is present, the probe specifically anneals between the forward and reverse primer sites. AmpliTaq Fold DNA Polymerase then cleaves the probe between the reporter and quencher when the probe hybridizes to the target, resulting in increased fluorescence of the reporter (see Figure 2). Accumulation of PCR products is detected directly by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of the reporter dye.","After the probe fragments are displaced from the target, polymerization of the strand continues. The 3\u2032-end of the probe is blocked to prevent extension of the probe during PCR. This process occurs in every cycle and does not interfere with the exponential accumulation of product. The increase in fluorescence signal is detected only if the target sequence is complementary to the probe and is amplified during PCR. Because of these requirements, any nonspecific amplification is not detected.","For test sample preparation, vector controls or constructs containing the coding sequence for the gene of interest are transfected into cells, such as for example 293T cells, and supernatants collected after 48 hours. For cell treatment and RNA isolation, multiple primary human cells or human cell lines are used; such cells may include but are not limited to, Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts, Aortic Smooth Muscle, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, HepG2, Daudi, Jurkat, U937, Caco, and THP-1 cell lines. Cells are plated in growth media and growth is arrested by culturing without media change for 3 days, or by switching cells to low serum media and incubating overnight. Cells are treated for 1, 6, or 24 hours with either vector control supernatant or sample supernatant (or purified\/partially purified protein preparations in buffer). Total RNA is isolated; for example, by using Trizol extraction or by using the Ambion RNAqueous\u2122-4PCR RNA isolation system. Expression levels of multiple genes are analyzed using TAQMAN, and expression in the test sample is compared to control vector samples to identify genes induced or repressed. Each of the above described techniques are well known to, and routinely performed by, those of ordinary skill in the art.","Table 1E indicates particular disease classes and preferred indications for which polynucleotides, polypeptides, or antibodies of the present invention may be used in detecting, diagnosing, preventing, treating and\/or ameliorating said diseases and disorders based on \u201ctarget\u201d gene expression patterns which may be up- or down-regulated by polynucleotides (and the encoded polypeptides) corresponding to each indicated cDNA Clone ID (shown in Table 1E, Column 2).","Thus, in preferred embodiments, the present invention encompasses a method of detecting, diagnosing, preventing, treating, and\/or ameliorating a disease or disorder listed in the \u201cDisease Class\u201d and\/or \u201cPreferred Indication\u201d columns of Table 1E; comprising administering to a patient in which such detection, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment is desired a protein, nucleic acid, or antibody of the invention (or fragment or variant thereof) in an amount effective to detect, diagnose, prevent, treat, or ameliorate the disease or disorder.

The first column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201cClone ID NO:\u201d, corresponding to a cDNA clone disclosed in Table 1A and\/or Table 1B. The second column provides the unique contig identifier, \u201cContig ID:\u201d which allows correlation with the information in Table 1B. The third column provides the sequence identifier, \u201cSEQ ID NO:\u201d, for the contig polynucleotide sequences. The fourth column provides the analysis method by which the homology\/identity disclosed in the Table was determined. The fifth column provides a description of the PFAM\/NR hit identified by each analysis. Column six provides the accession number of the PFAM\/NR hit disclosed in the fifth column. Column seven, score\/percent identity, provides a quality score or the percent identity, of the hit disclosed in column five. Comparisons were made between polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides of the invention and a non-redundant protein database (herein referred to as \u201cNR\u201d), or a database of protein families (herein referred to as \u201cPFAM\u201d), as described below.","The NR database, which comprises the NBRF PIR database, the NCBI GenPept database, and the SIB SwissProt and TrEMBL databases, was made non-redundant using the computer program nrdb2 (Warren Gish, Washington University in Saint Louis). Each of the polynucleotides shown in Table 1B, column 3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:X or the \u2018Query\u2019 sequence) was used to search against the NR database. The computer program BLASTX was used to compare a 6-frame translation of the Query sequence to the NR database (for information about the BLASTX algorithm please see Altshul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990), and Gish and States, Nat. Genet. 3:266-272 (1993). A description of the sequence that is most similar to the Query sequence (the highest scoring \u2018Subject\u2019) is shown in column five of Table 2 and the database accession number for that sequence is provided in column six. The highest scoring \u2018Subject\u2019 is reported in Table 2 if (a) the estimated probability that the match occurred by chance alone is less than 1.0e-07, and (b) the match was not to a known repetitive element. BLASTX returns alignments of short polypeptide segments of the Query and Subject sequences which share a high degree of similarity; these segments are known as High-Scoring Segment Pairs or HSPs. Table 2 reports the degree of similarity between the Query and the Subject for each HSP as a percent identity in Column 7. The percent identity is determined by dividing the number of exact matches between the two aligned sequences in the HSP, dividing by the number of Query amino acids in the HSP and multiplying by 100. The polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO:X which encode the polypeptide sequence that generates an HSP are delineated by columns 8 and 9 of Table 2.","The PFAM database, PFAM version 2.1, (Sonnhammer, Nucl. Acids Res., 26:320-322, 1998)) consists of a series of multiple sequence alignments; one alignment for each protein family. Each multiple sequence alignment is converted into a probability model called a Hidden Markov Model, or HMM, that represents the position-specific variation among the sequences that make up the multiple sequence alignment (see, e.g., Durbin, et al., , Cambridge University Press, 1998 for the theory of HMMs). The program HMMER version 1.8 (Sean Eddy, Washington University in Saint Louis) was used to compare the predicted protein sequence for each Query sequence (SEQ ID NO:Y in Table 1B) to each of the HMMs derived from PFAM version 2.1. A HMM derived from PFAM version 2.1 was said to be a significant match to a polypeptide of the invention if the score returned by HMMER 1.8 was greater than 0.8 times the HMMER 1.8 score obtained with the most distantly related known member of that protein family. The description of the PFAM family which shares a significant match with a polypeptide of the invention is listed in column 5 of Table 2, and the database accession number of the PFAM hit is provided in column 6. Column 7 provides the score returned by HMMER version 1.8 for the alignment. Columns 8 and 9 delineate the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO:X which encode the polypeptide sequence which show a significant match to a PFAM protein family.","As mentioned, columns 8 and 9 in Table 2, \u201cNT From\u201d and \u201cNT To\u201d, delineate the polynucleotides of \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d that encode a polypeptide having a significant match to the PFAM\/NR database as disclosed in the fifth column. In one embodiment, the invention provides a protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO:X delineated in columns 8 and 9 of Table 2. Also provided are polynucleotides encoding such proteins, and the complementary strand thereto.","The nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:X and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:X are useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in ATCC\u2122 Deposit No:Z. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling immediate applications in chromosome mapping, linkage analysis, tissue identification and\/or typing, and a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used to generate antibodies which bind specifically to these polypeptides, or fragments thereof, and\/or to the polypeptides encoded by the cDNA clones identified in, for example, Table 1A and\/or 1B.","Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X, and a predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing cDNA ATCC\u2122 Deposit No:Z (e.g., as set forth in columns 2 and 3 of Table 1A and\/or as set forth, for example, in Table 1B, 6, and 7). The nucleotide sequence of each deposited clone can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited clone in accordance with known methods. Further, techniques known in the art can be used to verify the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:X. The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular clone can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
