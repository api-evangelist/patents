title: Display configuration for multimode electronic calipers having a ratiometric measurement mode
abstract: A multimode electronic measuring instrument is provided that includes a ratiometric mode of operation. During the ratiometric mode, a desired dimension is established as a stored reference dimension X. After the reference dimension is stored in memory, subsequent ratiometric measurement readouts will equal a current measurement distance Xdivided by the reference dimension X. A persistent number of decimal places used to the right of the decimal point as seen on a display is determined based on a current reference dimension X, an increment used for the least significant digit, and an internal measurement resolution of the multimode electronic measuring instrument.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to electronic calipers, micrometers, digital scales, and similar length and angle measuring devices. More particularly, it relates to electronic calipers and the like that can be operated using a simplified control method to provide either ratiometric measurements or measurements in terms of conventional distance or angle units.","Most electronic calipers, dividers, and the like that are currently in use provide measurements only in conventional length or angle units such as inches, millimeters, degrees, or radians. Furthermore, devices that provide such measurements, particularly in the case of commercially-available electronic calipers, have become near-commodities. Elements such as the user-controlled functions, the number and spacing of the buttons to activate the functions, and the dimensions of the electronic housing and the LCD display portion have settled into a narrow range of configurations. These configurations provide the manufacturability, economical, functionality, and ergonomic factors that are expected or required by a majority of manufacturers and users of electronic calipers. As such, manufacturers and users are reluctant to accept design variations that may have undesirable effects, such as increasing the user-controlled functional complexity, increasing the number of buttons or decreasing their ergonomic spacing, increasing the ergonomic dimensions of the electronic housing, or decreasing the ergonomic visibility of LCD display elements, etc., even to a moderate extent.","If such undesirable effects are taken into account and mitigated during the design of electronic calipers, however, additional features may be added and accepted in new designs. An example of such a feature on an electronic caliper may be found in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,246,032, to Feldman (hereinafter \u201cthe '032 Patent\u201d), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The '032 Patent discloses an electronic caliper with a ratio-measuring mode. In the ratio-measuring mode, a ratio is determined from a reference measurement and a current measurement, such that the current measurement is divided by the reference measurement to display a ratio of the two measurements. Using an electronic caliper in this way allows a user to measure not only a ratio of dimensions of physical objects, but also a ratio on scaled drawings or other blueprint type plans, for example. As the caliper arms are moved, the current measurement changes and so, too, does the ratio displayed on the screen.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","With known calipers that include a ratiometric measuring mode (e.g., as disclosed in the '032 patent), the position of the decimal point and thus the number of decimal places displayed to the right of the decimal point are not optimized. In one example, the position of the decimal point on the display may vary (or float) as the current measurement changes, making it difficult for a user to read the displayed ratio. In another example, the number of decimal places displayed may be fixed, but may not be optimal for a particular reference dimension. For example, it may have an inappropriate or invalid resolution for at least part of the available measuring range, or worse, known methods for providing a resolution corresponding to the fixed number or decimal places may result in an unreliable ratio calculation. In various exemplary embodiments according to the present invention, the optimal position of the decimal point is calculated in real-time (e.g., at the time the reference dimension is set) and remains fixed or persistent throughout the ratiometric measuring mode of operation for a given reference dimension. In some embodiments, the optimal number of decimals or the optimal decimal point position may be determined in combination with an optimal increment used for the least significant digit (LSD) of the display, such as 1, 2, and 5, so as to provide an easy-to-read and reliable readout during the ratiometric measuring mode of operation. In various embodiments, the persistent number of decimal places and the increment used for the least significant digit of the displayed ratiometric measurement values are determined such that the increment used for the least significant digit corresponds to a measurement increment that is at least as large as the internal measurement resolution of the multimode measurement instrument.","A plurality of decimal point positions are provided on the display so as to have different candidate positions of the decimal point available, because different reference measurement dimensions have a different corresponding ratiometric measuring ranges available within the measuring range of the caliper. For example, if a reference measurement value is small and a subsequent measured value is large compared to the small reference measurement value, then the ratio displayed will be large (e.g., much greater than 1.0, with few decimal places required). Conversely, if a reference measurement value is large and a subsequent measured value is small compared to the large reference measurement value, then the ratio displayed will be small (e.g., much less than 1.0, with several decimal places required). Thus, it is desirable to select an optimal decimal point position to display a corresponding number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point for each particular reference measurement value before ratiometric measuring begins.","It should be appreciated that the ratiometric measurement provided according to the previous description is significantly different from \u201cscaled\u201d measurements and displays found in prior art instruments. Scaled measurements and displays are basically used to multiply an underlying dimensional measurement provided by a transducer of an instrument by a selected factor. In contrast, a ratiometric measurement according to the disclosed subject matter is particularly useful for comparing two dimensions. That is, the display indicates the relationship of a current dimension to another readily-changed (reference) dimension, rather than just scaling the displayed value for a measured dimension. One benefit of the ratiometric measurement is that the calculated ratio may be displayed regardless of units of measurement.","The ratiometric measurement mode of operation described above is implemented, in various embodiments, using a simple and intuitive user interface, a simple and intuitive setting of the reference dimension, and a ratiometric measurement display with an optimized decimal display that is flexible, simple and intuitively understood.","Accordingly, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method for displaying a ratiometric number in a multimode measurement instrument comprising a position-sensing transducer, the multimode measurement instrument having an internal measurement resolution. The method includes generally four steps. The first step involves operating the multimode measurement instrument to select a ratiometric measurement mode of operation using a mode-selecting feature included in a user interface of the multimode measurement instrument.","The second step involves operating the multimode measurement instrument to set a current reference dimension during the ratiometric measurement mode of operation. In some embodiments, the current reference dimension may be automatically set to a measurement value corresponding to a measurement position of multimode measuring instrument at the time that the ratiometric measurement mode of operation is selected. In some embodiments, the user interface of the multimode measurement instrument comprises a reference dimension setting element configured such that the user may activate the reference dimension setting element to set or replace the current reference dimension at various times. The third step involves operating the multimode measurement instrument to determine a persistent number of decimal places to be used in displaying ratiometric measurement values that are based on the current reference dimension, wherein the persistent number of decimal places is determined based, at least in part, on the current reference dimension. The fourth step involves operating the multimode measurement instrument to automatically display ratiometric measurement values using the persistent number of decimal places, wherein the ratiometric measurement values are determined based on a current measurement derived from the position-sensing transducer and the current reference dimension. In various embodiments, if the second step is repeated during the ratiometric measurement mode of operation such that a new current reference dimension is set, then the third and fourth steps are subsequently performed based on that new current reference dimension.","In various embodiments, the persistent number of decimal places is determined such that an increment used for displaying the least significant digit (e.g., a \u201cconventional\u201d increment of 1, in some embodiments) corresponds to a measurement increment that is at least as large as the internal measurement resolution of the multimode measurement instrument.","Additionally, the presently-disclosed subject matter provides a multimode measurement instrument having at least two relatively moveable members for making measurements. The multimode measurement instrument includes: a display configured to display the measurements made from a relationship between the at least two relatively moveable members; a mode-selecting element configured to select a ratiometric mode of operation; and a control element configured to automatically cause the display to show a ratiometric number based on the relationship between the at least two relatively moveable members and a reference dimension set in the ratiometric mode of operation, wherein the ratiometric number has a persistent number of decimal places determined, at least in part, based on the reference dimension.","In the following descriptions, reference numbers generally having the same suffix digits or trailing digits refer to analogous or identical elements, unless otherwise indicated by description or context. As such, the description of one or more such similar elements will be understood to apply to other similar elements unless otherwise indicated by description or context.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","101","102","103","104","109","108","102","102","110","111","112","113","102","102"]},"The user control portion  includes a mode-selecting element , origin-setting element , and an optional control element  that may provide various other user control functions. In various applications, a physically independent display device (not shown) displays information based on data received through the external data interface  and the display  that is typically connected and assembled with the signal processing and control unit  that optionally may be omitted in such applications.","The transducer  may comprise any convenient type of dimensional measurement transducer, including angular measurement transducers, linear measurement transducers, or the like. When the multimode measuring instrument system  is part of a low-power and portable handheld measurement device, it is advantageous to use a capacitive or inductive transducer such as those described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,879,508; 5,023,559; 5,841,274; 5,894,678; 5,973,494; 6,002,250; and 6,011,389, for example, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Furthermore, in various embodiments, the transducer  comprises an absolute measurement type of transducer, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,841,274, and 5,886,519, for example, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Certain operating advantages are provided when an absolute measurement type transducer is used in a multimode measuring instrument, as outlined further below.","In various embodiments, the signal processing and control unit  may include the memory  and processor  for storing and executing various instructions implemented by the signal processing and control unit . The memory  may be any device capable of storing and writing data for later use, even when no power is supplied to the memory . This may include, but is not limited to, a conventional hard drive device, RAM, ROM, any solid-state device, including removable and nonremovable devices, etc. The memory  is further configured to store computer-readable instructions that may be executed on the processor . The computer-readable instructions stored in the memory , when executed by the processor , implement the various functions as described herein with regard to the signal processing and control unit , but are not limited to such functions.","The signal processing and control unit  may also include the regular mode element  and the ratiometric mode element , as seen in . The regular mode element  and the ratiometric mode element  may be used in combination with, or separately from, the memory  and the processor  to implement their respective functions as described below. Additionally, the regular mode element  and the ratiometric mode element  may each comprise its own respective memory and processor (both not shown) for executing their respective functions. As with the memory , any individual memory incorporated in the regular mode element  or the ratiometric mode element  may be of a type including, but not limited to, a hard drive, a solid state device, including both removable and nonremovable devices, RAM, ROM, etc.","In various embodiments, the power supply  may comprise a solar cell, a miniature 1.5-volt or 3-volt battery, or the like. The incorporated references include detailed descriptions of the design and operation of various components usable in a multimode measuring instrument system, including components usable for the signal processing and control unit  and the power supply . In various embodiments, the display  may comprise a compact custom or dot-matrix LCD display. However, in general, now-known or later-developed display types that provide the desired operating characteristics may be used. It will be appreciated that each of these components, as well as the additional components described below, may be interconnected by one or more data\/control buses and\/or application programming interfaces, or by direct connections between the various elements.","The user control portion  includes the origin-setting element , the mode-selecting element , and may include the optional control element  that may include various other user control elements or provide other functions, as described further below. The mode-selecting element  allows the operator to determine or select the mode of operation of the multimode measuring instrument system . In particular, the mode-selecting element  allows the user or operator to select at least two modes of operation. A first mode is a conventional, or regular, measurement mode, wherein the multimode measuring instrument system  is usable to measure the dimensions of objects and display the measurement results in conventional units such as inches, millimeters, or other conventional or predetermined units. The first mode of operation may be controlled, in part, by the regular mode element  of the signal processing and control unit .","A second mode is a ratiometric measurement mode, wherein the multimode measuring instrument system  is usable to measure the dimensions of objects and display the measurement results as a ratio between the dimension of the measured object and a previously-determined reference dimension. The second mode of operation may be controlled, in part, by the ratiometric mode element  of the signal processing and control unit . In various embodiments, the mode-selecting element  may be implemented, for example, as a button, a miniature touch-screen element, a voice-activated control circuit, or any other now-known or later-developed miniature low-power switching or selection element.","In one embodiment, the operations associated with the origin-setting element  include allowing the operator to determine or select a reference dimension that is operative during the ratiometric measurement mode of operation. In particular, the origin-setting element  allows the user or operator to trigger the input and storage of a reference-measured dimension in the memory  corresponding to a current position of the transducer . The origin-setting element  may also, optionally, provide other functions as outlined further below. In various embodiments, the origin-setting element  may be implemented, for example, as a button, a miniature touch-screen element, a voice-activated control circuit, or any other now-known or later-developed miniature low power switching or selection element.","To operate in either the conventional or the ratiometric measurement mode as controlled, in part, by the regular mode element  and the ratiometric mode , respectively, the user or operator activates the mode-selecting element , for example, by pressing a button, speaking toward the multimode measuring instrument system  to activate voice recognition commands, etc., depending on the implementation of the mode-selecting element . This will set the signal processing and control unit  to operate in one of the modes, depending on the indicated selection.","If the ratiometric measuring mode is set, the desired reference dimension must be set. In one embodiment, the reference dimension may be set to an initial or default value corresponding to whatever the position or dimension of the multimode measuring instrument system  was at the time that the ratiometric measurement mode was activated. In various embodiments, the reference dimension may be set and\/or altered by physically adjusting the multimode measuring instrument system  to a desired position or dimension after the ratiometric measurement mode has been activated, and then activating the origin-setting element  (e.g., by pressing a button, speaking toward the multimode measuring instrument system  to activate voice recognition commands, etc., depending on the implementation of the origin-setting element ). In any case, after the reference dimension has been set, any subsequent measurement taken using the multimode measuring instrument system , where the transducer  signals that a measurement sample has been taken, will be displayed on the display  as a number equal to the ratio of the current position or measurement of the transducer  to the reference position or dimension. The ratio value may be determined by any method that, in effect, divides the current position or measurement of the transducer  by the stored reference position or dimension, as will be discussed in more detail below.","In one embodiment, when the mode-selecting element  is activated a first time, it places the multimode measuring instrument system  in the conventional mode state of operation in which the measurements are displayed in inches. If the mode-selecting element  is activated a second time, the multimode measuring instrument system  will remain in the conventional mode of operation, but will display measurements in units of millimeters, and so on for as many units of measurement as are capable of display in the multimode measuring instrument system . If the mode-selecting element  is activated an additional time and the multimode measuring instrument system  has exhausted the possible units of measurement in the conventional mode of operation, the multimode measuring instrument system  will then be placed in the ratiometric mode of operation, as previously discussed. However, this particular sequence of operations of the mode-selecting element  is exemplary only, and not limiting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","100","200","207","208","207","217","217","230","201","208","218","218","208","230","201","201","201"]},"In the embodiment shown in , the read-head member  carries the transducer read-head assembly , also referred to simply as read-head assembly , which includes a display , a power supply battery  (located internally and shown in dashed outline), a mode-selecting button , and an origin-selecting button . The read-head assembly  also includes a transducer read-head (not shown) that is operable to provide signals indicative of the position of the transducer read-head assembly  along the transducer scale \u2032 to the signal processing and control unit  as previously outlined with reference to .","The display  generally comprises an alphanumeric measurement display portion  and a mode indicator display portion . The display may be a custom LCD display, a dot matrix display, or any other type of display capable of displaying the type of information described herein. In the embodiment shown in , the display  is a custom liquid crystal display (LCD) including the mode indicator portion  and the alphanumeric measurement display portion , which is capable of displaying alphanumeric digits. In some embodiments, each alphanumeric digit displayed on the alphanumeric measurement display portion  may comprise at least seven line segments, not all of which are shown for each digit in . Also, the alphanumeric measurement display portion  may have more than one usable decimal point location, as seen in  (five such locations are shown).","The mode indicator portion  is capable of displaying conventional measurement mode\/unit indicators such as \u201cin\u201d for mode indicator  and \u201cmm\u201d for mode indicator , which indicate units of inches and millimeters, respectively. There is also a ratiometric measurement mode indicator  that displays \u201cratio\u201d when the multimode caliper  is in a ratiometric measuring mode. These indicators may take any convenient written or symbolic form and are not restricted to the exemplary \u201cin,\u201d \u201cmm,\u201d and \u201cratio\u201d forms. It should be appreciated that the conventional measurement units of inches or millimeters are exemplary only, and not limiting. More generally, the conventional measurement mode(s) may display measurements in any desired conventional or predetermined units, and may have corresponding indicators.","In one embodiment, when activated, the mode-selecting button  selects the operating mode and\/or units of measurement displayed by the multimode caliper . In one embodiment, the user may cycle through the modes by repeatedly activating (e.g., pressing) the mode-selecting button . When the \u201cin\u201d mode indicator  is active, the measuring instrument  is in inches mode, and the value displayed on the alphanumeric measurement display portion  is in units of inches. When the \u201cmm\u201d mode indicator  is active, the measuring instrument  is in millimeter mode, and the value displayed on the alphanumeric measurement display portion  is in units of millimeters. When the \u201cratio\u201d mode indicator  is active, the multimode caliper  is in ratio mode, and the value displayed on the alphanumeric measurement display portion  may be a number that is a ratio of a current distance between the relatively moveable members  (or \u2032) and  (or \u2032) to a reference distance previously stored as determined by the distance between the relatively moveable members  (or \u2032) and  (or \u2032), as described in greater detail below.","To obtain a measurement of an object while in the inches or millimeter mode, the user separates the jaw portions  and  to a desired distance, such that their respective measuring edges contact the measurement object. Generally, the alphanumeric measurement display portion  displays the distance between the measuring edges of the relatively-moveable members  and  which are in contact with the measuring object. In many conventional electronic calipers, an origin or zero button can be pressed with the jaw portions  and  at a selected separation or offset distance. Thereafter, that offset distance is subtracted from the measured distance prior to display. In various exemplary embodiments, the origin-selecting button  may provide the previously-described function when the multimode caliper  is operating in a conventional measurement mode, and a different function, a reference dimension setting function when the multimode caliper  is operating in a ratiometric measurement mode.","As previously outlined, in one embodiment, if the user wishes to obtain a ratiometric measurement of an object dimension, after entering the ratiometric measurement mode the user may separate the relatively-moveable members  and  to a desired reference distance or dimension. For example, the movable members  and  may be moved to match a dimension of a 3-dimensional object, a dimension of an illustrated part of an object in a blueprint, or the like. Once the relatively moveable members  and  are separated to the desired reference distance, the origin-selecting button  may be activated. The separation between the measuring edges of the relatively moveable members  and  is defined as the reference dimension Xand stored in the memory  by the signal processing and control unit . Alternatively, in some embodiments, the signal processing and control unit  is connected such that a user may set the reference dimension Xto an initial or default value corresponding to whatever the position or dimension of the multimode caliper  was at the time that the ratiometric measurement mode was activated. In some embodiments, the reference dimension Xmay be set by means of a remote console connected to the external data interface  (shown in ).","After the reference dimension Xis set, the alphanumeric measurement display portion  will initially (e.g., prior to a change in the position of the multimode caliper ) display a numerical value of one (1) as the ratiometric measurement value. In particular, there will be a decimal point displayed immediately to the right of the digit \u201c1\u201d, followed by a number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point. According to this invention, the number of decimal places is determined based at least in part on the reference dimension, as discussed below in more detail. After a reference dimension Xis set (and\/or stored in the memory ), any subsequent readout on the alphanumeric measurement display portion  while operating in the ratiometric mode will equal the current measurement distance Xdivided by the reference dimension X, as seen in EQUATION 1 below.","As one example illustrating the intuitive and useful operation of this mode, a user may wish to estimate the value of a point included on a graph. The user would first match the measuring edges of the jaw portions  and  to the dimension of the 100% scale graduation mark on the graph axis, and then the user may either activate the ratiometric mode of measurement to set the reference dimension, or if already in the ratiometric measurement mode, activate the origin-selecting button , thereby saving the current dimension as the reference dimension Xin the memory . The user would then match the measuring edges of the jaw portions  and  to the separation between any other graph point and the zero axis or match the measuring edges of the jaw portions  and  to the separation between any two points along the calibrated direction, which automatically establishes the separation dimension as X. The ratiometric measurement X, which is the ratio of the current dimension Xto the reference dimension X, is displayed on the alphanumeric measurement display portion  and is determined from the following equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003(Eq. 1)\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"sub":["ref ","curr"],"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["200","340","217","218","320","340","206","110","102","223","213","200"],"sub":["ref ","curr ","ref"]},"The number of decimal places displayed to the right of the decimal point of the value \u201c1.0000\u201d (four decimal places in the example of ) is automatically determined according to the reference dimension Xand several pre-chosen factors, as later described in more detail with regard to . These factors may include a desired increment value by which the displayed ratio value is to be incremented or decremented when the jaw portions  and  are moved after the reference dimension is set, a resolution value that is preset and that may correspond to the finest measurement resolution that may be provided in the operations of the multimode caliper , and a number base, such as base-10, that is to be used for displaying the determined ratiometric measurement value (also referred to simply as the ratio value or ratio measurement). In various embodiments, one of the criteria that may be applied when determining the number of decimal places is that an increment used for displaying the least significant digit (e.g., a \u201cconventional\u201d increment of 1, in some embodiments) corresponds to a measurement increment that is at least as large as the internal measurement resolution of the multimode measurement instrument.","As seen in the alphanumeric display portion  in the example of , the numerical value has four decimal places to the right of the decimal point. The number of decimal places chosen for display in  is determined based on the size of the object  with corresponding dimension  and the pre-chosen factors discussed above for determining the value \u201c1.0000.\u201d As seen in , the large object  causes the jaw portions  and  to open to approximately the full measuring capacity of the multimode caliper . In general, any subsequent measurement will result in a displayed ratio that is smaller than one (1) because the dimension  is already at the maximum length of the multimode caliper  and any subsequent object measured will be of a smaller size. Thus, a relatively larger number of decimal places (e.g., 4 decimal places) may be desired in order to provide a numerical display range that distinguishes a larger number of different measurement values from one another. In general, a ratio measurement is determined based on a comparison of the current dimension (e.g., the dimension  shown in ) to the reference dimension Xestablished for the first large object  as described above. After the ratiometric mode is entered and the reference dimension Xis set, the alphanumeric display portion  immediately and continuously displays the ratio Xof any current position X, defined by the separation of the jaw portions  and , in proportion to the reference dimension X.","As seen in , there is a second small object  with a corresponding dimension  for which a ratio measurement is desired. In particular,  shows the state of the multimode caliper  after a user has matched the measuring edges of the jaw portions  and  to the corresponding dimension  of the small object . In this case, the alphanumeric display portion  immediately displays the ratio Xof the current measurement Xto the reference dimension Xas \u201c0.0212.\u201d That is, the small object  is \u201c0.0212\u201d times the size of the large object . Further, the user knows that the Xvalue displayed is a ratiometric measurement, by reference to the display of the \u201cratio\u201d mode indicator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 3A"],"sub":["ref ","curr ","ref ","ref","ref ","ratio ","curr ","ref","ref"],"b":["200","360","217","218","350","360","206","110","102","223","217","218","223"]},"In particular, the number of decimal places displayed to the right of the decimal point of the value \u201c1.0\u201d (one decimal place in the example of ) is automatically determined according to the reference dimension Xand the pre-chosen factors outlined previously. Since the reference dimension Xis small, when compared with the full measurement length of the multimode caliper , almost all measurements taken after the small reference dimension Xis set will be larger than one (1). Thus, a relatively small number of decimal places (e.g., 1 decimal place), and a relatively larger number of digits to the left of the decimal point, may be desired in order to provide a numerical display range that distinguishes a larger number of different measurement values from one another.","The alphanumeric display portion  immediately and continuously displays any current measurement X, defined by the separation of the jaw portions  and , in proportion to the reference dimension X, as outlined above.  shows a ratiometric measurement in which a large object  is measured, in comparison to the small reference dimension established based on the small object  as described above. In particular,  shows the state of the multimode caliper  after a user has matched the measuring edges of the jaw portions  and  to the dimension  of the large object . In this particular example, the alphanumeric display portion  immediately displays the ratio value Xof \u201c9999.9\u201d of the current measurement Xto the reference dimension X. Coincidentally, this may indicate that the large object  is the largest object that provides a valid measurement display in the ratiometric mode for the given number of decimal places and the current reference dimension. However, one of ordinary skill will recognize that the display capability of the alphanumeric display  is a function of the characteristics of the display and in no way limits the scope of the disclosed subject matter. For example, a display with more than five displayable digits is fully contemplated within the scope of the disclosed subject matter.","In one embodiment, if the value of Xis greater than a predefined value X, which is the largest numerical representation possible for the alphanumeric display portion  given a particular number of decimal places, the display  may display an error message by activating whatever elements of the display that can be readily interpreted as an error message. For example, the occurrence of a value such as \u201c9999.9\u201d may be so rare in practice that it may be used as an error indicator, or the display may be configured to display \u201cREF_X\u201d, a blinking alphanumeric representation, or a display analogous to the word \u201cError.\u201d The most suitable value of Xmay be determined according to the properties of the display , the transducer , or other elements of the multimode measuring instrument system  that may limit the ability of the instrument to provide a ratiometric measurement display value that meets predetermined criteria for range and\/or resolution. Alternatively, large-valued ratiometric measurements may be displayed in a signed exponent notation. For example, using a five-digit segmented numeric display portion, a value such as \u201c1.72E5\u201d may be displayed.","In another potential error condition, if the user activates the reference dimension selecting button  while the jaw portions  and  are effectively closed and attempts to set the reference dimension such that the current measurement is effectively zero, the value of X, as determined by EQUATION 1, will be undefined because of an attempted division by zero. In one embodiment, this may be prevented by assigning an error condition and an error display to any operation that assigns zero (or a value closely approaching zero) to X. For example, the signal processing and control unit  may be programmed such that if the user activates the reference dimension setting button  when the jaw portions  and  are positioned such that X=0 and, thus, Xwould also equal zero, the display  will show an error message by activating elements of the display that can be readily interpreted as an error message. For example, \u201cREF0\u201d may be displayed in the alphanumeric display portion , the display portion may blink \u201c00000\u201d instead of displaying the ratiometric value of one that is generally expected immediately after activating the reference dimension selecting button , or a message such as \u201cError\u201d may be displayed.","Additionally, if the ratio Xof Xto Xis sufficiently small, the value of Xmay require a greater display resolution than is available from the numerical display portion in order to display non-zero digits. If the number of leading zeros in Xis greater than the number of zeros that a numerical display portion is capable of displaying, the displayed value of Xmay be set equal to zero. Alternatively, small-valued ratiometric measurements may be displayed in a signed exponent notation. For example, using a six-digit segmented numeric display portion, a value such as \u201c3.68E-5\u201d may be displayed.","In an alternative embodiment, the user may only be able to set the reference dimension Xif the separation between the jaw portions  and  is greater than a predefined minimum value X. The most suitable value of Xmay be determined according to the properties of the display , the transducer , or other elements of the multimode measuring instrument system  that may limit the ability of the instrument to provide a ratiometric measurement display value that meets predetermined criteria for resolution and accuracy.","As described above, it is desirable to display a ratio value in the ratiometric measurement mode that is as precise and meaningful as the system will allow. Additionally, it has been found that it is desirable from the standpoint of human perception and value recognition to keep the decimal point position in the displayed ratio value persistent after the reference dimension Xhas been set. Examples of this can be seen on the alphanumeric display portion  in , and A, and B, respectively. Having a persistent position for the decimal point helps prevent errors in reading the display because of sudden and unexpected movement of the decimal point that might otherwise occur (e.g., in some display algorithms) as the jaw portions  and  are moved to measure an object under observation. Keeping the decimal point in one place after the reference dimension Xhas been set also creates a more pleasant and easily read display when taking ratio measurements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","105","205","520","520","510","105","206","520"]},"At a block , the multimode measurement instrument is operated to determine a persistent number of decimal places to be used in displaying ratiometric measurement values that are based on the current reference dimension, wherein the persistent number of decimal places is determined based, at least in part, on the current reference dimension. As previously outlined, in various embodiments the number of decimal places may be automatically determined based on the current reference dimension and several pre-chosen factors, as described in more detail below. For example, these factors may include an increment used for the least significant digit of the displayed ratiometric measurement values, an internal measurement resolution of the multimode measurement instrument, a number base that is to be used for displaying the ratiometric measurement value (e.g., base 10), in various embodiments. In addition, in various embodiments, one of the criteria that may be applied when determining the number of decimal places is that the increment used for displaying the least significant digit (e.g., a \u201cconventional\u201d increment of 1, in some embodiments) corresponds to a measurement increment that is at least as large as the internal measurement resolution of the multimode measurement instrument. In some embodiments, at least the increment used for the least significant digit of the displayed ratiometric measurement values may be determined in combination with the persistent number of decimal places determined at the block  as one method of satisfying the aforementioned criterion.","At a block , the multimode measurement instrument is operated to automatically display ratiometric measurement values using the persistent number of decimal places determined at the block , wherein the ratiometric measurement values are determined based on a current measurement derived from the position-sensing of the transducer multimode measurement instrument and the current reference dimension. As previously outlined, the displayed ratiometric measurement values are approximately equivalent to the current measurement divided by the reference dimension, regardless of whether the algorithm used to determine the ratiometric measurement takes the form of a conventional division operation, or not.","The decision block  is an optional block in some embodiments. In some embodiments the user may choose to establish a new current reference dimension while the multimode measurement instrument is operated in the ratiometric mode. In some such embodiments, at a decision block , if a new current reference dimension is to be set, then the operations loop back to the block . If a new reference dimension is not to be set, then new operations need not be implemented, and the method may stop. It will be appreciated that when a new current reference dimension is set by returning to the block , then the operations of blocks  and  are subsequently repeated using the new current reference dimension, to provide an advantageous ratiometric display according to previously outlined principles.","In one embodiment of block  of the method  shown in , the persistent number of decimal places that is to be shown on the alphanumeric display  is determined such that it corresponds or conforms to the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"DEC","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["\u230a","\u230b"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["log","base"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","ref"]},"mo":"*","mi":"INC"},"mi":"RES"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}}}}},"In the argument of the log function shown in EQUATION 2, the reference dimension X(e.g., as determined by one of the methods outlined previously) is multiplied by an increment factor INC that is the minimum increment to be used for changing the least significant digit on the alphanumeric display portion , and divided by the internal measurement resolution, RES, of the multimode measuring instrument system . The logarithmic function value, in a predetermined base value corresponding to the base value to be used for the alphanumeric display  (e.g., most commonly base 10), is calculated for the argument of the log function. To determine the persistent number of decimal places, DEC, the floor of the computed logarithmic function value is calculated. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the floor function is a rounding down function to the nearest integer value. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the persistent number of decimal places may be determined by implementing EQUATION 2. However, in other embodiments, other algorithms or equations may be implemented to give a similar result that still corresponds or conforms to EQUATION 2.","Regarding the increment factor INC, when determining a ratio value Xas the jaw portions  and  move, the display will instantaneously and continuously change with each movement. Based on these movements, the ratio value Xdisplayed must be increased or decreased. The INC value determines by what increment the ratio value Xwill be incremented and decremented in the alphanumeric display  when the jaw portions  and  are moved.","In one advantageous embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, when the ratiometric measurement values are displayed as base-10 numbers, the INC value may be chosen from the values 1, 2, or 5. That is, the least significant digit of the ratio value Xdisplayed on the alphanumeric display portion  will be increased or decreased by 1, 2, or 5 units as the jaw portions  and  move. One benefit of choosing the INC value from the values 1, 2, or 5 is that each of these values is a factor of 10, thus incrementing a base 10 display in a way that is readily perceived and understood, for various display resolutions. Despite this benefit, however, one of ordinary skill will recognize that the INC value may be chosen based on whatever increment value is desirable.","The value RES is the operative internal measurement resolution of the multimode measuring instrument system . For example, if the multimode measuring instrument system  includes a linear position measuring transducer and electronics that is internally capable of a 0.01 mm measurement resolution, then the value RES will be 0.01 mm One of ordinary skill will recognize that the value for RES is a function of the capabilities of the multimode measuring instrument system . If the multimode measuring instrument system  is designed to measure very small objects, then a very fine and precise measuring resolution is required. In such an instance, the RES value will correspondingly be small to conform to the capabilities and requirements of the multimode measuring instrument system . On the other hand, if the multimode measuring instrument system  is designed to measure large objects, then there is less of a requirement for very fine and precise measuring, and the resolution of the multimode measuring instrument system  may be larger or coarser; thus RES, too, will be larger.","Additionally, the logarithmic function of EQUATION 2 may use any base that corresponds to the number-base displayed on the alphanumeric display portion . In most instances, this will be a base-10 value since humans most readily and easily use a base-10 number system. However, alternatives, such as a base-16, i.e., hexadecimal, number system are possible and fully contemplated in the disclosed subject matter. If a base-16 number system is used in EQUATION 2, then the corresponding output on the alphanumeric display portion  will also be in base-16.","Once all of the variables of EQUATION 2 are known, the number of decimal places, DEC, may then be calculated for display. As seen in , for example, it is clear from EQUATION 1 how a large reference dimension, such as dimension , in combination with a small RES value can result in a larger number of decimal places (to the right of the decimal point) being chosen for display. As an example of the implementation of EQUATION 2, assume that in  the reference dimension Xis equal to 75 mm, INC is equal to 2, and RES is equal to 0.01 mm Using EQUATION 2, taking the log, in base-10, of the quantity (75*2\/0.01) gives a value of 4.18. Completing EQUATION 2 and taking the floor of 4.18 gives the value of 4. Thus, with the reference dimension equal to 75 mm, the INC value equal to 2, and the RES value equal to 0.01 mm, the number of decimal places to be displayed on the alphanumeric display equals four (4). As a result, the alphanumeric display portion  should initially display the value \u201c1.0000.\u201d","Now, as seen in , the ratio value of the small object  to the reference object  is desired. To make this measurement, the jaw portions  and  will surround the small object  so that the transducer  can read and use the current measurement dimension . Once the current measurement dimension  is known, it is assigned to the value X. Next, the Xvalue that was previously stored in memory  is accessed to determined the ratio value X. Using EQUATION 1 to determine the ratio value Xas seen in  gives a result of 0.0212.","Since the number of decimal places, DEC, was calculated to be four in , the output of the Xvalue will also have four decimal places. Since the increment INC value chosen was two, the least significant digit of 0.0212 is a two (2) and will be incremented and decremented by two (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8). By way of an alternative example, if the INC value chosen would have been one (1), the number of decimal places determined from EQUATION 2 would have been equal to three (3) for . As a result, the Xvalue displayed for the measurement taken in  would have been 0.021, with the least significant digit incrementing or decrementing by one (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). As can be seen, the use of appropriately determined decimal places and the increment value for displaying the ratio value Xcan give a more precise and meaningful output having maximum resolution without exceeding the internal resolution limit of the multimode measuring instrument system  and displaying meaningless or unreliable least significant digits. Thus, it is advantageous to allow the system to determine the most appropriate combination of the number of decimal places DEC and the increment value INC in various embodiments.","In one embodiment according to the disclosed subject matter, it may be desirable to compare results based on more than one increment value INC to determine the most precise number of decimal places DEC possible. For example, similar to the example above, where Xis 75 mm and RES is 0.01 mm, EQUATION 2 may be used to determine the number of decimal places DEC for INC values of 1, 2, and 5. Using EQUATION 2, an INC value of 1 gives a DEC value of 3; an INC value of 2 gives a DEC value of 4; and an INC value of 5 gives a DEC value of 4. Since the more decimal places shown on the alphanumeric display portion  will allow a more precise ratio value X, assuming that measurement range is a limiting factor, an INC value of either 2 or 5 is preferred because it results in 4 decimal places being displayed (as compared to 3). Further, to have the most precise measurement possible, the least amount of incremental increase or decrease is desired. Thus, using the smaller of the two INC values (2 and 5) is desirable in this example. Based on the foregoing example, one skilled in the art may determine other implementations that provide the most desirable combination of INC and DEC for a given reference dimension and set of operating constraints.","In another embodiment for determining an increment value and the total number of decimal places to display, a lookup table  may be employed, as seen in . For example, the lookup table , or the like, may be used to implement operations at the block  of . Briefly, the lookup table  comprises sets of related values, and each set of related values comprises a value DEC (column ) which is a permissible persistent number of decimal places, and a value INC (column ) which is a permissible increment used for the least significant digit of the displayed ratiometric measurement values. In addition, each set of related values includes a value X, (column ) which is a lower bound criterion for current reference dimensions that are permissible with the values DEC and INC of that set of related values. When using the lookup table , determining the persistent number of decimal places and the increment used for the least significant digit of the displayed ratiometric measurement values comprises comparing the current reference dimension to the lower bound criteria Xof the lookup table and identifying the appropriate set of related values such that its lower bound criterion Xis the largest lower bound criterion Xthat is less than or equal to the current reference dimension. The persistent number of decimal places is then set to be the same as the value DEC included in that appropriate set of related values and setting the increment used for the least significant digit of the displayed ratiometric measurement values to be the same as the value of INC included in that appropriate set of related values.","In general, the sets of related values included in the lookup table  may be determined such that they correspond or conform to the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","rlb"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["Base","DEC"]},"mo":"*","mi":"RES"},"mi":"INC"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"4"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sub":"rlb"},"As seen in , the first lower-bound reference dimension Xvalue in the lookup table  may correspond to the RES value, or the internal measuring resolution for the multimode measuring instrument system . Additionally, the largest Xvalue in the lookup table  may be limited in relation to the maximum range the multimode measuring instrument system  can measure. As seen in , the Xcolumn  only has two decimal places to the right of the decimal point. This is because the minimum resolution RES of the multimode measuring instrument system  is assumed to be 0.01 mm, in this example, and two decimal places are sufficient for expressing this resolution.","One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the actual numerical values and the range of lower bounds included in the table in  may be determined to correspond to the design of a particular corresponding multimode caliper . More generally, it will be appreciated that the particular embodiment shown in  is exemplary only, and not limiting for various multi-mode measuring instruments. In general, once an appropriate lookup table (e.g., the lookup table ) has been prepared as outlined above, it may be used in corresponding multimode measuring instrument (e.g., the multimode measuring instrument ), in order to measure objects and display a ratiometric value Xin an alphanumeric display portion. It should be appreciated that the previously described exemplary embodiments are illustrative only, and not limiting. For example, the mode-selecting element  and the origin-setting element  may comprise the same physical element activated to provide different codes or signals. They may be implemented, for example, using a single button. The single button may be pressed in various manners to provide various signals that have recognizable durations and\/or patterns usable to activate the desired operations of the signal processing and control unit . Alternatively, a simple voice-activated circuit may be used.","Furthermore, although the ratiometric measurement mode of operation described above has characteristics that are particularly well-suited to being combined in the most efficient way possible with conventional caliper operations or the like, it should be appreciated that the ratiometric measurement can be enhanced and\/or used in various other ways. For example, the ratiometric measurement can be displayed as a percent of the reference dimension, or an element can be provided to activate operations that invert the ratiometric measurement (that is, the operation 1\/Xcan be performed) and display the inverted value and a corresponding \u201cinvert\u201d indicator. Such an inverted value may be useful in certain applications. Furthermore, the ratiometric measurement operation disclosed herein may also be used as the sole operating mode of a ratiometric measuring instrument, if desired. Thus, while various preferred and exemplary embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same become better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 3A and 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
