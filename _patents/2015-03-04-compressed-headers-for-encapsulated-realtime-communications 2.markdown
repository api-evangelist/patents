title: Compressed headers for encapsulated real-time communications
abstract: A system performs tunneling for real time communication (“RTC”) between a source endpoint and a destination endpoint. The system receives, by a server, a request from a user equipment (“UE”) for enabling header compression of inner internet protocol (“IP”) and transport headers of media traffic encapsulated within a tunnel. The media traffic corresponds to the RTC between the source endpoint and the destination endpoint. The system determines a mapping that maps one or more indices to identifying information of the source endpoint and the destination endpoint, and sends a response to the UE including the mapping. Upon sending the response, the UE and the server communicate the media traffic according to the mapping, where the media traffic includes media packets in which inner IP and transport headers are replaced with an index within the one or more indices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["One embodiment is directed generally to a communications network, and in particular, to delivering real-time traffic over a communications network.","Many enterprises have moved from telephony services using the Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) (provided by a traditional telephone company) to telephony services using the Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) (provided by an IP Telephony service provider). Such services are commonly known as Voice over IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) or IP Telephony. IP Telephony uses an IP network (e.g., the Internet) as a backbone and can thus provide advanced features such as video conferencing, call recording, and call forwarding.","Recently, driven by the growing base of mobile data subscribers, ubiquitous Internet access, and high bandwidth that is now available in both fixed and mobile networks, advanced services accessed via the Internet (known as Over-the-Top (\u201cOTT\u201d) services) have become popular. However, while OTT services threaten traditional telephony offerings, innovative service providers are introducing their own OTT services, and must therefore overcome a number of unique challenges as they deploy and market these new services.","One embodiment is a system for tunneling of real time communication (\u201cRTC\u201d) between a source endpoint and a destination endpoint. The system receives, by a server, a request from a user equipment (\u201cUE\u201d) for enabling header compression of inner internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) and transport headers of media traffic encapsulated within a tunnel. The media traffic corresponds to the RTC between the source endpoint and the destination endpoint. The system determines a mapping that maps one or more indices to identifying information of the source endpoint and the destination endpoint, and sends a response to the UE including the mapping. Upon sending the response, the UE and the server communicate the media traffic according to the mapping, where the media traffic includes media packets in which inner IP and transport headers are replaced with an index within the one or more indices.","One embodiment provides efficient tunnels for real-time communications (\u201cRTC\u201d) services between a client and a tunneling server. In one embodiment, when redundant inner network and transport headers (corresponding to a fixed source and a fixed destination) are transmitted in packetized media traffic that is encapsulated within a tunnel, such headers are replaced by equivalent compressed headers which are understood by the client and the tunneling server. Accordingly, embodiments improve RTC throughput by providing efficient tunneling of media traffic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","114","122","102"]},"In performing RTC, UE  communicates media traffic (e.g., speech, video, etc.) with a media server  in service provider network . UE  also communicates signaling traffic with a signaling server within service provider network  according to an application layer protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d). SIP is a signaling communications protocol, conventionally used for controlling multimedia communication sessions such as voice and video calls over IP networks. SIP is configured to be independent of the underlying transport layer. Accordingly, SIP can run on different transport protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d), the User Datagram Protocol (\u201cUDP\u201d), etc. TCP is one of the core protocols of the IP suite and provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between programs running on computers connected to an IP network such as a local area network, an intranet, or the public Internet. A datagram is a basic transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network for which the delivery, arrival time, and order of arrival need not be guaranteed by the network. UDP is a protocol that uses a simple connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. Applications that do not require the reliability of a TCP connection may instead use UDP which emphasizes low-overhead operation and reduced latency rather than error checking and delivery validation.","Network  further includes a tunneling server  that, together with a tunneling client  within UE , provides functionality for establishing and managing tunnels for performing RTC according to the Tunneled Services Control Function (\u201cTSCF\u201d) standard as described in, for example, 3rd generation partnership program (\u201c3GPP\u201d) technical report (\u201cTR\u201d) 33.830 V0.5.0, the disclosure of which being incorporated herein by reference.","In general, using a tunnel for communication refers to using a delivery protocol to encapsulate a different payload protocol. The TSCF standard provides client side and server side network elements for establishing managed Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d) tunnels for performing RTC. TLS is a cryptographic protocol configured to provide communication security over the Internet. TLS is an Internet Engineering Task Force (\u201cIETF\u201d) standards track protocol as provided in, for example, IETF request for comments (\u201cRFC\u201d) 2246, RFC 4346, RFC 5246, and\/or RFC 6176.","In one embodiment, tunneling client  and tunneling server  establish and manage a TSCF tunnel  according to the TSCF standard. TSCF tunnel  encapsulates traffic within an outer protocol (e.g., TCP). In this embodiment, UE  may use TSCF tunnel  to traverse security devices (e.g., firewalls, proxies, etc.) and connect to tunneling server  to reach service provider network  for performing RTC. In one embodiment, UE  may execute a SIP based RTC application  that relies on a library such as the software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) provided by the \u201cTunneled Session Management Solution\u201d from Oracle Corp.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10","10","10","116","10","24"]},"System  includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor  coupled to bus  for processing information.

Table 1 provides example protocol layers when TSCF tunnel  is used for encapsulating and communicating UDP media traffic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example protocol layers when UDP traffic"},{"entry":"is encapsulated in a TSCF tunnel"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Application Data"]},{"entry":[{},"Inner UDP"]},{"entry":[{},"Inner IP"]},{"entry":[{},"Outer TCP"]},{"entry":[{},"Outer IP"]},{"entry":[{},"Ethernet"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"With these known systems, RTC media traffic (e.g., speech, video, etc.) inside TSCF tunnel  is usually communicated between fixed source and destination IP addresses and transport ports, and specific IP addresses are assigned to tunneling client  and tunneling server  when they establish, maintain, and terminate TSCF tunnel . However, such fixed IP addresses and transport ports are generally included in every single inner IP and transport header (typically 28 bytes).","One disadvantage with this known configuration is that the inclusion of highly redundant information in the inner IP and transport headers results in a waste of bandwidth. This bandwidth waste is further aggravated when very low bitrate codecs are used (i.e., when the amount of payload in each packet is very small). Examples of very low bitrate codecs that implement very small payloads (typically 12 bytes) are the Adaptive Multi Rate (\u201cAMR\u201d) codec and the International Telecommunication Union (\u201cITU\u201d) G.711 and G.723 Speech Codecs.","In contrast to the known systems, embodiments of the present invention allow for header compression at the inner UDP layer within a tunneling configuration. In one embodiment, the inner IP and transport headers are replaced with much shorter indices (typically 3 or 4 bytes each) in order to dramatically improve the overall transmission throughput of TSCF tunnel . One embodiment first detects redundancy in header transmission, and then adaptively enables or disables header compression accordingly and without client application intervention. Thus, embodiments reduce the required bandwidth for media communication (for example, 12% reduction in required bandwidth for a high bit rate codec such as the ITU G.711 codec, and 65% reduction in required bandwidth for a low bit rate codec such as the AMR codec). One embodiment provides a software application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) at UE  that allows for dynamic enabling\/disabling of the header compression functionality.","In one embodiment, the header compression functionality is provided based on a bi-directional mapping between each index and a corresponding sequence of inner IP and transport headers. That is, each index corresponds to a specific IP header and transport header (i.e., a sequence of headers), thus a one-to-one mapping is provided between an index and two headers. In one embodiment, the mapping functionality is implemented at a first compressed header module  at tunneling client  and a second compressed header module  at tunneling server . Based on the mapping, first compressed header module  and second compressed header module  perform mapping between IP and transport headers of the inner UDP of media traffic and corresponding indices.","For example, when a media packet is transmitted from UE  to tunneling server , first compressed header module  replaces the IP and transport headers of the inner UDP of the packet with a corresponding index according to the mapping received from tunneling client  for the corresponding RTC. Upon reception of the packet by tunneling server , second compressed header module  replaces the index with corresponding IP and transport headers according to the mapping. The same functionality is provided in the opposite direction when a media packet is transmitted from tunneling server  to UE .","In one embodiment, the mapping between the inner IP and transport headers and the corresponding indices is dynamically enabled and performed without intervention of application . For example, when tunneling client  and tunneling server  determine that media traffic is communicated between fixed endpoints, they enable header compression functionality for that communication by implementing a respective one of first compressed header module  and second compressed header module . Accordingly, the implementation of header compression functionality is transparent to application .","In one embodiment, the mapping between the inner IP and transport headers and the corresponding indices is based on a hash map. In one embodiment, TSCF tunnel  supports up to 256 individual mappings between indices and headers. That is, tunneling server  stores a table with 256 entries, where each entry relates an index to an IP header and a transport header (i.e., a sequence of IP and transport headers), thus providing a one-to-one mapping.","One embodiment provides control messages for communicating compressed header media traffic encapsulated within TSCF tunnel . According to the TSCF standard, control messages between tunneling clients and a tunneling server are of a \u201crequest\/response\u201d type, and a control message response for a request includes either a corresponding reply or an error code indicating why the request could not be honored. TSCF control messages utilize a Type Length Value (\u201cTLV\u201d) encoding. TLV is defined as the variable length concatenation of a unique Type (represented by an integer) and a Value containing the actual value identified by the Type.","One embodiment provides a TSCF service request control message to enable header compression functionality. In this embodiment, when RTC traffic endpoints have fixed IP address and transport ports, tunneling client  sends a TSCF client service request message of type \u201cEnable_Header_Compression\u201d to tunneling server , including TSCF client connection information TLVs that identify source and destination endpoints. Subsequently, tunneling server  maps this connection information (i.e., IP addresses and transport ports) into an index (for example, an 8-bit index) and sends a TSCF service response control message of type \u201cEnable_Header_Compression\u201d back to tunneling client , including a header compression index TLV that indicates the index value that tunneling client  should use to identify the corresponding sequence of headers. Thereafter, tunneling client  or tunneling server  communicate media traffic with inner IP and transport headers replaced with a compressed header (i.e., the index).","In one embodiment, the length of the compressed header is based on the payload size. In one non-limiting example embodiment, the compressed header is either 3 bytes or 4 bytes depending on the amount of data to be sent.

In the example configuration of Table 3, a 4-byte header is used for payload lengths between 256 and 65535 bytes.","One embodiment provides a TSCF service request control message to disable header compression functionality. In this embodiment, when UE  determines that this functionality needs to be terminated, tunneling client  sends a client service request control message of type \u201cDisable Header Compression\u201d to tunneling server  to remove the mapping between connection information and indices. This request includes a compression index TLV to indicate that the index needs to be removed.","One embodiment provides a number of TSCF TLVs for implementing client service request control messages of type \u201cEnable_Header_Compression\u201d and \u201cDisable_Header_Compression\u201d for enabling and disabling header compression, respectively. For example, this embodiment provides a TLV for implementing a client service request control message of type \u201cConnection_Info_IPv4\u201d to indicate source and destination IP addresses and ports of the subject endpoints. The client service response control messages to this request is of the same type and includes a \u201cHeader_Compression_Index\u201d TLV indicating the index to be used to compress the sequence of IP and transport headers. If tunneling server  is not configured to support this functionality, it responds to tunneling client  with a TLV indicating an error code (e.g., tsc_response_service_unavailable).","Table 4 provides examples TLVs for implementing TSCF service request and response control messages for implementing header compression according to some present embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"385pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example TLVs for implementing TSCF service request and response control"},{"entry":"messages for implementing header compression"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"SHORT\/",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["TLV Type",{},"LONG","VALUE"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["NAME","Value","SEMANTICS","FORMAT","TYPE","LENGTH","NOTES"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Connection_Info_IPv4","24","Client","Short","Octet",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Connection Info",{},"string"]},{"entry":["Connection_Info_IPv6","25","Client","Short","Octet"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Connection Info",{},"string"]},{"entry":["Service_Type","27","Service Type","Short","Unsigned","1 byte","Enable_Header_Compression = 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"integer",{},"Disable_Header_Compression = 2"]},{"entry":["Header_Compression_Index","33","Header","Short","Unsigned","1 byte"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Compression",{},"integer"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Index"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"One embodiment marks a network socket at UE  as a candidate source socket for header compression.

One embodiment determines whether traffic is communicated between a fixed source address\/transport and a fixed destination address\/transport, and automatically enables\/disables header compression functionality accordingly. Thus, when speech or video payloads are packetized and transmitted from a fixed source endpoint to a fixed destination endpoint, the compression of redundant header information results in efficient use of bandwidth. This gain is even more significant when smaller payloads (e.g., payloads of highly efficient low bit rate codecs such as AMR) are communicated. Accordingly, embodiments give the end user the possibility of improving the overall network performance and increasing the number of simultaneous serviceable tunnel clients for a fixed bandwidth. Further, embodiments improve the overall call quality by reducing network congestion.","Several embodiments are specifically illustrated and\/or described herein.
