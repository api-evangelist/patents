An alert application (or other software) residing on a client device  may be configured to notify the host that a conference (e.g., audio conference , an online conference, a virtual conference location , or other conference interface) has started and manages who has joined by showing the name and number of participants  via, for example, a push from the application. As participants join, the notification may maintain a count of the number of participants . It may also allow the host to quickly enter the conference from the application, modify settings prior to an audio conference  starting, and provide easy access to account numbers. The application may display, for example, an icon or other user interface control or feature in a system application tray of the client device , which exposes a menu or other functionality that enables users to modify certain settings, configurations, options, etc.","While the conference alert application is running, it communicates with the conferencing infrastructure using, for example, a conferencing API  (). The communications may comprise, for example, status checks of the user's conferencing bridges or locations to determine if there are any active participants . In the event that someone has entered the user's location or joined one of their bridges via a phone, this activity may be transmitted to the alert application as a status update. The update may include other information about the newly joined participant  such as the incoming phone number, email address, name, or other identifiable details (e.g., user-related information \u2014) that may determined using, for example a caller ID database.","The application alerts the user by displaying a message on a display of the client device . The message may appear for a pre-determined amount of time, which may be configurable in the application's settings. The content of the message may further include the details transmitted in the status update mentioned above. The message display may also provide a mechanism for the user to acknowledge the message by either cancelling or joining a location. If the user chooses to cancel a particular message, subsequent messages will appear as new members join a location or audio bridge, with a running tally indicating the total number of participants. If the user chooses to join their own location, the alerts will cease until the event has ended.","The in-conference participant identification module(s)  generally support various techniques for developing and operating a database (e.g., participant ID database \u2014) for identifying participants in an audio conference . The conferencing system  and\/or servers  may employ caller identification (ID) databases to capture information about who has dialed into, or otherwise accessed, the audio conference . For callers who dial in without joining via a web presence, the system can capture the dial-in number (ANI). There are numerous databases that store information such as name, location, etc. about that ANI. In order to better identify the caller in the audio conference , data may be pulled from various databases and made visible in the virtual conference location . Once obtained, that data may be stored to be used when that caller dials-in again. In this manner, the virtual conference location application  may create and manage a proprietary caller ID database  () for participants , which may provide more information about them.","As illustrated in the embodiment of , the virtual conference location application  may obtain information about participants  by sending a request  to the client device(s)  or otherwise enabling the participants  to submit information  (either about themselves or other participants ) to the virtual conference location application . For example, the GUI  () may include various UI mechanisms for enabling the user to provide the information . During the audio conference , a participant  may recognize an unidentified participant's voice and provide appropriate contact information, which may then be stored in the database  via interface . Participants  may also specify additional information about themselves by, for example, supplementing user info  () or providing new information. This information may be specified manually or the participants  may authorize the server  to access user information stored in remote servers. For example, a participant  may authorize the server  to access data stored on a social networking site  (), or the information may automatically be obtained via, for example, search engine(s)  based on the currently-available user info . As illustrated in , user information may be obtained from caller ID databases  (or other server(s)) via requests  and responses  between the server  and the databases . The information obtained from the databases  or servers may be stored in the participant identification database  (via interface ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 37","b":["3700","114","3702","104","114","102","106","104","114","102","106","104","102","104","114"]},"At decision block , the conferencing system  may determine whether the participant  is joining the audio conference  via an incoming voice call. If the participant  is not joining the audio conference  via an incoming voice call (e.g., the participant is joining via a web presence), the system may request that the participant  provide participant profile information (block ). The participant profile information may comprise any desirable parameters identifying the participant  or other information related to the participant  (e.g., the parameters identified in the exemplary screen shots of ). At block , the conferencing system  receives the specified parameters and, at block , stores them in a database (e.g., database ).  illustrates an embodiment of a data structure  for storing various participant profile parameters associated with a particular participant . Each participant  in an audio conference  may be identified with a unique participant identifier  and may include any of the following, or other, parameters; a name ; a title ; an email address ; a phone number ; a resident and\/or home address ; a current location  (which may be obtained by GPS coordinates from the client device, from an IP address, etc.); social networking profile parameters ; a graphical representation  (); a virtual location view  (); and conference applications  that the participant  has purchased, selected, or are otherwise accessible to the participant during an audio conference .","At block , the conferencing system  may present a conference user interface to the computing device  associated with the participant  (as well as the other devices\/participants in the audio conference ).

The audio indicator  comprises a user interface control that indicates when the participant  is speaking. In this regard, each participant identifier  may have a corresponding audio indicator . In an embodiment, the conference user interface may be configured as a virtual conference location , as described above, although it should be appreciated that the term conference user interface or conference interface refers to any graphical user interface associated with the audio conference , an online conference, or any other conference, which presents information, data, multimedia, etc. and\/or functionality or applications (e.g., conferencing applications ) to the participants.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 40","FIGS. 9-14","FIG. 38"],"b":["4000","4002","4004","104","4004","4002","124","4004","4102","4104","4106","3820","4108","4102","104","4004","128","108"]},"The profile information  may comprise one or more of the participant profile parameters. The audio indicator  visually identifies when the associated participant  is speaking during the audio conference . By monitoring the audio streams  for certain audio characteristics, the conferencing system  may determine when a participant  is speaking. The audio stream  may be logically mapped to the corresponding audio indicator  according to the participant identifier  and\/or the audio indicator identifier  (). When a participant is speaking, the audio indicator  may be displayed in a first visual state (), such as, by graying out the audio indicator . When the participant  is speaking, the audio indicator  may be displayed in a second visual state (), such as, by blacking out the audio indicator . It should be appreciated that any visual and\/or audio distinctions may be employed to identify a speaking participant in the conference interface.","The business card component  comprises a user interface control that, when selected, displays further information about the participant . The business card component  may trigger the display of any additional participant profile parameters. In the embodiment illustrated in , the business card component  \u201cflips\u201d the object  to display additional parameters . As further illustrated in and at block  (), the object  may further comprise a participant profile control , which comprises a user interface control for enabling the participants  to edit their own, or another participant's, participant profile parameters during the audio conference .","Referring again to , if the participant  is joining the audio conference  via an incoming voice call (decision block ), a caller ID database, resource, or service may be used to automatically identify the originating telephone number (block ). If an originating telephone number is not available, the participant  may be added to the audio conference  and displayed in the conference user interface as an unidentified participant (). Where an originating telephone number is available, at decision block , the number may be used as an input to a look-up table, database, service, etc. to determine additional information. In an embodiment, the originating telephone number may reference a stored participant profile, such as, the data structure  (). If additional information is not available (either in a stored participant profile or a response ), the participant  may be identified in the conference user interface based on the originating telephone number and the associated audio indicator . Regardless the availability of participant information, telephone numbers, etc., at block , the objects  may be presented with the participant profile edit control .","It should be appreciated that the participant profile control  provides a convenient mechanism for enabling participants  to specify, during the audio conference , additional profile information about themselves and\/or other participants  via the conference user interface. In this manner, the conferencing system  may develop a proprietary database (e.g., participant database ) for identifying participants .  illustrates an embodiment of a simplified method for operating the participant profile control  to develop or supplement a participant database . At block , a first participant  and a second participant  join an audio conference . At block , the conference user interface displays an object  associated with the first and second participants . The objects  may comprise no profile information (i.e., an unidentified participant) or any level of profile details, as described above. Regardless the existence of, or level of, profile information, each object  displays a corresponding audio indicator  to indicate when the participant  is speaking. Each object  may further display a corresponding participant profile control  for specifying information about the participant . The participant profile control  may be selected (decision block ) by any participant  in the audio conference , enabling participants  to specify information about themselves or any of the other participants. This mechanism may be particularly useful when, for example, the participant  is an unidentified participant, the participant  specified minimal information at log-in, or there is otherwise minimal and\/or incorrect profile information.","For example, assume that a first participant  is an unidentified participant. During the audio conference , a second participant  may recognize the identity of the first participant  based on the speaker's voice and the state of the audio indicator  in the object . The second participant  may select the participant profile edit control  in the object  associated with the first participant . In response, the conference user interface  may enable the second participant  to specify profile parameters, such as those described above. When selected, the conference user interface may prompt the participant  to enter known parameters. In another embodiment, the conference user interface may be configured to enable the second participant  to specify information via, for example, a search engine results page, a local or remote contact application, a social networking system, or any other source of profile information. At block , the specified profile parameters may be linked to the participant identifier  (). At block , the conferencing system  receives the specified profile parameters and, at block , stores the parameters in the participant database , according to the participant identifier . At block , the specified parameters may be added or updated to the participant object  displayed in the conference user interface.","Referring again to  and the various modules located in the server memory , the location-based services module(s)  comprise the logic and\/or functionality for supporting various location-based services provided by the conferencing system . As illustrated in the embodiment of , the location-based module(s)  may receive location information from the client devices  (arrow ). It should be appreciated that the location information may be obtained in various ways. As described below in more detail, when a participant  joins an audio conference , an online conference, or otherwise accesses the conferencing system , the location information may be captured from GPS information, caller ID, IP address, sign-in profiles, etc.","The client device  may include a GPS transceiver that acquires GPS signals. When the client device  accesses the conferencing system , the GPS coordinates may be passed to the location-based module(s) . The conferencing system  may also obtain caller ID information in the manner described herein. The caller ID information may be automatically obtained by the conferencing system  when the participant  joins an audio conference . The conferencing system  may perform various look-ups to determine the location associated with the telephone number. The conferencing system  may translate the area code into a corresponding geographic area. In other embodiments, the conferencing system  may use the telephone numbers as an input to a look-up table, web service query, etc. to determine if there is an associated location. The location may be a stored current location associated with a participant identifier (e.g., current location \u2014). The stored current location may be a previously stored location specified by a user or acquired as described herein. The conferencing system  may also query the client device  for (or otherwise obtain) an IP address of the client, which may be used to determine the current location of the device.","In additional embodiments, the location information may be obtained from the participant's social networking data via a request  and response  to a social networking system  (). For example, as described below, the participant may be a member of the social networking system  and provide location information to a communication channel  (). This information may be automatically acquired by the social networking system  from the client device , or specified by the user. Regardless of the manner in which the location information is acquired by the social networking system , it should be appreciated that the conferencing system  may obtain this information via the API  and associated social networking integration module(s)  (), as described below.","As illustrated in , the conferencing system  may implement various software mechanisms to obtain the location information from the client device . In the embodiment of , the conferencing system  comprises a Participant Manager Service , a Location Service , and a Caller ID Service . In operation, the computing device  may access the conferencing system  by visiting a particular web site. The Participant Manager Service  may send a getClientIPAddress( ) message  to the computing device . In response, the client device  may send a ClientIP response  containing an IP address associated with the device. It should be appreciated that the IP address may be associated with the client device  or other communication devices associated with the client device . The Participant Manager Service  may send a getLocationbyIP( ) request  to the Location Service , which returns a response  to the client device . The response  may specify location according to, for example, latitude and longitude, or any other means.","In another embodiment, the client device  may access the conferencing system  and send a Login Request  to the Participant Manager Service . The Participant Manager Service  may authenticate the participant . If the login is successful, the Participant Manager Service  may send a getClientPhoneNumber( ) request  to the client device . The participant  may provide the information via, for example, a conferencing user interface, such as those described herein or others.","The entered telephone number may be provided to the Participant Manager Service  as a PhoneNumber response . The Participant Manager Service  may send a getLocationbyPhoneNumber( ) request  to the Caller ID Service , which contains the entered phone number. The Caller ID Service  may provide corresponding location information to the client device in a response .","It should be appreciated that additional information may be requested from the client device . For example, the Participant Manager Service  may send a getClientCurrentLocation( ) request , and receive a City\/State response  containing the entered city, state, zipcode, etc. The Participant Manger Service  may send a getLocationByCity( ) request  (which may include any of the entered information) to the Location Service . The Location Service  may provide corresponding location information to the client device in a response . Regardless of the manner in which the location information is obtained, the client device  may send a getMapParticipantLocation( ) request  to a map service . The map service  may return a showMapWithParticipantDetails response . The conferencing system  may perform this process for each participant  and then present the combined location information in a map view . An exemplary embodiment of a map view  is illustrated in , although it should be appreciated that the location information may be presented in the conference interface in any manner.","Based on the location information, the conference interface may customize the presentation of the interface with location-based information associated with one or more participants . For example, the conferencing system  may provide a unique conference interface to each participant  based on the participant's corresponding location. The customization may involve providing location-based resources, services, functionality, etc. to the participant  (e.g., news, weather, traffic, events, etc.). Furthermore, in some embodiments, a virtual location view  may be selected by the conferencing system  to match the location information obtained from the participant  (e.g., a participant  in San Francisco may be presented a virtual location view  including the Golden Gate Bridge).","In further embodiments, the location information may be used to provide an intelligent conference dial-out and\/or dial-in feature, which dynamically provides guidance to the participants  on how to join the audio conference  (e.g., via a login screen  () or setup screens  ()) or automatically configures an appropriate dial-out from the conferencing system  to the participant . When a participant  accesses the conferencing system , the location information may be obtained. Based on the participant location, the conferencing system  may recommend a dial-in number, taking into consideration customer data and\/or voice plans and carrier provider rates, or automatically determine a desirable dial-out number.

In the embodiment of , the conferencing system  is configured in the manner described above, and comprises one or more servers , social networking integration module(s) , a conference interface, and one or more datastore(s) . As described below in more detail, the social networking integration module(s)  enable the conferencing system  to communicate with the social networking system  via, for example, an application programming interface (API) . The conferencing system  and\/or the social networking system  may access data, applications, or any other stored content or functionality associated with the respective systems.","It should be appreciated that the social networking integration module(s)  may be configured to interface with any desirable social networking system . However, to illustrate the general principles of the integrated systems, various exemplary embodiments of a social networking system  will be described.","The social networking system  generally comprises one or more server(s)  for providing a social networking website  to client devices  via, for example, a client or web browser . The social networking system  may expose an application program interface (API)  to other computer systems, such as, the conferencing system . The API  enables third party applications to access data, applications, or any other stored content or functionality provided by the social networking system  to members .","The social networking system  offers its members  the ability to communicate and interact with other members  of the social network. Members  may join the social networking system  and then add connections to a number of other members  to whom they desire to be connected. Connections may be explicitly added by a member . For example, the member  may select a particular other member  to be a friend, or the social networking system  may automatically recommend or create connections based on common characteristics of the members (e.g., members who are alumni of the same educational institution, organization, etc.). As used herein, the term \u201cfriend\u201d refers to any other member to whom a member has formed a connection, association, or relationship via the social networking system . Connections in social networks are usually in both directions, but need not be, so the terms \u201cmember,\u201d \u201cfriend,\u201d or \u201cfollower\u201d may depend on the frame of reference. For example, if Bob and Joe are both members and connected to each other in the website, Bob and Joe, both members, are also each other's friends. The connection between members  may be a direct connection. However, some embodiments of a social networking system  may allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections. It should be appreciated that the term friend does not require that the members  are friends in real life. It simply implies a connection in the social networking system .","The social networking system  may be implemented in various types of computer systems. The implementation of the social networking system  may provide mechanisms for members  to communicate with each other, form connections with each other, store information, and share objects of interest, among other things. The implementations described below include a social networking website  that interacts with members  at client devices  via a communication network , such as a web-based interface (e.g., via the browser ). However, other implementations are possible, such as one or more servers  that communicate with clients using various client and server applications (e.g., non-web-based applications). Furthermore, the social networking system  may not include any centralized server, but rather may be implemented as, for example, a peer-to-peer system with peer-to-peer applications running on the client devices  that allow members  to communicate and perform other functions. One example is a peer-to-peer network of smart phones communicating via Short Message Service (SMS) over a cellular network.

These items may include groups or social networks (a social network refers not to physical communication networks but rather to social networks of people) to which members  may belong, events or calendar entries in which a member  might be interested, computer-based applications that a member  may use via the social networking website , and transactions that allow members  to buy, sell, auction, rent, or exchange items via the social networking website . These are just a few examples of the items upon which a member  may act on the social networking website , and many others are possible.","As illustrated in the embodiment of , the social networking website  maintains a number of objects for the different kinds of items with which a member  may interact on the social networking website . In one embodiment, these objects include member profiles , group objects , event objects , application objects  (respectively, hereinafter, referred to as profiles , groups , events , and applications ). In one embodiment, an object is stored by the social networking website  for each instance of its associated item. For example, a member profile  is stored for each member  who joins the social networking website , a group  is stored for each group defined in the social networking website , and so on. The types of objects and the data stored for each is described in more detail below.","The member  of the social networking website  may take specific actions on the social networking website , where each action is associated with one or more objects. The types of actions that a member  may perform in connection with an object are defined for each object and may depend on the type of item represented by the object. A particular action may be associated with multiple objects. Described below are a number of examples of particular types of objects that may be defined for the social networking website , as well as a number of actions that may be taken for each object. The objects and actions are provided for illustration purposes only, and one or ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that an unlimited number of variations and features may be provided on the social networking website .","The social networking website  maintains a member profile  for each member of the website . Any action that a particular member  takes with respect to another member  is associated with each member's profile , through information maintained in a database or other data repository, such as the action log  (). The tracked actions may include, for example, adding a connection to the other member , sending a message to the other member, reading a message from the other member , viewing content associated with the other member , attending an event posted by another member , among others. In addition, a number of actions described below in connection with other objects may be directed at particular members , in which case these actions may be associated with those members , as well.","A group  may be defined for a group or network of members . For example, a member  may define a group to be a fan club for a particular band. The social networking website  would maintain a group  for that fan club, which might include information about the band, media content (e.g., songs or music videos) by the band, and discussion boards on which members  of the group may comment about the band. In this regard, member actions that are possible with respect to a group  may include joining the group, viewing the content, listening to songs, watching videos, and posting a message on the discussion board.","An event  may be defined for a particular event, such as a birthday party. A member  may create the event  by defining information about the event, such as the time and place and a list of invitees. Other members  may accept the invitation, comment about the event, post their own content (e.g., pictures from the event), and perform any other actions enabled by the social networking website  for the event . The creator of the event , as well as the invitees for the event, may perform various actions that are associated with that event .","The social networking website  also enables members  to add applications  to their profiles. These applications provide enhanced content and interactivity within the social networking website , which maintains an application object  for each application hosted in the social networking system. The applications may be provided by the social networking system , the conferencing system , and\/or by third party developers. The social networking system  and the conferencing system  may share applications between the respective computer systems. The use of any functionality offered by the application may constitute an action by the member  in connection with the application . The actions may be passive and need not require active participation by a member . The scope and type of applications provided is limited only by the imagination and creativity of the application developers. The applications are generally written as server-side code that is run on servers of the social networking website , although in other embodiments an application may also use client-side code as appropriate, or any combination thereof. When a member  logs into the social networking website site , the system determines which applications the user has installed (e.g., registered for, purchased, etc.), and then loads and runs such applications in combination with the underlying functionality of the social networking website .","When a member  takes an action on the social networking website , the action is recorded in an action log . In one embodiment, the social networking website  maintains the action log  as a database of entries. When an action is taken, the social networking website  may add an entry for that action to the log . The action loc  may maintain any of the following or other types of information: a timestamp of when the action occurred; an identifier for the member  who performed the action; an identifier for the member  to whom the action was directed; an identifier for the type of action performed; an identifier for an object acted on by the action (e.g., an application); and content associated with the action. It should be appreciated that many types of actions that are possible in the social networking website  need not require all of this information.","The social networking website  generally comprises a computing system that allows members  to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content and\/or functionality as described herein. The social networking website  stores member profiles  in, for example, a member profile store . A member profile  may describe the member, including biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or preferences, location, and the like. The social networking website  further stores data describing one or more relationships between different members . The relationship information may indicate members  who have similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history. The social networking website  may include member-defined relationships between different members , allowing members  to specify their relationships with other members . For example, member-defined relationships may allow members  to generate relationships with other members  that parallel real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. Members  may select from predefined types of relationships, or define their own relationship types as needed.","To further illustrate the manner in which the conferencing system  may share data and\/or applications with a social networking system,  shows a block diagram of the social networking website . In this embodiment, the social networking website  includes a web server , an action logger , an action log , a member profile store , an application data store , a group store , and an event store. In other embodiments, the social networking website  may include additional, fewer, or different modules for various applications. Conventional components such as network interfaces, security mechanisms, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system.","The web server(s)  link the social networking website  via the network  to the client devices . The web server  serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as, for example, Java, Flash, XML, and so forth. The web server  may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking website , the client devices , and the conferencing system . The messages can be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging technique, using any suitable protocol(s).","The action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about member actions on and\/or off the social networking website . The action logger  populates the action log  with information about member actions to track them.","As discussed above, the social networking website  maintains data about a number of different types of objects with which a member may interact on the social networking website . In this regard, each of the member profile store , application data store , the group store , and the event store  stores instances of the corresponding type of object(s) maintained by the social networking website . Each object type has information fields that are suitable for storing information appropriate to the type of object. For example, the event store  may contain data structures that include the time and location for an event, whereas the member profile store  may contain data structures with fields suitable for describing a member's profile . When a new object of a particular type is created, the social networking website  may initialize a new data structure of the corresponding type, assign a unique object identifier to it, and begin to add data to the object as needed.","Having described exemplary embodiments of a social networking system  with which the conferencing system  may share data and\/or functionality, the operation of additional embodiments of the social networking integration module(s)  will be described with reference to .  illustrates another embodiment of a graphical user interface  for presenting the audio conference  and the conference interface to participants . The graphical user interface  may comprise a first portion , a second portion , and a third portion . The conference interface may be presented in the first portion.

The alert\/notification functionality generally comprises logic for monitoring an audio conference  and the content\/functionality presented in the conference interface and providing alerts, notifications, or other messages (collectively referred to as \u201calerts\u201d) to the participant . An alert may comprise audio, video, text, graphics, or other information embodied in any medium and presentable via hardware and\/or software components supported by the computing device, including, a browser , an operating system , a GUI , a microphone, and a display, such as, for example, a touchscreen .","In the embodiment illustrated in , the alert\/notification functionality comprises a conferencing notification application  residing in memory  on a client device  () and executed by processor(s) . It should be appreciated that the logic associated with the conferencing notification application  may be located at, and\/or controlled by, the conferencing system  or other computer devices, systems, etc.","In general operation, the conferencing notification application  may provide alerts based on various events monitored by the conferencing system . For instance, the conferencing notification application  may notify a host when an audio conference  or conference has started and alert the host to who has joined the audio conference  or accessed the conference by showing, for example, the participant name, the number of current participants, etc. The alerts may be implemented using a push methodology by which the alerts are \u201cpushed\u201d from the conferencing system , a pull methodology by which the alerts are \u201cpulled\u201d from the conferencing system  by the computing device  using, for example, the conferencing API , or other alert protocols, services, methodologies, etc. As participants  join the audio conference  or the associated conference, the conferencing system  maintains a counter of the number and identity of participants  and provides related or other information to the host. The conferencing notification application  may also enable the host to conveniently access the conference interface from within the application (e.g., via a menu, key shortcut, or other user interface control), as well as modify conferencing, notification or account settings prior to or during a virtual conference.","The conferencing notification application  may incorporate a user interface control for enabling users to launch the application or conveniently access certain functions or features of the application (e.g., configure remote or local settings, join a virtual conference, etc.).

When an object, such as a finger, presses down on a point on the panel's outer surface the two metallic layers become connected at that point. The touchscreen panel then behaves as a pair of voltage dividers with connected outputs. This causes a change in the electrical current which is registered as a touch event and sent to a controller (e.g., processor ) for processing.","The touchscreen display  may be implemented using surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology that uses ultrasonic waves that pass over the touchscreen panel. When the panel is touched, a portion of the wave is absorbed. This change in the ultrasonic waves registers the position of the touch event and sends this information to the processor .","In another embodiment, the touchscreen display  supports capacitive sensing via a capacitive touchscreen panel. A capacitive touchscreen panel comprises an insulator, such as glass, coated with a transparent conductor, such as indium tin oxide. As the human body is also a conductor, touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the local electrostatic field, measurable as a change in capacitance. Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location may be passed to the processor , which may calculate how the user's touch or gestures relate to the particular functions of the conferencing notification application .","The touchscreen display  may also support surface capacitance implementations, in which only one side of the insulator is coated with a conductive layer. In such implementations, a small voltage is applied to the layer, resulting in a uniform electrostatic field. When a conductor, such as a human finger, touches the uncoated surface, a capacitor is dynamically formed. The sensor controller may determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the capacitance as measured from the four corners of the display area .","In a further embodiment, the touchscreen display  implements a projected capacitive touch (PCT) display having an etched conductive layer. An XY array may be formed by, for example, etching a single layer to form a grid pattern of electrodes or by etching two separate perpendicular layers of conductive material with parallel lines or tracks to form the grid. Applying voltage to the array creates a grid of capacitors. Bringing a finger or conductive stylus close to the surface of the sensor changes the local electrostatic field. The capacitance change at every individual point on the grid may be measured to accurately determine the touch location. The use of a grid permits a higher resolution than resistive technology and also allows multi-touch operation. The PCT display may allow operation without direct contact, such that the conducting layers can be coated with further protective insulating layers, and operate even under screen protectors.","The touchscreen display  may be configured to optically sense touch using, for example, an array of infrared (IR) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on two adjacent bezel edges of a display, with photosensors placed on the two opposite bezel edges to analyze the system and determine a touch event. The LED and photosensor pairs may create a grid of light beams across the display. An object (such as a finger or pen) that touches the screen interrupts the light beams, causing a measured decrease in light at the corresponding photosensors. The measured photosensor outputs can be used to locate a touch-point coordinate.","Another embodiment of the touchscreen technology involves dispersive signal technology, which uses sensors to detect the mechanical energy in the glass that occurs due to a touch. Algorithms stored in memory  and executed by processor  interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch.","Acoustic pulse recognition may also be used to detect the touch. In this embodiment, two piezoelectric transducers are located at some positions of the screen to turn the mechanical energy of a touch (i.e., vibration) into an electronic signal. The screen hardware then uses an algorithm to determine the location of the touch based on the transducer signals.","Referring again to , the mobile telephone  includes a microphone  and various hardware keys, including, for example, a scroll button  for navigating the GUI . The mobile telephone  includes a notification bar  for displaying system information, such as, signal strength icon , battery level icon , or any other system of application information. The notification bar  may be expandable based on touch input to display additional notification icons.","Regardless of the type and configuration of the computing device , the conferencing notification application  may be accessed by selecting the user interface control. For example, a user may select the user interface control  () to display a conferencing notification menu  ().

In the embodiment of , conferencing notification menu  displays an iMeet Now button , a Manage Account button , a Notification Settings button , a Conference Scheduler button , a Help button , and an About button .","The iMeet Now button  may enable the user to connect to the conferencing system . When the user selects the button , the conferencing notification application  may launch the browser  and enable the user to join an audio conference  and access the conference user interface . The Manage Account button  may enable the user to configure the account profile  (). In an embodiment, the user may configure the parameters via the conferencing notification application , and the parameters subsequently provided to the conferencing system  via the conferencing API . In alternative embodiments, the Manage Account button  may direct the user to a web page provided by the conferencing system , which receives the configuration parameters. The Notification Settings button  may operate in a similar manner to enable the user to configure parameters associated with the conferencing notification. For example, the conferencing notification parameters may specify any of the following, or other, parameters: alert push enabled\/disabled; alert pull enabled\/disabled; alert frequency; and alert types.","In operation, the conferencing notification application  may communicate with the conferencing system  using conferencing API(s) . The conferencing API(s)  may enable the conferencing notification application  to submit requests  to, and receive responses  from, the conferencing system . These communications may include, for example, status checks of the user's conferences to determine if there are any active participants . In the event that someone has entered the user's conference or joined one of their bridges via a phone, this activity may be transmitted to the conferencing notification application  as a status update or alert.
