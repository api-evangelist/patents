The Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field","Aspects of the present teachings relate to multi-filter chemical speciation samplers to collect particulate matter (PM) fractions from ambient air, and virtual impaction particle separation inlets for the same.","2. Description of the Related Art","Airborne particulate matter (PM) is one of the major components of air pollution. PM includes microscopic particles in the air that are generally classified by size as being coarse PM or fine PM. The fine PM includes particles having an aerodynamic diameter (AD) of less than 2.5 microns (\u03bcm), and the coarse PM includes particles having an AD of between 2.5 and 10 \u03bcm.","PM can be released directly to the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources, such as, industrial smokestacks, automobile tailpipes, wood burning, road dust, wind blown dust, and biological materials (spores and pollen), for example. PM can also form in the atmosphere from chemical reactions involving other pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide (SO), nitrogen oxides (NO), ammonia (NH), and volatile organic compounds (VOC).","Large particles (>10 \u03bcm AD) are generally filtered out by the nose. Middle-size or coarse particles (2.5 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm AD) are deposited in the upper airways, where they can impact on surfaces in the throat, larynx and upper branches of the lungs. Coarse PM may consist of several potentially toxic components, such as resuspended particulate matter from paved and unpaved roads, industrial materials, brake linings, tire residues, trace metals, and bio-aerosols. A considerable portion of these particles may be deposited in the upper airways and to a lesser extent into the lower airways, and may be responsible for the exacerbation of asthma and other respiratory disease. Recent data from a small number of epidemiological studies indicate that, apart from, or in addition to, the fine PM, health effects may also be closely associated with the coarse PM, to an even larger extent than to the fine PM. In vitro studies with human monocytes have shown that cellular toxicity and inflammation may also be associated with the coarse PM and its biological components.","In addition, fine PM reaches the alveoli, where it must be dealt with by macrophages from the immune system. Fine PM can be inhaled deep into the lungs and reach the critical areas where the cells replenish the blood with oxygen. They can cause breathing and respiratory symptoms, irritation, inflammation and damage to the lungs. Health studies have shown significant associations between exposure to fine PM and premature death from heart or lung disease. Fine PM also aggravates heart and lung diseases and has been linked to effects, such as cardiovascular symptoms, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, heart attacks, respiratory symptoms, asthma attacks, and bronchitis. These effects can result in increased hospital admissions, emergency room visits, absences from school or work, and restricted activity days. Individuals that may be particularly sensitive to fine PM exposure include people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children.","Accordingly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published rules setting forth air quality designations and classifications for fine PM, pursuant to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The U.S. EPA has recently considered (2006) rules for coarse PM but at that time the lack of evidence associating coarse particles to health effects was lacking. The U.S. EPA will likely consider a PMc standard in the next round of NAAQS. To support this effort and learn more about PMc and health effects, the U.S. EPA is developing a coarse particle chemical speciation network, where the material collected on filters will be analyzed in the laboratory for different chemical components. Despite the growing evidence of particulate-related health effects, the paucity of information about specific biological mechanisms, associated with both fine and coarse particles, remains a critical missing link.","Accordingly, a need exists for size-fractionating PM from ambient air, separating the fractionated PM into coarse and fine fractions, and then further separating the coarse fraction into coarse aliquots collected on separate filters, which can be separately analyzed.","Aspects of the present teachings relate to virtual impaction particle separation inlet comprising: a housing having a bottom, a collection tube that extends through the bottom, and collection apertures formed in the bottom, arranged around the collection tube; a first plate disposed on top of the housing, having acceleration nozzles disposed in a generally circular pattern; a second plate disposed in the housing below the first plate, having a central aperture disposed on a first end the collection tube, and separation apertures disposed around the central aperture, aligned with corresponding ones of the acceleration nozzles.","According to aspects of the present teachings, when a partial vacuum is applied to the housing, ambient air including particulate matter (PM) flows through the acceleration nozzles and is divided into a major stream and a minor stream.","According to aspects of the present teachings, the major stream flows through the central aperture and into the collection tube, and the majority of the PM in the major stream have a smaller aerodynamic diameter (AD) than that of the majority of the PM in the minor stream.","According to aspects of the present teachings, the second stream flows through the separation apertures and into the collection apertures, and at least about 90% of the fine PM in the particles in the second stream have an AD of more than about 10 \u03bcm. Ten percent of the particles less than 10 \u03bcm AD, for example, flow with the second air stream into the collection apertures. In addition, 100% of the coarse particles flow with the second air stream into the collection apertures.","Aspects of the present teachings relate to multi-filter chemical speciation sampler comprising: an inlet to fractionate PM having an AD of less than about 10 \u03bcm, for example, from other PM in ambient air, greater than about 10 \u03bcm AD, for example; a virtual impaction separator to further fractionate the fractionated PM entering the sampler, into a course fraction and a fine fraction; a first separation assembly to divide the course fraction into coarse aliquots, comprising first filters to collect each of the coarse aliquots; a second separation assembly to divide the fine fraction into fine aliquots, comprising second filters to collect each of the fine aliquots.","Additional aspects and\/or advantages of the present teachings will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present teachings.","Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The exemplary embodiments are described below, in order to explain the aspects of the present teachings, by referring to the figures.","As used herein, \u201cflow rate\u201d refers to a volumetric airflow rate, but mass flow also can be applied. Particulate matter (PM) sizes are expressed in microns (\u03bcm), and refer to particulate aerodynamic diameter (AD), as conventionally used in the art. In addition, as referred to herein, \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d refer to an airflow direction through a device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10","10","10"]},"The inlet  includes a housing , a first plate  disposed on an upstream end of the housing , and a second plate  disposed within the housing , downstream of the first plate . The housing  includes a collection tube  that extends through a central portion of the bottom of the housing . A plurality of collection apertures  are formed in the bottom of the housing , which are arranged around the collection tube . For example, from 4 to 16 collection apertures  may be formed in the bottom of the housing .","While not required in all aspects, the inlet  includes a precipitation guard , to prevent precipitants from entering the housing . The precipitation guard  includes first and second shields , , which are spaced apart, so as allow ambient air to flow therebetween and enter the inlet . The precipitation guard  also includes debris screens  disposed between the first and second shields , . The inlet  also includes an optional adapter  attached to the downstream end of the collection tube . The adaptor  can facilitate the connection of the inlet  to, for example, a standard high volume air sampler (not shown). However, it is understood that the precipitation guard  as shown, may be replaced by a precipitation guard different of different geometry, and the adaptor  may be optional and need not be included in all aspects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["30","30","20","20","32"]},"The acceleration nozzles  can each include a conical portion A and a cylindrical portion B that extends from the conical portion A. The acceleration nozzles  are disposed in an annular arrangement, such that the adjacent conical portions A contact one another and form an acute angle (knife edge), on the upstream surface of the first plate . The walls of the conical portions A can be disposed at, for example, an angle of approximately 40 degrees, with respect to the walls of the cylindrical portions B. The cylindrical portions B are disposed in an annular arrangement on the downstream surface of the first plate . There may be a smooth transition between the conical portions A and the cylindrical portions B, rather than the shown abrupt transition. In addition, while the first plate  is shown as being circular, the first plate  can have any other suitable shape, such that PM entering the inlet  from positions equidistant to the collection tube .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":["40","40","44","42","44","40","42","32","42","22","32","42","40","40"]},"Referring again to , the second plate  is disposed in the housing , such that the central aperture  is aligned with an upstream end of the collection tube . The second plate  is disposed downstream of the first plate , such that each of the separation apertures  is aligned with (paired) a corresponding acceleration nozzle . In particular, the separation apertures  can directly or partially face the corresponding acceleration nozzles . In other words, the separation apertures  are centrally aligned with the corresponding acceleration nozzles . The inlet  can include any number of pairs of the separation apertures  and acceleration nozzles . For example, the inlet  can include from 2 to 36 pairs of the separation apertures  and acceleration nozzles .","When a partial vacuum is applied to the housing  (such as through use of a pump), the ambient air is drawn into the housing  through the acceleration nozzles . As the air is draw through the acceleration nozzles , the velocity thereof is increased, thereby increasing the inertia of PM included in the air, in proportion to the mass thereof. The air flow through the acceleration nozzles  may be laminar or turbulent.","The air is then split into major and minor streams. The major stream flows through the central aperture  and into the collection tube . The major stream generally includes from 90-98% of the total air flow into the inlet . The minor stream flows through the separation apertures  and into the collection apertures . Smaller PM (AD of less than about 10 \u03bcm) is primarily confined to the major air stream, and larger PM (AD of more than about 10 \u03bcm) is generally confined to the minor air stream, due to differences in the inertia thereof. In other words, the inlet  has a DP50 cut point of about 10 \u03bcm, as described herein. However, as discussed below, the Dp50 cut point can be adjusted, by adjusting the design parameters of the inlet . For example, the DP50 cut point can be from 1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, in some embodiments. In addition, all of the larger PM enters the collection apertures . In addition, a small amount (10% or less) of the smaller PM may also enter the collection apertures . However, substantially none of the larger PM enters the collection tube .","The collection tube  may be connected to an air sampler (not shown), to collect the PM in the major stream. The collection apertures  can also be connected to an air sampler, to collect the PM in the minor stream. Alternatively, the collection apertures  can be connected to one or more vacuum pumps, which can simply exhaust the minor stream. The air samplers\/pumps can be used to apply the partial vacuum to the housing . A single pump and corresponding flow controllers can be used to create both the minor and major flow streams.","Efficient separation of the particles can occur, when a ratio of the diameter Dj of the cylindrical portions B to the diameter Dc of the separation apertures  ranges from about 1 to 1.5 and in particular, is about 1.33, for example. The lengths of the conical portions A and the cylindrical portions B (taken in a thickness direction of the first plate ) can be approximately equal, and can also be approximately equal to the diameter Dj. The distance J, between the acceleration nozzles  and the separation apertures , can be in a range of from about 1 to 1.5 Dj, and in particular, can be 1.25 Dj, for example. The housing  may have a diameter of about 25 cm, for example. However, the size of the inlet  can be varied, according an intended application thereof.","The airflow through the acceleration nozzles  may be laminar or turbulent, depending on the number of nozzles (N) and the total flow rate (O). Efficient size-fractionation of particles by the inlet  is not affected by the occurrence of turbulent air flow through the acceleration nozzles .","A multi-filter chemical speciation sampler , according to aspects of the present teachings, is shown in . The sampler  includes: a frame ; an inlet  disposed in the frame ; a virtual impaction separator  connected to the inlet ; a first separation assembly  attached to a first outlet of the separator ; and a second separation assembly  attached to a second outlet the separator .","The first separation assembly  includes: a plenum  attached to the first outlet of the separator ; a drum  attached to a downstream end the plenum ; filters A, B disposed in the drum . While not required in all aspects, the shown first separation assembly  also includes a flow splitter  attached to downstream ends of the filters A, B; and a vacuum pump  attached to the flow splitter .","The second separation assembly  includes a flow splitter  attached to the second outlet of the separator  and filters A, B attached to the flow splitter . Although not shown, the second separation assembly  may also include one or more vacuum pumps and a flow controller, which are attached to the filters A, B, as shown for the first separation assembly .","As recited above, ambient air is drawn into the inlet  for PM fractionation. The PM having an AD of less than about 10 \u03bcm, for example, flows from the inlet  into the separator . According to some embodiments, the inlet  may be the inlet , or may be any suitable fractionation device having an appropriate particle size cut point. For example, the inlet  may be a real impaction inlet, with or without Federal Reference Method (FRM) designation.","The separator  can be a virtual impaction separating device as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,325,465, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein, by reference. The separator  receives the PM having an AD of less than about 10 \u03bcm from the inlet . The separator  then fractionates the PM into course and fine fractions. Typically, the fine fraction includes PM having an AD of less than about 2.5 \u03bcm, and the course fraction includes PM having an AD of between about 2.5 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm. However, according to various aspects, the particle sizes of the course and fine fractions may be changed.","The flow split between the fine and coarse fractions can range from between 2% to 10%. In other words, between about 90% and 98% of airflow is directed to the plenum , with a corresponding amount of airflow (i.e., 10% to 2%) being directed to the flow splitter . Lower flow splits to the coarse fraction minimize the amount of fine PM collected with the coarse PM. This concentration value is corrected based on the concentration of particles observed in the fine fraction. For example, if the flow split is 10%, then 10% of the fine concentration value can be subtracted from the coarse fraction.","The course fraction exits the bottom of the separator  and is drawn into the plenum . The plenum  is generally a conical tube. Ends of the plenum  can be configured to mate with the separator  and the drum , and thereby form airtight seals. According to some aspects, tri-clamps or the like can be used to connect the plenum . The course fraction is drawn through the plenum  and into the drum . Due to the shape of the plenum , the particles of the course fraction are spread evenly in the space above the filters A, B, such that homogenous deposits of the coarse PM are collected on the filters A, B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["101","100","104","100","101","103","105","101","90","104"]},"Referring to , the bottom plate  includes a plurality of apertures  and a positioning screw . The bottom plate  has a beveled edge , which corresponds to the downstream edge  of the main body .","Referring to , A, and B, the filters A, B are housed in the main body  and face the plenum . In particular, the filters A, B may include, for example, a 102 mm filter A and three 47 mm filters B. However the present teachings are not limited to any particular arrangement, number, or type of filter. The filters A, B are seated in corresponding ones of the apertures  formed in the bottom plate . The apertures  may be designed to form an airtight seal with the corresponding filters A, B.","Downstream ends of the filters A, B are connected to the vacuum pump , which draws the coarse fraction though the filters A, B, to collect the coarse fraction. In some aspects, each of the filters A, B can each be connected to a separate pump. In other aspects, the flow controller  is disposed between the pump  and the filters A, B. The flow controller  can be, for example, a volumetric or mass flow controller. In particular, the flow controller  may be a flow splitter  to direct appropriate flows through each of the filters A, B.","While not required in all aspects, the shown sampler  includes a guide member  that is rotatably attached to the frame . The screw  is rotatably seated in the guide member , such that the bottom plate  can be moved with respect to the main body . The guide member  may be rotated, such that the bottom plate  can be moved out of the frame , to allow for easy access to the filters A, B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 4 and 6"],"b":["110","80","110","110","112","114","112","114","112","122","114","122","112","114","122","122","120","120","110"]},"The various filters described herein can be any suitable type of filter, such as, filters made of Teflon, quartz-fiber, nylon, nucleopore, cellulose, polyurethane, or the like. In some aspects, different types of filters are simultaneously employed to collect the coarse and\/or fine fractions as desired, to achieve suitable chemical analysis of the collected PM and thus, obtain a nearly complete mass balance of the collected PM. Herein, the mass balance refers to a comparison between the sum of the PM species measured, to the total mass measured of the collected PM. The sampler  can include a denuder on any or all of the flow paths to the various filters. The filters can be housed in filter cartridges. The filter cartridges may each include multiple filters in series as needed, to obtain chemical components of the collected PM. The sampler  may also include one or more bypass lines , to control the air flow through the filters. The bypass line  may extend between the plenum  or base plate , and the flow splitter  or the pump .","Because the drum  houses multiple filters A, B, the coarse fraction in the plenum  can be divided amongst a number of separate streams and drawn into the corresponding filters A, B that correspond thereto. The flow splitter  can be used to obtain any number of desired flow splits.","The shown sampler  is designed based on air flows of, for example, 400 liters per minute (Lpm) and 1000 Lpm through the inlet , although any flow rate is possible. At 400 Lpm, 20.1 Lpm (5%) of the air flow is diverted by the separator  into the plenum . With three of the filters A, B (a three-way split), 6.7 Lpm pass through each filter A, B. A 20.1 Lpm flow split is also acceptable at 350 Lpm (flow split is 5.8%). The flow rate of 6.7 Lpm matches the current widely used MetOne PM2.5 chemical speciation sampler. At 1000 Lpm, 50.1 LPM allows for a 3-way flow split of 16.7 Lpm. This flow rate matches the Federal Reference Methods for coarse (PM10 PM2.5) and fine (PM2.5) fractions, the former by the difference between PM10 and PM2.5. At 10% flow split for the coarse fractions at 1000 Lpm, the additional fraction can be collected by a fourth filter, at a higher flow rate (5% of the total flow, e.g., 49.9 Lpm) and used, for example, for ultra-trace organic species or trace metals analyses or used by health effects researchers for biological analysis or toxicological animal testing.","The Table 1 includes exemplary design parameters for inlets of Examples 1-3, according to aspects of the present teachings. Example 2 included an inlet having 16 acceleration nozzle\/separation aperture pairs, as shown in , and Examples 1, and 3 included inlets respectively including 8 and 36 acceleration nozzle\/separation aperture pairs. The inlets of Examples 1-3 were connected to high volume air samplers. A flow rate of 1190 l\/min was 1.05 times the actual flow rate of the samplers, to account for the 5% lost to the particle flow through collection apertures thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Design Parameters for Virtual Impactor"},{"entry":"Inlets (10 \u03bcm AD cut point)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Examples","1","2","3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Nozzle Number","8","16","36"]},{"entry":[{},"D(cm)","1.861","1.477","1.127"]},{"entry":[{},"D(cm)","2.481","1.969","1.502"]},{"entry":[{},"Re","11,250","7085","4127"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As shown in Table 1, the Dj values were calculated using Ranz and Wong classical impaction theory of (1952) and assumed a \u03c8value of 0.15 for the impaction parameter (\u03c8is proportional to QD\/ND), for the most commonly employed flow rate of a high volume sampler (1130 l\/min or 40 cfm), and a Dof 10 \u03bcm AD.
