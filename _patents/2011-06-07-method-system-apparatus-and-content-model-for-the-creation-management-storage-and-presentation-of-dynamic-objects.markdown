A \u2018rich media\u2019 format, delivered instantaneously via the Internet or corporate intranets, enables organizations of all sizes to communicate quickly and effectively with customers, partners and employees. Fast, effective communications drives top-line revenue, streamlines business processes, and lowers cost.","The method, system, and apparatus of the present invention provides the ability to organize, enrich, and leverage existing and future rich media content, including streaming content.","The invention relates to methods, systems, apparatus and content models for providing a computer implemented discussion group for collaborative participants. The method includes the steps of storing a time-based dynamic object within a plurality of stored dynamic objects, wherein each dynamic objects comprises a plurality of predefined attribute fields; assembling requested dynamic objects in real time so that the requested dynamic objects are displayed on the basis of the start-time attribute field of each requested dynamic object; and providing, with each displayed requested dynamic object based on the displayed requested dynamic object's start time, a different threaded discussion associated with the each displayed requested dynamic object.","The method can further include storing participant-progress tracking when the requesting participant has viewed at least a portion of the stored dynamic objects; and when the requesting participant requests the requested dynamic objects after viewing the portion of the stored dynamic objects, computing a percentage of the stored dynamic objects viewed by the requesting participant based on the stored participant-progress tracking.","In one embodiment, at least a portion of the threaded discussion is displayed in real time as the at least one of the collaborative participants provides the portion.","In one embodiment, the threaded discussion comprises at least one text message provided by at least one of the collaborative participants about a conversation among group members over time or about individual parts of the conversation.","In one embodiment, the threaded discussion comprises a shared text file that is configured for the at least one of the collaborative participants to post a text-based comment in a common viewed format of the text file, wherein the comment is about an individual part of the discussion.","In one embodiment, providing the each displayed requested dynamic object the associated different threaded discussion further includes providing the each displayed requested dynamic object the associated different threaded discussion over a networking using an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).","The method can further include providing a participant interface for each participant to retrieve and view the different threaded discussions.","In one embodiment, the participant interface comprises an out-of-time view comprising a timeline expansion of the dynamic objects.","In one embodiment, the participant interface comprises an in-time view comprising a player of the dynamic object.","In one embodiment, the participant interface comprises an overview folder view comprising thumbnails of time-specific scenes within the dynamic object.","In one embodiment, the dynamic object is a dynamic rich media object.","The method can further include automatically delivering the assembled requested dynamic objects to at least one of the collaborative participants based on a subscription to the requested dynamic objects.","The invention also relates to a system for providing a computer implemented discussion group for collaborative participants. The system includes a server configured for storing a time-based dynamic object within a plurality of stored dynamic objects, wherein each dynamic objects comprises a plurality of predefined attribute fields; assembling requested dynamic objects in real time so that the requested dynamic objects are displayed on the basis of the start-time attribute field of each requested dynamic object; and providing, with each displayed requested dynamic object based on the displayed requested dynamic object's start time, a different threaded discussion associated with the each displayed requested dynamic object.","In one embodiment, the server is further configured for storing participant-progress tracking when the requesting participant has viewed at least a portion of the stored dynamic objects; and when the requesting participant requests the requested dynamic objects after viewing the portion of the stored dynamic objects, providing a percentage of the stored dynamic objects viewed by the requesting participant based on the stored participant-progress tracking.","In one embodiment, the threaded discussion comprises a shared text file that is configured for the at least one of the collaborative participants to post a text-based comment in real time in a common viewed format of the text file, wherein the comment is about an individual part of the discussion.","In one embodiment, providing the each displayed requested dynamic object the associated different threaded discussion further comprises providing the each displayed requested dynamic object the associated different threaded discussion over a networking using an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).","In one embodiment, the server is further configured for providing a participant interface for each participant to retrieve and view the different threaded discussions.","In one embodiment, the system further includes a client configured for displaying the participant interface.","In one embodiment, the participant interface is displayed within a web-browser operating on the client, and wherein at least one of the requested dynamic object comprises a time-synchronized data that is viewed within the browser based on a time.","The invention also relates to an apparatus for providing a computer implemented discussion group for collaborative participants. The apparatus includes a computer implemented component configured for storing a time-based dynamic object within a plurality of stored dynamic objects, wherein each dynamic objects comprises a plurality of predefined attribute fields; a computer implemented component configured for assembling requested dynamic objects in real time so that the requested dynamic objects are displayed on the basis of the start-time attribute field of each requested dynamic object; and a computer implemented component configured for providing, with each displayed requested dynamic object based on the displayed requested dynamic object's start time, a different threaded discussion associated with the each displayed requested dynamic object.","The invention also relates to methods, systems, apparatus and content models for the creation, management, storage, and presentation of dynamic objects, as exemplified by, but not limited to streaming audio and streaming video. The methods, systems, and apparatus are built upon a content model for rich media formats, that is, media formats adapted to dynamic, time changing objects or time based content models.","The content model provides a hierarchy of views for the same content. Thus, one view might be an \u201cin time\u201d view where objects are presented in time order, while another view may be an \u201cout-of-time\u201d with the objects shown as for editing, the content model supporting a number of different view structures.","The content model provides a hierarchy of objects, with a container object at the top, as a \u201cTalk Folder\u201d object, and a plurality of time-based objects, called element objects, in the container object. The individual element objects have properties, in the OOP sense, such as start time, end time, and linked documents. The linked documents are logical functions, such as audio-visual objects or elements, transcript objects or elements, and graphics objects or elements. These objects or elements, themselves, have associated detailed characteristics such as a construction or build, type data, bandwidth detail, JavaScript details, and track objects. The next levels down in the hierarchy are those things that will actually play. The track object builds in a time view, parses the objects, and builds the page.","The method, system, and apparatus of our invention provides total management, storage, searching, calling, and delivering of time dependent rich media content. Specifically, the invention utilizes time dependent objects and time dependent object management systems using a defined object model, and utilizing rich media, that are capable of real time interactions. One exemplary form of rich media is streaming media. A further aspect of the invention is the Management of Time Dependent Objects, with the method, system, and apparatus of the invention assembling time based objects on the fly, in real time, for delivery to a browser or client. Exemplary is a rich media player receiving and presenting pages on the fly from media objects.","The method, system, and apparatus of the invention includes a scalable software platform that manages, delivers and enriches all forms of rich media and streaming content for various end user applications. It accomplishes this by converging streaming media, documents, graphics, Web links and other communications content into a personalized, interactive and extensible communications format.","The server, data structure, and object model of the method, system, and apparatus described herein provide:","Central management of all streaming and rich media content. This is accomplished through central organization, management and delivery of all streaming and rich media content, including Eloquent, Microsoft Windows Media, Real Networks, and QuickTime formats.","Built-in profiling and personalization technology that enables users to push relevant information to individuals and groups as well as to request that certain types of information be automatically delivered to them. Library and category views offer users more structured views of all the content. Comprehensive search functionality enables users to find content ad-hoc, either through a powerful full-text search capability or alternatively by specific metadata types, such as author, organization and time.","The method, system, and apparatus described herein provide a User Interface that is both pleasing and functional within a standard Web-based (browser) paradigm. The four access points into the method, system, and apparatus of the invention are: My View, Search, Browse and Library.","The My View section includes the following categories:","a. Favorites\u2014frequently used files or folders, personally selected by the individual user and displayed in a library-type view.","b. Subscriptions\u2014content types selected by the user to be automatically be added or updated.","c. Recommendations\u2014content delivered to the user by someone else in the system based on his\/her profile.","The Search section enables users to perform a full-text search of content or to search for content based on metadata such as author, date, time, etc.","The Browse section provides categories by subject matter categories.","The Library section presents all the content in the system organized in a typical folder hierarchy.","The data structure, the metadata, and the set of graphical user interfaces facilitate end-user interactivity and provide an extensible framework for working with rich media, including streaming media. In this way, rich format content, including streaming media, go from being the end-solution, to becoming the starting point for collaborative, ongoing communications that grows in value as more users view the content and interact with it. This new framework enables users to add threaded discussions, documents, URLs, polls, and other communications content to existing streaming and rich media, enhancing the overall communication.","Attached Items and Discussion Topics: One embodiment of our invention provides a graphical user interface panel called: Attached Items and Discussion Topics. Documents, polls, shortcuts and links to other content (URLs) can be added and synchronized in the Attached Items section, while topics of interest about the content can be added in the Discussion Topic area. The user decides when the attached content should appear\u2014and disappear. The user can also decide whether it is mandatory that the viewer read a document or participate in a discussion or Poll before continuing through the presentation.","Polls: Polls can be used to survey a site's viewing audience. Anyone with appropriate permissions can set up a poll and link it to a specific part of a presentation. Results can be made public or restricted, depending on the permissions set by the author.","Shortcuts: A shortcut is a pointer or reference to another item in the system. Shortcuts are useful to reference objects and items that physically exist in another place on the network.","A further aspect of the method, system, and apparatus of our invention is enterprise-level security and access control. The system, method, and apparatus centrally manage enterprise-wide access. Access controls include single user login to access any information that authorized users can view, alter or create content, and secure extranet access for remote users, suppliers and customers.","A still further aspect of the invention is enterprise scalability.","The method, system, and apparatus of our invention manages and delivers all forms of streaming and rich media content, including Eloquent, Microsoft Windows Media, Real Networks, and QuickTime formats.","In a preferred embodiment of our invention, the system, method, and apparatus are all completely standards-based and require only a browser on the desktop. To be understood, however, is that all streaming formats\u2014including Microsoft Windows Media and Real Networks\u2014require that a \u2018player\u2019 be installed on the client side in order to deliver that content.","The rich media and rich media management features of the method, system, and apparatus provide dynamic and collaborative communications. Communications are dynamic. Every good presenter knows this. In addition, communications in business is inherently collaborative. The audience adds to the value of the communication with questions, updates and ideas related to the topic. The method, system, and apparatus of our invention not only effectively deliver content to large audiences; it also facilitates and captures the interactive information sharing that naturally occurs in conjunction with those presentations.","By simply communicating, users create content that adds to the richness of the experience. Streaming media becomes rich. And rich media becomes richer. This interaction builds collective intelligence and increases the value of the content over time.","The data structure and object structure of the method, system, and apparatus of our invention begins with a \u201cfolder.\u201d Folders are logical \u2018containers\u2019 that are used to organize communications and content according to any criteria that the user desires. Information in a folder can be organized by topic, by date, by intended audience, or simply at random. Users can set permissions on folders that by default will pertain to the content contained in them unless the individual items are given different permissions. Folders appear in the Library section.","The objects contained in the container \u201cFolder\u201d can be viewed in various ways or views. One such view is the \u201coverview\u201d The overview function allows users to quickly see how time-based content such as streaming media is organized over time. The overview presents thumbnails of key \u2018scenes\u2019 of the streaming presentation\u2014defined by the slides in the presentation for most business presentations. It then shows which additional communications content (transcript, documents, URLs, polls, etc.) is associated with those scenes. It also lists the start and end times for all elements of the communication.","The overview function enables content owners to easily review, edit and maintain a piece of rich media content. It gives users a convenient way to find and edit attachments and permissions associated with a presentation.","Another aspect of the rich format media of the invention is a threaded discussion. A threaded discussion is a shared text file that enables multiple users to post text-based comments in a common viewed format. Individual users can follow a \u2018discussion\u2019 among group members over time, can comment on individual parts of the conversation, and can begin new \u2018side conversations\u2019 or threads.","Unlike email, where a user might get many similar responses on the same topic because no one knows who else has responded to the original mail, a threaded discussion enables participants to see who else has added to the discussion\u2014and what they said\u2014in real time. This enables a widely dispersed group to have an electronic conversation that is both more natural and more useful than email.","Scalability is provided through a wide range of configuration options designed to fit any corporate or other user requirement. The system's Java Application Server uses clustering technology to grow capacity as large as the user base requires. Databases can be run locally or can be configured to run remotely. Remote databases can include supported enterprise databases running on the UNIX operating system. Finally each media server (Eloquent, Microsoft Windows Media, Real Networks, and QuickTime) can be operated independently and scaled to support the requirements for streaming media capacity.","The method, system, and apparatus of the invention are readily customizable, for example, through the use of customizations and third-party applications. This is the result of a completely object based structure, which facilitates adding new object types to the system and automatically benefiting fully from the existing server infrastructure, including permissions, categorization, subscriptions and full text indexing. The system also supports custom indexing and the addition of new actions that function in a fully integrated fashion.","Customizability and scalability also arises from object implementation. Security permissions and constraints can be inherited from a defined group. Security is implemented independently for each content object in the system, so that a single rich media presentation can present a different set of supporting information and links to different audiences\u2014and can do so easily and transparently.","The method, system, and apparatus of the invention provide and facilitate a full suite of services, including rich media content production and complete communications design and implementation services on a per project basis.","This results in a more collaborative environment around talks, along with a framework for adding value to talks over time, for example by allowing association of arbitrary objects with intervals within Talks. All object types within the method, system, and apparatus of the invention have the capability of being \u2018time-sensitive\u2019. This allows the association of a start time and end time with any object instance. When contained within an object that is time-sensitive, like a Talk (or Talk Folder), the container can use the time attributes of the objects to determine when it is appropriate to display them.","Talks are central to the method, system, and apparatus of our invention. Talks are container objects or \u2018Folders\u2019 within the structure of the method, apparatus, and system of the invention. This allows objects to be created inside of talks.","The method, system, and apparatus of the invention are built upon the object model, shown in . The principal organization element in the method, system, and apparatus of our invention is the \u201cTalk.\u201d The \u201cTalk\u201d is an object of the container class.  illustrates a \u201cTalk\u201d container class object, , containing three element objects. The element objects provide certain properties, inherited by the next level of objects. These properties include start time, stop time, and duration. These time dependent properties are inherited by content objects, such as the AV Object or audio-visual object, , the Transcript Element Object, , and the Graphics Element Object, , which contain Javascript files, time synchronized text, and time synchronized graphics. The content objects are controlled or tracked by tracking objects, , , and , which provide control data, build information, type information, and bandwidth information.","Exemplary objects include:\n\n","Any object created within a Talk \u2018Folder\u2019 will contain fields for entering start and stop time offset for that object within the talk. This is illustrated in . These fields will appear on the normal edit pages for these objects. Moreover, everything within a talk folder is considered part of the talk. Talks folders implicitly include all of the \u2018normal\u2019 items. One discussion can be associated with each talk.","Content administrators can enable the discussion by selecting the \u2018Enable Discussion\u2019 action on the talk. The discussion will be an implicit member of the Talk; it won't be explicitly displayed as a separate object.","A talk folder contains at least two views, an \u201cout-of-time\u201d view and an \u201cin-time\u201d view.  is a screen shot of an in-time view of a talk-play screen. The in-time view is a player. The out-of-time view is a vertical timeline expansion of all the presentation objects.  is a screen shot of an out of time view of a talk view screen.","Since the talk folder is a time-sensitive container, the new\/edit screen has fields for the start\/stop time of the object being created. Default time start\/end is the duration of the current slide, but this is editable. Once an item is added to a talk folder, a Control frame updates after the item is added, and displays a list of discussion topics associated with the current time.","The Control screen also displays a \u2018Add a new topic\u2019 link that invokes the \u2018create topic\u2019 screen. The \u201ccreate topic\u201d screen will act just like a selection from the \u2018new\u2019 menu, and a list of the objects associated with the current time, with a link to their open verb will appear.","Controls frame changes as the talk progresses, displaying the information that is appropriate to that point in the presentation. The window is implemented using DHTML, so all of the content to be displayed will be downloaded in advance. This allows refreshing the information without a server hit.","The talk\/view screen or window allows a user to get an overall view of the talk and the objects associated with it. It is useful for a content administrator to bootstrap the conversation, displays all the slides in the talk and associated times, and displays attached objects within the appropriate slide with separate timing info.","If the duration of the object overlaps the slide time at all, it is shown in with that slide. This means that a single object could be displayed for part of a slide, an entire slide, more than one slide, or even for the entire duration of the Talk.","Clicking the start or stop time for the object brings up the edit screen to allow editing of the start\/stop time values, as well as those fields normally accessible on the edit screen for that kind of object. Clicking the object name \u2018opens\u2019 the object. Clicking the slide key jumps to that point in the talk (in-time view) or shows a full-size image of the slide, thereby causing creation\/attachment of new objects, and shows transcript snippets for each section. Clicking the \u2018Edit Slide Data\u2019 will bring up the Edit Slide Screen.","The \u201cEdit Slide Screen\u201d is shown in . The \u201cEdit Slide Screen\u201d opens a window that allows actions to be executed on the items attached to a slide in a talk. This is required to edit the objects or manipulate permissions. A pop-up of all the slides in the talk is displayed. Slide titles are displayed in the pop-up in the order they appear in the talk. Selecting a slide and hitting the \u2018Go\u2019 button will allow the user to edit that slide.","The window displays the current slide. The start time and end time for the slide are displayed below the slide.","Clicking on other keys allows loading the talk (frameset) at that slide, or displays a full-size version of the slide.","Screen shots for the Poll Object are shown in  for the \u201cNew\/Edit Screen\u201d function,  for the \u201cSingle Choice Vote Screen\u201d,  for the \u201cMultiple Choice Vote Screen\u201d,  for the \u201cPoll Results Screen, Single Choice\u201d, and  for the \u201cPoll Results Screen\u2014Multiple Choice.\u201d","The Poll Object allows surveying the users and displaying the information in a chart. Poll objects are \u2018first-class\u2019 objects like documents and URLs, and can be created anywhere in the system. Just like all other objects, they have permissions, and can be used in recommendations, etc.","The Creator can configure if users can change their votes. When the poll object is called, the system records each users vote. Users are not allowed to vote more than once, although they may be able to change their votes. The creator can configure if and when users can see results, such as Always; (Users can see results before and after they vote), Never; (Users cannot see the results) After, (Users can only see results after they've voted), and After poll ends; (Users can only see results after the poll has ended). The Creator can always see results. The Poll object also allows the creator to suspend the poll. This allows no one new to vote. In running the poll object, the creator must specify a question and at least two responses, and whether the users must pick exactly one or \u2018zero to n\u2019 responses. The form implementation may be radio buttons or checkboxes depending on which option is selected. In the poll object, Read permission is required to see the results (where available), and write permission is required to vote, while Edit permission is required to change options on the poll.","Vote screen (single-choice) is shown in . This is the view that a user with write access who has not voted would see. Vote' submits the users vote. If the user has already voted, clicking the object will show the poll results if the user is allowed to see them. Otherwise it will show an informative message indicating that the user has already voted.","If the \u2018allow user to change vote\u2019 flag is enabled, the button reads \u2018Change Vote\u2019 instead of just \u2018Vote\u2019. The percentages shown by each item are the number of respondents who voted for that item. They should add up to 100% (+\/\u2212fuzz).","The Multiple Choice Vote Screen, shown in , looks and works identically to the previous screen except that the choices are represented by checkboxes rather than radio buttons. This allows the user to select more than one item. The percentages shown by each item are the number of respondents who voted for that item. They do NOT necessarily add up to 100%.","The Poll Results screens,  for the Single Choice and  for the Multiple Choice, are displayed if the user has permissions to see the results and the Poll is configured to allow that. Percentages work as previous described. Users with control permission to the Poll (Admin, creator, etc.) can always see the results.","The Poll Results Multiple. Choice screen, shown in , is displayed if the user has permissions to see the results and the Poll is configured to allow that. Percentages work as previous described. Users with control permission to the Poll (Admin, creator, etc.) can always see the results.","The Shortcut object is a pointer or reference to another object in the method, system, and apparatus of the invention. Shortcuts are very useful in cases where you want to reference objects in one place, but don't want to move or copy the object. They are very similar to Windows shortcuts. When displayed in the browse screens, shortcuts use the icon of the object they are pointing at.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 10"]},"Shortcuts, as first-class objects, can have permissions. The permissions on a shortcut only control access to the Shortcut, not to the target object. In order for a user to click on a shortcut and open the target object, they must have read permission to both the shortcut and the target object. If a shortcut is created that a user does not have permission to see, that does not necessarily preclude them from opening the target object directly.","When shortcut objects are full-text indexed, only the metadata for the object is indexed, not the content of the target object.","The Create Shortcut screen, , is a normal edit screen with name and description. A non-typeable box contains the name of the target object. The shortcut can be directed to a new object by clicking the \u2018Select Object to Shortcut\u2019 link which invokes the \u2018Select Shortcut Target\u2019 screen in a new window. If no name is input, the name defaults to \u2018Shortcut of\u2019+the name of the target object. The target object is the only required field","The Select Shortcut Target screen, shown in , allows the user to browse and select any object in the system.","Selecting an object closes the window and fills in the appropriate fields in the Create or Edit Shortcut screen. Hitting the cancel link closes the window.","Inside the browse view (or any other view), shown in , the shortcut object looks, acts, and behaves like its target object. One exception is that the actions that appear on the Shortcut modify the Shortcut rather than the target object. Clicking on the shortcut will behave exactly as clicking on the original object with one exception\u2014two audit records will be generated; one for opening of the shortcut and one for the original object.","Key to the method, system, and apparatus of our invention is the object structure. In order to have a standards-based, extensible, indexable and searchable persistent object the objects and data structures are architected as follows:","The Objects are serialized to XML. This provides a standards based storage format. That is readable, editable and easily parsed. The serialized Objects are stored with an SQL database.","The method, system, and apparatus of the invention need not use conventional SQL Tables with columns matching the object fields and indexes to access the objects. Instead, to facilitate extensibility we store the object definition as a blob of XML in a single static table. To get indexability of this static table we use a separate indexing table that is capable of indexing an unlimited number of different fields all at once. Traditionally we would have to add more columns to a growing number of SQL tables and growing number of indexes on these tables to store and index all of this type of data. Using our scenario we never change tables to add columns or add indexes to index more fields.","Indexbility. As the number of fields grows we would have to be continually adding indexes to locate and retrieve objects from the persistent store. Each object defines what fields it needs to have indexed. These fields are indexed with a single SQL table.","Searchability. Objects contain searchable content as well as indexable fields so the Object System allows objects to have their content full-text indexed as well. Each object specified what content is to be indexed along with the Object.","One embodiment of the apparatus and system of the invention are illustrated in , which shows a web-based exemplification. The system and apparatus, , has a web browser, receiving data, as pages and data, over an internet  or intranet, from a web server, . The web server, , receives data from an application server, , which, in turn, receives data from a source of streaming media, , and a database server. The database server, , interacts with various databases,  and , as well as tools repositories,  , which may contain tools, applets, servlets, business objects, and the like.","The method, system and apparatus of our invention are also built on standards. These include Java JDK 1.2.2 (Java2), Java Servlets 2.2, Java Server Pages 1.1 (JSP) JDBC 2.2, Extensible Markup Language (XML), Java Messaging Service (JMS), Java Naming Service 1.2 (JNDI). The method, system, and apparatus of our invention is also built upon and synergistically integrates third party tools, such as WebLogic Server 5.1.0 sp4+, Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 sp1+, Oracle 8i (8.1.6), Sybase Adaptive Server 6.0, Verity 4.2, and Xerces (Apache) XML Parser 1.1.1.","The servlet is named\/ecs by default, and is a singleton that lasts for the time the WebLogic server is running. A request in the system, method, and apparatus of our invention completely manages all HTTP GET and POST requests. Requests must specify at least an Object and a method, such as\/ecs?ID=<objectID>.<method> or\/ecs\/<objectID>\/<method>.

The Access Control Lists are attached to each Object, and contains entries for users and groups who have some type of access to the object. Each entry specifies a permission level (RWED). In the method, system, and apparatus of our invention,","Permission ACLs are subject to the following rules: granted permissions are additive, inherited from containing object, can be \u2018indirected\u2019 to another object,","Closely related to permission Access Clearance Lists are Extended Object Permissions, including Hide Before (Effective Date), Hide After (Expiration Date), and Hide Always.","The method, system, and apparatus of the invention provide. Privileges on users. These include Bypass, Admin, Login, and Alter.","User Password Management modules specify minimum number of letters, minimum number of digits, minimum and maximum lengths, history lists, expiration dates, pre-expired passwords, and stored one-way encrypted.","System Management modules within the method, system, and apparatus of our invention include utilities for database initialization, utilities for database upgrade, MD5, GUID\u2014Unique ID Management, RMS Usage Reporting, Database Import, and CSV User Import.","User customization includes capability for and support of, page decoration overrides, company logo (GIF, URL, alt), top-level labels (i18n), HTML includes, company logo area (below company logo), login page banner (above fields), tab configuration, which top-level tabs, my view, search, browse, library, and order of top-level tabs, among others.","Other utilities support authentication, including creating users and groups, user logs, public access and guest accounts, and sign up, a REMOTE_USER Header for Login User Name with No Password Required, Automatic User Creation when REMOTE_USER is detected.","The system servlets are singletons and include requests, session\/login management, access target object, method dispatcher, render JSP, return content, render errors, redirect, method, check parameters, check enabled, check permissions, gather data, perform actions, specify jsp*, and request life cycle.","Objects include, cache, manager, object, store, attribute, indexer, cluster, cache, manager, writer\/parser, object, monitor, full-text, document, store, verity, attribute, indexer, reference, manager, file system, document, store, audit, object, store, registered, and monitors.","Database Schema","The system, method, and apparatus of the invention rely on a relational database to store Object attribute information as well as audit and tracking data. Oracle version 8 and MS-SQL Server 7 are both supported. One of the more significant differences between Oracle and SQL7 is in their support of identity columns (columns which are to be assigned numerically increasing unique values). SQL7 supports the \u201cidentity\u201d keyword, whereas Oracle requires the use of a sequence. Since this affects how code is written, inserts into tables with an identity column are performed through stored procedures, allowing our Java code to be the same regardless of the database system being used. Other database-specific constructs are isolated to views (for example, EUsageSummaryView), again relieving the Java code of having any database-specific knowledge.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0150"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SQL7\/Oracle
