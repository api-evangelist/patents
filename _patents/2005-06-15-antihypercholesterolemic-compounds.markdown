continuation-in-part of International Application No. PCT\/US2004\/042698, filed Dec. 17, 2004, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/532096, filed Dec. 23, 2003.","The instant invention relates to substituted 2-azetidinones and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, and to their use alone or in combination with other active agents to treat hypercholesterolemia and for preventing, halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis and related conditions and disease events.","It has been clear for several decades that elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, and many studies have shown that the risk of CHD events can be reduced by lipid-lowering therapy. Prior to 1987, the lipid-lowering armamentarium was limited essentially to a low saturated fat and cholesterol diet, the bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine and colestipol), nicotinic acid (niacin), the fibrates and probucol. Unfortunately, all of these treatments have limited efficacy or tolerability, or both. Substantial reductions in LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol accompanied by increases in HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol could be achieved by the combination of a lipid-lowering diet and a bile acid sequestrant, with or without the addition of nicotinic acid. However, this therapy is not easy to administer or tolerate and was therefore often unsuccessful except in specialist lipid clinics. The fibrates produce a moderate reduction in LDL cholesterol accompanied by increased HDL cholesterol and a substantial reduction in triglycerides, and because they are well tolerated these drugs have been more widely used. Probucol produces only a small reduction in LDL cholesterol and also reduces HDL cholesterol, which, because of the strong inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol level and CHD risk, is generally considered undesirable. With the introduction of lovastatin, the first inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase to become available for prescription in 1987, for the first time physicians were able to obtain large reductions in plasma cholesterol with very few adverse effects.","Recent studies have unequivocally demonstrated that lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin, all members of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class, slow the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary and carotid arteries. Simvastatin and pravastatin have also been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease events, and in the case of simvastatin a highly significant reduction in the risk of coronary death and total mortality has been shown by the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. This study also provided some evidence for a reduction in cerebrovascular events. Despite the substantial reduction in the risk of coronary morbidity and mortality achieved by simvastatin, the risk is still substantial in the treated patients. For example, in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, the 42% reduction in the risk of coronary death still left 5% of the treated patients to die of their disease over the course of this 5 year study. Further reduction of risk is clearly needed.","A more recent class of anti-hyperlipidemic agents that has emerged includes inhibitors of cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe, the first compound to receive regulatory approval in this class, is currently marketed in the U.S. under the tradename ZETIA\u00ae.

Particularly preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids.","Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable esters include, but are not limited to, \u2014Calkyl and \u2014Calkyl substituted with phenyl, dimethylamino and acetylamino. \u201cCalkyl\u201d herein includes straight or branched aliphatic chains containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, iso-propyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for diseases and medical conditions affected by inhibition of cholesterol absorption.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.

Particularly, the dosage a patient receives can be selected so as to achieve the amount of LDL cholesterol lowering desired; the dosage a patient receives may also be titrated over time in order to reach a target LDL level. The dosage regimen utilizing a compound of the instant invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the potency of the compound chosen to be administered; the route of administration; and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.","The compounds of the instant invention are cholesterol absorption inhibitors and are useful for reducing plasma cholesterol levels, particularly reducing plasma LDL cholesterol levels, when used either alone or in combination with another active agent, such as an anti-atherosclerotic agent, and more particularly a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, for example an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Thus the instant invention provides methods for inhibiting cholesterol absorption and for treating lipid disorders including hypercholesterolemia, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a person in need of such treatment. Further provided are methods for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, as well as for halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically evident, comprising the administration of a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount, as appropriate, of a compound of Formula I to a mammal who is at risk of developing atherosclerosis or who already has atherosclerotic disease.","Atherosclerosis encompasses vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including restenosis following revascularization procedures, coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease including multi-infarct dementia, and peripheral vessel disease including erectile dysfunction are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and are therefore encompassed by the terms \u201catherosclerosis\u201d and \u201catherosclerotic disease.\u201d","A compound of Formula I may be administered to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence, or recurrence where the potential exists, of a coronary heart disease event, a cerebrovascular event, and\/or intermittent claudication. Coronary heart disease events are intended to include CHD death, myocardial infarction (i.e., a heart attack), and coronary revascularization procedures. Cerebrovascular events are intended to include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accidents) and transient ischemic attacks. Intermittent claudication is a clinical manifestation of peripheral vessel disease. The term \u201catherosclerotic disease event\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass coronary heart disease events, cerebrovascular events, and intermittent claudication. It is intended that persons who have previously experienced one or more non-fatal atherosclerotic disease events are those for whom the potential for recurrence of such an event exists.","Accordingly, the instant invention also provides a method for preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event comprising the administration of a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient at risk for such an event. The patient may or may not have atherosclerotic disease at the time of administration, or may be at risk for developing it.","Persons to be treated with the instant therapy include those at risk of developing atherosclerotic disease and of having an atherosclerotic disease event. Standard atherosclerotic disease risk factors are known to the average physician practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Such known risk factors include but are not limited to hypertension, smoking, diabetes, low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and a family history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Published guidelines for determining those who are at risk of developing atherosclerotic disease can be found in: Executive Summary of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel E), JAMA, 2001; 285 pp. 2486-2497. People who are identified as having one or more of the above-noted risk factors are intended to be included in the group of people considered at risk for developing atherosclerotic disease. People identified as having one or more of the above-noted risk factors, as well as people who already have atherosclerosis, are intended to be included within the group of people considered to be at risk for having an atherosclerotic disease event.","The oral dosage amount of the compound of Formula I, is from about 0.1 to about 30 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably about 0.1 to about 15 mg\/kg of body weight per day. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 5 mg to about 1000 mg of drug per day. However, dosage amounts will vary depending on factors as noted above, including the potency of the particular compound. Although the active drug of the present invention may be administered in divided doses, for example from two to four times daily, a single daily dose of the active drug is preferred. As examples, the daily dosage amount may be selected from, but not limited to, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg.","The active drug employed in the instant therapy can be administered in such oral forms as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. Oral formulations are preferred.","For compounds of Formula I, administration of the active drug can be via any pharmaceutically acceptable route and in any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. This includes the use of oral conventional rapid-release, time controlled-release and delayed-release (such enteric coated) pharmaceutical dosage forms. Additional suitable pharmaceutical compositions for use with the present invention are known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.","In the methods of the present invention, the active drug is typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients or carriers (collectively referred to herein as \u201ccarrier\u201d materials) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups and the like, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices.","For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with a non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, modified sugars, modified starches, methyl cellulose and its derivatives, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and other reducing and non-reducing sugars, magnesium stearate, steric acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, glyceryl behenate, calcium stearate and the like.

Compound 7b (shown in Example 7) was tested for inhibition of cholesterol absorption in mice, and its activity was compared to that of ezetimibe. C57BL\/6 male mice (n=6\/group), aged 7-8 weeks, were dosed orally with 0.1 ml 0.25% methyl cellulose solution with or without test compound, ezetimibe or 7b (0.12-10 mg\/kg). Thirty minutes later all of the mice were dosed orally with 0.2 ml 0.25% methyl cellulose solution containing 1% cholesterol and 2 \u03bcCi [H]-cholesterol per mouse. Three hours later, the animals were euthanized, and liver and blood were collected. Cholesterol counts in liver and plasma were determined, and percent inhibition of cholesterol absorption was calculated. Both ezetimibe and 7b inhibited cholesterol absorption by >90% at the lowest dose tested.","Additionally, 7b was tested for inhibition of cholesterol absorption in rats, and its activity was compared to that of ezetimibe-glucuronide. Rats were anesthetized with 100 mg\/kg Inactin i.p. The intestine was cannulated by passing an 18G Venocatheter through the fundus of the stomach and approximately 1-2 cm into the duodenum. The cannula was ligated in place at the pyloric valve. Rats were given either 1 ml of rat bile or test compound, 7b or ezetimibe-glucuronide (0.3-30 \u03bcg\/kg) in 1 ml rat bile. Vehicle or drug remaining in the cannula after delivery was rinsed into the intestine with 1 ml saline. Within 30 minutes of compound or vehicle delivery, 3 ml of a solution containing 1 \u03bcCi C\u2014 cholesterol in lipid emulsion was delivered to the intestine via the cannula. After 1.5 hours, the rats were euthanized under anesthesia, and blood and liver were collected. Cholesterol counts in liver and plasma were determined, and percent inhibition of cholesterol absorption was calculated. The two test compounds exhibited similar potency for inhibition of cholesterol absorption in this model.","The compounds of structural Formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of the following Scheme and Examples, using appropriate materials, and are further exemplified by specific examples which follow.

Alkyne I-2 may contain a radioactive atom such as S to provide the corresponding radiolabeled adduct upon reaction with I-1. Conversion of I-3 to I-4 can be achieved using a variety of hydrolytic methods known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.
