{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The embodiments herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.","1. Technical Field","The embodiments herein generally relate to microscale manufacturing techniques, and, more particularly, to microscale manufacturing techniques for electrical and mechanical connections.","2. Description of the Related Art","The assembly of devices from different materials and\/or fabrication processes is a fundamental requirement of any modern system manufacturing procedure. Such assembly is often performed at the device level. For example, a printed circuit board is a system platform which electrically connects a number of individual devices, including resistors, capacitors, inductors, sensors, or integrated circuit (IC) chips. Each of these devices comes from a unique fabrication process, and each device size is constrained in part by the process used to assemble these devices onto the printed circuit board. In addition to the printed circuit board, system platforms include flat or flexible panel displays, bio-compatible medical devices, smart cards, and many other systems which integrate conventional ICs with unconventional substrates.","Modern system integration methods typically use manual or robotic \u201cpick-and-place\u201d techniques. However, below a certain component size scale, these techniques typically cannot handle and deterministically place components with reasonable efficiency and cost. The smallest capacitor package which a modern robotic pick-and-place machine is specified to handle is approximately 300 \u03bcm by 600 \u03bcm, and suggests that the difficulty of handling even smaller devices would increase beyond a cost-effective level. Modern IC and MEMS manufacturing processes produce devices much smaller than 300 \u03bcm, but current assembly methods typically cannot handle such small, individual devices. Therefore, there is a need for cost effective methods of component assembly in the size scale below 300-600 \u03bcm.","One method for assembling small devices is to effectively employ similarly-small pick-and-place machines. However, a limitation with such methods is that other forces can overcome the inertial or gravitational forces required to release parts at the desired stage in a pick and place process. These forces contribute to an observed stiction phenomenon. A further limitation is that the deterministic handling of parts becomes infeasible as the number of parts increases, because of the serial nature of such methods.","Self-assembly is an attractive alternative manufacturing paradigm for continued miniaturization and increased functional microsystem integration. A viable self-assembly packaging and integration process requires both assembly and alignment of individual parts to any desired binding sites, as well as electrical and mechanical connections to these binding sites. Furthermore, these processes must be cost-effective, and scalable in terms of numbers of parts assembled and in terms of part size.","One approach to self-assembly is based on magnetic forces where templates are composed of alternating layers of magnetized and non-magnetized material to form a laminated structure with an array of magnetic regions. Components are vibrated and trapped by the magnets to form a matching array. However, a limitation exists with the use of a laminated structure, in that the application of this method to large numbers of assembly sites would be infeasible. Another limitation is that strong magnetic fields remain permanently in the vicinity of each part following assembly, which would affect the electromagnetic characteristics of any device and may be incompatible with many device technologies. A further limitation is that additional process steps are required to form permanent mechanical and electrical connections, which increase cost.","A related approach utilizes magnetized or electrified binding sites using two-dimensional, planar fabrication methods. Such an approach overcomes the limitation associated with laminated structures, and through the use of electrically active structures as opposed to passive, permanent electrets or magnets, the approach also overcomes the limitation of permanent electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of each part. However, the limitation remains of requiring additional process steps to form permanent mechanical and electrical connections, which increases cost.","Another approach involves fluidic self-assembly where individually shaped micrometer-sized parts are integrated into correspondingly shaped recesses on a substrate using a liquid medium, or carrier fluid, for transport. The key features of the approach are that gravitational and fluidic forces guide parts into the desired wells, and each part has a characteristic trapezoidal shape such that it only fits into its well in the desired orientation. Enhancements to fluidic self-assembly include different-shaped wells for self-selecting different part shapes, and the specific use of a gas as the carrier fluid. A limitation with these methods is only gravity will keep the parts in desired wells following assembly, and therefore the parts may disengage from the wells upon further handling. The same limitation also exists in that post processes are required to form permanent mechanical and electrical connections, which is an example of further handling.","In other approaches related to fluidic-assembly, a template may contain specific electrical conductor patterns, such that when electrically charged by an external source, local electric or magnetic fields help guide and trap parts at the desired locations. Limitations with these approaches include high costs associated with the difficulty of providing temporary electrical connections to addressable electrode structures on the template, where the template is typically submerged in a fluid containing the parts to be assembled. The same limitation also exists in that post processes are required to form permanent mechanical and electrical connections.","One way to overcome some post-processing limitations is to take advantage of surface energy effects, such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. For example, a substrate can be chemically treated to create regions with a hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature. By also treating parts with complementary hydrophobic or hydrophilic surface treatments, hydrophobic parts can be made to adhere only to a hydrophobic template region, and similar effects can be used with hydrophilic parts and regions. Although any hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions disappear once the surrounding fluid is removed, hydrophobic and hydrophilic effects may be extended through the use of capillary forces. The effects of capillary forces may be made into permanent mechanical bonds via heating a cross-linkable polymer, or through the contact hardening of cyanoacrylate adhesives. One way to control the assembly at particular template locations is by the use of a carrier fluid which increases its viscosity upon local heating. This viscosity increase can \u201cscreen\u201d parts from assembling at particular sites while other sites remain available. However, in all of these approaches, a limitation remains in that further processing is needed to make electrical connections.","An example of further processing is the use of an electrolyte carrier fluid for subsequent electroplating. However, this method requires the attachment of temporary electrical connections to addressable electrode structures on the template, which may increase cost and complexity. Another way to form electrical connections directly as part of a fluidic self-assembly process is to take advantage of capillary forces from a molten alloy or solder. This idea has been explored with millimeter to centimeter scale parts, and more recently with micrometer-scale parts, and in conjunction with the complimentary shaped wells of a fluidic self-assembly process. In each of these examples, a single alloy is used for both mechanical assembly and electrical connections, mandating the use of large electrical contacts and\/or alloys which melt at near room temperature. The reason is that comparatively long times are required for stochastic self-assembly processes to reach desirable yields, and high-temperature fluid flux environments cause excessive molten alloy degradation and intermetallic growth when the contact size is too small. The reported electrical conductance per unit area of these contacts is 1.5 to 2.0 m\u03a9cm, which are over three orders of magnitude lower than macroscopically-formed molten alloy contacts, indicating the level to which the contacts can degrade. Accordingly, there is clearly a need to improve the state of the art in molten-alloy based self-assembled electrical contacts.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a device that is millimeter-sized or smaller, manufactured from at least two parts, with at least one part comprising a substrate; and a plurality of different liquids patterned on the substrate, wherein at least one of the liquids provides self-assembly and alignment of the part using capillary forces, wherein at least one of the liquids comprises a solder alloy used for electrical connections to the part, and wherein the solder alloy only liquefies at a temperature above that at which the self-assembly and alignment is performed. In one embodiment, if the liquid used for self-assembly and alignment comprises a molten solder alloy, then it has a melting point which is lower than that of the solder alloy used for electrical connections. Additionally, the solder alloy used for electrical connections comprises a plateau solder structure, and wherein the solder alloy may be formed by any of electroplating, electroless plating, screen printing of a solder paste, and may be self-assembled onto binding sites used for subsequent self-assembly of larger parts. Also, the plateau solder structure is used prior to liquefying the solder alloy, and wherein subsequent liquefying of the solder alloy causes an effective height of the plateau solder structure to increase allowing the solder alloy to contact the part. The solder alloy liquefies for only a limited time. Moreover, the solder alloy is solidified after self-assembly and alignment of the part. Preferably, a height of the bump structure prior to liquification is less than a height of the bump structure after solidification.","Another embodiment provides an apparatus comprising a microscale part comprising a part binding site and a part electrical binding site; and a template binding site comprising a template electrical conductor layer; a metallization layer on the template electrical conductor layer; a bump structure comprising a solder alloy positioned on the metallization layer, wherein the solder alloy is liquefied to allow the bump structure to self-assemble and align with the part electrical binding site using capillary forces, and wherein the solder alloy only liquefies at a temperature above that at which the self-assembly and alignment is performed; and a fluid on the template electrical conductor layer, wherein the fluid comprises a melting point lower than that of the solder alloy, wherein the fluid binds with the part binding site.","In one embodiment, the fluid comprises a metal alloy. Preferably, the bump structure forms an electrical connection between the template electrical conductor layer and the part electrical binding site. Furthermore, the solder alloy liquefies for only a limited time. Additionally, the solder alloy comprises a plateau solder structure, and wherein the solder alloy may be formed by any of electroplating, electroless plating, screen printing of a solder paste, and self-assembly onto the part binding site used for subsequent self-assembly of larger parts. Preferably, the plateau solder structure is used prior to liquefying the solder alloy, and wherein liquefying of the solder alloy causes an effective height of the plateau solder structure to increase allowing the solder alloy to contact the microscale part. The apparatus further comprises a template structure adjacent to the template electrical conductor layer; and a base material positioned between the template structure and the fluid. Moreover, the solder alloy is solidified after self-assembly and alignment of the bump structure with the part electrical binding site. Preferably, a height of the bump structure prior to liquification is less than a height of the bump structure after solidification.","Another embodiment provides a method of self-assembling microscale structures, the method comprising providing a microscale part comprising a part binding site and a part electrical binding site; and providing a template binding site comprising a bump structure comprising a solder alloy; and a fluid comprising a melting point lower than that of the solder alloy. The method further comprises liquifying the solder alloy to allow the bump structure to self-assemble and align with the part electrical binding site using capillary forces, and wherein the solder alloy only liquefies at a temperature above that at which the self-assembly and alignment is performed; and solidifying the solder alloy after self-assembly and alignment of the bump structure with the part electrical binding site causing the fluid to bind with the part binding site. Preferably, a height of the bump structure prior to liquification is less than a height of the bump structure after solidification. The fluid may comprise a metal alloy. The solder alloy may be formed by any of electroplating, electroless plating, screen printing of a solder paste, and self-assembly onto the part binding site used for subsequent self-assembly of larger structures.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","The embodiments herein provide a technique for forming electrical and mechanical connections via self-assembly without sacrificing the electrical qualities of those connections on microscale-sized parts (e.g., approximately 280 \u03bcm). The use of two alloys, or more generally the use of two liquids, where one liquid is a metal alloy, decouples the formation of mechanical and electrical connections. The second alloy is intended specifically for the formation of electrical connections, allowing smaller and higher quality electrical contacts.

In addition to fluid , a previously-deposited solder pedestal or bump  on top of an underbump metallization layer (UBM)  is located on the template. The solder bumps  are not liquefied and do not participate in this stage of the assembly process, and retain good electrical conduction properties for later use. Fluid  may be a low-melting point metal alloy with a melting point that is lower than that of solder alloy . Fluid  may also be any other liquid which is immiscible with fluid .","As shown in , with reference to , once the part  has been assembled, the solder bumps  align with part electrical binding sites . The system is then globally heated above the melting point of solder , or locally heated in the regions of solder , for example through incorporated micro-scale heaters. The heat is applied just sufficiently long enough to allow the solder  to flow and form electrical connections between the template electrical conductor layers  and those on the part . The formation of electrical connections as a separate process from that of physical assembly avoids problems with excessive solder degradation and intermetallic compound growth in the under bump metal layers , , and in general achieves much better electrical connections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 through 3"],"b":["26","26","26","6","5","27","27","3","5","3","5","3","5","3"]},"After the parts  are self-assembled on the template via capillary forces provided by the liquid binding sites , the solder bumps  remain in a solid state. Following the initial assembly, and following the formation of electrical connections by heating the template above each solder bump  melting point for approximately 30 seconds, a close-up image of three self-assembled parts  is shown in . In , a side image of the electrical contacts  is shown. In this example, the connections measured on average 3.9\u03a9. For the 10 \u03bcm diameter contacts  on each part, this electrical resistance corresponded to a conductance-per-unit-area of approximately 333 m\u03a9cm, which is over 160 times higher than other conventional values of measured, self-assembled electrical contacts.

To illustrate the problem with conventional solutions that the embodiments herein address, and with reference to , where  illustrates the pre-assembly configuration, and  illustrates the post-assembly configuration. In , solder alloy  is held above its melting temperature for an extended period of time in order for the stochastic self-assembly processes to reach a desirable yield. During this time, alloy  remains a liquid and its quality decreases due to the corrosive environment in which it is held in order to insure that the alloy surface is free of metal oxides which otherwise interfere with solder-metal bonds. The quality of the electrical contact between the alloy and the underlying metal layer  also decreases due to intermetallic compound (IMC) growth. After a part  has been assembled (as shown in ) on template  comprising template electrical conductor layer , alloy  remains above its melting temperature to allow other neighboring parts to self-assemble, and alloy  continues to degrade along with the alloy-metal connections to metal layers  and now the metal layer on the part, .","The embodiments herein may be used in a variety of applications including, but not limited to: (i) integration of group III and group IV semiconductors at the device level rather than what is conventionally termed the die level; (ii) formation of large area displays on flexible or other low-cost substrates; (iii) integration of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible substrates, or with flexible, polymeric, organic, or other unconventional substrates; (iv) integration of electronic, micro-mechanical, or photonic devices on printed circuit boards; (v) implementation of \u201csystem-on-chip\u201d designs in a low-cost manner, where the desire to monolithically integrate many types of microelectronic systems on one chip is prohibited by the cost of process changes that would be required to render each fabrication process compatible with all other fabrication processes needed for a particular system.
