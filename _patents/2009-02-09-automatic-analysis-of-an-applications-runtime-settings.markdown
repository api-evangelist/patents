title: Automatic analysis of an application's run-time settings
abstract: A method and system for automatic analysis of an application's runtime configuration settings is provided. The configuration processing system includes a monitoring component and an analysis component. The monitoring component observes requests for configuration information stored in configuration data stores of a monitored device. For example, the monitoring component may observe requests directed to the configuration data stores when an application starts, during runtime, and when the application exits. The monitoring component may record the observed requests in a file or data structure that may be accessed by or sent to the analysis component. Based on the observed requests of an application, the analysis component automatically identifies a reduced set of configuration settings which likely correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by the application. The configuration processing system may include a post-analysis component that displays the reduced set of configuration settings to a user for review, manual analysis, and/or verification.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Computer users configure their computers in order to most efficiently and comfortably perform typical tasks. For example, a user may configure a word processing application to include a footer containing the user's initials in every document created by the user. As another example, a user may configure an email application to automatically correct spelling errors. When a user needs to use a computer other than his own, he loses the ease of use represented by those system settings. This makes it difficult to do meaningful computer work. This problem is typically addressed by the user manually configuring the computer in the way that he is accustomed. This solution has problems of its own, including the user's familiarity and ability to remember how each application is configured, where the settings are located, and so on. Depending upon the computer's configuration, operating environment, and applications, this solution tends to be time consuming, tedious, and error prone even for experienced users. Given these problems, it is desirable to have a mechanism by which user-specified configuration settings of a computer can be identified. This would enable the user to operate any computer in a way familiar and comfortable for him.","A method and system for automatic analysis of an application's runtime configuration settings is provided. In some embodiments, the configuration processing system receives a selection of an application for which a subset of configuration settings is to be identified. For example, the configuration processing system may include a user interface for a user to select one or more applications, such as a word processing application, an email application, and so on. The configuration processing system identifies a subset of configuration settings used by a selected application by observing requests directed to one or more configuration data stores (e.g., a registry) and by analyzing the observed requests. In some embodiments, some or all of the identified configuration settings are identified as being user-specific configuration settings. User-specific configuration settings include application configuration settings that a user has created, deleted, or modified. For example, the configuration processing system may identify the font type of a word processing application as a configuration setting used by the word processing application, and, if the font type is, or has been, modified by a user from the default font type, then the configuration processing system may identify the font type as a user-specific configuration setting used by the word processing application. The configuration processing system may also extract and store the identified subset of configuration settings, so that the configuration settings may be used on another device.","In some embodiments, the configuration processing system includes a monitoring component and an analysis component. The monitoring component observes requests for configuration information stored in configuration data stores of a computing device (referred to herein as the \u201cmonitored device\u201d). For example, the monitoring component may observe requests directed to the configuration data stores during initial start up of an application, while a user interacts with the application, and during final shut down of the application. Such requests typically include reading, modifying, creating, and\/or deleting system or environment variables, files, registry settings, etc. (collectively referred to herein as \u201cconfiguration settings\u201d). For example, the monitoring component may observe requests directed to a configuration data store by instrumenting an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) that is used by applications to access configuration settings maintained by the configuration data store. When an application calls an instrumented function of the API, the function transfers control to the monitoring component. The monitoring component then records the observed request in a file or data structure that may be accessed by, or passed directly to the analysis component. For example, the monitoring component may record information about the calling application, the access type (e.g., read, create, etc.), the setting path, the setting name, the setting value, and so on. One skilled in the art will appreciate that many different techniques may be used to observe requests for configuration settings. For example, some APIs provide a hooking mechanism through which hooks may be registered to transfer control to the monitoring component before and\/or after an API function is performed.","Based on the observed requests of an application that are directed to one or more data stores, the analysis component automatically identifies a reduced set of configuration settings used by the application (referred to herein as \u201ccandidate settings\u201d). Some or all of the candidate settings may be user-specific configuration settings. It is noted that the number of applications observed by the monitoring component may be greater than one, and that the analysis component may identify a set of candidate settings for each observed application. However, to facilitate description, it is assumed that a user of the configuration processing system has selected a single application for which a set of user-specific configuration settings is to be generated.","In some embodiments, the analysis component includes a number of subcomponents. To identify a set of candidate settings, the analysis component may invoke one or more of its subcomponents. For example, the analysis component may invoke a filter subcomponent to remove particular types of observed requests; a correlation subcomponent to determine whether a relationships exists between observed requests directed to different configuration data stores; a fall-back subcomponent to analyze failed requests; a progression subcomponent to determine whether certain observed requests can be combined into a fewer number of requests; an access subcomponent to analyze requests to read, modify, create, and\/or delete configuration settings; and\/or a frequency subcomponent to determine the frequency at which an application accesses particular configuration settings. It will be appreciated that the analysis component may include other subcomponents not mentioned.","In some embodiments, a user can review and\/or edit configuration requests that were observed by the monitoring component before the analysis component processes the observed requests, while in other embodiments the analysis component automatically analyzes some or all of observed requests without user intervention or review. It is noted that, by automatically analyzing the observed requests, user-specific configuration settings can be identified substantially faster then if user input were required. In addition, by not requiring user input, the configuration processing system can be used by novice users.","In some embodiments, the configuration processing system includes a post-analysis component that may be invoked to display the set of candidate settings to a user for further review, manual analysis, and\/or verification. For example, a user may review a set of candidate settings to verify that such settings correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by an application. As another example, a user may review the observed requests that served as the foundation for the automated analysis and, if the user desires, the user may perform additional, manual analysis to revise the set of candidate settings.","In some embodiments, the configuration processing system persistently stores the set of candidate settings, such that the user-specific configuration settings used by an application can be virtualized across a wide variety of computing devices, such as a personal computer, personal digital assistant, cell phone, digital camera, or other electronic device. It is noted that the set of candidate settings need not be verified by a user prior to being stored or virtualized. The configuration processing system may use various techniques to extract the identified configuration settings from the monitored device, such as, for example, those described in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,728,877 of K. Mackin et al., filed on Dec. 13, 2002 and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATICALLY TRANSITIONING OF CONFIGURATION SETTINGS AMONG COMPUTER SYSTEMS,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, the extracted configuration settings are persistently stored on another computing device, while in other embodiments the extracted configuration settings may be used by another computing device without persistently loading or storing the settings on the computing device, for example, using techniques such as those described in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,293,170 of R. Bowler et al., filed on Oct. 13, 2005 and entitled \u201cCHANGING THE PERSONALITY OF A DEVICE BY INTERCEPTING REQUESTS FOR PERSONALITY INFORMATION,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In some embodiments, the system stores the extracted user-specific configuration settings on a storage medium in a canonical or application-independent form. The canonical form may be neutral in the sense that it is independent of any application program and independent of the operating system under which an application program executes. For example, the user-specific configuration settings of a word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word), such as default font type, may be stored in a format that is independent of the word processing program through which the user-specific configuration settings were specified and\/or used on the monitored device. When the extracted configuration settings are used by a recipient device that uses a different word processing application (e.g., StarOffice), the user-specific configuration settings may be converted from the canonical form to a recipient-specific form that can be used by the applications of the recipient device. In some embodiments, the canonical form is a neutral form, while in other embodiments the canonical form defaults to a form specific to an application or an operating system.","The configuration processing system may be implemented as an application layer that observes an application's requests for configuration settings and, based on the observed requests, automatically identifies a reduced set of configuration settings which likely correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by the application. The configuration processing system may be implemented by the monitored device. However, it is noted that the configuration processing system does not have to be implemented by the monitored device. For example, in some embodiments, the configuration processing system is implemented by a separate computing system to which configuration requests are provided as input.","Before considering the technology introduced herein in greater detail, it is useful to consider an environment in which a configuration processing system can be implemented.  is a block diagram that illustrates some of the components incorporated in a monitored device on which a configuration processing system executes in one embodiment. It is noted that the monitored device  may be a physical computing system or a virtual computing system. In the illustrated embodiment, the monitored device  includes one or more processors  (e.g., processors  may be physical or virtualized). The processors  are the central processing units (CPUs) of the monitored device  and, thus, control its overall operation. In some embodiments, the processors  accomplish this by executing software stored in memory and\/or other computer-readable storage media of the monitored device . A processor  may be, or may include, one or more programmable general-purpose or special-purpose microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), programmable controllers, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), or the like, or a combination of such devices.","In the illustrated embodiment, storage media  includes computer-readable media for reading and\/or persistently storing applications  and data  and memory for storing applications  and data  while they are being used. For example, storage media  may include a removable computer-readable storage medium such as a Universal Serial Bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) device and\/or a fixed computer-readable storage medium such as a hard drive. As used herein, computer-readable storage media includes volatile, nonvolatile, removable, and non-removable media, or any combination of such media devices that are capable of storing information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. It is noted that storage media  may include physical or virtualized storage devices. It will be appreciated that the monitored device  may include other components not illustrated, such as input devices (e.g., keyboard and pointing devices), output devices (display devices), network connections, and so on.","In the illustrated embodiment, the monitored device  includes one or more configuration data stores  that maintain configuration settings of the monitored device. A user typically configures an application  in a way that allows the user to most efficiently and comfortably use the application. Some configuration settings are considered \u201cglobal\u201d settings in the sense that all applications executing on the monitored device share the configuration settings, while other configuration settings are specific to an application or a group of application. For example, a configuration setting that indicates the base color for a window may be global, whereas a configuration setting that indicates spelling errors are to be automatically corrected may be specific to an application (such as, for example, a word processing application or an email application). Typically, both global and application-specific configuration settings are configurable by a user. As a result, such settings may be automatically identified by the configuration processing system as user-specific configuration settings.","In the illustrated embodiment, the monitored device  includes a monitoring component  and an analysis component . However, in other embodiments, one or both of these components are implemented by a computing system other than the monitored device . The monitoring component  observes requests for configuration settings maintained by configuration data stores  of the monitored device .","In some embodiments, the monitoring component  provides an extensible framework that may be used to define a number of monitors, such as monitors , . . . . In some embodiments, the monitoring component  includes a monitor for each configuration data store  that is to be monitored, and each monitor observes requests directed to the monitor's corresponding configuration data store. For example, monitor may observe requests directed to a registry of the monitored device  when an application starts, during runtime, and when the application exits. By providing an extensible framework, the monitoring component  can be extended to adapt to computing environments having different or new types of configuration data stores.","The monitoring component  may record the observed configuration requests in a file or data structure (not shown) that may be accessed by or sent to the analysis component . In some embodiments, each monitor , , . . . records observed requests in a shared file or data structure, while in other embodiments each monitor records observed requests in a private file or data structure associated with the particular configuration data store  that it monitors. Based on the observed configuration requests, the analysis component  identifies a reduced set of configuration settings for each application, which correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by each application (referred to herein as \u201ccandidate settings\u201d). For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the sets of candidate settings . . . correspond to applications . . . , respectively. It will be appreciated that a set of candidate settings  may be empty or may include one or more configuration settings.","In some embodiments, the monitoring component  and the analysis component  are implemented as computer-executable instructions, such as software modules or applications. It is noted, however, that these components need not be stored on the same computer-readable medium or in storage media  of the monitored device . It is further noted that the computer-readable storage medium(s) on which these components are stored need not be the same computer-readable storage medium(s) on which the configuration data stores  or applications  are stored. However, to facilitate description, it is assumed that the monitoring component  and the analysis component  are stored in storage media  of the monitored device . While computing devices configured as described above are typically used to support the operation of the configuration processing system, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the system may be implemented using devices of various types and configurations, and having various components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["125","200","115","125"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["RegCreateKey( )\u2014creates a new registry key","RegDeleteKey( )\u2014deletes a registry sub-key, including all its values","RegDeleteValue( )\u2014removes a value from a registry key","RegEnumKey( )\u2014enumerates sub-keys of a registry key","RegEnumValue( )\u2014enumerates values for a registry key","RegSetValue( )\u2014sets the data for a value in a registry key"]}}}},"In the illustrated embodiment, applications . . . read, modify, create, and\/or delete configuration settings maintained by configuration data stores . . . through each store's corresponding API . It is noted that one or more APIs may be provided for each configuration data store . . . . However, to facilitate description, each it is assumed that a single API is provided for each configuration data store. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, APIs . . . correspond to configuration data stores . . . , respectively.","In the illustrated embodiment, each monitor . . . installs a number of interceptors . . . to intercept requests for configuration settings. For example, a monitor may install interceptor . . . for each function of API . In some embodiments, an interceptor  is implemented as a jump instruction that is inserted within each function of an API  to transfer control to the corresponding monitor .

In the illustrated embodiment, each monitor . . . records observed requests in a record . . . corresponding to configuration data stores . . . , respectively. However, it is noted that in other embodiments, each monitor . . . records observed requests in a single, shared record  (not shown). For example, a registry monitor may record information about the calling application, the access type (e.g., read, create, etc.), the registry key path, the registry key name, the registry value name, the actual value, the type of the value (DWORD, string, binary, etc.), and so on. In some embodiments, the file or data structure includes a time-stamp of each observed request such that requests observed by one monitor (e.g., a registry monitor) can be correlated with requests observed by another monitor (e.g., a file system monitor). Based on the observed requests, the analysis component  identifies a reduced set of configuration settings for each application , which likely correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["135","135","300","305","310","315","320","325"]},"The filter subcomponent  identifies and removes certain types of observed requests, such that configuration settings associated with such requests are not be identified as candidate settings. For example, the filter subcomponent  may remove the following types of requests:\n\n","It will be appreciated that the filter subcomponent  may remove other types of requests not mentioned.","The correlation subcomponent  determines whether relationships exists between observed requests directed to different configuration data stores  by the same application. The correlation subcomponent may determine that a relationship exists between an observed registry request and an observed file system request when the registry request modified a value in the registry to define a valid path (e.g., fully qualified, relative or by using environment variable expansion) for an item referenced in some way by the observed file system request. For example, if a user creates a custom dictionary in a word processing application, a new registry value is created for the custom dictionary under the custom dictionary registry key having the following path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Shared Tools\\Proofing Tool\\1.0\\Custom Dictionaries. When the custom dictionary is accessed, such as during a spell check operation, the correlation subcomponent  may determine that a relationship exists between the observed registry request that created the new registry value and the observed file system request to access the custom dictionary. When the correlation subcomponent  determines that a relationship exists between observed requests directed to different configuration data stores  by the same application, the correlation subcomponent may identify the configuration settings as candidate settings. In the example above, the correlation subcomponent  may identify the registry value and\/or custom dictionary as candidate settings, which likely correspond to, or include, user-specific configuration settings used by the word processing application.","The fall-back subcomponent  analyzes failed requests (e.g., attempts by an application  to open registry keys\/values and\/or file system items that resulted in failure). Typically, if an application  requests a configuration setting that does not exist, a feature or function of the application is disabled. The fall-back subcomponent  determines whether an observed request succeeded immediately after the failed request. If the fall-back subcomponent  determines that the application  attempted one operation that failed, and subsequently performed a different \u201cfall-back\u201d operation as an alternative, the fall-back subcomponent may identify configuration settings associated with the observed fall-back request as candidate settings, which likely correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by the application .","The progression subcomponent  determines whether certain observed requests for configuration settings can be combined into a fewer number of requests. For example, the progression subcomponent  may analyze the following sequence of observed requests to determine whether any of the requests can be combined into a fewer number of requests:\n\n","In this example, the progression subcomponent  may combine the following observed requests into a single request indicating that the value HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Tranxition\\LiveManage\\Foo was read by the application .","The access subcomponent  analyzes observed requests to retrieve, modify, create and\/or delete configuration settings while an application  is running. For example, if an application  creates a configuration setting and does not delete that setting within the same session, the access subcomponent  identifies the created configuration setting as a candidate setting, which likely corresponds to a user-specific configuration setting used by the application. As another example, the access subcomponent  may identify configuration settings that are modified by the application  as candidate settings. In some embodiments, the access subcomponent  is invoked by the analysis component  after the filtering and progressing subcomponents are invoked.","The frequency subcomponent  determines the frequency at which an application  accesses configuration settings. Configuration settings which are accessed more frequently by the application  are then identified by the frequency subcomponent  as candidate settings, which may correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by the application.","The analysis component  invokes one or more of the illustrated subcomponents - to identify a reduced set of configuration settings for each application, which likely correspond to user-specific configuration settings used by the applications.
