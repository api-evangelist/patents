Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/547,165, filed Oct. 14, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic proteins, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treating diseases during which anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL proteins are expressed.","Apoptosis is recognized as an essential biological process for tissue homeostasis of all living species. In mammals in particular, it has been shown to regulate early embryonic development. Later in life, cell death is a default mechanism by which potentially dangerous cells (e.g., cells carrying cancerous defects) are removed. Several apoptotic pathways have been uncovered, and one of the most important involves the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are key regulators of the mitochondrial (also called \u201cintrinsic\u201d) pathway of apoptosis. See, Danial, N. N. and Korsmeyer, S. J. (2004) 116, 205-219. The structural homology domains BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4 are characteristic of this family of proteins. The Bcl-2 family of proteins can be further classified into three subfamilies depending on how many of the homology domains each protein contains and on its biological activity (i.e., whether it has pro- or anti-apoptotic function).","The first subgroup contains proteins having all 4 homology domains, i.e., BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4. Their general effect is anti-apoptotic, that is to preserve a cell from starting a cell death process. Proteins such as, for example, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and Bfl-1\/A1 are members of this first subgroup. Proteins belonging to the second subgroup contain the three homology domains BH1, BH2 and BH3, and have a pro-apoptotic effect. The two main representative proteins of this second subgroup are Bax and Bak. Finally, the third subgroup is composed of proteins containing only the BH3 domain and members of this subgroup are usually referred to as \u201cBH3-only proteins.\u201d Their biological effect on the cell is pro-apoptotic. Bim, Bid, Bad, Bik, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, and Puma are examples of this third subfamily of proteins. The exact mechanism by which the Bcl-2 family proteins regulate cell death is still not entirely known and understanding this mechanism is an active area of research in the science community. In one hypothesis of regulation of cell death by Bcl-2 family proteins, the BH3-only proteins are further categorized as either \u201cactivator\u201d (e.g., Bim and Bid) or \u201csensitizer\u201d (e.g., Bad, Bik, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, and Puma) proteins depending on their regulatory function.","The key to tissue homeostasis is achieving the delicate balance in the interactions among the three subgroups of protein in cells. Recent studies have tried to elucidate the mechanisms by which pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic subgroups of Bcl-2 family proteins interact to allow a cell to undergo programmed cell death. After receiving intra- or extracellular signals in cells, post-translational or transcriptional activation of BH3-only proteins occurs. The BH3-only proteins are the primary inducers of an apoptotic cascade that includes, as one step, the activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak on the mitochondrial membrane in cells. Upon activation of Bax and\/or Bak that are either already anchored to the mitochondrial membrane or migrate to this membrane, Bax and\/or Bak oligomerize to result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the release of cytochrome C, and downstream activation of effector caspases, to ultimately result in cell apoptosis. Some researchers hypothesize that certain BH3-only proteins (e.g., Puma, Bim, Bid) are \u201cactivators\u201d in that these proteins directly engage pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to initiate MOMP, while other BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bad, Bik and Noxa) are \u201csensitizers\u201d and induce Bax and Bak oligomerization indirectly by binding anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1) and displacing and \u201cfreeing-up\u201d the \u201cactivator\u201d BH3-only proteins, which subsequently bind to and activate pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak) to induce cell death. Other researchers suggest that anti-apoptotic proteins engage and seqeuester Bax and Bak directly and all BH3-only proteins regulates this interaction by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1) which results in the release Bax and Bak. See, Adams, J. M. and Cory S. (2007) 26, 1324-1337; Willis, S. N. et al. (2007) 315, 856-859. Although the exact interactions through which the anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis remain under debate, there is a large body of scientific evidence to show that compounds which inhibit the binding of BH3-only proteins to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins promote apoptosis in cells.","Dysregulated apoptotic pathways have been implicated in the pathology of many significant diseases such as neurodegenerative conditions (up-regulated apoptosis), such as for example, Alzheimer's disease; and proliferative diseases (down-regulated apoptosis) such as for example, cancer, autoimmune diseases and pro-thrombotic conditions.","In one aspect, the implication that down-regulated apoptosis (and more particularly the Bcl-2 family of proteins) is involved in the onset of cancerous malignancy has revealed a novel way of targeting this still elusive disease. Research has shown, for example, the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are over-expressed in many cancer cell types. See, Zhang J. Y., , (2002) 1, 101; Kirkin, V. et al. (2004) 1644, 229-249; and Amundson, S. A. et al. (2000) 60, 6101-6110. The effect of this deregulation is the survival of altered cells which would otherwise have undergone apoptosis in normal conditions. The repetition of these defects associated with unregulated proliferation is thought to be the starting point of cancerous evolution. Additionally, research has shown that BH3-only proteins can act as tumor suppressors when expressed in diseased animals.","These findings as well as numerous others have made possible the emergence of new strategies in drug discovery for targeting cancer. If a small molecule that could mimic the effect of BH3-only proteins were able to enter the cell and overcome the anti-apoptotic protein over-expression, then it could be possible to reset the apoptotic process. This strategy can have the advantage that it can alleviate the problem of drug resistance which is usually a consequence of apoptotic deregulation (abnormal survival).","Researchers also have demonstrated that platelets also contain the necessary apoptotic machinery (e.g., Bax, Bak, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and APAF-1) to execute programmed cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although circulating platelet production is a normal physiological process, a number of diseases are caused or exacerbated by excess of, or undesired activation of, platelets. The above suggests that therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins in platelets and reducing the number of platelets in mammals maybe useful in treating pro-thrombotic conditions and diseases that are characterized by an excess of, or undesired activation of, platelets.","We have developed a class of small molecule BH3-only protein mimetics, i.e., ABT-737 and ABT-263, that bind strongly to a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL, but only weakly to Mcl-1 and A1, and exhibits mechanism-based cytotoxicity. These compounds were tested in animal studies and demonstrated cytotoxic activity in certain xenograft models as single agents, as well as enhanced the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents on other xenograft models when used in combination. See, Tse, C. et al. (2008) 68, 3421-3428; and van Delft, M. F. et al. (2006) 10, 389-399. These in vivo studies suggest the potential utility of inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins for the treatment of diseases that involve a dysregulated apoptotic pathway.","The natural expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins members vary in different cell types. For example, in young platelets, Bcl-xL protein is highly expressed and plays an important role in regulating cell death (life span) of platelets. Also, in certain cancer cell types, the cancer cell's survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over-expression of one or more anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. In view of the important role for Bcl-2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and normal (i.e., non-cancerous) cells, and the recognized inter-cell type variability of Bcl-2 family protein expression, it is advantageous to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein(s), for example, to an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that overexpressed in a certain cancer type. Such a selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting, by providing, for example, the flexibility to select a dosing regimen, a reduced on-target toxic effect in normal cells, among others (e.g., lymphopenia has been observed in Bcl-2 deficient mice). See, Nakayama, K. et al. (1994) 91, 3700-3704.","In view of the above, there is a need in the art for small molecules therapeutics that can selectively inhibit the activity of one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, for example, of a Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic protein. The present invention fulfills at least this need.","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL proteins, the compounds having Formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"32.94mm","wi":"71.29mm","file":"US08940737-20150127-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"X is heteroaryl;

Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term \u201cperfluoro\u201d means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term \u201cperfluoroalkyl\u201d means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.","The term \u201ccarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014.","The term \u201caminocarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014NH.","The term \u201coxo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means (\u2550O).","The term \u201coxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an ether substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014O\u2014.","The term \u201chydroxyalkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-OH.","The term \u201calkylamino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-NH.","The term \u201calkyloxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an alkylether substituent, i.e., \u2014O-alkyl.

Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. 64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., 77, 79-88 (1999).","In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called \u201cheavy drugs,\u201d can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl-xL activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic N et al. in \u201cDosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy\u201d, Zamenhof R, Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp. 125-134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).","Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.","Suitable groups for X, Y, L, Y, Z, R, R, K R, m, n, and p in compounds of Formula (I) are independently selected.

The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand. For example, siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT-263, (i.e., N-(4-(4-((2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1-cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(morpholin-4-yl)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide) or ABT-737 (i.e., N-(4-(4-((4\u2032-chloro(1,1\u2032-biphenyl)-2-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide) in multiple tumor cell lines (Tse et. al, 2008, 68(9), 3421 and references therein).","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.","Alkylating agents include

\u03bcM to 0.020 \u03bcl. Each concentration was tested in duplicate at least 3 separate times. The number of viable cells following 48 hours of compound treatment was determined using the CellTiter 96\u00ae Aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation MTS assay according to manufacturer's recommendations (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.). Molt-4 cell viability results (i.e. ECin micromolar) for certain compounds of Formula (I), (i.e., Examples 81, 82, 84, 87, 124, 130, 134, 145, 151, 152, 166, 179, and 186 in Table 2), are 0.33, 0.135, 0.501, 1.2, 2.7, 0.532, 0.029, 0.081, 0.014, 0.006, 0.586, 0.493, and 0.006, respectively.","The single dose pharmacokinetics of select compounds were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) after a 5 mg\/kg oral dose (n=3) (10% DMSO in PEG-400) administered by gavage or by 5 mg\/kg Rbolus dose (n=3) (10% DMSO in PEG-400). Compound and the internal standard were separated from each other and coextracted contaminants on a 50 mm\u00d73 mm Keystone Betasil CN 5 \u03bcm column with an acetonitrile\/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid mobile phase (50:50, by volume) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL\/min. Analysis was performed on a Sciex API3000 biomolecular mass analyzer with a heated nebulizer interface. Compound and internal standard peak areas were determined using Sciex MacQuan software. The plasma drug concentration of each sample was calculated by least-squares linear regression analysis (nonweighted) of the peak area ratio (parent\/internal standard) of the spiked plasma standards versus concentration. The plasma concentration data were submitted to multiexponential curve fitting using WinNonlin.3. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule for the plasma concentration-time profiles.","In pharmacology, bioavailability (BA) is a subcategory of absorption and is used to describe the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation, one of the principal pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. By definition, when a medication is administered intravenously, its bioavailability is 100% (see Griffin, J. P. The Textbook of Pharmaceutical Medicine (6th Ed.). New Jersey: BMJ Books). However, when a medication is administered via other routes (such as orally), its bioavailability generally decreases (due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism) and may vary from patient to patient. Bioavailability is one of the essential tools in pharmacokinetics, as bioavailability must be considered when calculating dosages for non-intravenous routes of administration. One way to calculate bioavailability of a drug or agent is by dividing the plasma concentration following an oral dose by the concentration following an intravenous dose dose. The oral bioavailability (as represented by % F) in Sprague-Dawley rats for representative compounds of the invention are provided below in Table 3.","In the drug discovery setting, it is generally accepted that Lipinski's \u201crule of 5\u201d predicts that poor oral absorption or poor permeation is likely when two or more of the following metrics are satisfied: i) there are more than 5 hydrogen bond donors, ii) the molecular weight is greater than 500, iii) there are greater than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (expressed as the sum of nitrogen and oxygen atoms), or iv) the calculated Log P (cLogP) is greater than 5 (Lipinski et al. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2001, 3-26). Indeed, the combination of high molecular weight (>500) and high cLogP (>5) is the best predictor of poor absorption or permeation. Compounds described herein generally exceed the recommended ranges pertaining to molecular weight (>500) and cLogP (>5), as shown in Table 3. It is notable, therefore, that Examples described herein have acceptable oral bioavailability in rats (as defined by % F>10, see Martin 2005, 48, 3164), as illustrated in Table 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0701","num":"1258"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PK Data, Rat p.o. dose"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Molecular",{},"F (%),"]},{"entry":[{},"EXAMPLE #","weight","cLogP","dose"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"5","600.7","6.6","19, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"12","614.7","6.7","29, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"19","600.7","6.5","22, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"20","600.7","6.5","17, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"22","656.8","6.1","27, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"23","572.6","6.5","20, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"25","621.1","7.0","24, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"37","612.7","6.7","29, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"63","592.7","6.8","20, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"70","632.8","7.8","21, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"73","642.7","6.8","19, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"74","660.7","7.3","23, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"82","620.8","7.9","45, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"88","650.8","7.0","23, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"89","674.8","6.3","13, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"90","664.8","7.2","44, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"91","616.7","7.2","16, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"93","644.7","6.4","33, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"97","678.8","7.7","33, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"99","714.8","6.7","19, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"101","680.8","6.7","40, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"103","598.7","8.4","39, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"106","596.7","8.4","24, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"107","616.8","9.6","14, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"110","612.7","8.6","36, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"114","618.7","8.6","38, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"119","622.7","8.4","54, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"122","587.7","5.8","40, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"129","624.7","7.0","17, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"130","630.6","7.8","32, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"131","713.9","6.0","11, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"134","678.9","8.0","50, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"146","692.9","8.4","16, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"147","692.9","8.5","37, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"148","756.0","7.0","18, 5 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"151","694.9","7.5","30, 1 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"154","608.72","5.7","22, 1 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"156","625.8","8.8","39, 1 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},"157","664.8","8.1","30, 1 mpk"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Data in Table 2 and cited Molt-4 data show the utility of compounds of the invention to functionally inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein in a cellular context.
