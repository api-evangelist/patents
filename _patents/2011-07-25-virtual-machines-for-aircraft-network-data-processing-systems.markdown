{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to aircraft and, in particular, to aircraft network data processing systems and software aircraft parts on aircraft. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for loading and operating a virtual machine on an aircraft network data processing system on an aircraft and for performing operations by a virtual machine on an aircraft or other vehicles.","2. Background","Modern aircraft are extremely complex. For example, an aircraft may have many types of electronic systems on-board. These systems are often in the form of line-replaceable units (LRUs). A line-replaceable unit is an item that can be removed and replaced from an aircraft. A line-replaceable unit is designed to be easily replaceable. A line-replaceable unit may be replaced when the aircraft is in flight or while the aircraft is on the ground. Line-replaceable units are typically packaged in a box and may be sealed.","A line-replaceable unit may take on various forms. A line-replaceable unit on an aircraft may be, for example, without limitation, a flight management system, an autopilot, an in-flight entertainment system, a communications system, a navigation system, a flight controller, a flight recorder, a collision avoidance system, a system to support maintenance functions, and a system to support crew processes. The various line-replaceable units on an aircraft may be parts of an aircraft network data processing system.","Line-replaceable units may use software or programming to provide the logic or control for various operations and functions. Typically, all software on an aircraft is treated as a separate part or is combined with a hardware part and is unchangeable without changing the hardware part number. Aircraft software that is treated as an aircraft part may be referred to as a loadable software aircraft part or a software aircraft part. Software aircraft parts are parts of an aircraft's configuration.","Aircraft operators are entities that operate aircraft. Aircraft operators also may be responsible for the maintenance and repair of aircraft. Examples of aircraft operators include airlines and military units. When an aircraft operator receives an aircraft, software aircraft parts may be already installed in the line-replaceable units on the aircraft.","An aircraft operator may also receive copies of these loaded software aircraft parts in case the parts need to be reinstalled or reloaded into the line-replaceable units on the aircraft. Reloading of software aircraft parts may be required, for example, if a line-replaceable unit in which the software is used is replaced or repaired. Further, the aircraft operator also may receive updates to the software aircraft parts from time to time. These updates may include additional features not present in the currently-installed software aircraft parts and may be considered upgrades to one or more line-replaceable units. Specified procedures may be followed during loading of a software aircraft part on an aircraft so that the current configuration of the aircraft, including all of the software aircraft parts loaded on the aircraft, is known.","In some cases, operations performed using some software aircraft parts may need to be isolated from operations performed using other software aircraft parts. In other cases, it may be desirable to control operations performed using some software aircraft parts based on a current state of the aircraft. Current systems and methods for providing such isolation and for controlling operations in an aircraft network data processing system rely extensively on computer hardware. These current systems and methods may be less effective and efficient than desired. In particular, more hardware on an aircraft means more weight. More weight on an aircraft increases fuel consumption and, therefore, reduces the aircraft operating efficiency and increases aircraft operating costs.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a method and apparatus that takes into account one or more of the issues discussed above, as well as possibly other issues.","An advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for operating a network data processing system on an aircraft. The method comprises performing a number of operations in a virtual machine on an aircraft. The virtual machine runs on a processor unit in the network data processing system on the aircraft to create a simulated computer environment and accesses resources of the processor unit for performing the number of operations using a host operating system on the processor unit. The method further comprises identifying, by the network data processing system, a current state of the aircraft, and managing the running of the virtual machine based on the current state of the aircraft and a policy for managing the virtual machine for different states of the aircraft.","Another advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure provides an apparatus comprising a first software aircraft part on a network data processing system on an aircraft. The first software aircraft part is a host operating system. The apparatus further comprises a number of second software aircraft parts on the network data processing system. The number of second software aircraft parts is configured to create a virtual machine. The apparatus further comprises a number of third software aircraft parts on the network data processing system. The number of third software aircraft parts is configured to perform a number of operations. The apparatus further comprises a processor unit on the network data processing system. The processor unit is configured to perform the number of operations in the virtual machine. The virtual machine is configured to run on the processor unit to create a simulated computer environment and to access resources of the processor unit for performing the number of operations using the host operating system on the processor unit. The apparatus further comprises a management module on the network data processing system. The management module is configured to manage the running of the virtual machine based on a current state of the aircraft and a policy for managing the virtual machine for different states of the aircraft.","Another advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure provides another method for operating a network data processing system on an aircraft. A first software aircraft part comprising a host operating system for a processor unit is loaded into transient storage in the network data processing system on the aircraft.","Software aircraft parts loaded into the transient storage are lost when the network data processing system is shut down. A second software aircraft part comprising a virtual machine template is loaded into the transient storage. The second software aircraft part is configured to provide virtual machine functions usable in a number of virtual machines having different configurations. A third software aircraft part comprising a configuration for a virtual machine is loaded into the transient storage. A number of fourth software aircraft parts configured to perform a number of operations are loaded into the transient storage. The host operating system and the virtual machine are run on the processor unit in the network data processing system on the aircraft from the first, second, and third software aircraft parts in the transient storage. The virtual machine comprises an instance of the virtual machine template having a configuration defined by the third software aircraft part. The number of operations are performed in the virtual machine using the number of fourth software aircraft parts in the transient storage. The virtual machine is configured to access resources of the processor unit for performing the number of operations using the host operating system on the processor unit.","The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.","The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account a number of different considerations. \u201cA number\u201d, as used herein with reference to items, means one or more items. For example, \u201ca number of different considerations\u201d are one or more different considerations.","The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that an aircraft network data processing system may need to support software applications of various types from various sources. Some of these applications may be neither written nor certified by the aircraft manufacturer. Often, such applications may make use of commercial off-the-shelf software that was not written with aircraft use in mind. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that a way is needed to separate these applications from other applications running on the aircraft network data processing system so that there is no risk that these applications could interfere with the operation of certified applications on the aircraft.","The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that current methods for separating operations in a network data processing system on an aircraft include running certain third party applications on separate computers. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that other methods for separating applications have relied upon applying specific and often onerous constraints in the form of applications that may be hosted on the aircraft network data processing system. For example, when software applications that may not be fully certified are to be hosted on a line-replaceable unit on an aircraft along with certified functions, the developers of such applications are forced to conform to very restrictive application programming interfaces and other technological constraints. Line-replaceable unit operating system permissions and scheduling then may be relied upon to contain the applications.","The different advantageous embodiments also recognize and take into account that any solution that overcomes the limitations of current systems and methods for separating operations on aircraft network data processing systems and controlling such operations based on aircraft states must adhere to accepted methodologies for loading data onto an aircraft. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that accepted methodologies require that software and other data is loaded onto the aircraft network data processing system as discrete software aircraft parts. The configuration of the aircraft may then be reported in terms of the software aircraft parts that are installed on the aircraft.","The different advantageous embodiments also recognize and take into account that virtualization of traditional computer operating systems has been used in fixed ground-based information technology systems. However, conventional virtualization has not been applied on aircraft, because conventional information technology approaches used in ground-based systems do not fit well with the packaging and management requirements for software used on an aircraft.","Thus, one or more of the advantageous embodiments provide a system and method for loading and operating virtual machines in a network data processing system on an aircraft. Virtual machines may be implemented on the aircraft using a number of software aircraft parts. Therefore, conventional methodologies for loading software onto an aircraft and maintaining an accurate record of the aircraft configuration may be employed. The use of virtual machines on the aircraft provides for the separation of operations in the aircraft network data processing system without the use of additional hardware or stringent limitations on software implementation. The running of the virtual machines on the aircraft may be managed based on the current state of the aircraft. In this manner, policies restricting operations that may be performed on the aircraft network data processing system with respect to certain aircraft states may be effectively and efficiently implemented.","Turning to , a block diagram of a software aircraft part management environment for managing software parts on the ground and on an aircraft is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, software aircraft part management environment  may include number of software suppliers .

These operations may affect the performance or safety of aircraft . Operations performed using software aircraft parts  that are not specifically designed for aircraft  or that are not certified for use on aircraft  in particular may affect other operations on aircraft  in an unwanted manner.","Therefore, separating the performance of some operations on aircraft  from the performance of other operations on aircraft  may be desirable. Separating the operations may reduce the potential for unwanted effects during operation of aircraft . Furthermore, restricting the performance of some operations on aircraft  during certain states of operation of aircraft  also may be desirable. For example, it may be desirable to restrict the performance of some operations on aircraft  when aircraft  is in a state where any unwanted effects of such operations are most likely to occur or most likely to be significant.","Turning to , a block diagram of an aircraft is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, aircraft  is an example of one implementation of aircraft  in . Aircraft  is an example of vehicle  in which advantageous embodiments may be implemented.

Virtual machine  accesses resources of one of processor units  on which it is running to perform the operations for applications . Virtual machine  accesses resources of one of processor units  on which it is running using host operating system .","Virtual machine  is a software implementation of a machine that executes programs, such as a physical machine. Therefore, applications  may be run on virtual machine  as if they were running directly on physical hardware. However, virtual machine  provides an isolated operating system installation within host operating system . Access to resources of one of processor units  on which applications  are running may be managed at a more restrictive level for virtual machine . Therefore, operations performed in virtual machine  may be separated from other operations performed on one of processor units . Separating the operations may prevent the operations performed in virtual machine  from affecting other operations in unwanted ways.","Aircraft configuration  includes aircraft network data processing system hardware  and software aircraft parts  that are on aircraft .

In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, multiple virtual machines may be implemented on the multiple networked processor units to perform various operations. In this case, the virtual machines across multiple processor units  may be formed in a number of virtual networks that are overlaid on the physical network. The virtual machines and virtual networks may be separated from the physical processor units  and the aircraft network data processing system hardware  forming the physical network.

Thus, performing operations  in virtual machine  provides a convenient way to selectively stop performance of some operations  without also stopping performance of other operations  on the same processor unit  in an aircraft network data processing system.","For example, it may be desirable to stop performance of operations  if a particular current state of the aircraft is identified. Performance of operations  may be restarted in response to a subsequent further change in the state of the aircraft. In this case, operations  may be restarted by restarting virtual machine . Performing operations  in virtual machine  provides a way to restart operations  more quickly and efficiently in response to a change in the current state of the aircraft than would be possible if restarting operations  required restarting a computer or other hardware platform on which operations  were implemented.","Use of virtual machines in an aircraft network data processing system is not limited to a single processor unit.

In this example, aircraft states  is an example of states for aircraft state  in .","Aircraft states  may include various phases of flight  of an aircraft. For example, phases of flight  may include, without limitation, at least one of taxi , takeoff , climb , cruise , descent , landing , and at the gate . Aircraft states  may include location  of the aircraft. Location  may include the geographic location of the aircraft. Location  also may include other parameters related to the location of the aircraft in space, such as the altitude or orientation of the aircraft in space.","Aircraft states  also may include, without limitation, engine conditions , outside conditions , cabin conditions , network conditions , and conditions of other aircraft systems . For example, without limitation, engine conditions  may comprise at least one of engine temperature, engine pressure, and other engine parameters at one or more locations within an engine of the aircraft. For example, without limitation, outside conditions  may comprise at least one of temperature, pressure, and other conditions outside of the aircraft.","Cabin conditions  may comprise, for example, without limitation, at least one of temperature, pressure, and other conditions within the aircraft passenger or crew cabin, or both. For example, without limitation, network conditions  may include conditions on the aircraft network data processing system, such as the volume of data traffic on the network, the presence or absence of various alerts, or other parameters indicating conditions in the aircraft network data processing system, such as whether the aircraft is in a data load or maintenance mode.","Turning to , a block diagram of virtual machine management policies is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, virtual machine management policies  is an example of one implementation of virtual machine management policies  in . Virtual machine management policies  define policies for managing the running of a number of virtual machines on a network data processing system on an aircraft with respect to states of the aircraft. For example, virtual machine management policies  may define whether or not particular virtual machines on an aircraft network data processing system should be running for a particular aircraft state. If a particular virtual machine should be running for a particular aircraft state, virtual machine management policies  may define the parameters of operation of the virtual machine for that aircraft state. Virtual machine management policies  may be defined with respect to a current aircraft state or with respect to changes in a current aircraft state, or both.","For example, without limitation, virtual machine management policies  may include policies for running a virtual machine  or not running a virtual machine  for identified current aircraft states. Virtual machine management policies  may include policies for stopping a virtual machine  and starting a virtual machine  in response to identified changes in the current aircraft state.","Virtual machine management policies  may include policies defining operating parameters of a virtual machine  for a given current aircraft state. For example, without limitation, policies defining operating parameters of a virtual machine  may include policies defining allowed access by a virtual machine to resources in the aircraft network data processing system for a given current aircraft state.","Virtual machine management polices  may include policies defining configuration of a virtual network  for a given current aircraft state. Virtual machine management policies  also or alternatively may include other policies  for managing the running of virtual machines in the aircraft network data processing system based on the current state of the aircraft or a change in the current state of the aircraft, or both.","For example, without limitation, certain software aircraft parts on a network data processing system on an aircraft may perform operations that provide interfaces to the aircraft network data processing system for wireless devices used by passengers in the passenger cabin of a commercial aircraft. These operations may not be considered operations that are critical to the safe and effective operation of the aircraft. The software aircraft parts for implementing these operations may include commercial off-the-shelf software or otherwise may include software that may not be fully certified for use in an aircraft.","In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, these operations may be performed in a virtual machine on the aircraft network data processing system. Performing these operations on a virtual machine separates these operations from other operations on the aircraft network data processing system so that the operations supporting wireless device use by aircraft passengers do not affect other potentially more-critical operations in unwanted ways.","It may be desired that wireless device use by aircraft passengers is not supported during certain aircraft states. For example, during certain aircraft phases of flight, wireless device use by aircraft passengers may be more likely to interfere with aircraft operation. In this case, virtual machine management policies  may be established for running a virtual machine  performing the operations supporting wireless use by the passengers only during some phases of flight and for otherwise not running a virtual machine  during other phases of flight.","For example, without limitation, virtual machine management policies  may indicate a policy for running a virtual machine  if the current state of the aircraft indicates a phase of flight of cruise or at the gate. If the current aircraft state indicates either of these phases of flight and the virtual machine is not already running, the virtual machine may be started automatically.","Virtual machine management policies  may indicate a policy for not running a virtual machine  if the current state of the aircraft indicates a phase of flight of taxi, takeoff, climb, descent, or landing. If the current aircraft state indicates any one of these phases of flight and the virtual machine is running, the virtual machine may be stopped automatically.","Turning to , a block diagram of loadable software aircraft parts in an aircraft network data processing system is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment.

For example, without limitation, transient storage  may include memory or other transient storage associated with a processor unit on the aircraft network data processing system.","Transient storage  may also include memory that has been temporarily swapped out to a swap partition on persistent storage . Memory that is swapped out in this manner may be managed by the main host operating system. Therefore, transient storage  need not be limited to the size of physical memory. Software aircraft parts loaded into transient storage  are lost when the aircraft network data processing system is shut down.","Host operating system loadable software aircraft part  is loaded in transient storage  to provide host operating system  for the processor unit. Depending on the operating system used, host operating system loadable software aircraft part  may include virtualization support .
