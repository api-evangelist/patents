title: Methods and systems for drag and drop content sharing in a multi-device environment
abstract: Methods and systems for interacting with graphical user interface elements to invoke commands and initiate requests in a multi-device environment are described. Content from a first set top box is received at a mobile computing device having a touchscreen. The touchscreen is then used by the user to drag-and-drop a first graphical user interface element representing the content to over a second graphical user interface element. This causes the content to be shared from the first set top box to a second set top box, the second set top box automatically initiating download of the content.

No. 61\/381,392, filed on Sep. 9, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure generally relates to digital media content systems and applications. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods and systems for interacting with graphical user interface elements to invoke commands and initiate requests in a multi-device environment.","With the increasing popularity of powerful, full-featured, mobile computing devices, including smart phones, tablet computers, and personal media players, and the merging of networked computers and large screen displays (e.g., television monitors), content consumers have increasingly complex choices when it comes to how and when they consume digital media content. Moreover, the number and types of content sources have increased significantly as well. For example, content consumers generally have a choice for television programming between over-the-air programming, cable television programming, satellite broadcast programming, and even Internet, or IPTV (Internet Protocol) programming. Additionally, the World Wide Web continues to expand its video capabilities with ever-expanding options for rich video content.","Methods and systems for interacting with graphical user interface elements to invoke commands and initiate requests in a multi-device environment are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","For purposes of the present disclosure, the term \u201cmobile computing device\u201d is meant to include mobile phones (frequently referred to as smart phones) as well as other general purpose or application specific computing devices that include wireless data networking functionality, with or without voice-based phone functionality, such as certain tablet computing devices and portable media player devices. Skilled artisans will immediately recognize that certain mobile computing devices, such as iPhone\u00ae, iPod\u00ae and iPad\u00ae devices, developed by and available from Apple Corporation of Cupertino, Calif., as well as any one of a wide variety of devices based on the Android\u2122 operating system developed by Google, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., fall within the intended definition of a mobile computing device. A great number of other mobile computing devices, with other operating systems, will also be applicable to the inventive subject matter, which is described at length below in connection with the description of the various figures.","Consistent with some example embodiments, a digital content browsing and viewing application resides and executes on a mobile computing device that has a touch screen display. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the content browsing and viewing application (hereinafter, \u201cthe content viewing application\u201d) includes various graphical user interface elements. For instance, the content viewing application will generally include one or more content or video windows in which content is displayed and\/or video is presented. In addition, the content viewing application includes icons that are representative of content and other real-world entities, including networked hardware devices, and\/or individual friends, family members and groups of people. The mobile computing device includes a data communications module and\/or network interface that facilitates the exchange of data with other networked hardware devices over any number of data communication channels, including local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). For instance, consistent with one example embodiment, the mobile computing device includes a WiFi\u00ae network connection (e.g., IEEE 802.11) to a set top box, which may be connected to a large screen display. In addition, with some example embodiments, the mobile computing device includes the necessary radio transceiver and support for communication protocols for communicating data over various wide area networks (WANs), such as conventional GSM, LTE, WiMAX (e.g., IEEE 802.16), or other mobile data networks. Accordingly, the mobile computing device may communicate with a set top box over a WAN even when the mobile computing device is not in the same geographical location as the set top box, thereby enabling geographically remote control over certain functionality. Within this environment of networked devices, a user can quickly and easily perform a variety of operations by simply manipulating a graphical user interface element on the touch screen display of the mobile computing device, as described in greater detail below.","For instance, consistent with one example embodiment, a user may press and hold his finger on a first GUI element displayed on the touch screen device, such as a content or video window, while dragging, or otherwise moving his finger to \u201cpull\u201d the first GUI element and then lift his finger as if to \u201cdrop\u201d the element on top of a second GUI element\u2014such manipulation commonly referred to as a \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d operation. By dragging and dropping a first GUI element over the top of a second GUI element, the user can invoke a wide variety of operations that intuitively make sense to the user based on what the various GUI elements represent. For instance, in some example embodiments, dragging and dropping a content or video window over a GUI element representing a person, or group of people (such as the case may be with a buddy list) may automatically invoke an operation to share the content or video currently being displayed or presented in the content or video window of the content viewing application executing on the mobile computing device, with a particular person associated with the second GUI element. More precisely, the currently displayed content or video may be shared with a particular hardware device associated with (e.g., owned by) the person associated with second GUI element.","In yet another example, the user of the content viewing application may drag and drop a content or video window over a second GUI element (e.g., icon) representing a separate hardware device, such as a large screen display, a digital video recorder, or desktop computer. Depending upon the configuration settings or profile associated with each individual icon, the operation that is invoked by dragging and dropping the content or video window may vary. For instance, an icon representing a large screen display may have a profile with configuration settings that allow the icon to be configured such that, when a user \u201cdrops\u201d a content or video window on the icon for the large screen display, the content or video currently being displayed or presented in the content or video window of the mobile computing device is automatically displayed or presented on the large screen display. Similarly, an icon for a digital video recorder (DVR) may be configured such that dropping a content or video window on the icon for the DVR automatically schedules a recording of the content or video being displayed or presented via the content viewing application executing on the mobile computing device.","Consistent with some embodiments, the various GUI elements that represent hardware devices, or persons on a buddy list, will have or be associated with profiles consisting of easily manipulated configuration settings that enable the user, or an administrator, to quickly and easily define the operations that are to occur when certain GUI elements are \u201cdropped\u201d on the representative icons. For instance, an icon for a set top box may be configured to invoke a variety of operations when a user drops a content or video window on the respective icon. The profile of the set top box icon may be configured to invoke a command to schedule a recording of the video being presented in a video window of the content video window. Alternatively, the profile of the set top box icon may be configured to invoke a command to automatically display or otherwise present the content or video that is dragged onto the set top box icon. With some embodiments, a single default operation is defined to occur when a video or content window is dropped on a GUI element. However, as described in more detail below, with some example embodiments, a list or menu of selectable operations may be displayed when a video or content window is dropped on a particular GUI element or icon.","For instance, consistent with some example embodiments, various icons representative of networked hardware components or people may be configured to display a pop-up list or menu of possible operations when a content or video window, or another GUI element representative of some content, is dragged and dropped onto the icon. For instance, when a GUI element representative of some content is dropped on a set top box icon, a menu may be displayed allowing the user to select whether the content is to be recorded for subsequent viewing, or whether the content is to be instantly displayed or presented on a large screen display connected to the set top box. Of course, icons for other devices may be associated with a wide variety of other functions that are supported by the various hardware devices being represented by the icons. As such, the list of operations that is displayed for a particular icon will vary based on the functionality of the hardware device represented by the icon. With some embodiments, icons may be displayed to represent separate functions of the same hardware device. For example, a set top box may have a first icon representing a digital video recording (DVR) capability, such that when a content item is dropped onto the icon, a DVR functionality is automatically invoked. In addition, the set top box may be connected to a large display, and therefore may have a separate icon representing the display. When a content item is dropped on this icon, the default operation that is invoked may cause the respective content to be automatically presented or displayed via the display connected to the set top box.","As described in greater detail below, when the content viewing application residing and executing on the mobile computing device detects that an operation has been invoked by a drag and drop action, the content viewing application generates one or more commands based on configuration settings for the relevant GUI elements, and communicates the commands over a network to the relevant hardware devices. For instance, if a user drags and drops a GUI element representative of content onto an icon representative of a person in a buddy list for the purpose of sharing the content with the person, the content viewing application analyzes the configuration settings of the target icon (e.g., the icon representative of the person), generates a command that identifies the relevant content (e.g., with a content identifier) and communicates the command over a network to a networked hardware device associated with the target icon. In some example embodiments, the command may be communicated over a network directly to a remote set top box of the person associated with the icon in the buddy list (i.e., the person with whom the content is being shared). Alternatively, with some example embodiments, the command may be communicated directly to a local set top box, or to a content management server, either one of which will process the command and communicate a subsequent command to the appropriate hardware device of the person with whom the content is being shared.","Consistent with some example embodiments, the various hardware devices that can be controlled, or with which content can be shared, will each include a software module for receiving, transmitting, processing and\/or interpreting commands that may be generated via another compatible networked device. Moreover, with some embodiments, the mobile computing device may invoke commands over a wide area network (e.g., such as the Internet), using a mobile data connection (e.g., GSM, LTE or WiMAX). Accordingly, a user of the content viewing application on the mobile computing device may share content even when the user is away from his set top box, and remotely schedule a recording on a compatible set top box or DVR device. Furthermore, the content that can be shared may be content that is directly communicated to the mobile computing device, such as the case may be with a web page, or web-based video and audio streaming content. Alternatively, the content that may be shared via the content viewing application may be received at the mobile computing device directly from a set top box, which in turn receives the content from a centralized content provider with which the user has subscribed (such as a cable, satellite or Internet service or programming provider).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","1","10","2","10","3","12","14","16","18","14","14","1","12","16"]},"In some example embodiments, the set top box  may be configured to receive content via a cable, satellite or Internet programming provider. As such, the content management server  may receive, process, aggregate and distribute content from a wide variety of content providers. This content may be communicated first to the set top box, and then over a LAN or WAN to the mobile computing device for display via the content viewing application. Accordingly, with some example embodiments, the content viewing application on the mobile computing device is configured to browse and view content directly from the set top box . In addition, the content viewing application may include web browsing functionality, enabling a user to browse web content and view video content delivered via the World Wide Web. The content viewing application may also include a media player module capable of processing and displaying content from one or more video on demand sources. In general, the content viewing application  is designed to process and present (e.g., display or playback) a wide variety of content, to include web content, video content and audio content.","Although  shows a single network cloud, the network cloud  may consist of several interconnected networks, including wired and wireless networks, public and private networks, conventional Internet Protocol (IP) networks as well as mobile data networks and\/or packet based networks. At any given time, the mobile computing device may be connected to one or more devices, such as the set top box , via a home network of the user, as well as a WAN.","Consistent with some embodiments of the invention, a buddy list or other type of social network may be facilitated by the content management server . For instance, all subscribers to the content provider operating the content management server  may be provided with a personal username or other personal identifier. The content management server  may include a web server, enabling users to specify other friends and family members, and define groups of people, that are arranged and organized into a buddy list. In some embodiments, the buddy list may be accessed and managed via the set top box (e.g., via the display connected to the set top box), via the content viewing application executing on the mobile computing device, or from a conventional web browser executing on another computing device (not shown). The buddy list may be centralized and managed via the content management server, or in some instances, a third party service, such that changes and modifications made from any device will automatically be reflected in all other devices.","With some embodiments, the content management server  includes personal and\/or device profiles  that reflect various user preferences and\/or device capabilities. Accordingly, with some embodiments, commands that are generated for sharing content may be communicated to the content management server and processed in accordance with various preferences defined by the personal profile (e.g., profile -) of the person with whom the content is being shared. For example, a subscriber may configure his personal profile (e.g., profile -) to indicate a device (e.g., a mobile phone) where alerts and notifications should be communicated, when content is received from other subscribers. Accordingly, when a user of the content viewing application drags and drops a content icon (representative of some content) onto a buddy list icon, with some embodiments, a command may be communicated to the content management server (either directly via a WAN, or indirectly through the set top box connected via a LAN). The command may identify the target (e.g., the person with whom the content is being shared) by his or her subscriber ID, email, username or some other identifying mechanism. In addition, the command may identify the content being shared by a content identifier. The content management server will then analyze the received command, including the identifying mechanism for the target user. The content management server will then process the command in accordance with the personal profile and\/or a device profile of the target user (e.g., profile -). If, for example, the target user has blocked content sharing from a particular user, the content management server may notify the user who has attempted to share the content without further processing the command. Similarly, if the target user has requested that a message (e.g., email, SMS, instant message, or similar) be directed to a particular device when a content sharing request is processed, the content management server may generate and transmit the appropriate message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","4","20","22","24","26","20","22","24","20","28","1","28","2","28","3","28","4","28","5","20"]},"At the bottom of the user interface there is shown a buddy list with three icons representing three persons in the buddy list\u2014for example, John -, Fred - and Sally -. If a user of the content viewing application desires to share a content item represented by any visible content or video window (e.g., content windows -, -, -, -, - or ), the user can simply press on the content window, and then move his or her finger (e.g., dragging or pulling) the content window over a particular buddy with whom the user would like to share the content. When this occurs, the content viewing application detects the drag and drop action, invokes an operation to generate a command in accordance with the particular profile (e.g., profile -) or configuration settings of the respective target icon and content or video window, and directs the command to an appropriate hardware device for further processing.","By way of example, consider the case where the user has dragged the active content window  to the icon - representing the user's friend, John. When the content viewing application detects the drag and drop action, the content viewing application will generate a command in accordance with the profile - or configuration settings for the icon - for John. In some embodiments, the configuration settings for the icon - are locally stored at the mobile computing device . The configuration settings for the icon - will specify how the sharing operation is to occur, and thereby affect the resulting command that is to be generated. First, the configuration settings may indicate the type of operation that is to occur for the icon -. For example, given that the icon represents a friend, the operation type may indicate a sharing operation. The configuration settings for the icon - may specify other instructions for how the sharing operation is to occur. For instance, the configuration settings may indicate that an actual copy of the content is to be communicated to a particular device owned by John, such as his set top box. Alternatively, the configuration settings for the icon may indicate that a link or other type of pointer, such as a content identifier and\/or content source identifier be communicated to one of John's devices, such that John will be able to automatically retrieve a copy of the shared content at a time and location of John's choosing. As such, the various configuration settings for the icon may control what is shared (e.g., actual content, or a link to content), and to what specific device the content is to be directed (e.g., John's set top box, mobile phone, tablet computer, etc.).","With some embodiments, the icon - may not have any associated configuration settings residing locally at the mobile computing device. Consequently, the user of the mobile computing device may have less control over the sharing operation. Instead, the generated sharing command that results from the drag and drop action may be automatically directed to a local set top box, or a centralized content management server, where the command is further processed in accordance with preferences established by John. For instance, with some embodiments, John may establish various preferences as part of a personal and\/or device profile - that indicate how content sharing requests\/commands are to be handled. For example, John may specify that all shared content is to be immediately loaded to his set top box, and an alert or notification is to be sent to his mobile device to alert him of the shared content. Alternatively, John may specify that only a link or address where the content can be accessed is to be communicated to his tablet computer, or desktop computer, and so on. As such, with some embodiments, John can control how content sharing occurs by specifying various preferences that are part of a personal user profile, or device profile (e.g., profile -).","In yet another example embodiment, the configuration settings associated with a particular icon (e.g., profile - which may be associated with Icon - for buddy, John, in ) may be stored on the set top box . Accordingly, when a drag and drop action is detected, a command may be routed to the network-connected set top box, which will further process the sharing command in accordance with configuration settings associated with the icon that is representative of John. In this way, multiple devices (e.g., mobile computing devices, laptop computer, desktop computer, etc.) may all utilize the centrally located configuration settings for different icons residing at the set top box. In yet other example embodiments, certain preferences or configuration settings may be locally established, for example, with a profile (e.g., profile -) associated with the icon stored at the mobile computing device, while other preferences or configuration settings are stored centrally, either at the content management server  or the set top box . As such, with some embodiments, certain aspects of the sharing operation may be controlled or managed by the person sharing the content, while other aspects of the sharing operation may be under the control of the person with whom the content is being shared.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["22","20","29","1","29","2","29","3","29","4","29","5","16","29","1","29","2","29","3","29","4","29","5","30"]},"By way of example, consider the case when a user drags and drops the active video window  onto the icon - representing the plasma screen in the living room. By default, the icon may be configured to invoke a command that results in the content being presented in the active video window to automatically be presented on the plasma screen. For instance, when the content viewing application detects the drag and drop action, the content application may generate a command with the relevant content identifier, and communicate the command to the appropriate device, requesting that the device display the content on the plasma screen. In some cases, the appropriate device may be the plasma screen itself, assuming that it has built-in networking, channel tuning, and computer processing capabilities. In other instances, the command may be directed to a set top box to which the plasma screen is connected. The set top box, upon receiving the command, will process the command to tune the correct channel, and output the correct signal on the output to which the plasma screen is connected.","In another example, consider the case when a user drags and drops the active video window onto the icon representing the DVR -. By default, the content viewing application may invoke a command to have the DVR record the content that is being presented in the active video window. As described in connection with , in some instances, an additional user interface element may be displayed when the drag and drop action is detected. For example, the additional user interface element may simply be a pop-up or text box that describes the operation that has been invoked, and requests that the user press a virtual button to confirm that the operation is to be executed. Alternatively, the additional user interface element may provide a list of operations that can be invoked, as described in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["30","34","34","36","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["14","41","14","14","40","42","42","40","14","44"]},"As illustrated in , the mobile computing device  includes a speaker and microphone  for use in presenting audio and video content. In some embodiments, the microphone  may be used to sense audible spoken commands. The mobile computing device also includes an accelerometer  and a gyroscope . The accelerometer  and gyroscope  may be used to detect changes in the orientation of the mobile computing device , and thereby trigger manipulations to the user interface.","In addition, the mobile computing device  includes a touch screen display  for displaying content and various graphical user interface elements, and sensing the position of an user's touch on the display screen. Accordingly, a user may perform certain gestures (e.g., such as finger swipes) to manipulate the UI, and in particular browse content in the content carousels. In addition, the touch screen display is used to sense the dragging and dropping of one user interface element onto another, thereby invoking various commands.","Consistent with some embodiments, the mobile computing device  includes one or more radio transceiver modules  and one or more antennas  for sending and receiving wireless data communications. For example the radio transceiver module  may facilitate voice and\/or data communications over a wireless telephone network, a wireless data network (e.g., Wi-Fi\u00ae or IEEE 802 compatible network), or a Bluetooth\u00ae network.","Although not shown in , the mobile computing device may include an infrared port for communicating commands via an infrared signal to nearby hardware devices. For instance, with some embodiments, upon detecting a drag and drop action, the content viewing application may invoke a command that is communicated via an IR port to a set top box, television, or other hardware device capable of receiving and processing commands via infrared.","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. Accordingly, the modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or at a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a service, for example, such as in the context of \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., Application Program Interfaces (APIs).)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
