title: Spatially controlled atomic layer deposition in porous materials
abstract: Methods for the selective deposition of materials within a porous substrate. The methods use the passivating effects of masking precursors applied to the porous substrate. A portion of a pore surface within the substrate is masked by exposing the substrate to one or more masking precursors. The depth of the pore surface that is masked is controllable by regulating the exposure of the substrate to the masking precursor. Application of the masking precursor prevents adsorption of one or more subsequently applied metal precursors about a portion of the pore surface coated by the masking precursor. Less than an entirety of the unmasked pore surface is coated by the metal precursor, forming a metal stripe on a portion of the pore surface. The depth of the metal stripe is controllable by regulating exposure of the porous substrate to the metal precursor. Subsequent exposure of the substrate to a saturating water application oxidizes the deposited precursors.

More particularly, the invention is directed toward methods of ALD for depositing uniform films at controlled depths and widths within the pores of various porous substrates through application of passivating precursors.","ALD is a thin film growth method using alternating, self limiting reactions between gaseous precursors and a solid surface to deposit materials in an atomic layer-by-layer fashion. These attributes allow highly conformal and uniform films to be deposited on complex, three-dimensional substrates such as aerogels, powders, and anodic aluminum oxide (\u201cAAO\u201d) membranes useful in numerous applications. For instance, functionalization of a porous substrate by ALD allows for the synthesis of useful catalytic materials. It would be advantageous to construct catalytic structures with localized regions of different catalytic materials in a specific sequence along the internal walls of the nanopores of a substrate. Such structures could afford precise control over a multi-step catalytic process because the reacting feed stream would encounter the different catalytic sites in a predetermined order. It also might be useful in creating internal wiring structures for solar to fuels devices.","Heretofore, conventional ALD on porous substrates resulted in uniform infiltration of the deposited material into the entirety of the porous substrate, forming a uniform coating on all of the interior surfaces. Although a variety of techniques have been developed to allow patterning of ALD films using masking or passivating agents, these techniques are limited to planar substrates. For example, self assembled monolayers of long-chained, hydrophobic alkanes such as docosyltrichlorosilane (\u201cDTS\u201d) have been used as a masking agent for selective ALD of zinc oxide. However, such techniques are limited to depositing a mask pattern on a flat surface.","Thus, there is a need for methods capable of precisely applying various materials at localized regions within nano-porous materials. It is desirable to overcome limitations, such as those described above, to facilitate fabrication of structures having one or more coatings within nano-porous materials.","The methods of the present invention permit selective deposition of materials using ALD techniques at controlled depths on complex geometries within a porous substrate. The methods rely on the passivating effects of one or more masking precursors applied to the porous substrate. A portion of a pore surface within the substrate can be masked by exposing the substrate to one or more masking precursors. By regulating exposure of the substrate to the masking precursor, the depth of the pore surface that becomes masked is controllable. Application of the masking precursor prevents adsorption of one or more subsequently applied metal precursors along the portion of the pore surface coated by the masking precursor. The metal precursor reacts with and coats an unmasked portion of the pore surface. By regulating exposure of the porous substrate to the metal precursor, less than an entirety of the unmasked pore surface is coated by the metal; and a metal stripe is deposited on a portion of the pore surface. The depth of the metal stripe is controllable by regulating exposure of the substrate to the metal precursor. The depth of the masking precursors, thereby the position of the metal precursor, and the depth of the metal precursor are attributable to Knudsen diffusion effects, wherein diffusion through nanopores is related to the exposure time of the nanopores to the reactants, the partial pressure of the reactants, the mass of the reactants, and the temperature. Subsequent exposure of the substrate to a saturating application of water vapor or other oxygen-containing precursor vapor removes the ligands from the deposited metal precursors and prepares the growing film for subsequent deposition.","In one embodiment, the method is used to deposit one or more stripes of metal oxide on the pore surfaces of an AAO membrane. The AAO membrane pores can be coated with stripes of various metal oxides, such as, but not limited to, ZnO, TiO, MgO, VOand NbO. The location and depth of the metal oxide stripes within the pores is controlled by regulating the ALD timing sequence, thereby masking one or more portions of the pore surface by first exposing the AAO membrane to a masking precursor such as trimethyl aluminum (TMA). Multiple distinct metal oxide stripes are formed on portions of the pore surface by further controlling exposure of the masking precursor and the metal precursor sequences.","In addition to forming stripes of metal oxides in porous materials, this method can also be used to deposit stripes of metals, metal nitrides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, metal carbides, and other ALD materials.","In another embodiment, the method is used to deposit a stripe of metal oxide within a nano-porous particle, such as, but not limited to, a silica gel. The location and depth of the metal oxide stripe, such as a ZnO stripe, is formed in the nano-porous particle by regulating the ALD timing sequence.","The present invention is useful in a number of commercial applications. For example, the methods may be employed to synthesize nano-porous catalytic membranes that permit control over sequential catalytic processes or the spatial location of the catalysts. As another example, the methods may be employed to synthesize catalysts from nano-porous particles in which the active catalyst is applied as a stripe or concentric shell below the level of the surface. In this way, the active catalyst which might be a precious metal, such as platinum, is protected from mechanical attrition. The methods are also useful, but not limited to, the fabrication of catalysts, sensors, separations membranes, electron multipliers, solar cells, and nuclear fuel assemblies.","These and other objects, advantages and features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention relates to methods of preparing patterned growth of one or more ALD materials in porous substrates and the resulting structures. In one embodiment, an ALD film is deposited on a supported AAO membrane  positioned in a viscous flow reactor  having a first end  and a second end , as depicted in . Ultrahigh purity nitrogen carrier gas and ALD reactants enter the viscous flow reactor  from the first end . In one embodiment, the nitrogen carrier gas is applied with a mass flow rate of about 360 sccm and a pressure of about 1 Torr. Nitrogen purge gas enters the viscous flow reactor  from the second end  as depicted in .","The supported. AAO membrane  is prepared from high purity aluminum metal disks using conventional methods of electrochemical anodization. One method of preparing the AAO membrane  is described in detail in Example 1 below. In general, an anodization procedure yields an AAO membrane having well-ordered pore arrays comprising a plurality of nanopores  orientated substantially normal to the major plane of the AAO membrane , as shown in  and further depicted in . As shown in , the anodization procedure can be performed such that a free-standing AAO membrane  can be formed within the annulus of an integral aluminum sealing ring . In this way, a gas-tight seal to the AAO membrane  in the viscous flow reactor  can be achieved by using commercially available face-seal fittings.","One or more films can be deposited within the plurality of the nanopores  by ALD. For example, a zinc oxide film can be applied by exposing a hydroxylated surface of the AAO membrane  to diethyl zinc (\u201cDEZ\u201d), which reacts with and coats the walls of the plurality of the nanopores . Subsequently presenting the AAO membrane  with a saturating water exposure forms a zinc oxide coating within the nanopores . Similarly, the deposition coating process can be carried out for other metals, such as, but not limited to, titanium, magnesium, vanadium, and niobium, with their respective oxides formed upon a saturating application of water vapor or exposure to other oxygen-containing vapor. In addition to forming stripes of metal oxides in porous materials, this method can also be used to deposit stripes of metals, metal nitrides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, metal carbides, and other ALD materials.","In one embodiment, the position and depth of the metal oxide coating within the plurality of the nanopores  can be controlled through exposure of the AAO membrane  to a precursor. Application of the precursor causes the nanopore surface to be unreactive towards the chemisorption of the subsequently applied metal. For example, prior exposure of the AAO membrane  to trimethyl aluminum (\u201cTMA\u201d) prevents the usual reaction of DEZ with the nanopore surface. This effect can be combined with the fact known in the art that the infiltration of a nano-porous material under normal ALD conditions occurs via Knudsen diffusion in which the reactive sites in the nanopores  tend to react in order starting from the entrance of the pore.","As illustrated in , by limiting the exposure time of the membrane  to the precursor, e.g. TMA, a masking stripe  forms on a portion of a pore wall  of the nanopores . As a consequence of the Knudsen diffusion effect, the masking stripe  begins at a pore entrance  and proceeds to a depth dalong the pore wall . Subsequent exposure of the AAO membrane  with the second precursor, e.g. DEZ, coats a portion of the pore wall, commencing at depth d. The masking stripe  makes a portion of the pore wall  unreactive to the second precursor from the surface of the AAO membrane  and extending to depth d. As illustrated in , a stripe  of chemisorbed DEZ precursor commencing at or about depth dand extending to depth dis formed on a portion of the pore wall  by limiting the exposure time of the second precursor. Finally, exposure of the AAO membrane  to water forms the corresponding metal oxides on the pore wall , as depicted in . As shown in , installing the AAO membrane  in the depicted manner ensures that the ALD precursors only contact the membrane  from one side. This mounting method causes the ALD stripes to form from only one side of the membrane .","The ALD timing sequences of the coating process can be expressed as t-t-t-t-t-twhere tis the exposure time for the first precursor, tis the purge time following the first exposure, tis the exposure time for the second precursor, tis the purge time following the exposure to the second precursor, tis the exposure time to the coreactant precursor (e.g. water vapor), and tis the purge time following the coreactant precursor. By varying the precursor exposure times, the depths dand dare highly controllable. Thus, controlling the exposure time, t, of a first masking precursor, the depth d, or starting location of the stripe , can be controlled. Likewise, controlling the time, t, of a second metal precursor, the depth d, or the width of the stripe , can be predictably controlled. For example,  illustrates the relationship between the masking precursor exposure time and the depth of the metal oxide stripe . The process can be extended to add subsequent stripes of metals at desired positions along the surface of the pore wall .","Application of this process can advantageously form multi-stripe, multi-material catalysts that precisely control reactions. For example, an AAO membrane may be constructed with multi-striped pores to efficiently react with a feed stream in a predetermined order, as depicted in . For instance, initial reactants A enter an ALD nanopore  at a first end  and encounter a first ALD stripe catalyst  within the nanopore, thereby converting reactant A to product B. Product B continues to travel through the nanopore , eventually encountering a second ALD stripe catalyst  within the nanopore , thereby converting product B to final product C. The final product C then exits the nanopore  at a second end . One skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative arrangements can be constructed, including additional stripe catalysts in the nanopore . Other applications include, but are not limited to sensors, separation devices, and three-dimensional nuclear fuel structures having enhanced heat transfer properties, and electron multipliers having regions of high- and low-secondary electron emission (SEE) materials arranged along the pore walls.","The ALD stripe coating methods can be generalized to use with other metal oxides. For example, in addition to the formation of ZnO, TiO, and MgO stripes within nano-porous materials, samples have also been prepared with stripes of VOand NbOusing a similar approach. Additionally, the methods are not limited to ALD stripe coatings in AAO materials. For example, the formation of AlOstripes in nano-porous silica gel powder is described in detail below. Further, one skilled in the art will appreciated that the processes can be generalized to other powders, aerogels, and other nanoporous support structures using various materials deposited by ALD.","Various aspects of the present invention will now be further explained in the following illustrative examples. However, the present invention should not be construed as limited thereby. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand how to vary the exemplified methods to obtain the desired results.","The AAO membranes  were prepared by the electrochemical anodization of high purity aluminum metal disks. The disks had a thickness of 0.6 mm and a diameter of 19 mm. A two-step anodization procedure was performed in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V to obtain well-ordered pore arrays in the disks. Boundary layer removal was accomplished using phosphoric acid. As illustrated in , a masking process employed during the anodization and boundary layer removal steps allowed a free-standing AAO membrane to be fabricated, attached about its perimeter to the starting thickness of aluminum. A gas-tight seal in the viscous flow reactor  was applied to the resulting samples using commercial VCR\u00ae face-seal fittings. The resulting AAO membranes , depicted in , were 10 mm in diameter and had a thickness of about 70 \u03bcm to 75 \u03bcm. Analysis of the AAO membranes , using scanning electron microscopy (\u201cSEM\u201d), revealed an average pore diameter of 56 nm and the pore size distribution had a full width at half-maximum of 3.8 nm.  is a SEM image showing the hexagonally arranged nanopores  distributed on the AAO membrane . The pore density of the AAO membrane  was determined to be 154 pores \u03bcm.","After various ALD coating processes, as described in detail below, the AAO membranes  were cleaved; and the fragments were embedded in silver epoxy, polished flat, and then carbon-coated using an evaporative coater. Elemental maps were acquired using a SEM with a field emission gun electron beam source and energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (\u201cEDAX\u201d) detector. Elemental area maps were stored as bitmaps, and the resulting bitmaps were integrated along the lateral dimension parallel to the AAO membrane pores to produce depth-integrated elemental distribution profiles.","Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the EDAX measurements obtained from the AAO membranes. These simulations modeled the AAO pores as a one-dimensional array, and simulated the ALD stripe-coating experiments by following the trajectories of individual TMA and DEZ molecules diffusing along the nanopores. Knudsen diffusion was assumed because the mean free path of the DEZ molecules in 1 Torr N, about 50 \u03bcm, is much greater than the AAO pore diameter, about 50 nm. Consequently, the diffusion was simulated as a one-dimensional random walk of hop-length D, the local pore diameter. After each hop, if the molecule encountered an empty site, the molecule would react with probability equal to the reactive sticking coefficient, 10. Each trajectory continued until the molecule reacted or left the tube, and the number of trajectories was selected to model the experimental exposure times and the pressures of DEZ and TMA, respectively. The HO exposures used in the experiments always exceeded the corresponding DEZ and TMA exposures and were saturating, so it was not necessary to include the HO exposures in the simulations. Each ALD cycle corresponded to a TMA and DEZ exposure, and if reaction occurred at any site along the nanopore during the cycle, the local pore diameter, D, was reduced to account for the film deposition at that location.","A stripe of ZnO was formed at the surface edge of the AAO membrane  by applying 60 cycles of DEZ\/HO with the timing sequence 1-10-1-10. The results achieved by this process are illustrated in , B and C. The DEZ and HO exposure times were chosen to be sub-saturating so that the precursors would not completely infiltrate the nanopores. Following the deposition, the AAO membrane  was cleaved, and a cross-sectional specimen was analyzed by SEM and EDAX.  shows a SEM secondary electron image of the sample.

TMA exposure times of 5, 15, 30, and 90 seconds were applied to a silica gel powder. As illustrated in , B, and C, the powder comprised of 100 micron particles having 30 nm pores in a powder bed fixture. The results achieved by these processes are illustrated in the EDAX elemental maps for Al depicted in , B, C, and D. As demonstrated by these figures, the penetration of the ALD coatings for an object with spherical geometry proceeds in a similar predictable manner as was previously illustrated for the one dimensional AAO substrates.","An internal stripe of ZnO was formed in the same silica gel powder using TMA as a masking agent to prevent absorption of the DEZ. A TMA mask exposure time of 2 seconds followed by a 10 sec exposure of DEZ was applied to the silica gel powder.
