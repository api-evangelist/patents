title: Acoustic processing for estimating size of small targets
abstract: A method is provided for estimating the size of an object from a region of a fluid medium when that object is emitting acoustic radiation of known wavelength λ on its own or as the result of being interrogated by acoustic pulses that reflect from the object. The acoustic radiation is monitored using a line array of N acoustic receivers such that N signals indicative of the acoustic radiation are generated. M time series summations are formed using the N signals. Each of the M time series summations is formed using a unique time delay predicated on a corresponding unique estimated speed of propagation of the acoustic radiation where M estimated speeds of propagation are defined. For an object in the region having a diameter D on the order of λ, the M values will vary as a function of the M estimated speeds of propagation with the resulting distribution of the M values being indicative of diameter D.

At lower frequencies, or smaller sizes, scattering becomes less \u201cspecular\u201d and more \u201cdiffracting\u201d in nature. While there have been some successful efforts involving the imaging of small objects in the near field, the technique cannot be extended to the imaging of small objects in the far field. If such far field imaging could be achieved, it could be used in medical acoustic, sonar, and particle detection on semiconductor wafer evaluation applications. In each of these applications, it may also be desirable to know the size of the small object, e.g., a tumor or other physical abnormality in medical acoustic applications, a mine-like object in sonar applications, and an imperfection in a semiconductor in wafer evaluation applications.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of acoustic processing that can be used to estimate the size of a small object.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of acoustic processing that can be used to estimate the size of an object that is smaller that one to two wavelengths of the acoustic radiation directed towards the object for the purpose of generating reflections or echoes therefrom.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method that uses only a single orientation of a sensor array to estimate the size of a small object.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a method for estimating the size of an object begins with monitoring acoustic radiation originating from a region of a fluid medium using a line array of N acoustic receivers such that N signals indicative of the acoustic radiation are generated. It is assumed that the acoustic radiation has a known wavelength \u03bb. M time series summations are formed using the N signals. Each of the M time series summations is formed using a unique time delay predicated on a corresponding unique estimated speed of propagation of the acoustic radiation where M estimated speeds of propagation are defined. A temporal Fourier transform is performed on each of the M time series summations to generate M values. For an object in the region having a diameter D<2\u03bb, the M values will vary as a function of the M estimated speeds of propagation. The resulting distribution of the M values are indicative of diameter D.","Before describing the method of the present invention, it will be beneficial to describe some background concepts on which the present invention is predicated. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , an infinite, acoustically opaque screen is referenced by numeral . Screen  has an aperture  formed therethrough. On one side of screen , an acoustic source  propagates a planar acoustic wave  towards screen . If the diameter of aperture  is small (e.g., on the order of the wavelength of acoustic wave ), acoustic wave  diverges as it passes through aperture  to form diverging waves -, -, . . . traveling at a range of velocities. The slowest velocities are found in the diverging waves moving approximately parallel to screen  (e.g., wave -) and the fastest velocities are found in the diverging waves moving approximately perpendicular to screen  (e.g., wave -).","The method of the present invention takes note of the fact that an exact solution for (acoustic wave) diffraction of a two-dimensional aperture in an infinite screen is given as \n\n\nSee G. C. Gaunaurd et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 63, p. 5, 1978. In equation (1), p is the acoustic pressure, F(k,k) is the two-dimensional spatial Fourier transform in the screen that is in the X-Y plane, and k is the propagation wavenumber in the z direction. This equation solves the governing equation exactly and meets all boundary conditions.\n","The above diffraction integral can be evaluated using the generalized method of exhaustion to more clearly see the behavior of each component using the following \n\n\nThis method of exhaustion is disclosed by A. A. Ruffa, International Journal of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences 31(6), 8 Aug. 2002, p. 345. Note that propagating waves will only occur when the transverse wavenumber (k+k)is lower than the cutoff wavenumber, so the integral can be evaluated to ok with good accuracy (assuming that F(k,k) is an even function with respect to both kand k) as follows \n\n","From this expression, it can be shown that the resulting field is due to a summation of an infinite number of contributions (e.g., waves -, -, . . . ), each propagating at a different phase speed (and hence a different group speed) based on its value of kand k.","The acoustic field radiating from such an aperture will have a continuous range of velocities, the amplitude distribution of which will depend on the Fourier transform of the field at the aperture F(k,k). For example, if the field scattered from acoustic source  is replaced by plane wave of infinite extent, F(k,k) becomes a Dirac delta function and the velocity distribution reduces to that of a single velocity. If, on the other hand, the aperture is very small compared toga wavelength, then F(k,k) will be nearly constant up to the cutoff wavenumber and the propagation velocity distribution will be much larger.","In equation (3), the aperture will radiate propagating waves -, -, . . . as long as k\u2267k+k(the cutoff wavenumber). For spanwise wavenumbers kand kthat do not meet this condition, the resulting field will not propagate, but rather will be a decaying evanescent field.","The phase speed will increase from c at the zero spanwise wavenumber to infinity at the cutoff wavenumber. The group speed, however, will decrease from c to zero at the cutoff wavenumber. The group speed is independent of range and is given as\n\n\u221a{square root over (1\u2212()\/)}\u2003\u2003(4) \n\nLarge decreases in group speed will lead to increased Doppler shifts. This can be potentially useful for low-Doppler targets. Also, if the velocity distribution of the acoustic field (associated with waves -, -, . . . ) can be measured, it will be directly related to F(k,k), and therefore provide information on the effective size of aperture .\n","The present invention provides a method for estimating the size of a small object in a fluid medium using the principles described above. To explain the present method, reference will be made to  where two small objects  and  are assumed to reside in a fluid (e.g., water) medium. A linear (or line) array  of acoustic receivers are placed in the fluid medium. As illustrated, object  lies in the end fire region of array  and object  lies in region away from the end fire of array .","The number of receivers used is not a limitation of the present invention. In general, N acoustic receivers will be discussed herein. Each of receivers - to -N is capable of passively detecting acoustic radiation (waves)  and  originating from each of objects  and , respectively. Typically, acoustic radiation  and  is representative of acoustic reflections caused when an acoustic source  transmits acoustic radiation  of a known-wavelength into the region(s) in which objects  and  reside. However, it is to be understood that use of acoustic source  is not a requirement or limitation of the present invention.","The present invention will first be described for estimating the size of object  lying in the end fire region of array . The N signals detected by N-channel array  are indicative of acoustic radiation (reflections) . The continuously received signals are sampled at a time based on the relative location of each acoustic receiver in array  and the speed of propagation of acoustic radiation (reflections) . For the end fire situation, acoustic receiver - is sampled at a time t and each successive receiver is sampled at a time delayed from t where the time delay is a function the distance d from acoustic receiver - and the speed of propagation of acoustic radiation (reflections) .","Based on the concepts for an aperture in an infinite screen described above, the speed of propagation of radiation (reflections)  will be a distribution of speeds if the size of object  is on the order of the wavelength of acoustic radiation (reflections) . More specifically, if object  has a diameter D that is less than approximately twice the wavelength of acoustic radiation (reflections) , there will be a distribution of propagation speeds that is indicative of the size of object . In its simplest form, the present invention assumes or approximates a circular shape for object . However, it is to be understood that the invention can be used to approximate other shapes for object  at the expense of more complicated processing.","Assuming the size of object  is on the order of the wavelength of acoustic radiation (reflections) , the present invention determines the distribution of the speed of propagation associated therewith. To do this, M different speeds of propagation are estimated and used in the processing of the sampled signals from array . The M different speeds define a range of distribution of speeds that acoustic radiation (reflections)  are expected to exhibit for the size of an object (e.g., object ) of interest.","In , there is shown a flowchart providing the method  of using this invention. This flowchart is made for the embodiment in which an acoustic signal ( in ) is transmitted toward an object ( or  in ) in step  and reflects ( or  in ) from the object. Step  can be omitted when the object is radiating an acoustic signal at a known wavelength. The acoustic signal is received  at an array of sensors . The received signal at each sensor is processed  in parallel. In one embodiment, the step of processing  can be merely forming an amplitude sum of the signals received at each sensor. This is further detailed in the discussion of  below. In another embodiment, the step of processing  can be forming an amplitude sum of the, signals and then performing a temporal Fourier transform of the signals. This is further detailed in the discussion of  below. In either case, processing  accounts for the orientation of the array  and the spacing of sensors - through -N while calculating the amplitude sum. In step , the invention determines if velocity spreading exists in the amplitude sums. If velocity spreading does not exist, the object must be larger than two wavelengths (2\u03bb), and a different method must be used to determine size. If velocity spreading does exist, a database of known object data  can be compared in step  with the amplitude sums and the Fourier transforms to give information about the object. In the most basic case, the known object database  contains data from disks having a range of diameters below the two wavelengths limit. In a more complicated case, the know object database  contains objects having a variety of different shapes, sizes and orientations. These objects can be disks, spheres or cylinders. The comparison step  provides an output of the diameter of the object, the object's shape, and\/or the object's orientation. Output is provided in step  to a user or to another system.","Processing of the N sampled signals sfor i=1 to N is carried out as illustrated in  where parallel processing (e.g., by individual processors or one parallel processor) improves processing efficiency; however, sequential processing can be used. Each of M processors -, . . . , -M forms a sum V(t) of the time sampled signals swhere the first term in each summation is the signal sampled at acoustic receiver - at time t and each successive i-th term is delayed by (2\u03c0d\/c) where dis the distance from the i-th receiver to receiver -, cm is an estimated speed of propagation for the m-th processor, and f is the frequency of acoustic radiation (reflections) . Each of the resulting M time series summations (e.g., voltage signals V(t)) for m=1 to M can have (as illustrated by the  embodiment) a temporal Fourier transform applied thereto at -, . . . , -M as a measure of the Doppler shift \u0394f. Lower speeds of propagation lead to increased Doppler shifts. The Doppler shift measurements are an independent check on each propagation velocity.","An amplitude distribution as a function of speed of propagation cfor m=1 to M indicates the presence of a \u201csmall\u201d target. Conversely, little or no velocity spread is indicative of the fact that no \u201csmall\u201d targets are present in the region of interest. Assuming there is a velocity distribution, the actual amplitude (voltage) distribution as a function of cis used to estimate the size of object  as follows. The measured distribution is compared to a plurality of two-dimensional spatial Fourier transform distributions determined for a corresponding plurality of known-dimension, circular apertures in infinite acoustically-opaque screens. The aperture size of the spatial Fourier transform distribution that most closely matches the measured\/determined amplitude distribution (vs. capproximates a (circular shape) size of object .","For object  that resides away from the end fire of array , processing in each beam of array  would proceed the same as described above so that the amplitude would again be estimated for each of the M estimated speeds of propagation c. Away from end fire, the effect of a distribution of propagation speeds is exhibited as a \u201cbeam spreading,\u201d effect where slower acoustic velocities lead to signals in adjacent beams. Beam spreading also occurs due to multipaths, which would show up in adjacent beams closer to broadside. In active sonar (e.g., where acoustic source  provides acoustic radiation that generates reflections ), the main path could be identified as the one arriving first. As is known in the art, this can be accomplished with replica correlator processing. Multipaths would appear in adjacent beams closer to broadside while any velocity distribution would lead to adjacent beams further away from broadside and involving velocities slower than the speed of propagation in the main path. The resulting Doppler shifts would be increased in adjacent beams due to the slower acoustic velocity in the beam. Since this would not occur as a result of multipaths, it provides a method to distinguish between beam spreading due to a velocity distribution with that due to multipaths.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Small underwater targets can have their size estimated. Such size estimation is an important clue used in target classification.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
