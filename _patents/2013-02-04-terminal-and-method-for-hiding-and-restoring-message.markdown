Field","The following description relates to data protection technology, and more particularly, to message hiding and message restoring technology.","2. Discussion of the Background","Developments in the information and communications industry have increased the number of methods of acquiring information available to users. Devices like mobile terminals have become essential communication devices and are used particularly for transmitting messages and receiving messages.","Increasing device usability is accompanied by increasing interest in data protection, which requires a user environment that is highly usable and more intuitive. That is, increasing usability is accompanied by an increasing need for a user environment that is highly convenient and intuitive when displaying messages or managing message lists or messages.","As an example of a message display and management method, if a user wishes to perform an archiving process on a specific message from an outgoing\/incoming message list (a first message list) for consolidated management of messages transmitted to and received from a large number of partners, the specific message may be moved from the first message list to a message archiving list (a second message list) to be stored, and eliminated from the first message list.","For example, if the specific message to be archived is selected by the user from the first message list through a hardware button or a software button, a menu screen may pop up, and then the message is eliminated from the first message list if an archiving instruction is input by the user.","Accordingly, it may be difficult for the user to intuitively discern which message is eliminated from the first message list, or where the message is located in the second message list.","In addition, since the archived messages are all stored in a storage box in a list form without distinction between conversation partners, a series of processes of selecting individual messages from the list of the storage box, verifying detailed contents of a message to be retrieved by the user, transmission\/reception targets, or the date and time of transmission\/reception, and returning to the list have to be repeatedly performed in order to view the detailed contents, the transmission\/reception targets, or the date and time of transmission\/reception. This repetition may be the result of messages being stored in the message storage box which is integrally managed without distinction between transmission\/reception targets, the data, and time of transmission\/reception, and the like, if the messages are separately archived.","In addition, when a user wishes to view previously received messages, a considerable amount of time may be required for searching if there is a large history of messages.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a terminal having a data protection operation and a message hiding operation.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method for message hiding and restoring.","Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention discloses a terminal to hide a message, including: an input unit to receive a first input signal and a second input signal; a control unit to hide a message in response to the first input signal and to restore the message in response to the second input signal; and a display unit to display messages according to control of the control unit.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention also discloses a method for hiding a message, including: receiving a first input to select a message on a main screen; moving the message to a hidden screen in response to the first input; and restoring the message to the main screen if a second input is received.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention also discloses a method for hiding an application, including: receiving a first input to select an application on a main screen; moving the application to a hidden screen in response to the first input; and restoring the application to the main screen if a second input is received.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention also discloses a method of hiding and restoring an object, including: receiving an input selecting an object; and hiding or restoring the selected object in response to the input.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.","Exemplary embodiments are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements.","It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being \u201con\u201d another element or layer, it can be directly on the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. It will be understood that for the purposes of this disclosure, \u201cat least one of X, Y, and Z\u201d can be construed as X only, Y only, Z only, or any combination of two or more items X, Y, and Z (e.g., XYZ, XYY, YZ, ZZ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A terminal  includes an input unit , a control unit , and a display unit . The terminal  may further include a message database .","The terminal  may be any device which can transmit messages to and receive messages from another party in a wired or wireless manner, such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless communication devices, portable devices, laptop computers, tablet computers, desktop computer, cordless phones, and the like. The terminal  may be a portable multi-functional device, such as a smart phone, a smart pad, and the like. The terminal  may include a user interface to recognize a touch operation input from a user.","Privacy of a terminal user may be protected by enabling a message to be hidden if the user opens a message window to read or edit the message. The message refers to a message which the user does not want to reveal or wants to archive separately. The message may be a reference message, a predetermined message, a selected message, and the like.","Ease of use may be increased in addition to protecting privacy. A hiding operation may be performed on a message, and the message may be hidden within the message window through a user's simple operation. If hiding the message, an original position may be hidden to be identified. Accordingly, a user may verify in which position the message is hidden within the message window.","Messages may be hidden or archived for each conversation partner, and therefore the user may immediately verify which conversation partners' messages are hidden within the message window.","A hide target is not limited to messages, and the hide target may be replaced with or expanded to all types of data which the user can hide in the terminal  for information protection. For example, the hide target may be phonebook data, call list data, schedule data, or memo data. The messages may include character messages, multimedia messages, or multimedia contents. The multimedia messages may be character messages including photos, moving images, music, and the like. The multimedia message may be, for example, image data or moving image data.","The message hiding operation may be applied to message-related applications such as Kakao Talk, and the like, in addition to general message programs.","The display unit  may display a message on a screen. The message may be displayed in the form of a speech bubble for each conversation partner. The speech bubble may be a graphic user interface object in which contents of the message transmitted to and received from a corresponding conversation partner within a small box may be recorded. For example, on the screen of the terminal , messages transmitted and received between a user and a conversation partner A may be displayed in chronological order. Messages transmitted to the conversation partner A from the user may be displayed on the right side of the screen, and on the left side of the screen, messages received by the user from the conversation partner A may be displayed.","The message displayed in the form of a speech bubble for each conversation partner will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings.","The display unit  may display, on the screen of the terminal , at least a part of a main screen where an outgoing message and an incoming message may be displayed, an outgoing hide screen where an outgoing message is hidden, an incoming hide screen where an incoming message is hidden, and an outgoing\/incoming hide screen where the hidden outgoing message and the hidden incoming message are all displayed.","The input unit  may be a user interface for executing user commands such as message reading, deletion, editing, hiding, archiving, and the like, with respect to the message displayed on the screen through the display unit .","The input unit  may receive a user input signal to hide the message displayed on the screen or to restore a hidden message. The input unit  may recognize a touch operation of the user. The input unit  and the display unit  may be formed in the same physical space, for example, in a touch-screen, so that the user may perform the touch operation on the screen. The user input signal for hiding the message may be received according to a drag method, a double-tap method, a rubbing method, etc. with respect to the message. A drag method, a double-tap method, and a rubbing method will be described below with reference to , , and .","The user input may include a gesture recognition method, a motion recognition method, and the like.","The input unit  may receive the user input signal in a direction perpendicular to a direction aligned with scroll direction of a message.","The user input signal may be received via a touch and drag method, a flicking method, or the like. The user input signal may be received in a position of a hide target message in the message list if hiding the message, and in an empty space where the message is absent from the message list or in a message position where a hiding indicator is present if restoring the message.","The control unit  may control the display unit  in accordance with the user input signal received from the input unit  to hide the message in a screen space or restore the message hidden in the screen space. The control unit  may hide the message in the screen space corresponding to an original position of the hidden message to identify an origin of the hidden message.","If the message is provided in the form of a speech bubble for each conversation partner, the control unit  may perform a message hiding and restoring operation for each conversation partner.","For example, message hiding may refer to the control unit  displaying an outgoing hide screen and displaying an incoming hide screen on the other side. The outgoing hide screen may be disposed on a side perpendicular to a direction in which the messages are aligned in a row on the main screen. In other words, the outgoing hide screen may be disposed to be perpendicular to a direction in which the messages are parallel with each other. The messages may be hidden in the screen space horizontally corresponding to the original position of the hidden message. The outgoing hidden screen and incoming hidden screen will be described below with reference to , , and .","For example, message hiding may refer to the control unit  displaying the outgoing hide screen and the incoming hide screen through a virtual view separately from a view of the main screen by controlling the display unit . The messages are hidden in the screen space horizontally and vertically corresponding to the original position of the hidden message. A virtual outgoing hide screen and incoming hide screen will be described below with reference to .","The message database (\u201cDB\u201d)  may manage the hidden messages. The message DB  may be utilized as a space for storing and managing the hidden messages. Messages restored by the user after being hidden may be eliminated from the message DB .","The control unit  may provide an addition operation in conjunction with another application with respect to the hidden message. The applications may be schedules, notes, or bookmarks. An example of the additional operation in conjunction with the other application will be described below with reference to , , , ,  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The components of the terminal  shown in  may be logically separated, however two or more of these components may be physically integrated or they may all be separately implemented. Although  will be described with reference to the features of , exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto.","The control unit  includes a message hiding and restoring control unit  (hereinafter, referred to as \u201ca message control unit\u201d) of an application terminal, and a call processing unit  of a framework terminal. The message DB  includes a local DB  of the application terminal and a message service DB  of the framework terminal.","A DB that stores messages such as multimedia message service (MMS), message service (SMS), and the like may not be the local DB  depending on the application but rather the message service DB  managed by the call processing unit  of the framework terminal.","The application may perform an arithmetic operation with respect to the message service DB  through the call processing unit . There may be a risk if directly changing a structure of the call processing unit  of the framework terminal and the message service DB  to perform the message hiding and restoring operation. For example, a third application may access an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) of the changed framework, and therefore problems may be caused at the time of use.","If transmitting and receiving messages, the messages stored in the message service DB  of the framework terminal are archived as is, and the message control unit  stores a hiding message or attribute information identifying the hiding message in a separate local DB  provided within the application. The message control unit  may store both the hiding message and the attribute information concerning the hiding message.","If receiving a message hiding input signal from a user, the message control unit  may call a call processing API operation and requests a message list from the call processing unit . The call processing unit  may search for the message list from the message service DB  and return the searched message list to the message control unit .","The message control unit  may access the local DB  which is generated asynchronously from the above-described process to obtain a hiding message list. The hiding message list obtained from the local DB  and the message list returned from the message service DB  may be compared, and if a message coinciding with the hiding message of the local DB  is present in the message service DB , the corresponding message may be hidden on the screen.","If receiving the message hiding input signal with respect to a message from the user, the message control unit  may store at least one of the hiding message and the attribute information concerning the hiding message in the local DB . If data of the local DB  is updated, the local DB  transmits a hiding request message to the message control unit . The message control unit  may receive the hiding request message to hide the message on the screen.","If receiving a message restoring input signal with respect to a message from a user, the message control unit  may search for the corresponding hiding message from the local DB  and restore the searched hiding message on the screen. The local DB  may transmit a restoring request message to the message control unit , and the message control unit  receives the restoring request message to restore the corresponding message on the screen. A message list may be searched from the message service DB  through the call processing unit . The hiding message of the local DB  and messages from the message list of the message service DB  may be compared, and the corresponding hiding message may be restored if the compared messages are the same based on the comparison result.","If the message restoring input signal with respect to a hiding message is received from a user, the message control unit  searches for the attribute information of the corresponding hiding message from the local DB . A message corresponding to the attribute information may be searched from the message list of the message service DB  through the call processing unit  using the attribute information of the hiding message, and when the corresponding message is searched, the searched message is restored on the screen. For example, the message may be tagged and stored, and later searched according to the tag. Further, the tag, the tagged message, and\/or the message may be extracted and used for another application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},"The terminal  may display a main screen where an outgoing message and an incoming message are displayed, an outgoing hide screen where an outgoing message may be hidden, and an incoming hide screen where an incoming message may be hidden. The terminal  may display the outgoing hide screen on one side perpendicular to a direction in which messages are aligned in a row on the main screen and the incoming hide screen on the other side.","The terminal  may select a display screen based on specifications of a display of the terminal. The specifications of the display may include a screen size and a screen direction of the terminal .","For example, referring to , if a terminal screen is longer in a transverse direction, the number of pages displayed on a single screen may be 2. In other words, the main screen and the incoming hide screen may be displayed on a single screen, as shown in a screen , or the main screen and the outgoing hide screen may be displayed in a single screen, as shown in a screen . In other words, the single screen may be divided into two pages because a size of the screen is reduced if the terminal screen is longer in the transverse direction.","Referring to , an incoming message may be hidden on the left side of the screen on a hide screen corresponding to a main screen, as shown in a screen , and an outgoing message may be hidden on the right side, as shown in a screen . The hidden outgoing and incoming messages may be displayed outside the main screen as shown in a screen .","Referring to , the terminal  may display a main screen , an incoming hide screen , and an outgoing hide screen  on a single screen. This screen may corresponds to a terminal screen is longer in a transverse direction or to a terminal with a larger screen size, such as, a tablet PC, a notebook PC, a laptop, etc.","If the terminal  is longer in a transverse direction and the main screen and the hide screen are displayed together on the same screen, the ratio of a width of a message of the main screen may be applied in a longitudinal direction. This may compensate for a phenomenon in which a message is laterally elongated and becomes visually awkward if the terminal  is converted into a transverse screen.","If performing a pinch in operation on the main screen  by a user, the incoming hide screen  and the outgoing hide screen  may be displayed, and if performing pinch out operation, the screen returns to display the main screen .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Referring to , the terminal  may display an outgoing hide screen and an incoming hide screen through a virtual view , separated from a view  of a main screen.","Multi-view refers a concept in which a user may be aware of messages displayed in different three-dimensional (3D) spaces.
