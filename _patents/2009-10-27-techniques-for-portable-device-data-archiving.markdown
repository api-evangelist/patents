Network element  may utilize storage  for the storage of application data, backup data, or other data. Network element  may be a host, such as an application server, which may process data traveling between network element  and a data archival platform, an archival process, and\/or storage. According to some embodiments, network element  may be a platform used for archiving data. One or more portions of data may be archived based on an archival policy applied, attributes associated with the data source, space available for archive, space available at the data source, or other factors.","Computer  may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a server, or other computer. Computer  may receive data from user input, a database, a file, a web service, and\/or an application programming interface. Computer  may detect the connection of a device using an architecture such as, for example, a hot-pluggable architecture, a plug and play architecture, a hot swappable architecture, and a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). For example, computer  may support one or more interfaces including, but not limited to, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, a firewire connection, a wireless connection, a Bluetooth connection, a memory card interface, and a storage media interface. For example, if a device, such as flash memory device , is connected to computer  through an interface (e.g., via insertion in a USB port), a hot-pluggable architecture of computer  may allow computer  to recognize flash memory device . Computer  may recognize devices using other architectures or interfaces. For example, if cell phone  or digital camera  connect to computer  via Bluetooth or another wireless interface, computer  may recognize the devices.

According to some embodiments, computer  may recognize a device upon reboot of computer  (e.g., a Plug and Play (PnP) device that is not hot-pluggable).","Computer  may contain an archive agent, a process, or a module that receives messages or monitors interfaces for the connection of a device. The archive agent may identify a connected device, determine one or more archive parameters associated with the device, and archive one or more portions of data on the device. For example, an archive agent may determine that a USB device has been connected by monitoring Hotplug events, hardware events, device manager events, and\/or devfs (a device file system). The archive agent, process, or module may attempt to identify a connected device. For example, an archive agent running on computer  may look for an identifier such as a Plug and Play Device ID associated with the connected device, a volume serial number associated with the connected device, a PIN associated with the connected device, a Media Access Control (MAC) address, and\/or an administrator assigned unique identifier. The archive agent, process, or module may use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or an operating system device driver interface to access an identifier.","If an identifier is not found, the archive agent may perform one or more actions which may be configurable. The archive agent may ignore a detected device for which an identifier has not been found, the archive agent may use default archive parameters for the detected device, and\/or the archive agent may query another component for parameters or more information. For example, the archive agent may query a centralized archiving process or module, such as archive module . Archive module  may provide default archive parameters based on a device type or other information provided by the archive agent. Archive module  may also provide instructions to allow the archive agent to obtain an identifier. For example, connection of a smartphone via Bluetooth may be detected by an archive agent, but the archive agent may not obtain an identifier. The archive agent may receive information from archive module  allowing the archive agent to access an identifier, such as information allowing access via an API to a smartphone identifier and\/or other data. In other embodiments, the archive agent may use default archive parameters to archive data from the connected device without obtaining an identifier. Default archive parameters may be stored on computer , obtained from archive module , or otherwise obtained by an archive agent.","According to some embodiments, an archive agent running on computer  may obtain one or more archive parameters after finding an identifier. Archive parameters may include a specified archive repository, a retention category, an indication of one or more portions of a connected device to be archived, an archive policy indicator, a keyword to be associated with archived data, a tag to be associated with archived data, a checksum associated with data previously archived, and\/or a hash value associated with data previously archived. Archive parameters may be located on the device connected to computer , on computer , or stored centrally. For example, an archive agent running on computer  may detect connection of a device, obtain an identifier of the device, and use the identifier to query one or more archive parameters from archive module .","According to some embodiments, if an archive agent on computer  is unable to locate an identifier for a connected device and\/or an archive parameter, an archive user interface may be launched. The archive user interface may prompt a user for device identification and one or more archive parameters. The archive user interface may be a graphical user interface such as a \u201cwizard\u201d which may guide a user through one or more steps to provide device identification and archive parameters. The archive user interface may allow a user to specify a desired archive repository, one or more portions of information to be archived (e.g., archive my contacts from my smartphone, or directories a, b, and e from a storage device), a retention period, and\/or other archive parameters. According to some embodiments, a user may provide identifying information for a device and archive parameters may be provided by a policy. For example, a device may be identified as a company issued smartphone which was issued to an executive officer of the company. Based on the this information, an archive policy may be identified which may specify the archive repository, the portions of data to be archived, the retention period, and\/or other archive parameters.","According to some embodiments, an administrator, a network service provider, a device reseller, or other parties may distribute a device with an identifier and\/or one or more archive parameters located on the device. For example, an administrator of a company may distribute cell phones, storage devices, or other devices with an identifier stored on the device and with archive parameters for the device already preconfigured. The archive parameters may be stored on the device and\/or may be stored on a location that is network accessible to computer . In one or more embodiments, some archive parameters may be specified only by an administrator and some may be selected by a user. For example, an administrator may specify an archive repository to be used for archive data of a device. A user of the device may specify one or more additional archive parameters (e.g., retention category) but may not change the archive repository.","After identification of a connected device, an archive agent on computer  may archive one or more portions of data on the connected device. An archive process of computer  may generate one or more hash values or checksums to indicate data that has been archived. According to some embodiments, an archive process of computer  may use a hash value or a checksum to determine whether the data has changed since a prior archive. If a hash value or checksum has not changed, data may not be archived.","Network element  may be a router, a broadband gateway, or another device providing network connectivity between network  and computer . According to some embodiments, network element  may be a broadband router which may provide wireless and\/or wired connectivity for a local LAN side and may connect to network  via a cable network, a telephone network, or a fiber optic connection. Network element  may be capable of detecting a connection of one or more devices connected to a LAN interface provided by it (e.g., a wireless connection made by device , or via a wired connection). For example, network element  may use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to detect a connection of a device. According to some embodiments, computer  may connect directly to network .","According to some embodiments, network element  may contain an archive agent, process, or module. The archive agent may detect connection of a device such as device  using Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Device  may be a smartphone, a PDA, or other device connecting via a Bluetooth, wireless, or wired interface. The archive agent may obtain an identifier associated with device  and\/or one or more archive parameters. The archive agent may then archive one or more portions of data on device .","Referring to , there is shown a device data archiving module  in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated, the device data archiving module  may contain one or more components including a device detection module , archive classification module , a data archive module , and an error handling\/reporting module .","The description below describes network elements, computers, and\/or components of a system and method for portable device data archiving that may include one or more modules. As used herein, the term \u201cmodule\u201d may be understood to refer to computing software, firmware, hardware, and\/or various combinations thereof.

It is noted that the modules are exemplary. The modules may be combined, integrated, separated, and\/or duplicated to support various applications. Also, a function described herein as being performed at a particular module may be performed at one or more other modules and\/or by one or more other devices instead of or in addition to the function performed at the particular module. Further, the modules may be implemented across multiple devices and\/or other components local or remote to one another. Additionally, the modules may be moved from one device and added to another device, and\/or may be included in two or more devices.","Device detection module  may detect the connection of a device to a computing platform. For example, device detection module  may run as an agent on a computing platform or receive messages from a computing platform (e.g., SNMP messages). Device detection module  may monitor Hotplug events, hardware events, device manager events, and\/or devfs (a device file system). Device detection module  may use one or more components of a computing platform to monitor for the connection of devices such as, for example, a hot-pluggable architecture, a plug and play architecture, a hot swappable architecture, and a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Upon detection of a device or detection of the addition of storage media, device detection module  may pass one or more portions of device data to archive classification module .","Archive classification module  may receive or identify a device identifier and\/or one or more archive parameters. Archive classification module  may look for an identifier such as a Plug and Play Device ID associated with the connected device, a volume serial number associated with the connected device, a PIN associated with the connected device, a Media Access Control (MAC) address, and\/or an administrator assigned unique identifier. Archive classification module  may use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to access an identifier.","Archive classification module  may receive, retrieve, or specify one or more archive parameters after finding an identifier. Archive parameters may include a archive repository, a retention category, an indication of one or more portions of a connected device to be archived, an archive policy indicator, a keyword to be associated with archived data, a tag to be associated with archived data, a checksum associated with data previously archived, and\/or a hash value associated with data previously archived. Archive parameters may be located on the device containing data being archived, on a computing platform to which the archived device is connected, or stored centrally. Archive classification module  may use one or more default archive parameters. Archive classification module  may identify an archive policy based on a device identifier, a device type, an associated user, an associated group, and\/or one or more specified archive parameters.","Data archive module  may archive data of one or more portable devices. Data archive module  may receive a device identifier and one or more archive parameters from archive classification module . According to some embodiments, data to be archived from a portable device may depend on one or more factors. For example, archive parameters may be specified by a user of the device, an administrator providing the device, or another entity, which specify what data to be archived. Archival of data may depend on data type, data location, or other data attributes. For example, an administrator may specify that data types associated with music or game files are not to be archived. According to some embodiments, a hash value or checksum may be used to determine whether a portion of data has previously been archived. If the data has previously been archived, archival of the data may be skipped.","Error handling\/reporting module  may handle errors associated with device identification, data archival, and other processes. Error handling\/reporting module  may log errors, such as errors occurring during archiving. Error handling\/reporting module  may provide reports or logs of errors. According to some embodiments, error handling\/reporting module  may contain logs identifying data (e.g., file names, directory names, file sizes) that was recognized on a portable device but not archived.","Referring to , there is depicted a method  for portable device data archiving in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. At block , the method  may begin.","At block , connection of a device or storage media may be detected. Interfaces such as USB, firewire, WiFi, and Bluetooth may be monitored. According to some embodiments, a device driver manager may be monitored for device events or device events may be received from a device driver manager.
