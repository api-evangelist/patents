{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/896,587, filed on Oct. 28, 2013, and 62\/054,858, filed on Sep. 24, 2014, the content of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","A power management system and method are disclosed. The system can be a high availability power delivery system. The system can be GPS tracked.","2. Description of the Related Art","Power management systems are networks of electrical components used for delivery of power to loads. Power systems are intended to condition the power, which is to say that the voltage and current delivered to the loads are regulated to insure consistency of power delivery. Power management systems often condition the power supply before delivery to the load, regulating the delivered current and voltage to suit the load.","Some power management systems have batteries that receive electricity from power inputs. The batteries can then supplement the power inputs, either providing power to the load concurrent with the power inputs, or when the power inputs are turned off or not available, such as a standard Uninterrupted (or Uninterruptible) Power Supply (UPS).","Batteries can only store incoming power at a limited rate. Accordingly, charging subsystems within power management systems may receive electrical power from power sources such as solar panels or a fixed 120 V line (e.g., from a wall outlet connected to a municipal or other governmental utility power supply) faster than the batteries in the power management system can absorb the charge, and some available power will be lost, for example such as heat.","Power management systems may also have no or one battery. The use of a battery at least helps increase power uptime when a usually-dependable power input, such as a power line, fails, but does not account for the power line and the battery. Thus, power delivery failure of these systems still occurs.","Also, power management systems often have a singular type of power output. That is, the power management system may be designed to output electricity at one fixed voltage and one fixed current.","Accordingly, a power management system that can store high rates of power into a backup battery is desired. A power management system with higher-availability (e.g., more uptime) than a typical single-battery system is desired. Furthermore, a power management system with different output voltages and currents to power different types of load current and load voltage demands is desired.","A power management system is disclosed. The power management system can have a first battery having a first battery voltage, a second battery having a second battery voltage, a first capacitor bank attached to the first battery, and a second capacitor bank attached to the second battery. The power management system can have a power management element configured to route current from the first capacitor bank to the first battery when the first battery voltage is less than a first full battery voltage. When the current from the first capacitor bank is routed to the first battery and when the second battery voltage is less than a second full battery voltage, the power management element can be configured to route current from the second capacitor bank to the second battery.","The power management system can have a satellite navigation receiver attached to the system. The power management system can have a power conditioning circuit. The power conditioning circuit can have a DC-to-DC converter configured to output a constant load input current and a constant load input voltage. The power management system can be configured to sense the first battery voltage, the second battery voltage, the current from the first capacitor bank, and the current from the second capacitor bank. The power management system can have a first power source and a third capacitor bank. The first power source can be configured to deliver energy to the third capacitor bank. The power management system can have a first power source configured to deliver energy to the first capacitor bank or the second capacitor bank.","The first capacitor bank can have a first capacitor having a first full capacitor voltage, a second capacitor having a second full capacitor voltage, a third capacitor having a third full capacitor voltage, a fourth capacitor having a fourth full capacitor voltage, and a fifth capacitor having a fifth full capacitor voltage. The first full capacitor voltage, the second full capacitor voltage, the third full capacitor voltage, the fourth full capacitor voltage, and the fifth full capacitor voltage can have the same voltage.","The power management element can have a microprocessor. The power management element can have a comparator. The power management system can have a voltage divider configured to send the current from the first capacitor bank to the first battery in 2.7 V increments. The power management system can have a voltage divider configured to send current from the second capacitor bank to the second battery in 2.7 V increments. The power management system can have a temperature management element and a temperature sensor, wherein the system is configured to be cooled when the system detects a temperature from the temperature sensor greater than an optimal temperature. The temperature management element can have at least one of a peltier junction or a piezo-electric plate.","The power management system can have a first capacitor bank, a second capacitor bank, a first power source configured to deliver energy to the first capacitor bank, and a battery. The second capacitor bank is configured to discharge current to the battery.","The power management system can have a second power source and a third capacitor bank. The third capacitor bank can be configured to receive energy from at least one of the first power source or the second power source. The first power source can have at least one of a solar panel, a wind turbine, or a fixed line. The first capacitor bank is less than or equal to 13.5 V. The power management system can have a satellite navigation receiver attached to the system.","The power management system can have a method for charging a first battery and a second battery. The method can determine a first voltage from the first battery; determine a second voltage from the second battery; route a first current from a first capacitor bank coupled to the first battery when the first voltage is less than a first full battery voltage; and route a second current from a second capacitor bank coupled to the second battery when the second voltage is less than a second full battery voltage. The method can charge a third capacitor bank from a first power source.","The power management system can have a method for charging a first battery and a second battery. The method can charge a first battery with a first capacitor bank; charge a second battery with a second capacitor bank; receive current from a power source to a third capacitor bank; and switch the third capacitor bank with the first capacitor bank when the first capacitor bank is less than an optimal capacitor voltage such that the first capacitor can receive current from the power source and the third capacitor bank can charge the first battery. The optimal capacitor voltage can be from about 0 V to about 2 V.","The power management system can have a method for charging a first battery and a second battery. The method can measure a first voltage from a first power source; measure a second voltage from a second power source; select the first power source or the second power source; receive a first current from the first power source or the second power source by a first capacitor bank; and discharge the current from the first capacitor bank to the first battery or the second battery. The receiving can occur in increments of 2.7 V. The system can select the first power source when the first voltage is greater than the second voltage. The system can manually select the first power source or the second power source by a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","101","101","227","225","226","224","206","213","222","223"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The power management system  can have at least a first power source , a second power source , a third power source, a fourth power source, and\/or a fifth power source (the third power source, the fourth power source, and\/or the fifth power source are not shown in ).
