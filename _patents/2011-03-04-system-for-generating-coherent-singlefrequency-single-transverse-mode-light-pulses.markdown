title: System for generating coherent single-frequency single transverse mode light pulses
abstract: A system is provided to generate coherent single-frequency and single transverse mode light pulses. A laser produces a linearly-polarized continuous wave beam defined by a single longitudinal and transverse mode. A first rotator processes the beam such that optical polarization is rotated during a first time period and not rotated during a second and third time period. A second rotator is operated during the first period to rotate optical polarization of the beam, during the second period to not rotate the beam, and during the third period to rotate the beam. An optical loop amplifies the beam during the first and second periods. An amplifier device can be added to the loop for amplification. A first beam splitter allows the beam to enter the loop and a second splitter directs the beam along the loop during the first and second periods and out of the loop during the third period.

Often, several pulses in a sequence are required to have the same frequencies and transverse mode structures. The same frequency and transverse mode structure is crucial to the performance of systems that involve interferometry between signals that are generated by different pulses.","Current systems attempt to achieve the single transverse mode requirement by design of the generating laser cavity. The control and matching of the frequency is generally achieved by using a low-power, continuous-wave, single-frequency laser to seed the cavity of a Q-switched pulse laser.","The laser cavity design comprises one mirror of the pulsed laser cavity attached to a piezoelectric mount that can be repositioned with the application of a control voltage. A control circuit is used to adjust the piezoelectric mount such that the frequency of the laser pulse is adjusted to be a controllable frequency difference from the seed laser pulse beam. This is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that the build-up time of the laser pulse depends on the difference between the seed laser beam frequency and the nearest piezoelectrically-controlled resonant frequency of the pulsed cavity.","The pulse build-up time is a minimum when the resonant frequency of the pulsed cavity laser is equal to the frequency of the seed laser beam. The control circuit works by altering the position of the piezoelectrically-controlled mirror laser by a small distance to either side of the matched frequency mirror position. Measurements of the pulse build-up time are made for pulses generated with the mirror on both sides of the frequency matching position. The differences in pulse build-up are used to correct any position errors.","When the pulsed laser is activated, a search procedure is used to establish the desired operating point. While the result is the generation of a sequence of high-power light pulses that have frequencies with known variations on either side of the seed laser beam; the alteration rate must be suitable to keep up with the cavity drifts caused by temperature variations and slow drifts in the seed beam frequency.","Accordingly, it is a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to provide a system for generating single-frequency, single transverse mode light pulses.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system for using a low-power laser to generate high-amplitude, single-frequency, single transverse mode light pulses.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a system is provided for generating coherent single-frequency and single transverse mode light pulses. A laser of the system produces a linearly-polarized continuous wave laser beam defined by a single frequency and a single transverse mode.","A first polarization rotator is positioned to receive and process the laser beam. The first polarization rotator is operated during a first time period to rotate optical polarization of the laser beam. The first polarization rotator is operated during a second time period and a third time period to not rotate optical polarization of the laser beam. An optical amplification loop is positioned to receive the laser beam.","The optical amplification loop amplifies the received laser beam during the first time period and the second time period. A second polarization rotator is operated during a third time period in order to rotate the optical polarization of the amplified laser beam so that the laser beam is ejected from the loop in order to provide the output pulse.","Referring now to the drawings,  depict an optical system for generating coherent single-frequency, single transverse mode light pulses that is referenced generally in each figure as item . Each of  illustrates the optical configuration of the system  during one of three different time periods indicated on the timing diagrams A and B presented with each figure. While the physical structure of system  is the same for the three time periods,  illustrates the optical configuration of the system from time tto tthat will be referred to hereinafter as time period ;",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","102","10","103","101","103"],"sub":["2 ","3 ","3 ","4 ","4"]},"Referring to , a continuous-wave, single-longitudinal mode and single transverse mode laser  produces a collimated, continuous-wave laser beam as referenced by arrows . The laser beam  is linearly polarized with a possible direction of polarization indicated by arrow . The laser beam  is passed through a polarization rotator  that can be operated either to preserve or rotate the linear polarization of the laser beam.","The rotator  typically includes an electrical signal generator A and a controllable optical element B (e.g., a Pockels cell, a Kerr cell, etc.) where the optical element preserves or rotates the polarization of the laser beam  based on the electrical signal (e.g., voltage) received from the generator. In the use of the rotator  in the present embodiment, the operation is to turn a laser beam \u201con and off\u201d. The rotator  provides a \u201cfast switch\u201d and optimal synchronization with other components of the system . Other components, known in the art, such as acousto-optic modulators and mechanical shutters may be possible alternatives for use in regard to the modulator ; however if used, the laser output polarization would have to be changed separately.","In terms of the time period , the electrical signal generator A applies a voltage (pulse) to the optical element B that causes polarization rotation of the laser beam . Timing diagram A illustrates the voltage output of the signal generator A.","With the optical element B energized during the time period , the polarization of the laser beam  is rotated to be perpendicular to the polarization direction  as indicated at direction . The laser beam  in the polarization direction  is presented to an optical amplification loop . In general, the amplification loop  includes a number of optical elements that circulate and amplify that portion of the laser beam  presented to the loop during the time period . Ejection or redirection of the laser beam  from the loop will be explained below in regard to time period .","The laser beam  enters the amplification loop  via a beam splitter  that is configured to pass the laser beam in the polarization direction , but deflects the laser beam in the polarization direction  towards a polarization rotator . Similar to the rotator , the rotator  includes a signal generator A and a controllable optical element B (e.g., a Pockels cell, a Kerr cell, etc.). During the time period , the signal generator A applies a voltage (pulse) to the element B that causes polarization rotation of the laser beam.","Timing diagram B illustrates the voltage output of the signal generator A. With the optical element B energized during the time period ; the polarization of the laser beam  in the polarization direction  is rotated to the polarization direction  for presentation to another beam splitter .","The beam splitter  is configured to pass the laser beam  in the polarization direction . Next, a light amplifier  amplifies the beam to generate an amplified beam A in the polarization direction . A lens  converges the amplified beam and focuses the beam to an input  of a single mode polarization preserving optical fiber  that can contain the amplified beam generated during the time period . This condition avoids coherent interactions of the amplified front edge of the pulse with other segments of the pulse that could alter the frequency of the pulse in the fiber .","Along its length, the fiber  can be formed into one or more loops L to facilitate space considerations for the system . It is also known in the art that the fiber  can also act as an amplifier so that the amplifier  is not always needed. The amplified beam contained within the fiber  exits from an optical end  to produce a diverging beam output that is then re-collimated by a lens  from which amplified beam A (in the polarization direction ) emerges.","The optical length of the optical amplification loop  is such that the emergence of the amplified beam A in the direction  from the lens  occurs after the conclusion of the time period . In other words, the time period  must be less than the time needed for the light to travel completely around the loop  (i.e., the round or loop trip travel time).","The explanation of the operation of the system  will continue now with reference to  where the optical configuration of the system  during the time period  is illustrated. During the time period , the signal generators A and A output a \u201czero\u201d pulse as shown respectively in timing diagrams A and B. Accordingly, the optical elements B and B will not rotate polarization of a beam presented thereto.","As mentioned above, the beam splitter  is configured to pass light in the polarization direction . Therefore, the laser beam  in the polarization direction  emerging from the rotator  during the time period  will pass through the beam splitter  for absorption by a light absorber . At the same time, the amplified beam A (in the polarization direction ) emerging from the lens  will also pass through the beam splitter  for presentation to the rotator . Since the rotator  is configured such that the rotator will not rotate polarization; the beam A in the polarization direction  is maintained. The amplified beam A is then passed through beam splitter  for further amplification at amplifier  and further passage through lens , fiber  and lens . This loop is repeated during the time period  which is designed\/selected to provide the desired amount of beam amplification.","At the conclusion of the time period , the time period  begins. The resulting configuration and operation of the system  during the time period  is explained with the aid of . During the time period , the signal generator A is maintained at a zero voltage (i.e., a \u201cno polarization\u201d rotation voltage) while the signal generator A again outputs a voltage that will bring about polarization rotation at the optical element B. The time tis adjusted to coincide with the beginning of the pulse exiting at the lens  after the desired number of propagation loops through the amplification loop .","The corresponding signal voltages are illustrated in respective timing diagrams A and B. Accordingly, the laser beam  in the polarization direction  is maintained through the beam splitter  and is passed to a light absorber  as was the case in the time period . However the amplified beam A in the polarization direction  is rotated by the rotator  such that the amplified beam in the polarization direction  emerges from the rotator  and is presented to the beam splitter .","While the beam splitter  is configured to pass light in the polarization direction , the beam splitter  is configured to deflect light in the polarization direction  out of the optical amplification loop . That is, during the time period , the amplified beam A in the polarization direction  is the output beam of the system . This condition is maintained by the optical element B until after the next pulse enters the amplification loop  (i.e., during the first time period ) so that no resonant modes of the loop can build up a laser oscillation. At the conclusion of the time period , the above-described process is repeated to produce another amplified laser pulse.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The laser output frequency of the system is equal to the stable seed laser frequency. The polarization of the output is linear in the polarization direction . The seed laser can efficiently excite the polarization preserving single transverse mode of the fiber; thereby, ensuring the spatial coherence of the output beam. The recycling of the pulse allows the same amplifier to be used to achieve the desired pulse powers. The time tis chosen so as to achieve the desired output pulse repetition rate and to allow for the re-excitation of the amplifier . The use of an optical fiber to implement the delay (required to avoid coherent interaction between the amplified front edge of a pulse and a later portion of the pulse and to thereby avoid a frequency shift to the nearest cavity mode) allows the delay to be implemented using a number of fiber loops so that a large delay can be achieved within a compact space.","Another advantage is that temporal shape and time delays between pulses are accomplished by modulating the continuous-wave output of the stable low-power laser; thereby, allowing great flexibility in the shapes and time delays in the sequence of amplified pulses that appear at the output.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
