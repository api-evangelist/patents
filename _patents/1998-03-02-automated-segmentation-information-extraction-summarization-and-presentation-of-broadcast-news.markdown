title: Automated segmentation, information extraction, summarization, and presentation of broadcast news
abstract: A technique for automated analysis of multimedia, such as, for example, a news broadcast. A Broadcast News Editor and Broadcast News Navigator system analyze, select, condense, and then present news summaries. The system enables not only viewing a hierarchical table of contents of the news, but also summaries tailored to individual needs. This is accomplished through story segmentation and proper name extraction which enables the use of common information retrieval methodologies, such as Web browsers. Robust segmentation processing is provided using multistream analysis on imagery, audio, and closed captioned stream cue events.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of a prior United States Provisional Application entitled \u201cMultimedia Summaries of Broadcast News,\u201d Ser. No. 60\/065,947 filed on Oct. 27, 1997.","Advances in video and computing technologies are enabling the production of increasing amounts of multimedia information in the form of broadcast radio and television programs, video recordings, multimedia software, Web pages, and the like. The now widespread popularity of broadcast news services such as the Cable News Network (CNN), news documentary programs such as produced by the Public Broadcasting System (PBS), and computerized interactive media such as the Web pages provided by USA Today, have made it clear that the value of multimedia information has expanded beyond transient communication and entertainment to become a serious form of business communication, advertisement, historical record and research tool.","Researchers have long used content summaries as a valuable way to locate source material. In the case of printed media such as books or magazines, it is fairly simple to create an index or abstracts of contents at the expanded beyond transient communication and entertainment to become a serious form of business communication, advertisement, historical record and research tool.","Researchers have long used content summaries as a valuable way to locate source material. In the case of printed media such as books or magazines, it is fairly simple to create an index or abstracts of contents at the time that the source material is edited or typeset. The indexes, abstracts, or even the full text can then be maintained in the form of computer files; indeed, in most cases, the source information now originates as word processing files. Standard data base software can then be used to search for information of interest, and there are many different examples of such systems in commercial operation at the present time. Some of these systems exploit techniques to automatically summarize text. These include simply selecting a predetermined number of the initial words, measuring word-frequency distributions, detecting clue phrases (e.g., \u201cin summary,\u201d \u201cthe most important\u201d), or reasoning about the discourse and\/or rhetorical structure.","Just as content abstraction techniques have been found to be quite valuable for managing printed text materials, multimedia sources would ideally be available with similar facilities to support real-time profiling as well as retrospective search. Unfortunately, unlike printed media, the innate continuous and visual nature of multimedia information makes it relatively difficult to catalogue. At the present time, it is common to employ data analysts to manually view, search, extract, transcribe, summarize, visualize, annotate, and segment multimedia information sources for a subject of interest or discovery of trends. These manual annotation techniques suffer from problems of accuracy, consistency (when performed by more than one operator), timeliness, scalability, and cost.","Certain techniques have been developed to automatically create time indices based on visual transitions in the multimedia image stream (e.g., dissolve, fade, cut) and shot classification (e.g., news anchor shot versus story shots). See, for example, Zhang, H., et al., in \u201cVideo Parsing, Retrieval and Browsing: An Integrated and Content-Based Solution,\u201d 95, pp. 15\u201324. Certain other researchers have specifically investigated the linguistic aspects of video such as closed captioned text or transcripts, and provided for the indexing of key words with associated key video frames to create a static and\/or hypertext depiction of television news. See Shahraray, B., et al., in \u201cAutomated Authoring of Hypermedia Documents of Video Programs,\u201d 95, pp. 401\u2013409, and Liang, Y., et al., in \u201cA Practical Video Database Based on Language and Image Analysis,\u201d 1997, pp. 127\u2013132. More complex linguistic processing is reported in Taniguchi, et al., \u201cAn Intuitive and Efficient Access Interface to Real-Time Incoming Video Based on Automatic Indexing,\u201d 95, pp. 25\u201334, who use Japanese topic markers such as \u201cex ni tsuite\u201d and \u201cwa\u201d (\u201cwith regard to\u201d, \u201cas for\u201d), as subject key word markers. Unfortunately, such key word indices, even when supplemented with linguistic processing to address complexities such as synonymy, polysemy, and co-reference, typically only support more traditional search and retrieval tasks. Brown, M. G., et al., in \u201cAutomatic Content Based Retrieval of Broadcast News,\u201d 95, pp. 35\u201344, provide content-based access to video using a large scale, continuous speech recognition system to transcribe the associated audio. And, Hauptmann, A., et al., in \u201cInformedia: News on Demand Multimedia Information Acquisition and Retrieval,\u201d , (Cambridge, Mass.: AAAI Press, 1997), pp. 215\u2013239, perform a series of analyses including color histograms, optical flow analysis, and speech transcription.","The techniques noted above do not automatically perform the segmentation, content extraction, and summarization believed to be more useful for higher level browsing search or analysis of news broadcast representations, however. Therefore, the present invention is a way to automatically annotate and summarize multimedia data representative of the information in a news broadcast so that it may be visualized, searched, and disseminated in a manner which is compatible with popular browsing tools originally developed for text-based documents. Segmentation, extraction and summarization also enable more timely and efficient (for example, \u201clow bandwidth\u201d) communication and storage of multimedia data.","In one aspect, the invention automatically correlates event cues in multiple media streams to improve story segmentation performance by using a finite state machine enhanced with temporal information.","The segmented source material may then be further processed to provide for the extraction of facts from the linguistic stream, representative key frames to permit visualization of extracted information, and even the identification of trends and patterns within news stories.","The invention also provides for integration of image, audio and language processing techniques to support automated story summarization, making use of algorithms for proper name, key phrase, and key frame extraction. The system is thus capable of generating multimedia summaries and trend analysis tailored to a user query in a Web browser format.","While the primary focus is on automated processing of broadcast news sources, the invention may also be applied to any structured multimedia source as well, such as documentary videos, radio broadcast, surveillance videos, amateur home videos, and the like. Different news sources require only the creation of different finite state machines which capture the appropriate broadcast state models for segment classification.","In one particular aspect, the invention is a method for automatically processing, in real time, a media presentation such as a news broadcast to generate representations of story segments contained therein. The method consists of creating a finite state representation of the expected structure of the media presentation including at least a news story state and an advertising state, with state transitions being indicated by events occurring within the media presentation. Portions of the media presentation are then selected as news story segments by correlating events detected within at least one information stream in the media presentation with the state transitions in the finite state representation.","The events may include both intrastream cues, that is, events occurring within a given one of several multimedia information streams or channels (for example, audio, video, or closed captioned text), or may also be interstream cues, that is, events occurring across multiple streams. For example, a black frame in the video stream and silence in the audio stream may indicate the onset of a segment transition.","The correlated events may occur as intrastream cues in a text information stream as provided by closed captioning or by speech recognition of an audio stream. These intrastream cues may include token phrases indicative of introductory news broadcast terms, anchor to reporter hand-off phrases, reporter to anchor hand-off phrases, leaders to highlights of upcoming news stories, or sign-off phrases.","For example, introductory news broadcast terms may include phrases such as \u201cI'm\u201d, \u201chello\u201d, \u201cwelcome\u201d, \u201chello from\u201d, \u201cwelcome to\u201d, \u201cthanks for watching\u201d, \u201cthanks for joining us\u201d, and \u201chere on\u201d. Anchor to reporter phrases may include a station or network identification with a reporter named entity, a reporter named entity with the phrase \u201cjoins us\u201d, or a reporter named entity with the phrase \u201creports\u201d. Reporter to anchor phrases may include a station identification with a reporter named entity, a reporter named entity with a located named entity, \u201cback to you\u201d, and \u201cthank you\u201d. Highlight leaders may include such phrases as \u201ccoming up\u201d, \u201cnext on\u201d, \u201cahead on\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d together with a station identification and \u201creturns\u201d, and \u201calso ahead\u201d. Sign-off phrases may include \u201cthat wraps up\u201d, \u201cthat is all\u201d, \u201cthat's all\u201d, \u201cthat's\u201d together with a news program identification, \u201cthanks for watching\u201d, and \u201cthanks for joining us\u201d.","In yet another particular aspect of the invention, a multimedia source is automatically processed to generate representations of story segments contained therein by a method of detecting interstream, cross-channel event cues occurring in multiple information channel streams, including event cues in an image stream, an audio stream, and a text stream, for example. Redundancy in these cross-channel event cues is exploited by including them in a logical representation of an expected event structure of the media presentation.","The expected event structure may include indicators of relatively high level media presentation states such as before start of broadcast, start of broadcast, highlight segment, advertising, story start, story end, before end of broadcast, and end of broadcast.","Event cues specifically for the image stream, used for example to detect scene changes, may be detected by categorizing types of image frames such as black frame, logo frame, single anchor frame, double anchor or reporter frame.","Event cues in the audio stream may include but are not limited to silence detection and speaker change detection.","Event cues in the text stream may be determined by detecting the occurrence of named entities, such as persons, locations, and organizations.","The invention also provides for automatically processing a media presentation by dividing the media presentation into one or more news story segments, processing a textual portion of the new story segments to detect named entities (such as people, places, organizations, dates, etc.) referred to therein; and then displaying the named entities associated with each news story segment. The named entities may be displayed together with an imagery frame selected from each news story segment, or a graph of frequency versus time of occurrence of the associated news story segment. Additionally, a story summary, topic, gist and full source text can be matched with the above components.","A. Introduction and System Architecture","Turning attention now to  in detail, an automated system  for content-based segmentation, information extraction, summarization and presentation of the content of a video program such as a news broadcast is shown in block diagram form. The functional aspects of the system  are divided into a news analysis subsystem  referred to as the Broadcast News Editor\u2122 (BNE) and a news information browsing subsystem  referred to as the Broadcast News Navigator\u2122 (BNN). BNE and BNN are trademarks of The MITRE Corporation of McLean, Va.","The Broadcast News Editor  consists of segmentation, extraction and summarization functions described below in further detail. It typically operates automatically such as every evening, according to a preprogrammed schedule of news broadcasts.","The Broadcast News Navigator  provides a presentation interface for the data produced by the Broadcast News Editor  in real time. It typically provides such data in response to user queries in a convenient form such as a World Wide Web page using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and\/or Java applets.","In terms of physical hardware, the system  preferably consists of a number of network computing systems, including a front end Intel Pentium-based personal computer , a UNIX-based file server  such as available from Sun Microsystems of Santa Clara, Calif., and a browser enabled client workstation , also a personal computer. In general, the personal computer  is responsible for capturing and converting information from a news media source  into digital form. The UNIX server  is used to provide portions of both the BNE  and BNN  subsystem functions. The client workstation  is used to browse the formatted information. This enable users of multimedia platforms to access multimedia content via browser programs.","After the front end processor  captures this data from the various streams in the media source , it passes data files to the UNIX server  for further processing. The UNIX server  is then responsible for processing the converted information from various information streams in the media source , including video imagery data , audio sample data , and closed captioned text data . The image data , for example, may be stored as an MPEG format file, the audio as an MPA format file, and the closed captioned text information as a text file.","The files representing the imagery , audio  and closed captioned text  streams are then fed to the Broadcast News Editor  to complete various functions for segmentation and classification of the news program. Those functions include scene change detection , scene classification , silence detection , speaker change detection , speech transcription , and closed captioned preprocessing . The outputs of these functions are provided to a correlation process , which performs multiple functions such as broadcast detection , commercial detection , and story segmentation . Named entity tagging  and token detection  also provide inputs to the correlation process . The outputs of the correlation process  are fed to story summary , story classifier  and key frame selection  processes as well.","The results of the above process are stored in the relational multimedia database management system  and video server and media storage . This data are then made available to the browser-enabled client  over a network connection  such as the Internet, a corporate Internet or other computer network.","Before proceeding with a detailed discussion of how these various functions achieve broadcast news segmentation and summary according to the invention, it will help to understand certain basic steps of the automated summarization process. These basic processes, as shown in , include analysis , selection , condensation , and presentation .","Within the analysis function , information is selected from the input media source and condensed into compact form. The selection function  selects such information based upon frame counts, cues, and other clues, such as by using priori structural understanding of the news program content. The condensation function  provides further compacting of the information by automated extraction and aggregation, together with a generation of a summary tailored to the interests of the particular user. The presentation function  focuses on the manner of presenting condensed information to the user in a sensible manner based upon type of media, desired layout, and end user tool realization.","More particularly now, in the specific instance of addressing the analysis of broadcast news programs, the analysis function  includes detection of discourse structure, such as anchor to reporter handoffs, commercials, interview segments, and other aggregatable program elements as occurring in the individual imagery , audio , and text  streams. The output of analysis  is an annotated version of the source information; this data is stored in the database management system  with pointers to related and other temporal references to a source file in order to permit later retrieval of specific segments.","Once the source content has been analyzed , the next step in summarization is content selection . Content may be selected from individual video channels (in other words, selecting just the imagery , audio , or closed captioned text ). In other instances, content may be selected from several information streams synchronously, such as in the case of a video clip. In still other instances, content may include elements selected from several temporally distinct portions of different streams to be integrated into a composite summary segment. For example, it may be desirable to select a key frame from an imagery stream  and store that together with audio data  taken from a different place in the source .","The simplest content selection technique is to count image frames, such as selecting the first few frames of the imagery , first few words of the text , or first few seconds of audio . A slightly more sophisticated content based selection algorithm is to exploit clues that might identify key passages. For example, the selection process  may detect spoken or closed captioned token phrases such as \u201cin summary\u201d, \u201cthe most important\u201d; similar spoken language cues in the audio stream; or images that contain predetermined, known visual features that would serve as informative key frames such as on screen logos, anchor\/reporter names or locations; or significant changes in the color, text, or shape of image frames indicating new scene content. In addition to these syntactic cues, other summarization techniques may statistically analyze the frequency of occurrence of words, images, or sounds as indicative of the most common or most important content.","Another method of content selection  involves compilation of \u201cvideo discourse\u201d or camera motions, such as cut, pan, or zoom to guide the extraction of key frames. A camera zoom may, for example, be represented by a situating shot extracted from the beginning of the zooming segment, followed by a key frame selected from the end of the zooming segment representing the target of the zoom. Higher level structural feature extraction may include, for example, in a broadcast news program, deleting commercial segments while retaining segments that contain top of the news summaries.","In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the content selection process  extracts a multistream summary, including (1) a textual summary consisting of the first sentence of the closed captioned text or the sentence containing the words which collectively have the highest named entity frequency of occurrence within the story, or if the named entity frequency is equal for more than one sentence, the sentence which occurs first in the story is selected, (2) a key imagery frame based upon the type of segment (e.g., news preview\/highlights, anchor segment, reporter segment, or weather segment), and (3) the six most frequently occurring named entities or key phrases in the story as detected from the closed captioned text.","Following selection , the condensation process  may be used to further condense the material whereby similar content is aggregated. For example, if several equivalent key imagery frames are determined to be highly indicative of the source content, a simple exemplary key frame can be used to represent all such frames. As described further below, this is also the preferred manner of operating for named entity extraction (that is, following an extraction of multiple occurrences of the same person, organization, or location, they are consolidated). Similarly, if several similar but not identical entities or events are to be extracted, these can be combined into a higher level class to be expressed. An example of this can occur when a commercial airplane crash and an air show collision are both in the news and they can be represented as two aviation accidents. As another example, if only named entities of a particular type are mentioned in a story, they may be used to describe the story type (e.g., a story about a location) or search stories by type (e.g., find all stories about people).","Finally, a presentation process  generates a multimedia summary and generally encompasses several tasks, including the planning of the structure of the presentation, including an order of the content to be presented. To ensure coherence, this may also include selecting output media (text, imagery, audio) appropriate to the end user's task and environment, and realizing and laying out the content in an effective manner. Unlike simple text summarization, the automated presentation process  draws source material from any or all of the imagery , audio , or text  streams or by combining information from more than one stream. In the present embodiment, the realization and layout is typically within the confines of presenting an electronic document form suitable for presentation by a Web-compatible browser program.","B. Broadcast News Editor (BNE)","This section describes the various processes performed by the Broadcast News Editor  in more detail. Returning attention to , the overall purpose of the Broadcast News Editor  is to provide high performance content-based access to the news in an efficient and effective manner. This is accomplished by independent detection of events or other cues in the multiple information streams (imagery , audio , and text ) of the media source , and then correlation such events with a model of expected new broadcast behavior. The image data  is first processed by the scene change detection process  such as provided by the Scene Stealer\u2122 hardware and software product available from Dubner International, Inc. Scene change detection  operates to sample video frames and then determine frames where various types of changes in the scene occur, as described below in greater detail. The imagery stream  is also processed through a signal-processing program that identifies the frames that are most equivalent to these models over selected periods of time, typically by extracting and storing them at one second intervals.","Scene change detection  is augmented by key frame selection heuristics that are engineered based upon the structure of individual video programs. For example, the key frame selection  may select a representative or \u201ckey\u201d video frame based upon the structure of individual video programs known in advance. For example, the key frame for a story containing a reporter segment is typically selected from the center of the reporter segment. A key frame for a news anchor segment may be taken from the beginning of the segment. However, for a story containing an anchor segment followed by a reporter segment, the key frame selector  will chase the frame which occurs in the center of the reporter segment. Other types of segments may have other types of key frame heuristics.","Audio analysis includes silence detection  and speaker change detection . Silence detection  is determined based upon low energy levels in the audio signal (for example, 0.7 seconds of low observed signal energy can be used as the criteria). The speaker change detection process  divides the audio stream  into a series of non-overlapping windows of predetermined lengths, such as 2, 5, 10, and 20 seconds. Feature vectors are then derived for each window using a difference metric to measure the relative change from window to window. Changes exceeding a threshold are identified as a speaker change event.","The closed captioned text  is processed by the closed captioned preprocessing  to automatically detect textual cues indicative of commercials and story segments in accordance with techniques which are further described below. In an alternate embodiment, spoken language automatic transcription  can provide a similar function to the closed captioned preprocessing  in a system in which closed captioned text is not directly provided by the video source . The closed captioned preprocessing  removes non-ASCII characters.","The named entity tagging process  extracts named entities from the closed captioned stream  such as people, places, and things. This is accomplished by detecting clue words and other linguistic indicators of such named entities. Story boundaries may also be detected in a similar manner.","The difficulty with attempting to segment a news broadcast by using only closed captioned text events is that the text stream is typically characterized by ungrammatical, upper case-only text. Therefore, applying capitalization cues alone, for example, cannot typically be used for named entity detection. Furthermore, errors of stenographic transcription (e.g., insertion, substitution, and deletion of characters in transcribed words) result in 2\u201320% word error rates in various news broadcast sources.","To overcome these difficulties in the closed captioned preprocessing , which would be less than ideal operating on its own, the correlation process  exploits cue event redundancy among all of the various streams , , and . For example, a detected black frame in the imagery data  may be temporally synchronous with silence in the audio data . This may be used to determine a commercial boundary. A cross-channel correlation such as detecting a broadcast logo in the imagery data  with a linguistic utterance such as \u201cGood Night\u201d in the closed captioned text  may be used to detect a program end.","To better understand how the correlation  process operates, consider that a broadcast news program tends to follow a general format across the entire program. Even within a story segment, a news broadcast can typically be broken down into a series of expected \u201cstates.\u201d Such states, for example, may include \u201cStart of Broadcast\u201d, \u201cAdvertising\u201d, \u201cNew Story\u201d, and \u201cEnd of Broadcast\u201d. Multi-stream cues, including time, may then be used to detect when a state transition has occurred. In other words, these parallel sources of segmentation information are used to navigate a state transition table, including cues from the image stream , discourse cues from the audio stream , and text cues from the closed captioned stream . Together, these provide redundant segmentation cues that are correlated and exploited to achieve higher precision in element segmentation.","Exemplary Segmentation for CNN Prime News","Consider as one example of a preferred embodiment of the invention an observation of the format of Cable News Network's (CNN's) evening PrimeNews program. A Prime News broadcast includes events typical of all news broadcasts, such as a start and end portion having with an anchor person segment, reporter segments preceded by an introductory anchor segment, and commercials segments serving as story boundaries.","However, each news program has a specific multimedia \u201cvocabulary\u201d of expected events peculiar to itself which can be exploited to identify structure and extract individual segments. CNN's PrimeNews broadcast typically has a multimedia vocabulary that includes the following states indicated by various visual, audio, and text cues:","Before Start of Broadcast. This state lasts an unknown period of time before the PrimeNews broadcast actually begins. The recognition of this state permits the correlation process  to analyze videotapes of the broadcast and other sources where the broadcast does not start at a fixed time of day.","Start of Broadcast. This is a transition state immediately before the start of the broadcast. The CNN logo is displayed in the video stream. There is typically a fade from black to the logo. As the logo is displayed, the audio stream contains a recording of James Earl Jones saying \u201cThis is CNN\u201d.","Highlights. This state lasts from 30\u201390 seconds. During this state, the CNN anchor introduces the top stories that will be covered in the full broadcast, typically with 5\u201315 second long story \u201cteasers\u201d. An audible jingle is heard in the background.","End of Highlights. This is another transition state where the anchors typically introduce themselves and state the date.","Start of Story. At the start of a story, one anchor is speaking, typically in the anchor booth. Stories can last anywhere from 15 to 360 seconds. The anchor may transition to a reporter or to a topic expert, who typically then continues the same story. A graphic will often accompany the anchor at the start of a story.","End of Story. A transition state where the reporter or topic expert will transition back to the anchor in the anchor booth. In addition, the anchor that is speaking will often transition to the other anchor.","Within Broadcast Highlights. Typically about 15 minutes into the broadcast, another highlight section occurs for the remaining stories. This segment lasts from 15 to 45 seconds, with the individual story teasers being from 5 to 15 seconds long. An advertising segment always follows this state.","Advertising. Advertising states last from 90 to 240 seconds and consist of a series of 15-, 30- or 60-second commercials. The advertiser always records the commercials, they are never delivered by an anchor.","Before End of Broadcast. A transition state where the anchors sign off from the program and inform the audience of upcoming programs on CNN.","End of Broadcast. This state lasts an unknown period of time after the broadcast has finished until the next broadcast begins. There is usually a fade to a black frame within this state.","A significant aspect of the Broadcast News Editor  includes the various elements which determine when a specific news broadcast is in each of these states. To detect when a state transition occurs, cues from the imagery , audio , and text  streams are detected as well as a time reference. When one of the analysis programs detects a cue, the event is stored in an integrated relational table in the database management system  by broadcast, cue type and time stamp. This integrated relational table allows rapid and efficient story segmentation by the correlation process .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In order to more fully understand how the state transitions are used in correlation , the details of how each information stream of the media source  is processed to provide broadcast event cues will now be discussed.","Text Stream  Event Processing","In the closed captioned text stream , highly frequent word patterns are used as one type of cue for news story transitions. One such pattern is in the anchor introduction. For example, anchors typically introduce themselves by stating {\u201cI'm\u201d} followed by {the anchor's name}. In the preferred embodiment, a text entity tagging tool  called Alembic, developed by MITRE Corporation, is used to detect \u201cnamed entities\u201d such as a person, location, organization, time, date, or monetary value occurring in the closed captioned text. (See Aberdeen, J., et al., \u201cDescription of the Alembic System Used for MUC-6, Advanced Research Projects Agency, 6\u20138 (1995) for more details of Alembic; Alembic's part of speech recognizer is retrained to find named entities within broadcast news closed captioned text.)","The token phrase detection process  is then used with the output from the named entity tagging tool  to perform a search for the phrase pattern {\u201cI'm\u201d <Person>}. As seen in , the token detector  may exploit the fact that anchor introductions typically occur 30 to 45 seconds from the start of PrimeNews and at 10 to 20 seconds from the end of the program. Detection of the token phrase {\u201cI'm <Person>\u201d} is thus a reliable predictor of start of broadcast and end of broadcast events.","From an analysis of word frequencies and their temporal locations in PrimeNews, it is possible to identify other introductory phrases that occur in other contexts. A specific list of these other terms is listed in Table 1. Observed phrase frequency data for such other terms, similar to that of , can be used to develop a set of token phrases used as other indicators of the \u201cStart of Broadcast\u201d state.\n\n","Other token phrases are then used in a similar fashion to detect still other broadcast states, such as by having the token detector programmed to identify terms that identify the type of segment. For example, certain terms nearly always occur during story segments pertaining to the weather. A list of such weather terms is in Table 2. From a plot of expected term frequency versus time statistics for these terms, such as shown in , it can be seen that a weather report starts on average 22 minutes and 30 seconds from the start of the broadcast and ends on average 2 minutes and 45 seconds later. Using this information, a story is tagged as a weather segment if it falls within these time periods and uses the listed terms.\n\n","Story segment cues can also be detected by considering anchor to reporter and reporter to anchor hand-offs. For anchor to reporter detections, the phrases illustrated in Table 3 may be used where the identification of a person or location is first made by the named entity tagging tool . For reporter to anchor hand-off detections, the phrases illustrated in Table 4 may be used, where again the person and location named entities are first tagged.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0115"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

Most notable is the \u201c>>\u201d cue used to indicate a change in speaker and \u201c>>>\u201d cue used to indicate a change in story. When available, the closed captioned operator cues are a valuable source of information; however, their use by closed captioned operators is not standard and thus relying upon them alone may lead to errors. For example, while most broadcast news sources provide the speaker change indicator, the story change indicators are present for some sources. Moreover, operators also can make errors (of omission, substitution, and insertion), which further reduce the reliability of closed captioned stories.","It is important to note that the segmentation process described above for closed captioned text can also be applied to multimedia sources (e.g., television, radio, surveillance video, and amateur video) that do not have supporting closed captioned data. After speech-to-text processing, the resulting text stream can be analyzed for both structural and discourse cues, of course subject to transcription errors. Speech transcription errors are lower for certain types of segments, for example, anchor booth segments, which also enables application of speech transcription selectively, based on the type of segment.","Audio Stream  Event Processing","The silence detection process  as was described above analyzes the audio stream  for sample periods of silence of a predetermined length, such as at least 0.7 seconds. Sample periods for which the audio signal level does not exceed an energy threshold are then flagged as a silence event. Although there may be various reasons for periods of silence, the knowledge of these data points is useful. For example, as shown in , when these events are plotted over time, they can serve as additional information as to when story segments or commercials begin and end.","The audio stream  is also processed using speaker change detection  software that identifies a speaker change event when the speaker-dependent components of the audio signal change more than a predetermined amount.","Video Stream  Event Processing","The frame classification  process discovers the location of black frames, logos, single anchor (i.e., one anchor is visible), and double anchor (i.e., two anchors are visible) scenes from the input imagery . Black frames are used to detect commercials, and logos are used to detect the beginning and end of a broadcast. Single and double anchor booth frame recognitions aid in locating story segment boundaries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0139"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"112"},"The histogram for a frame is then matched against models for each frame type such as black frame, CNN logo, single anchor, double anchor, and reporter frames. If a sufficient level of match is detected, the frame is classified accordingly.","As shown in , a plot of detected video frame class versus time is also indicative of story segment begin and end, although not perfect, as indicated by the presence of white boxes (estimated events) versus corresponding actual (truth) events.","Multi-Stream Event Correlation ","An examination of  indicate that cues from any one stream are indicative, but not infallible, indicators of the beginning and ending of story segments. News story boundaries are thus more reliably detected by correlating the processing of each of the cues discussed above. In general, broadcast boundaries are found by correlating audio silence, video logo, and black frame cues along with closed captioned tokens. Commercials are primarily found by correlating audio silence, black frame, and closed captioned blank line cues. Finally, story segments are primarily found by correlating closed captioned punctuation symbols (>>>, >>, <person>:), anchor to reporter, and reporter to anchor hand off cues, although speaker change detection and scene change detection also assist in verifying their start and end.","When deciding on the preferred techniques to be used for cue correlation , there are two requirements. First, the technique should be flexible enough to allow the quick addition of new cues into the system. Second, the technique should be able to handle cues that are highly correlated with each other (e.g., Black Frame and Silence).","The preferred technique used herein is to implement cue correlation  as is a finite state automation (FSA) enhanced with time transitions. The states and transitions of the FSA are represented in a relational database. Each detected cue and token is represented by a state that is instantiated by a record in the state table. The time transition attribute of each state allows state changes based on the amount of time the FSA has been in a certain state. For example, since for a CNN PrimeNews broadcast it is known that the highlights section never lasts longer than 90 seconds, a time transition is created to move the FSA from the \u201cHighlights\u201d state to the \u201cStart of Story\u201d state whenever the FSA has been in the \u201cHighlights\u201d state for more than 90 seconds. The time transitions act as buffer against the possibility that no cues used to detect a transition to another state occur when the system expects them to.","A combination of black frame video, audio silence, and closed captioned operator cues allow one to identify advertising or commercial segments. The end of a sequence of commercials in the closed captioned text is indicated by a blank line followed by a line containing a change of speaker (>>) or new story (>>>) indicator. One can then search backwards to find the beginning of the sequence, which is indicated by a \u201c>>\u201d or \u201c>>>\u201d, followed by any number of non-blank lines, followed by a blank line. The blank lines correspond to short (0.5 to 3 second) silences which accompany the transitions from news to commercials and back to news. Having the ability to identify and eliminate commercials also benefits proper named entity extraction and story summarization routines.","Below are listed the primary cues used to determine when the news broadcast has entered each of the primary states. An exemplary map of states and state transitions for the preferred embodiment are shown in  and listed in Appendices A and B. Note that any one of several events may cause a transition from one state to another.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"Rows two through eleven of  indicate the results of event detection software applied to the phrase token search of the text stream.

The scene changes illustrate that our image segmentor over generates. The scene change data appears to lag the other data by several seconds. This is due to the clock sequencing of the scene change detection  system and is corrected by a time delta.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0157"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"120"},"A detailed depiction of a finite state autonoma for implementing correlation  is depicted in . A detailed description of each state transition is contained in Appendix A.","The processes described so far principally address the first stage in the above model of the summarization processes, namely analysis . The second and third stages in the process, selection  and condensation , address the problem of determining which elements within the text, speech, and imagery should be extracted as relevant. For example, it is possible to identify a summary of the major stories in the broadcast and a representation of the major stories themselves. A user wishing to browse a one-hour newscast therefore needs only review an opening summary and a preview of the major stories. Similarly, the need to review sponsor messages can be eliminated entirely.","Once the individual news stories have been identified, a story classifier  such as the ConText engine available from Oracle Corporation is used to identify a gist or theme for each story. The gist portion of ConText automatically consolidates large volumes of text, such as provided by the closed captioned stream  or converted audio stream  into a relevant summary, using Boolean logic and statistical calculation methods. Themes are also generated by ConText that can provide up to sixteen main topics for a given story.","The story summarization function  may also implement several heuristics for text summarization. The first is simply to pick the first N words from the text stream in a segment, assuming that the text was created in journalistic style. Since the named entity tagging  also extracts proper names out of the text, however, another strategy is to use the most frequently occurring named entity within each segment to serve as its label. Yet another particularly effective strategy is to select a sentence which contains the highest number of distinct named entities, selecting that sentence closest to the top of the story if there is a tie.","Along with each story, a representative key video frame can also automatically selected by the key frame selector , as described above.","The operation of the Broadcast News Editor  therefore results in various data elements being stored in the relational data base management system  as data files , as shown in . The database system  and video server  may be any relational database system and associated video server, for example, Oracle Relational Database Management System 7.3 with Oracle Video Server 2.1. Queries may be made through Oracle 2.0 Web Server. Within the data base system , a digitized source video file  and closed captioned text file  correspond to stored versions of the media source  and closed captioned text  streams. In addition, multiple story segment records , video theme records , video gist records , story summary records , and named entity records  result. Links are provided between the various records and the story segment to which they pertain, either directly or indirectly, to permit retrieval of related data.","C. Broadcast News Navigator (BNN)","The Broadcast News Navigator  enables a user to search and browse the meta data files  via a computer network. The user may do so through a graphical interface using a Web browser such as Netscape Communicator\u2122, Microsoft Explorer\u2122, or NCSA Mosaic\u2122. (Netscape Communicator is a trademark of Netscape Communications Corporation, Microsoft Explorer is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation, and Mosaic is a trademark of The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.) The graphical interface is provided by creating Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page files and\/or Java applets that access the meta data  in a manner that is well known in the art.","For example, one quite useful initial query is to search for the most popular named entities in news stories that have occurred in the last week.  illustrates one such response to this query, which is a plot of the frequency of named entities versus date. Notice that the plot shows there were many references to the named entities \u201cMOTHER THERESA\u201d, \u201cWHITE HOUSE\u201d, and \u201cPRINCESS DIANA\u201d during the week of 8 Sep. 1997. From this display, the user may then determine what the most frequent news stories were about during that time period.","The graphing program can also be arranged to continually graph new tags at preset time intervals, for example, 30 seconds. Once the user has found a tag of interest, the user simply clicks on the data point to view the related stories.","Within Broadcast News Navigator , a user may also specify particular broadcast news agencies and time periods they are interested in searching via a graphical interface as shown in . The system  will then generate a list of stories from broadcasts during these dates in reverse chronological order.","The returned stories are viewable in a thumbnail sketch of a given news broadcast such as depicted in , such as when the query is limited to a particular broadcast program, for example, Oct. 21, 1997, sorted in descending order of temporal occurrence. Each returned story contains a key frame, the date, the source, the three most frequent named entity tags, and links to story details.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0170"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},"By clicking on one of the key frames, the system  retrieves the stored files and accesses just the selected segment for playback. While viewing the video clip, such as shown in , the user has the ability to directly access the portion related to the story segment. Thus, if the story segment starts at six minutes and twelve seconds into the news broadcast, the streaming of the video to the user will start at that point.","The navigation tool  also gives the user the ability to view results by the frequency of detected topic, named person, named organization, or named location tag as shown in . The user may then select a named entity to then view a thumbnail, such as in , of the results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0173"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},"In order to create this summary, a key frame is selected from the story segment as previously described. A more sophisticated image extraction algorithm may exploit camera movement and also more informative imagery, such as \u201cvisual subtext\u201d on the screen identifying the speaker and\/or topic (i.e., a visual caption).","Within a story segment, matching extracted named entities are aggregated and the six most frequently occurring names, organizations, and locations identified within the story segment are selected to include in the summary. Next, the first sentence in the segment is selected as a key sentence. Alternatively, a more sophisticated text selection algorithm which exploits term frequency\/inverse document frequency, extracted entities, and a more sophisticated semantic and relational analysis is used to discover key phrases and utterances within a string. As  illustrates, the result is that for each story, the user obtains a key frame, the date, the source, the most frequently occurring named entities, a single line summary of the story, and pointers to view the closed captioned text or video for the story, as in .","A search tool may be used to search by named entity, such as by topic, organization, person, or location, as shown in . Other search query forms are possible, such as shown in , which is a search of the closed captioned text records. Either of these types of search queries can result in displays such as  or .","A program summary, as in , consisting of multiple story frames, can also serve to function as a top level, hierarchical, video table of contents.","It is also possible to provide a more tailored presentation, for example, searching for people, show only person named entities and key frames that include faces. Several alternative selection strategies can thus result in different summary views.","A program summary, as in , consisting of multiple story frames, can also serve to function as a top level, hierarchical, video table of contents. This results in a \u201cstory board\u201d of a broadcast, such as in , with one key frame representing each story, although given the limited key frame extraction algorithm, this may result in under coverage of the visually salient content.","In contrast to this entirely visual summarization\/presentation of the data, it is also possible to present an entirely text centric perspective. It is also possible to further connect these various levels of abstraction of the underlying story to start with a broadcast news program table of contents (a key frame associated with a headline) and allow the user to \u201cdrill down,\u201d obtaining increasing levels of detail in each media (key phrase to key sentence to full text, keyframe to keyclip to full segment, sound bite to full audio), ultimately providing the entire source.","Efficacy of Story Segmentation","Breaking a news broadcast into reported news stories provides effective browsing that requires the data analyst to review less material than through linear browsing unsegmented content. To demonstrate the efficiency of a story segment search, metrics were gathered in a task based retrieval experiment.","To search for a particular news story in a given program, a linear search was first performed in a sequential fashion throughout recorded video tapes until the story was found. This is obviously a time consuming technique but it provides a useful baseline for comparison. A keyword search through the associated time stamped video transcript provides a time-indexed pointer into the video stream for each instance where the keyword occurred. For example, if the user performed a keyword search on Peru, the result provided a pointer to the video for each location where the word Peru was spoken. Because a keyword search may provide multiple pointer references to the same story, it was intuitive that a story segment search is superior to a keyword search.","In our experiment, a user was therefore requested to find a story on three topics over a one-month time period. The user was asked to find these stories by using three techniques: linear search, keyword search and story segment search. The linear search was performed with a VCR with a shuttle-control. The keyword search was performed by searching the multimedia database for dates and times when the news program referenced the given keyword. For each date and time retrieved, the user manually searched through the videotape using the VCR shuttle control. The story segment search was performed using the Broadcast News Navigator system. The data set was the nightly half-hour CNN PrimeNews\u2122 programs from 14 Dec. 1996 to 13 January 1997.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0184"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Search Time and Number of Stories Found for"},{"entry":"Linear, Keyboard and BNN Searches"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Keyword",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Actual #","Manual Search","Search","BNN Search"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Stories","Time","Number","Time","Number","Time","Number"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Peru","17","3:10","16","2:40","18","0:02","22"]},{"entry":["Middle","16","3:16","16","2:53","17","0:02","25"]},{"entry":"East"},{"entry":["Gulf War","3","4:30","3","0:33","3","0:02","4"]},{"entry":"Chemicals"},{"entry":["Average",{},"3:39",{},"2:02",{},"0:02"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 7 shows the results of searching for three different topics where the \u201cActual # Stories\u201d column indicates the number of relevant stories as determined by a human expert for each of the three given topics, for example, Peru, Middle East, Gulf Ware Chemicals. As seen in the Table, the manual search took 80% longer on average than the keyword search and 10,850% longer than the BNN search.","There were three anomalies discovered with the test. First, in the manual search, when a story was discovered in a news program, the searcher stopped for the remainder of that news program with the assumption that the story would not reoccur. Second, in the keyword search, keywords detected in the first minute of a broadcast were ignored because they pointed to the highlights of the news. This method had better recall and retrieved more of the relevant stories because the stories that re-occurred in the news broadcast were detected. Third, in the BNN search, the system over-generated story segments, which increased the number of stories that were found. In three cases of over segmentation, a story crossed a commercial boundary and was broken into two individual stories. In one case, a story consisted of two sub-stories, the Peruvian Army and the Peruvian Economy.","Limitations and Future Directions","An important area for further evaluation is to enhance the media selection and media generation algorithms to enhance their generality and minimize program specific dependencies. The system can be extended to incorporate automated story summarization tailored to particular users interests. Another important area is in human factors and usability questions surrounding which types of summaries, and which mix of media, are most effective for which kinds of information seeking task. Additional sources of information in the audio channel can be exploited that may facilitate summarization, such as emphasis detection (via intonation), music detection, and spoken language transcription. In the imagery channel, it is also possible to use more sophisticated analyses to enable finer control over keyframe selection. Spoken language transcription may also effect performance results of story segmentation and named entity tagging.","Video and audio segmentation techniques can be used to detect the broadcast and commercial boundaries in an initial pass of the multimedia source. With these detected boundaries, it is possible to then process the smaller story segments simultaneously as opposed to processing the complete broadcast serially further enhancing performance. The following cues may also be added as input to the audio and video stream processing:\n\n","While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
