title: Sulfonated polymer composition for forming fuel cell electrodes
abstract: A membrane electrode assembly for a fuel cell is described. The materials for the membrane electrode assembly are formed from sulfonated polymers. A polymer dispersion ink containing the sulfonated polymer and a mixture of solvents is used to form the electrodes on the exchange membrane. The dispersion ink allows for the electrodes to be formed directly on the exchange membrane without significantly dissolving the exchange membrane.

Further, the invention includes a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly based on ion-conducting sulfonated polymeric materials, where the sulfonated polymeric materials may be used in the formation of the electrode as well as the proton exchange membrane.","Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have great potential as an environmentally friendly energy source. Fuel cells have been used in the space program since the 1960's, but recently with the focus on \u201cgreen\u201d resources, fuel cells have come to the forefront of commercialization. Specifically, fuel cells are being explored for use in automobiles, electronics, and stationary power applications.","A polymer electrolyte fuel cell typically includes membrane electrode assembly (\u201cMEA\u201d) positioned between a pair of gas diffusion layers. The MEA typically includes a cathode and an anode with an exchange membrane positioned between the anode and cathode. A catalyst is used in proximity to the cathode and the anode.","For the last 30 years, the industry standard for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) as well as the electrodes for the fuel cell has been Nafion\u00ae (polyperfluoro sulfonic acid) by DuPont.","Nafion\u00ae materials display sufficient proton conductivity (\u02dc0.1 S\/cm), good chemical resistance, and mechanical strength. Some of the disadvantages of Nafion\u00ae materials include high cost, reduced conductivity at high temperatures (>80\u00b0 C.), and high methanol permeability in direct methanol fuel cells.","Because of the renewed interest in fuel cells and the challenge of high temperature and direct methanol operation, new materials have been explored as potential replacements for Nafion\u00ae. Previous work has focused on sulfonated polystyrene, styrene-butadiene block copolymers, or poly(arylene ether)s such as PEEK. Typically, these polymers were all made by a post-sulfonation polymer modification reaction where the sulfonic acid groups are attached to the already formed polymer backbone.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a membrane electrode assembly.

By starting with the sulfonated monomer, followed by direct polymerization, sulfonation is maintained on the deactivated ring, as shown in Structure 2. By controlling the concentration and location of sulfonate groups in the polymer, various properties of the resulting membrane, such as conductivity and water content, may be controlled.

The aromatic ring, due to its proximity to the sulfone group, is deactivated for sulfonation reactions. Sulfonation on the deactivated aromatic ring is accomplished by sulfonating the corresponding monomer followed by polymerization to form the polysulfone. In this way, sulfonation of the deactivated ring is maintained.","The formation of the sulfonated polysulfone polymer takes place by selecting or creating the desired sulfonated monomer, which is typically in the form of a dihalide.

The comonomer may itself be substituted with a sulfonate moiety. The polymer produced includes a molar ratio of sulfonated activated aromatic monomer to activated aromatic monomer ranging from about 0.001 to about 1, and preferably from about 0.3 to about 0.6.","Having described the sulfonated polymers used in the present invention, certain embodiments of the present invention will now be described. The above described polymers will generally be referred to as \u201csulfonated polymers\u201d or \u201csulfonated copolymers.\u201d In certain embodiments, the sulfonated polymers are used as the material in the electrodes and the proton exchange membrane to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA).","One suitable method for forming a proton exchange membrane includes dissolving one or more of the above-described sulfonated polymers in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) followed by casting onto a suitable substrate such as glass. The sulfonated polymers of the present invention exhibit conductivities suitable for fuel cell applications and are typically above about 0.005 S\/cm.","To form the MEA, electrodes are positioned on each side of the exchange membrane. The electrodes are preferably formed from the same polymer as the exchange membrane. Using the same type of polymer for the electrode and the membrane provides good adhesion of the electrodes to the membrane and potentially lower interfacial resistance between the membrane electrode assembly layers. Dissolving the sulfonated polymer in DMAc as discussed above to cast the electrodes on the membrane is not desirable because the polymer in DMAc will dissolve the previously cast exchange membrane and substantially reduce the integrity of the exchange membrane.","To avoid this problem, an electrode casting dispersion of the sulfonated polymer is prepared that can be cast on the exchange membrane without substantially reducing the integrity of the exchange membrane. The electrode casting dispersion contains a dispersion of the sulfonated polymer. The electrode casting dispersion should have a sufficient amount of the dispersed sulfonated polymer to allow for the formation of an electrode. In certain embodiments, the electrode casting dispersion contains up to about 20% of the dispersed polymer by weight. Preferably, the dispersed polymer range from about 2 to about 10% by weight. The size of the polymer particles in the dispersion are not particularly limited provided that the dispersion is suitable for casting on a substrate. In some embodiments of the invention, the particle sizes of the polymer dispersion preferably range from about 10 nm to about 60 nm.","The solvents used for the electrode casting dispersion are preferably a combination of solvents that will not substantially reduce the integrity of the exchange membrane. The combination of solvents may vary depending the type of sulfonated polymer to be used. The solvents may include, but are not limited to, a combination of any of the following solvents: water, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), acetone, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), 1,3-dioxolane, 2-methoxy ethanol, or benzyl alcohol. Single, binary (two different solvents), and tertiary (three different solvents) solvent combination are most useful with a polymer concentration ranging from about 2 to about 10%. When DMAc or NMP is used as one of the solvents, the solvent combination preferably should not include more than about 10% DMAc or NMP in order to avoid reducing the integrity of the exchange membrane. Greater amounts may be acceptable depending on the other solvent used in the dispersion as well as the polymer being used.","In certain embodiments, the solvent may be a binary mixture of water and one other solvent. In other embodiments, DMAc or NMP is preferably used in tertiary solvent mixtures. Further the solvent combination may include a mixture of DMAc and NMP with other solvents, preferably with two or more other solvents.","Some exemplary solvent combinations for the electrode casting dispersion include, but are not limited to, a solution containing 50% acetone and 50% water; a solution of 20% 2-methoxyethanol and 80% water; a solution of 10% DMAc with 45% water and 45% isopropyl alcohol.","The electrode casting solution may be used to cast the electrode directly on the exchange membrane or other substrates such as glass or a Teflon or Kapton substrate such as a decal for hot pressing the electrode on the membrane.","The preparation of the electrode casting solution is not particularly limited as long as the method results in a substantially uniform dispersion of the sulfonated polymer in the solvent. When DMAc or NMP is used as one of the solvent components, it is preferable that the polymer is dissolved in a high concentration of up to about 40% by weight followed by addition to the other solvents. For example, the acid form of the sulfonated polymer may be dissolved in DMAc at a concentration up to about 40%. The sulfonated polymer\/DMAc solution may then be added slowly to a solution of 50% IPA and 50% water, or other solvent combination. Vigorous stirring during the addition is preferable to homogeneously disperse the sulfonated polymer in the solution. Preferably heat is used in conjunction with vigorous stirring to aid in the dispersion of the polymer in the solvents.","Another method for dispersing the polymer in the solvent to form the electrode casting solution includes adding the acid form of the polymer to a single, binary, or tertiary solvent combination. Vigorous stirring or sonication may be used to disperse the polymer and form a substantially homogeneous solution. Heat may also be used to aide in the dispersion of the polymer in the solvents.","Various additives that are to be included in the electrode may be added to the electrode casting solution. For example, water retention additives may be added to the electrode casting solution. Water retention additives are used to help retain water in the polymer on a local scale to increase proton conduction at low levels of hydration. Suitable water retention additives include, but are not limited to, heteropoly acids such as inorganic heteropoly acids. The weight ratio of heteropoly acid to sulfonated polymer may range up to about 60%. Preferably, the weight ratio of the heteropoly acid ranges from about 5% to about 60%. The ratio will vary depending on the type of the sulfonated polymer and the type of the heteropoly acid used. The types of heteropoly acids include but are not limited to, phosphotungstic acid, phosphomolybdic acid, zirconium hydrogen phosphate, and zirconium containing heteropoly acids.","By including the water retention additive in the electrode casting solution, when the electrode is cast on the exchange membrane, the water retention additive will be dispersed in the electrode.","The electrodes will also have a catalyst either on one surface of the electrode or dispersed within the electrode. For embodiments where the catalyst is dispersed through the electrode, the catalyst may be added to the electrode casting solution. The types of catalysts are well-known in the art and include both supported and unsupported catalysts. Examples of catalysts include, but are not limited to, platinum on XC-72 from E-TEK Corp., platinum\/ruthenium black, platinum\/chromium alloys, and other suitable catalysts.","Having described the electrode casting solution for forming anodes and cathodes for a membrane electrode assembly in a fuel cell, the formation of the membrane electrode assembly will now be described.","With reference to , a membrane electrode assembly  may be prepared by forming the proton exchange membrane  by casting the sulfonated polymer on a suitable substrate. Using an appropriate electrode casting solution, the anode  and cathode  may be separately cast on opposing surfaces of the proton exchange membrane , thereby forming the membrane electrode assembly . The electrode casting solutions for the anode  and cathode  may also include the water retention additive  and an appropriate catalyst  for the anode and cathode, such that the water retention additive and catalyst are dispersed in the electrodes during casting on the proton exchange membrane. Alternatively, the electrode casting solution may be used to form decals of the sulfonated polymer which may be subsequently attached to opposing surfaces of the proton exchange membrane.","While the invention has been described in terms of its preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
