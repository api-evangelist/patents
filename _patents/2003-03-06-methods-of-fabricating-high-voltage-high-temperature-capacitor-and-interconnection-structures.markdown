No. 09\/878,442, filed Jun. 11, 2001, entitled \u201cHIGH VOLTAGE, HIGH TEMPERATURE CAPACITOR STRUCTURES AND METHODS OF FABRICATING SAME,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority from U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/141,795 entitled \u201cLAYERED DIELECTRIC ON SIC SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURES\u201d filed Aug. 28, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,246,076, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein as if set forth fully.","This invention was developed under Army Research Laboratories contract number DAAL01-98-C-0018 and Office of Naval Research contract numbers N00014-99-C-0172 and N00014-99-C-0173. The government may have certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to high power, high field, or high temperature capacitive structures and in particular relates to capacitors and inter-metal dielectrics.","For electronic devices, particularly power devices, silicon carbide offers a number of physical, chemical and electronic advantages. Physically, the material is very hard and has an extremely high melting point, giving it robust physical characteristics. Chemically, silicon carbide is highly resistant to chemical attack and thus offers chemical stability as well as thermal stability. Perhaps most importantly, however, silicon carbide has excellent electronic properties, including high breakdown field, a relatively wide band gap (about 3.0 eV and 3.2 eV at room temperature for the 6H and 4H polytypes respectively), high saturated electron drift velocity, giving it significant advantages with respect to high power operation, high temperature operation, radiation hardness, and absorption and emission of high energy photons in the blue, violet, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.","Accordingly, interest in silicon carbide devices has increased rapidly and power devices are one particular area of interest. As used herein, a \u201cpower\u201d device is one that is designed and intended for power switching and control or for handling high voltages and\/or large currents, or both. Although terms such as \u201chigh field\u201d and \u201chigh temperature\u201d are relative in nature and often used in somewhat arbitrary fashion, \u201chigh field\u201d devices are generally intended to operate in fields of 1 or more megavolts per centimeter, and \u201chigh temperature\u201d devices generally refer to those operable above the operating temperatures of silicon devices; e.g, at least about 200\u00b0 C. and preferably 250\u00b0-400\u00b0 C., or even higher. For power devices, the main concerns include the absolute values of power that the device can (or must) handle, and the limitations on the device's operation that are imposed by the characteristics and reliability of the materials used.","Silicon carbide-based insulated gate devices, particularly oxide-gated devices such as MOSFETs, must, of course, include an insulating material in order to operate as IGFETs. Similarly, MIS capacitors require insulators. By incorporating the insulating material, however, some of the physical and operating characteristics of the device become limited by the characteristics of the insulator rather than by those of silicon carbide. In particular, in silicon carbide MOSFETs and related devices, silicon dioxide (SiO) provides an excellent insulator with a wide band gap and a favorable interface between the oxide and the silicon carbide semiconductor material. Thus, silicon dioxide is favored as the insulating material in a silicon carbide IGFET. Nevertheless, at high temperatures or high fields or both, at which the silicon carbide could otherwise operate satisfactorily, the silicon dioxide tends to electrically break down; i.e., to develop defects, including traps that can create a current path from the gate metal to the silicon carbide. Stated differently, silicon dioxide becomes unreliable under the application of high electric fields or high temperatures (250\u00b0-400\u00b0 C.) that are applied for relatively long time periods; i.e., years and years. It will be understood, of course, that a reliable semiconductor device should have a statistical probability of operating successfully for tens of thousands of hours.","Additionally, those familiar with the characteristics of semiconductors and the operation of semiconductor devices will recognize that passivation also represents a challenge for structures other than insulated gates. For example, junctions in devices such as mesa and planar diodes (or the Schottky contact in a metal-semiconductor FET) produce high fields that are typically passivated by an oxide layer, even if otherwise non-gated. Such an oxide layer can suffer all of the disadvantages noted above under high field or high temperature operation.","Accordingly, IGFET devices formed in silicon carbide using silicon dioxide as the insulator tend to fall short of the theoretical capacity of the silicon carbide because of the leakage and the potential electrical breakdown of the silicon dioxide portions of the device.","Although other candidate materials are available for the insulator portion of silicon carbide IGFETs, they tend to have their own disadvantages. For example, high dielectrics such as barium strontium titanate or titanium dioxide have dielectric constants that drop dramatically when a field is applied. Other materials have poor quality crystal interfaces with silicon carbide and thus create as many problems (e.g., traps and leakage current) as might solved by their high dielectric constant. Others such as tantalum pentoxide (TaO) and titanium dioxide (TiO) tend to exhibit an undesired amount of leakage current at higher temperatures. Thus, simply substituting other dielectrics for silicon dioxide presents an entirely new range of problems and disadvantages in their own right.","Recent attempts to address the problem have included the techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,905 to Harris, \u201cSemiconductor Device Having a Passivation Layer.\u201d Harris '905 appears to be somewhat predictive, however, and fails to report any device results based on the disclosed structures.","Similarly, Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) capacitors on wide bandgap Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) may be subject to high voltages at elevated temperatures. Accordingly, such capacitors typically are desired to have a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 10for a stress condition of, for example, as high as 200 volts at temperatures of up to about 300\u00b0 C. Unfortunately, these extreme fields and temperatures may cause a conventional silicon nitride MIM capacitor to suffer from excessive leakage current and\/or poor reliability (e.g. MTTF of about 200 hours).","Therefore, the need exists for a dielectric composition or structure that can reliably withstand high electric fields while minimizing or eliminating current leakage, and while operating at high temperatures.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a capacitor having a dielectric structure having a first oxide layer having a first thickness, a layer of dielectric material on the first oxide layer and having a second thickness, the layer of dielectric material having a dielectric constant higher than the dielectric constant of the first oxide layer and a second oxide layer on the layer of dielectric material opposite the first oxide layer and having a third thickness. The first thickness is between about 0.5 and about 33 percent and the third thickness is between about 0.5 and about 33 percent of the sum of the first, second and third thicknesses.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the capacitor further has a first metal layer on the first oxide layer opposite the high dielectric layer and a second metal layer on the second oxide layer opposite the high dielectric layer so as to provide a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the first oxide layer and the second oxide layer are silicon dioxide layers and the layer of dielectric material is a silicon nitride layer. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the first thickness and the third thickness are at least about one order of magnitude smaller than the second thickness. For example, the first thickness may be from about 10 to about 30 nm, the second thickness from about 200 to about 300 nm and the third thickness from about 10 to about 30 nm.","Additional embodiments of the present invention provide for capacitors characterized by having a mean time to failure versus voltage characteristic which has a greater slope than a corresponding MIM capacitor with only a nitride dielectric.

Capacitors according to still further embodiments of the present invention may be characterized by having a mean time failure of at least about 10hours at a voltage of up to about 100 volts and a temperature of up to about 100\u00b0 C.","In yet additional embodiments of the present invention, the silicon dioxide layers and the silicon nitride layer are deposited layers. Furthermore, the first and second metal layers comprise titanium, platinum, chromium and\/or gold.","In other embodiments of the present invention, a high mean time to failure interconnection structure for an integrated circuit includes a plurality of semiconductor devices in a substrate and an insulating layer on the plurality of semiconductor devices.

In such embodiments, the first oxide layer may have a thickness of from about 10 to about 30 nm, the layer of dielectric material may have a thickness of from about 200 to about 300 nm and the second oxide layer may have a thickness of from about 10 to about 30 nm.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the first oxide layer has a first thickness, the layer of dielectric material has a second thickness and the second oxide layer has a third thickness and wherein the first thickness and the third thickness are at least about one order of magnitude smaller than the second thickness.","Furthermore, the interconnection structure may be characterized by having a mean time to failure versus voltage characteristic which has a greater slope than a corresponding nitride inter-metal dielectric. Also, the silicon dioxide layers and the silicon nitride layer may be deposited layers. The interconnection structure may also be characterized by having a mean time to failure of at least about 10hours at a voltage of up to about 50 volts and a temperature of up to about 100\u00b0 C. or more preferably by having a mean time failure of at least about 10hours at a voltage of up to about 100 volts and a temperature of up to about 100\u00b0 C.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will filly convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. As illustrated in the Figures, the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures or the present invention. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present.","The present invention is a dielectric structure for wide bandgap semiconductor materials and related devices formed from such materials. A device structure according to embodiments of the present invention, in particular a basic MIS capacitor, is illustrated in FIG.  and is broadly designated at . The structure comprises a layer of silicon carbide  which can be a substrate portion or an epitaxial layer of silicon carbide. The manufacture of such single crystal silicon carbide substrates and the various epitaxial layers can be carried out according to various techniques described in U.S. patents that are commonly assigned (or licensed) with the present invention. These include but are not necessarily limited to Nos. Re. 34,861; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,912,063; 4,912,064; 4,946,547; 4,981,551; and 5,087,576, the contents of all of which are incorporated entirely herein by reference. The substrate or epitaxial layer can be selected from among the 3C, 4H, 6H, and 15R polytypes of silicon carbide with the 4H polytype being generally preferred for high power devices. In particular, the higher electron mobility of the 4H polytype makes it attractive for vertical-geometry devices. The device structure  next includes a layer of silicon dioxide  on the silicon carbide layer. Silicon dioxide has an extremely wide bandgap (about 9 eV at room temperature) and forms an excellent physical and electronic interface with silicon carbide. Thus, it is a preferred insulator for many purposes with the exception that, as noted in the Background, it can exhibit characteristic weaknesses at high temperatures under high fields.","Accordingly, the invention further includes a layer  of another insulating material on the silicon dioxide layer . The layer  is selected as having a dielectric constant (\u2208) higher than the dielectric constant of silicon dioxide, and also has physical and chemical characteristics that enable it to withstand the high temperature operation for which the silicon carbide portion of the device is intended. In preferred embodiments, the high dielectric material is selected from (but not limited to) the group consisting of silicon nitride, barium strontium titanate ((Ba,Sr)TiO), titanium dioxide (TiO), tantalum pentoxide (TaO), aluminum nitride (AlN), and oxidized aluminum nitride, with silicon nitride and oxidized aluminum nitride being particularly preferred, and with silicon nitride (SiN) being most preferred. The gate contact  is made to the insulating material layer  for permitting a bias to be applied to the device structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["15","16","17","20","21","22","20","21"]},"In preferred embodiments, the silicon dioxide layers  or  are thermally formed following which the insulating layers  or  are deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The insulating layers can, however, be formed by any appropriate technique, e.g., certain oxides can be formed by sputter-depositing a metal and then oxidizing it. As another example, SiNcan be deposited by plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD). Because the SiOlayer  or  serves to prevent tunneling, it does not need to be exceptionally thick. Instead, the SiOlayer is preferably maintained rather thin so that the extent of thermal oxidation can be limited. As recognized by those familiar with these materials, implantation can affect the manner in which SiC oxidizes. Thus, if extensive oxidation is carried out on a device or precursor having implanted SiC portions, the resulting oxidized portions will differ in thickness from one another, a characteristic that can be disadvantageous in certain circumstances. Accordingly, limiting the extent of oxidation helps minimize or eliminate such problems. Alternatively, the oxide can be deposited (e.g., by CVD) to avoid the problem altogether. Oxides may also be fabricated as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/834,283, entitled \u201cMETHOD OF NO ANNEALING AN OXIDE LAYER ON A SILICON CARBIDE LAYER\u201d, filed Apr. 12, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 09\/834,283 entitled \u201cMETHOD OF NO GROWTH OF AN OXIDE LAYER ON A SILICON CARBIDE LAYER\u201d, filed May 30, 2001, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein.","For example, a layer of oxide may be provided on a silicon carbide layer by oxidizing the silicon carbide layer in an NO environment at a temperature of at least about 1200\u00b0 C. A predetermined temperature profile and a predetermined flow rate profile of NO are provided during the oxidation. The predetermined temperature profile and\/or predetermined flow rate profile may be constant or variable and may include ramps to steady state conditions. The predetermined temperature profile and the predetermined flow rate profile may be selected so as to reduce interface states of the oxide\/silicon carbide interface with energies near the conduction band of SiC. The predetermined temperature profile may result in an oxidation temperature of greater than about 1200\u00b0 C. Preferably, the oxidation temperature is about 1300\u00b0 C. The duration of the oxidation may vary depending on the thickness of the oxide layer desired. Thus, oxidation may be carried out for from about 15 minutes to about 3 hours or longer.","Additionally, the predetermined flow rate profile may include one or more flow rates of from about 2 Standard Liters per Minute (SLM) to about 6 SLM. Preferably, the flow rates are from about 3.5 to about 4 Standard Liters per Minute. Furthermore, formation of the resulting oxide layer may be followed by annealing the oxide layer in Ar or N. Such an annealing operation in Ar or Nmay be carried out, for example, for about one hour.","The predetermined flow rate profile preferably provides a velocity or velocities of the NO of from about 0.37 cm\/s to about 1.11 cm\/s. In particular, the predetermined flow rate profile preferably provides a velocity or velocities of the NO of from about 0.65 cm\/s to about 0.74 cm\/s. Additionally, a wet reoxidation of the oxide layer may also be performed and\/or the NO oxidation may be carried out in an environment with a fraction or partial pressure of steam.","Additionally, a layer of oxide may be formed on a silicon carbide layer by forming the oxide layer on the silicon carbide layer in an NO environment at a predetermined temperature profile which includes an oxidation temperature of greater than about 1200\u00b0 C. and at a predetermined flow rate profile for the NO. The predetermined flow rate profile may be selected to provide an initial residence time of the NO of at least 11 seconds. Preferably, the initial residence time is from about 11 seconds to about 33 seconds. More preferably, the initial residence time is from about 19 seconds to about 22 seconds. Additionally, a total residence time of the NO may be from about 28 seconds to about 84 seconds. Preferably, the total residence time is from about 48 seconds to about 56 seconds.","In preferred embodiments, the first silicon dioxide layer  or  is no more than about 100 angstroms thick while the layer of insulating material ( or ) can be about 500 angstroms thick. Stated differently, each of the oxide layers represents between about 0.5 and 33 percent of the total thickness of the passivation structure, with the insulating material making up the remainder. In preferred embodiments, the oxide layers are each about 20 percent of the total thickness and the preferred nitride insulator is about 60 percent of the total thickness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["24","25","25","26","27","30","26","31","32","33","34","25","35","36","33","34","24","37","37","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["40","41","42","43","40","44","43","45","45","46","41","45","41","40","47","47"]},"Those familiar with semiconductor devices will understand that the illustrations of  and  are exemplary, rather than limiting, in their representations of various insulated gate and metal-insulator-semiconductor structures.

The silicon dioxide continues to provide a large electrical barrier (i.e., its 9 eV bandgap) on silicon carbide and prevents the layered dielectric from leaking current. In complementary fashion, the additional dielectric material (with its higher dielectric constant) improves the high temperature and high field reliability as compared to a single dielectric layer.

Second, the SiOportion of the insulator structure has a high quality interface with silicon carbide.","Third, the multilayer structure minimizes leakage currents at high temperatures (250-400\u00b0 C.).

Only the structures that included silicon dioxide insulated well on silicon carbide at 250\u00b0 C. This is most likely related to the bandgap of the dielectric material and the resulting low band offsets (barrier heights) with silicon carbide. Silicon carbide has a bandgap of about. 3 eV and for a material to insulate, a barrier height of at least about 2 eV is desired. Thus, on silicon carbide, the dielectric material or structure should have a bandgap of at least about 7 eV. Standing alone, silicon nitride, with a bandgap of 6 eV was thus expected to\u2014and did\u2014demonstrate problems, as shown by the leakage current measurements reported in Table 2. The bandgap of aluminum nitride (6.2 eV) is not very different than that of silicon nitride, and aluminum nitride has substantially higher leakage currents. The leakage currents demonstrated by the aluminum nitride and the silicon nitride prevent these materials from being useful as sole gate dielectrics. Additionally, further analysis of these insulators was limited to evaluating the net oxide charge.","Although a dielectric must have high reliability for high temperature high field device passivation applications, such reliability represents a necessary, but not a sufficient characteristic, to make it applicable for the gate layer of a MIS device.

Any difference between the actual voltage at which flatband capacitance occurs and the ideal value, accounting for metal-semiconductor work functions, is attributed to this fixed oxide charge. For wide bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide, however, the term \u201cfixed\u201d oxide charge is a misnomer. This calculated charge density includes contributions from interface states, many of which appear fixed at room temperature. For this reason, this calculated charge density is referred to herein as a \u201cnet\u201d oxide charge.","Electrically active defects at the dielectric-semiconductor interface are termed interface states. These states can severely degrade the channel mobility of an MIS devices by either trapping and releasing the electrons, or by providing a charged site which would apply a force normal to the current flow.

Thermal oxides grown on implanted areas also tend to be weaker than those grown on non-implanted material.

A cross section of an exemplary device  is shown in FIG. . The top p-layer  was implanted with variable doses. A second implant, the Junction Termination Extension (JTE) , was performed adjacent to the first implant to reduce field crowding. Although the JTE implant helps reduce the field crowding at the edge of the device, a high quality dielectric  on the surface of the wafer is required for passivation. The shape of the planar diode was circular. The dielectric  is formed of the oxide\/nitride\/oxide according to the present invention. Specifically, all three layers were deposited by PECVD.","The fabrication was repeated for comparison purposes with PECVD SiNand PECVD SiOas single layer insulators.","The mask set used for this device consisted of diodes with radii varying from 100 to 500 \u03bcm, while the width of the JTE implant varied between 50 and 150 \u03bcm. The epitaxial layers should support 5 kV, but the JTE of these devices were designed to block only 3 kV in order to place more stress on the passivation. The device performance is more sensitive to the passivation, because the JTE implants do not terminate all of the fields generated by the higher voltage.

The anode junction was defined by etching through the top p-type layer in most of the surface, while leaving circular p-type anode regions exposed. Using a thick (1.4 \u03bcm) oxide mask, the regions receiving the low-dose JTE implant were defined. The thickness of the oxide mask and the implantation energy and dosage of the p-type dopant (aluminum) were chosen so that only the intended termination region receives the implant while it is blocked entirely from regions where it is not intended. The junction region also received this implantation step so that a high surface doping of the p-type layer was formed for ohmic anode contacts. The implanted aluminum was annealed to minimize the damage from ion implantation and to electrically activate the implants.","The breakdown voltage was measured on each type of diode. The silicon nitride had a great deal of leakage, and broke down at 2.6 kV. The oxide devices had low\/no leakage and broke down around 3.5 kV.
