title: Television system to extract TV advertisement contact data and to store contact data in a TV remote control
abstract: A television advertisement system whereby a viewer retrieves advertisement teletext contact information of an advertisement that has been displayed on the viewer's television by using a wireless remote control device. The invention provides the means for a viewer to easily obtain adâ€² contact information, in-hand, which can then be used at will. Teletext data is associated with an advertisement video signal, which is then decoded and stored in the television's or TV's set-top box's page memory. The viewer can retrieve, on demand, the advertisement's teletext data stored in the television's, or set-top box's page memory by using a wireless remote control. The advertisement data is transferred to and stored in the remote control's memory. The data is displayed on the remote's screen. The data stored in the remote control can be used to automatically contact an advertiser for further information, or to purchase an advertised product or service. This is achieved by wirelessly transferring pertinent contact information from the remote control to various communication devices, such as a computer, a telephone, a PDA, etc.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a system for receiving television advertisement associated textual data and for a viewer to obtain, on demand, the textual data in-hand using a television remote control device.","2. Description of Related Art","Whenever an advertisement (ad\u2032) appears on the television (TV) and the viewer is interested in following up on the displayed product, today he must either remember the product contact information, or scribble down the information on a piece of paper. Another option is to have a telephone within reach and to dial the phone number displayed in the advertisement.","The current invention uses a readily available feature of TV signals, namely the teletext standard to transmit advertisement data to a television viewer. The viewer then uses his remote control to selectively acquire the displayed ad's data and thereby to have the advertisement related data at hand for use.","Generally, in the USA, teletext is not greatly used, as it is in Europe and other global regions. In the USA, closed captioning (CC) is commonly available on most TV sets and TV set-top boxes. Closed captioning is a specific use of teletext in the USA, i.e. as an aid to deaf TV viewers.","Goreta teaches in U.S. Pat. No. 5,973,747 a TV program management system to display and control TV programs. Goreta also teaches the display of program information on the TV screen as well as on a remote control device. Goreta does not teach the retrieval, display and interaction of a viewer with TV advertisements as the present invention teaches, but is focused on television viewing program management.","Darbee et al. teaches in U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,450 a remote control unit that displays television advertisements. Darbee et al. teaches that the remote control is in effect an extension of the television viewing space to capture a viewer's attention with advertisements. This is taught by the use of the remote control whilst it is not being used by the viewer, i.e. ad's are broadcast to the remote without a viewer's request or interaction. It is also taught that time based display of advertisements is offered on the remote control's display, i.e. similar as to how advertisement space is sold on televisions.","The present invention's primary objective is a system whereby a television viewer retrieves advertisement contact information of an advertisement that is, or has been displayed on the viewer's television by using a wireless remote control device. One of the key premises to advertising is for the advertised product or service to be purchased. The invention provides the means for a viewer to easily obtain ad\u2032 contact information, in-hand, which can then be used at will.","The present invention teaches the use of teletext data associated with an advertisement video signal, which is then decoded and stored in the television's or TV's set-top box's page memory.","The viewer can retrieve, on demand only, the advertisement's teletext data stored in the television's, or set-top box's page memory by using a wireless remote control. The advertisement data is transferred to and stored in the remote control's memory. The data is displayed on the remote's screen. No advertisement data is transmitted to the remote control without the viewer's explicit interaction.","The viewer can retrieve, display and delete any advertisement data stored in the remote control's memory, at any time, even if the TV is switched off.","The data stored in the remote control can be used to automatically contact an advertiser for further information, or to purchase an advertised product or service. This is achieved by wirelessly transferring pertinent contact information from the remote control to various communication devices, such as a computer, a telephone, a PDA, etc.","The preferred embodiment's description is detailed in the following sections:\n\n","We now consider each of these sections in further detail.","1. Overview of Teletext","The preferred embodiment of the invention uses a common feature of today's television systems, i.e. teletext. Teletext is a technology used to deliver data within an analog video signal by using the vertical blanking interval (VBI) between lines of active video. The VBI is a generally unused space located between the vertical synch pulse and the actual active video picture. Because of the limited number of available lines in the VBI, the actual amount of data that can be transmitted is limited to about 17.76 Kbits\/sec times the number of transmitted lines. The data represents pages of information to be displayed on a television screen.","Various teletext formats are available including the World System Teletext, (WST), the North American Broadcast Teletext Specification (NABTS) and others.","The teletext standards used by broadcasters all over the globe are defined in the International Telecommunication Union's ITU-R BT.653-2 document. The European teletext is defined as \u201cteletext system B\u201d for 625\/50 Hz TV systems. NABTS teletext is defined as \u201cteletext system C\u201d for 525\/60 Hz TV systems. WST for PAL is defined as \u201cteletext system D\u201d for 625\/50 Hz TV systems and WST for NTSC is defined as \u201cteletext system D\u201d for 525\/60 Hz TV systems.","Semiconductor manufacturers provide video encoders and decoders that encode and decode multiple teletext standards. For example, Intersil\u2122's HMP8117 decoder handles closed captioning, NABTS, WTS and BT.653 System B, C and D teletext. Cirrus Logic\u2122's encoders CS4954 and CS 4955 support closed captioning in NTSC and teletext for NTSC and PAL.","Most modern television sets have built-in teletext decoders. For example Sharp\u2122 Corporation's 19R-M100 and Panasonic\u2122's CT-36SL13 TVs support closed captioning decoding and display. Hitachi\u2122's C50F550 TV system supports teletext decoding and display.","The insertion, i.e. encoding of teletext information into video signals is commonly available and is covered by many patents and available products, e.g. MRG Systems\u2122 DTP800 Digital Databridge and CT700 Teletext Scheduler and Optimum Technology\u2122's OPT-III Teletext Encoder.","Today TV broadcasting is graduating into the digital world, a technology without VBI. Analog teletext does not exist in digital television (DTV). Digital teletext is evolving with the evolution of DTV. The current standard for digital teletext is the Multimedia Hypermedia Experts Group open standard called MHEG-5, which is described in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO\u2122) document ISO\/IEC 13522-5. In DTV, graphics data can be incorporated, together with text data into digital teletext, which can then be decoded and displayed. So for example, a company's graphic logo could be embedded in digital teletext.","The important thing to note is that the current invention does not exclude digital television broadcasting, but uses analog television broadcasting in its preferred embodiment. To those knowledgeable in the art, it is obvious that teletext embedded in a digital video signal can be decoded at the viewer's end of the transmission. A number of broadcasters, i.e. the BBC\u2122 and BSkyB\u2122 have such digital systems on trial today.","2. Advertisement Teletext Format","In the invention's preferred embodiment, the teletext associated advertisement data stream consists of a number of paired data fields, i.e. an identifier tag field and an associated attribute field.","Each advertisement teletext stream is prefixed with a tag <AD> to distinguish it from other teletext information, such as closed captioning. At the end of the advertisement teletext transmission is a termination tag <\/D>. These two tags enable the Microcontroller  to process the advertisement teletext information more easily. Furthermore, the stream of data between these two tags represent one page of advertisement teletext data.","The format of the teletext advertisement (i.e., the ad's teletext page) is as follows, and is transmitted left to right, top to bottom:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<AD><N> product name <$> product cost <S> shipping cost"},{"entry":"<#> phone-number <W> web addr. <M> mail addr. <P> payment <\/D>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Table 1 further describes the advertisement teletext transmission format. Note that the format of these tags can be other descriptors besides those used in the preferred embodiment of the invention. For example, the product's nametag could be {NAME}, or [PROD], etc. Furthermore the present invention does not exclude the use of other fields, for example expiration date\/time for the ad's offer (tag <E>), or email address (tag <@>), etc.","Not all advertisements have data for all of the fields. In this case, it can be handled in one of two ways:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<AD><N>product name<$><S><#><W>web addr.<M><P><\/D>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":"(b) The second option is such that unused fields are not transmitted.

A video signal is received by the set-top box  with embedded teletext that is associated with an advertisement to be displayed, or is being displayed on the TV . The remote control  has a display screen, a wireless transceiver to communicate with other wireless devices, data memory, control circuitry (e.g. a microprocessor), and keyboard keys to interact with the TV viewer.","3.1 Set-top Box","The set-top box  comprises the following components as illustrated in :\n\n","The preferred embodiment of the invention implements this wireless circuit as an infrared (IR) circuit. IR devices are commonly used in remote control units, as well as other handheld devices, such as PDAs. Any other commercially available wireless transmitter technology could as easily be used in the invention, e.g. short-range Radio Frequency (RF) products such as Ericsson\u2122's Bluetooth\u2122 enabled transceivers.\n\n","Note that all of the functionality of the set-top box , as previously mentioned could as easily be implemented in the TV . The preferred embodiment of the invention does not exclude this implementation in a TV .","3.2 Remote Control Unit","The Remote Control unit  comprises the following components as illustrated in :\n\n","With reference to  and , a viewer uses a remote control  to interact with the set-top box  in order to obtain the associated page of ad\u2032 information for later, or immediate use. The ad\u2032 page of information is retrieved from TVInfo Memory , transmitted from the set-top box  to the remote control , stored in the remote control's memory NVRAM and displayed on the remote control's screen .","The viewer can review the ad\u2032 information page that he has retrieved and stored on his remote control . The viewer can then contact the product  distributor and inquire further, or purchase the product or service. Purchasing can be made via:\n\n","Universal Electronics\u2122 has software called Nevo\u2122 that runs on personal digital assistants (PDAs) such as the HP\u2122 iPAQ\u2122 Pocket PC H3950 and H5400. Nevo software enables the PDA to be used as a remote control . The Sony\u2122 Cli\u00e9\u2122 PEG-NR70v PDA comes with software called Remote Commander\u2122 that enables the PDA to be used as a remote control . It is well known in the art that PDAs can be used to connect  to the PSTN  and to connect  to the Internet  via a fax\/modem card.","Note that the various remote control  keys could be implemented, with relative ease as touch-screen options on the remote control's screen . Various manufacturers of remote control units have touch-screen circuitry. For example, the Philips\u2122 TSU ProntoNEO\u2122 Intelligent A\/V remote control has a touch screen display. The preferred embodiment of the invention uses keys as described above, but does not exclude the use of such a touch-screen system.","4. Receiving and Storing Advertisements","The patent is focused specifically on the retrieval, in-hand, of advertisement information by a television viewer, which the viewer is interested in. With reference to ,  and , we now consider this aspect of the invention.","A television  is connected to a TV set-top box  and a remote control unit  is used to control the TV viewing functions.","Embedded in the invention's set-top box  are electronic circuits that retrieve pages of teletext information that have been attached to the video signal.  depicts a preferred embodiment of the set-top box . The preferred embodiment of the invention has used a set-top box , but as mentioned previously these circuits can be embedded directly into a TV set . One of the reasons for using a set-top box  is because it is relatively easy to either add a new or upgraded set-top box , or replace a current set-top box  in order to use the current invention with old TV sets.","An originating broadcaster , via cable television, satellite television or broadcast television, transmits the video signal. The video signal has been embedded with advertisement teletext at an originating point before being transmitted. It is important to note that the ad\u2032 teletext is only embedded in the originating video signal when an ad\u2032 video is broadcast. In other words, in the preferred embodiment, ad's page of teletext is directly associated with an advertisement video signal. This is important, because the goal of the present invention is for a viewer to capture data associated with a specific ad\u2032 that he is viewing, or has been displayed on the TV  and is interested in. Otherwise, it would be like viewing junk mail, with a person having to wade through unwanted mail to retrieve something of interest.","When the receiver, i.e. the set-top box  or the TV  with embedded decoder circuits, receives a video signal via the UHF\/VHF Tuner and IF circuit , the video signal is passed onto the Teletext Decoder . The Teletext Decoder  and Microcontroller  are generally part of the same commercially available integrated circuit. For example, Philips\u2122 Semiconductors has an intelligent teletext decoder, the SAA5264 and the SAA5265 that incorporate Intel\u2122's 80C51 microcontroller.  has separated these two circuits for illustrative purposes only.","The Teletext Decoder  extracts the page of ad\u2032 teletext data from the video signal and stores it in Page Memory . Whenever new page of ad\u2032 data is stored in Page Memory , the Microcontroller  moves the page of data into separate memory, the TVInfo Memory . Commercially available teletext decoders generally have limited memory to store teletext in. For example, the SAA5264 can only store a single page of teletext and the SAA5265 can store ten pages of teletext. Using separate storage memory, i.e. TVInfo Memory , enables the invention to store more advertisements for later recall by the viewer (via the Recall-TVInfo  key.). TVInfo Memory  is implemented as Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM) in order to retain ad\u2032 data even if the set-top box  (or TV  depending on the implementation of the teletext decoder) has been powered down.","It is feasible to store the ad\u2032 data in Page Memory  rather than separate TVInfo Memory , but the preferred embodiment of the invention uses separate memory.","The preferred embodiment of the invention stores pages of ad\u2032 data in the TVInfo Memory  as it is received in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO). When the memory  is full, the microcontroller , overwrites the first received and stored page of ad\u2032 data with the newly received data page. This feature enables the viewer to browse any advertisements that have been received and stored in the TVInfo Memory . The invention does not preclude other data storage techniques such FILO, indexed, etc. from being used.","Once the associated ad\u2032 data is stored in the TVInfo Memory , it is available for the viewer to download into his remote control unit .","5. Downloading an Advertisement to the Remote Control","With reference to  and , we now consider how the invention enables the viewer to retrieve two types of advertisements stored in TVInfo Memory :\n\n","(5.a) In the first case, i.e. real-time ad\u2032 display, the ad\u2032 being displayed on the TV  screen has associated teletext data stored in memory  on the set-top box . In this case, the viewer is watching the ad\u2032 on TV  and wishes to capture the associated page of ad\u2032 information for use. The viewer uses his remote control  to send a request to the set-top box  via a wireless interface  on his remote control. This is done by selecting the Get-TVInfo  key located on his remote control . The set-top box  has a wireless receiver Rx  that captures the viewer's remote control request and passes this request to the microcontroller  to process. The Microcontroller  then retrieves the ad's data page from memory  and transmits it to the viewer's remote control  via the wireless transmitter Tx . Once the remote control  receives the ad's page of data, it displays it on the remote control's screen  and stores the data page in the remote's NVRAM.","(5.b) In the second case, i.e. the viewer is interested in a previously displayed TV ad\u2032; he selects the Recall-TVInfo  key on the remote control . The remote control  sends the recall request to the set-top box  via a wireless interface  on his remote control. The set-top box  has a wireless receiver Rx  that captures the viewer's remote control request and passes this request to the microcontroller  to process. The microcontroller  then retrieves advertisements' data pages, that it stored FIFO in TVInfo Memory . This information is then displayed on the TV . The viewer browses the displayed ad\u2032 list by using the channel keys  on his remote control . If he locates an ad\u2032 page that he wishes to retain on his remote control , he simply selects the Get-TVInfo  key on the remote control , and it is transmitted  via the Tx  circuit by the Microcontroller  to the remote control . The remote control  displays the information on its screen  and stores the ad\u2032 data in its NVRAM.","6. Contacting Advertisers Using the Remote Control","With reference to  and , we now consider how the present invention helps the TV viewer to contact TV advertisers about a product , or service.","Once the viewer has stored an ad's data page about a Product(s)  in his remote control , the viewer can then contact the advertiser by:\n\n","Note that many TV advertised products do not have a distributor or Store  to contact, but are simply raising the awareness of the viewer to the products availability. Examples for this type of advertising include cosmetic products, detergent products, motor vehicles, multi-national corporations, etc. At best, these types of advertisements may have an associated web site.","Another feature that is not displayed in . is that the remote control  could have a wireless interface to a printer (e.g. the HP\u2122 Deskjet\u2122 995c Bluetooth\u2122 and IR enabled printer). This feature would allow the viewer to obtain a hardcopy of the advertised product information that he stored in the remote control . Another feature not displayed in . is the capability of transmitting the displayed page of information from the remote control  to a PDA. Wireless communication between PDAs is common technology in the art."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
