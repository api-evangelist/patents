No. 61\/391,569 filed Oct. 8, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/505,915 filed Jul. 8, 2011; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. EB011704 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The following is a glossary of abbreviations used herein:\n\n","The term \u201cbubble\u201d as used herein refers to a bubble of gas encased or surrounded by an enclosing substance. Bubbles that are from one micrometer to several tens or hundreds of micrometers in size are commonly referred to as \u201cmicrobubbles\u201d, while bubbles that are smaller than one micrometer in size are commonly referred to as \u201cnanobubbles.\u201d The term \u201cdroplet\u201d as used herein refers to an amount of liquid that is encased or surrounded by a different, enclosing substance. Droplets that are less than one micrometer in size are commonly referred to as \u201cnanodroplets\u201d and those that are in the one micrometer to tens or hundreds of micrometers in size are commonly referred to as \u201cmicrodroplets.\u201d If a droplet is encased in another liquid, the droplet and its casing may also be referred to as an \u201cemulsion\u201d. The term \u201cparticle\u201d as used herein refers to either a droplet or a bubble of any size.","Microbubbles for diagnostic ultrasound imaging have been established in the clinical arena as a sensitive and inexpensive imaging technique for interrogating landmarks in the vasculature. Currently, microbubble-enhanced diagnostic ultrasound has been approved by the FDA for the study of wall motion abnormalities and ventricular contraction in echocardiography. Researchers have proposed microbubble-aided ultrasound for a wide range of potential applications, including functional tumor, kidney, and liver imaging, identification of vascular inflammation, identification of vulnerable plaque deposition, thrombus detection and targeted molecular imaging of angiogenesis. Microbubbles have been used for therapeutic interventions, primarily in concert with ultrasound-mediated cavitation for sonothrombolysis.","Despite their utility as vascular contrast agents and potential for therapeutic applications, microbubble size (typically 1-5 microns in diameter) prevents their transport outside of the vasculature, a process commonly referred to as extravasation. In other words, microbubbles are trapped within the circulatory system. In order to extravasate into the interstitial space in a solid tumor, the bubble would need to be smaller than a micron, i.e., a nanoparticle is required. The exact size limit for nanoparticle extravasation into the interstitial space in solid tumors depends on a variety of factors, but usually falls within the range of 100 nm-750 nm.","Nanoparticles make poor ultrasound contrast agents, however. Nanobubbles small enough to diffuse past inter-endothelial gap junctions scatter ultrasound energy poorly compared to microbubbles and thus provide limited imaging contrast. Additionally, bubble circulation in vivo is shown to be on the order of tens of minutes before bubble dissolution, and clearance significantly limits contrast enhancement. This short time period may be insufficient for enough bubbles to accumulate by diffusion into the tumor interstitium. Droplets of any size provide poor contrast for ultrasound imaging as compared to equivalently sized bubbles, and nanodroplets small enough to extravasate into the interstitial space in solid tumors, provide poorer contrast still.","One approach to solve the problem of providing ultrasound contrast agents that are both small enough to extravasate and large enough to provide sufficient ultrasound contrast has been to produce a droplet that is small enough to extravasate but which can be caused to expand into a bubble, a processed referred to as \u201cactivation\u201d. Such particles are commonly referred to as \u201cphase change agents\u201d. One method of activation is known as acoustic droplet vaporization, or ADV. In ADV, the droplet is subjected to ultrasonic energy, which causes the liquid within the droplet to change phase and become a gas. This causes the droplet to become a bubble, with the corresponding increase in size. The ultrasound impoulses impart a mechanical pressure upon the tissues, and the amount of pressure applied is indicated in terms of a mechanical index, or MI.","Particles that start as droplets but can be activated to become bubbles are referred to as \u201cmetastable\u201d, because they are stable as droplets (e.g., they don't spontaneously expand into bubbles) without additional energy. If these PCAs are used as contrast agents, they are commonly referred to as \u201cphase-change contrast agents\u201d (PCCAs).","Recently there has been interest in the use of PFC droplets for this purpose. To date, PCAs have been developed using PFCs which have boiling points above room temperature (25\u00b0 C.), which are herein referred to as \u201clow volatility PFCs\u201d. Examples include dodeafluoropentane (DDFP), perfluorohexane (PFH), and perfluoroheptane. These low volatility PRCs have been used to make PCAs that have a diameter greater than 1 micron, i.e., microdroplets or microbubbles. PFCs with boiling points above room temperature, which are herein referred to as \u201chigh volatility\u201d or \u201chighly volatile\u201d PFCs, have not been used to make microparticles out of a concern that, if subjected to body temperature (37\u00b0 C.), a droplet containing a highly volatile PFC might spontaneously change phase.","However, the low-volatility PFCs conventionally used to make micro-PCAs are not suitable for making nano-PCAs. Many in vitro studies have shown that the energy required to activate a PFC-based PCA increases as the diameter of the initial droplet decreases. There is a direct correlation between activation energy and mechanical index, and applications involving relatively low frequencies and\/or sub-micron droplets may require pressures higher than diagnostic ultrasound machines currently provide. This is an obstacle to human treatment, because excessive ultrasonic activation energy can cause tissue damage or other unwanted bioeffects.","Thus, PFCs that had been used in microbubbles may be unsuitable for use in a nanodroplet due to the excessive activation energy required. The smaller the nanodroplet, the more activation energy is required, and the less suitable the PFC. For example, the Antoine vapor pressure equation was analyzed in order to assess the theoretical vaporization temperature dependence upon droplet diameter of selected PFCs as a result of the influence of interfacial surface tension. Using this model to investigate the influence of PFC boiling points, it was concluded that DDFP, PFH, and perfluoroheptane may require a relatively large amount of energy in order to elicit droplet vaporization at a size that would practically be able to extravasate through endothelial gap junctions and into the extravascular space.","Therefore, there exists a need for a phase-change agent that is stable at physiological temperatures yet is more susceptible to ultrasound pressures. Such a particle could provide a more efficacious vehicle for extravasation into tissue and activation at the site of action in many applications. For human therapeutic and diagnostic use, there is a need for a stable nanoparticle capable of being vaporized using frequencies and mechanical indices within the FDA-approved limits of commercial clinical diagnostic ultrasound machines.","The subject matter described herein includes formulation methods and applications for particles that can be activated by acoustic energy to convert from a liquid state to a gas state. In one embodiment, nanoparticles suitable for use in human diagnostics, imaging, therapeutics, and treatment are presented. The methods described herein produce stabilized nano- and micro-particles, in liquid or emulsion form, of compounds that are normally gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Two distinct methods are disclosed: the first is called the \u201cdroplet extrusion\u201d method and the second is called the \u201cbubble condensation\u201d method.","In one embodiment, the droplet extrusion method includes causing the first substance to condense into a liquid and then extruding or emulsifying the first substance into or in the presence of a second substance to create droplets or emulsions in which the first substance is encapsulated by the second substance. To condense the first substance, it may be cooled to a temperature below the phase transition temperature of the component having the lowest boiling point, it may be compressed to a pressure above the phase transition pressure of the component having the highest phase transition pressure value, or a combination of the above. The contents of the droplet or emulsion so formed may be entirely or primarily in a liquid phase.","In one embodiment, the bubble condensation method includes extruding or emulsifying the first substance into or in the presence of the second substance to create bubbles having an outer shell of the second substance encapsulating an amount of the first substance, at least some of which is in gaseous form. The bubble thus formed is cooled and\/or compressed such that the contents of the bubble reach a temperature below the phase transition temperature of the component having the lowest boiling point at that pressure. This causes the gas within the bubble to condense to a liquid phase, which transforms the bubble into a droplet or emulsion. In this mariner, droplets or emulsions in which the first substance is encapsulated by the second substance are created.","The two methods described above produce particles containing in liquid form a substance that is normally a gas at room temperature and pressure, and stabilizing these particles in their liquid form using a shell such as a lipid, protein, polymer, gel, surfactant, or sugar. The surface tension of the shell enables these particles to be stable in liquid form, even when the surrounding temperature is raised back to room temperature. Acoustic energy can then \u201cactivate\u201d the particle, returning it to gas form.","In one embodiment, a method for delivery of particles to a target region includes introducing particles comprising stable, activatable nanodroplets, each nanodroplet comprising a liquid encapsulated in a shell, where the liquid comprises at least one component that is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, into a blood vessel in the vicinity of a target region. The particles then extravasate into the target region.","In one embodiment, a method for medical diagnostic imaging using activatable droplets as contrast agents includes producing encapsulated droplets, each encapsulated droplet containing a liquid encapsulated in a shell, where the liquid includes a liquid phase of a fluorocarbon, a perfluorocarbon, a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, a hydrocarbon, a gas having a boiling point that is below room temperature (25\u00b0 C.), or combinations thereof; introducing the encapsulated droplets into a tissue to be imaged; providing activation energy sufficient to cause the liquid within the encapsulated droplets to change from a liquid phase to a gas phase, causing the encapsulated droplets to increase in size and become bubbles of encapsulated gas; and performing ultrasonic imaging of the tissue using the bubbles as a contrast agent.","In one embodiment, a method for medical therapy using activatable droplets includes producing encapsulated droplets, each encapsulated droplet including a liquid encapsulated in a shell, where the liquid comprises a liquid phase of a fluorocarbon, a perfluorocarbon, a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, a hydrocarbon, a gas having a boiling point that is below room temperature (25\u00b0 C.), or combinations thereof; including a therapeutic agent in or on the shell; delivering the encapsulated droplets to a target region; and providing activation energy sufficient to cause the liquid within the encapsulated droplets to change from a liquid phase to a gas phase, causing the encapsulated droplets to increase in size and become bubbles of encapsulated gas, wherein the substance to be delivered to the target tissue enters into the cells of the target tissue.","In one embodiment, a method for medical therapy using activatable droplets includes producing encapsulated droplets, each encapsulated droplet including a liquid encapsulated in a shell, where the liquid includes a liquid phase of a fluorocarbon, a perfluorocarbon, a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, a hydrocarbon, a gas having a boiling point that is below room temperature (25\u00b0 C.), or combinations thereof; delivering the encapsulated droplets to a target tissue; and providing activation energy sufficient to cause the liquid within the encapsulated droplets to change from a liquid phase to a gas phase, causing the encapsulated droplets to increase in size and become bubbles of encapsulated gas, where the bubbles obstruct the flow of blood, oxygen, or nutrients to a target region.","In one embodiment, a method of size selection of particles including droplets or emulsions having at least one component that is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure encapsulated in liquid form inside a lipid, protein, or polymer capsule, includes exposing the particles to at least one of a pressure other than atmospheric pressure and a temperature other than room temperature, thereby causing some portion of the particle distribution to become activated, and separating the activated particles from the non-activated particles.","An ideal phase change agent for use where extravasation into interstitial regions of tissue is desired, such as an extravascular ultrasound contrast agent, for applications where thermal and cavitation-based bioeffects are minimized should be: 1) stable in the vasculature for a sufficient time period, 2) capable of extravasation out of the vascular space, and: 3) labile enough to be activated and interrogated by clinical ultrasound machines at clinically relevant acoustic intensities. The subject matter described herein includes methods to produce acoustically activatable nanoparticles that are formulated with high volatility PFCs yet remain stable at room temperature and pressure. The resulting droplets are acoustically activatable with substantially less energy than other favored compounds proposed for phase-change contrast agents. Also presented are uses of these nanoparticles in medical diagnostics, imaging, therapy, and treatment. In one embodiment, the activation energy of the nanoparticle may be tuned to a particular value, opening up the possibility of highly-targeted treatments.","To determine which PFCs had potential as a phase-change contrast agent at physiological temperatures and with pre-activation droplet size in the range desired for extravasation, it was necessary to estimate the energy that would be required to activate droplets containing the PFCs. The energy required depends on both the PFC contained within the droplet and the diameter of the droplet itself. To estimate this energy, calculations were performed using the Antoine vapor-pressure equation. This equation was derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation by Antoine in 1888, and when re-arranged for temperature is expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0058"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"T","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"B","mrow":{"mi":"A","mo":"-","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"log","mn":"10"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"P"}}},"mo":"-","mi":"C"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["Eq","#1"],"mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0059"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","P"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["P","inside"]},{"mi":["P","outside"]}],"mo":"-"},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03c3"},"mi":"r"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["Eq","#2"],"mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["inside ","outside "]},"Because the Laplace pressure is an inverse function of radius, smaller droplets will experience greater pressure.

Droplets containing DFB, OFP, or a combination have an activation energy that is low enough for use in human diagnostics, therapeutics, or treatment. For example, droplets containing DFP have the desired low vaporization threshold, even when prepared as sub-micron droplets. DFB's boiling point of \u22121.7\u00b0 C. is significantly lower than other PFCs commonly used in ADV, which allows vaporization at much lower pressures than similarly-sized emulsions of higher boiling-point PFCs. Lipid-encapsulated nanodroplets containing condensed OFP, which has a boiling point of \u221240\u00b0 C., are surprisingly stabile: exposing these nanodroplets to body temperature is not by itself enough to cause them to activate and expand into microbubbles; additional energy, such as may be provided by a medical ultrasound transceiver, is required. The resulting droplets are activatable with substantially less energy than other favored PCCA compounds. For example, when exposed in vitro to a 2 \u03bcs ultrasound pulse at 5 MHz and MI=1.2, the generated nanodroplets yield a distribution of microbubbles that corresponds well with expected expansion of the initial droplets through ideal gas law predictions with surface tension effects included.","The methods described in  can be used to produce stabilized, lipid-encapsulated nanodroplets of highly volatile compounds suitable for use as extravascular ultrasound contrast agents and activatable using ADV at diagnostic ultrasound frequencies and mechanical indices within FDA guidelines for diagnostic imaging. The methods described above have routinely yielded droplets in the 200\u02dc300 nm range, which, upon activation, become bubbles between 1 and 5 microns in size. In other words, the droplets are small enough to extravasate, and, once activated, the bubbles are large enough to provide sufficient contrast for ultrasound imaging. As will be described in more detail below, the particles thus created are suitable for use in diagnostics, therapeutics, and treatment other than ultrasound imaging, such as drug and gene delivery.","It is noted, however, that the methods and techniques described herein may be used to create stable nanodroplets containing highly volatile PFCs, even those that have activation energies above the limits defined for human medical use. The unexpected stability of OFP droplets in the sub-micron range indicate that other highly volatile PFCs may be used to create nanodroplets that may be used to interrogate materials other than biological tissues, for example, to which a higher activation energy may be applied, e.g., where there is no concern about bioeffects.","Detailed Preparation.","In one embodiment, lipid films were prepared with a lipid composition containing 85 mole percent DPPC, 10 mole percent LPC, and 5 mole percent DPPE-PEG 2000. The lipids were dissolved in less than 1 mL of chloroform and gently evaporated with nitrogen gas. The lipids were kept under a lyophilzer overnight in order to remove residual solvent and to create lipid films. The lipid films were rehydrated with approximately 1 mL of HEPES buffer (pH=7.4) and sonicated for 10 minutes in a water bath sonicator at 50-60\u00b0 C. The rehydrated films were subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles where the freezing section consisted of an isopropanol bath with dry ice and the thawing section was a 50-60\u00b0 C. water bath. This created a homogeneous lipid suspension, which was also stirred for 10 minutes at 50-60\u00b0 C. immediately afterwards. The resulting concentration of the lipid solution was about 20 mg\/mL.","For the method described in , a PFC, such as DFB, was condensed in a container over dry ice. The condensed DFB was poured into a 2 mL glass vial and crimped. Two hundred microliters (200 \u03bcl) of DFB was then mixed with the lipid solution and the samples were extruded in a \u221220\u00b0 C. cold room by 20 passes through a 1 \u03bcm porous membrane filter. After extrusion, the resulting emulsion was stored at 4\u00b0 C. in a crimped 2 mL vial. Samples were observed throughout the extrusion process to make sure they did not freeze.","For the method described in , microbubbles of a PFC, such as DFB, were formulated by the dissolution DPPC, DPPE-PEG-2000, and TAPS in a molar ratio of 65:5:30 (mole:mole:mole) and a total lipid concentration of 0.75 mg\/mL, 1.5 mg\/mL, and 3 mg\/mL. The excipient liquid was comprised of propylene glycol, glycerol, and normal saline. Microbubbles were formed via agitation by shaking for 45 seconds. The 2 mL vial containing the formed microbubbles was then immersed in a CO\/isopropanol bath controlled to a temperature of approximately \u22125\u00b0 C. A 25 G syringe needle containing 30 mL of room air was then inserted into the vial septum and the plunger depressed slowly. This step was repeated with another 30 mL of room air. Lipid freezing was avoided by observing the contents of the vial as well as the temperature of the CO\/isopropanol solution periodically. After pressurizing with a total of 60 mL of room air, the syringe needle was removed from the vial, leaving a pressure head on the solution.","Analysis of Results.","The vaporization threshold of individual droplets was determined, and the size of the bubble resulting from activation of the droplet was measured. The vaporization threshold was determined by observing what level of ultrasound pressure was required to cause droplets of various diameters to activate.

For example, droplets containing pure DFB, which has a boiling point of \u22121.7\u00b0 C., has a higher activation energy than droplets containing pure OFP, which has a boiling point of \u221237.6\u00b0 C.

By adjusting the mix of a relatively more volatile substance with a relatively less volatile substance, e.g., OFP and DFP, a droplet may be produced that has an activation energy that is somewhere in between the activation energies of the individual components of the mix. Thus, the energy required to vaporize a nanodroplet can be manipulated by simply mixing the gases to a desired ratio prior to condensation.","At both room and body temperature, DFB and OFP droplets were vaporized in vitro with waveforms similar to those found on clinical diagnostic ultrasound machines, and with pressures less than the current FDA limit at 8 MHz (approximately 5.4 MPa).

For example, tissue-specific targeting ligands may be incorporated into the shell of microbubbles produced and later condensed into nanodroplets according to the bubble condensation methods described above. In one embodiment, targeted DFB microbubbles were fabricated with DSPC, PEG, and PEG conjugated with a cyclic RGD peptide, which is known to target \u03b1\u03b2, a known angiogenic biomarker. Likewise, control microbubbles were fabricated with DSPC, PEG and PEG conjugated with a cyclic RAD peptide, which does not bind to \u03b1\u03b2. Targeted and non-targeted microbubbles were condensed into nanodroplets and incubated (15 minutes) independently with cover slips confluent with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which overexpress \u03b1\u03b2integrin. After incubation, each cover slip was washed with cell media to remove any non-targeted droplets. Next, each cover slip was placed on a custom built holder and submerged in a water tank full of phosphate buffered saline heated to 37\u00b0 C. for acoustic vaporization and testing. A linear array transducer was used to take 2D cross-sectional images across the cover slip as a baseline before vaporization. Then, the transducer was scanned at a constant speed of 2.5 mm\/s across the cover slip at a mechanical index of 1.9 in power Doppler mode to vaporize any adherent droplets. Finally, 2D acquisitions across the cover slip were obtained with the transducer in contrast mode to determine the degree of contrast (via microbubbles from droplet vaporization) for both control and targeted samples. The brightness of adherent microbubbles was assumed to be correlated with the degree of \u03b1\u03b2expression. Analysis of ultrasound images shows that incorporating targeting ligands (in this case, the cyclic RGD peptide) increased the number of droplets present on the cell layer (HUVECs) dramatically. After being exposed to pressures within the limit of what a clinical ultrasound machine can provide, any droplets adhering to the cell layer were vaporized into microbubbles, which show up brightly on the ultrasound scan. Comparing targeted droplets to non-targeted droplets shows that the contrast present after vaporization was significantly greater for targeted droplets than for non-targeted droplets, indicating that 1) the targeting ligand was successfully preserved in the nanodroplet shell and 2) the targeted nanodroplets preferentially adhered to the cell layer. These results suggest successful \u2018transformation\u2019 of targeted microbubbles into targeted nanodroplets, which could be valuable for applications such as early detection and diagnosis of angiogenesis.","Delivering a droplet to targeted cells or to cells in a targeted region may involve more than simply delivering the substance to the exterior of the cell or into the vicinity of the cell. In one embodiment, the droplets may be coated with a material that causes the cells to internalize the droplets, such as via endocytosis or phagocytosis. For example, coating a droplet with folate may cause a cell to internalize the droplet. Once inside the cell, activation of the droplet causes the droplet to expand to microbubble size. In one embodiment, the activated droplet kills the cell, either by the expansion alone, or by subsequent excitation of the microbubble within the cell. Alternatively, the activated droplet may not kill the cell but instead deliver the intended payload more efficiently within the cell, e.g., by increasing the surface area of a shell containing a therapeutic substance intended for the cell to receive and use. In this manner, any substance that may be delivered into the presence of the cell (e.g., a drug to be delivered to the target region, genetic material to be inserted into the cells of the target region, and others) may instead be delivered into the interior of the cell directly.","In one embodiment, the droplet may be coated with a material that targets specific parts of the cell once internalized.

This study is the first, to the knowledge of the authors, which has explored the use of lower boiling-point PFCs by means of using shell encapsulation to produce stable liquid droplets of PFCs which are normally gas at room and body temperature.
