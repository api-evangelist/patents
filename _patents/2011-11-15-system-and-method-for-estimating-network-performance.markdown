Many of these applications are configured to send and receive data. For instance, such applications can include video streaming, audio streaming, video chat, file transfer, and messaging applications. The perceived quality of applications streaming large amounts of data can be adversely affected when the network performance, e.g., throughput or network delay, is suboptimal.","For example, a video streaming application may request a lower quality video stream or a photo sharing application may send a lower resolution photo when the network performance is suboptimal. These applications however try to determine the current network performance based solely on the current session or by performing diagnostics. Thus, if the application has just started executing or if the application has not been executing for a sufficient duration, the application cannot efficiently adjust network operations to compensate for the network condition of the mobile device. Thus, there is a need for an efficient means to estimate network performance.","This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.","In various embodiments of the present disclosure, a system for estimating network performance of a mobile device is disclosed.

The description and specific examples in this summary are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.","Corresponding reference numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings.","Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","104","100","100","102","104","106","108","110","100"]},"Mobile device operating systems and applications aim to find the delicate balance between data quality and speed of service. In an ideal environment, mobile device  users would receive the highest resolution data instantaneously, i.e., ideal realized network performance. In practice, however, network performance is adversely affected by a number of factors. Thus, it is appreciated that a tool which allows a mobile device  to estimate network performance may be beneficial to the operation of the mobile device  and to other applications executing thereon. Network performance estimates may allow the operating system or application that is to perform a network application to tune the network operation based on the network performance estimate. For example, if a video streaming application is going to stream video from a content provider but the network performance estimates indicate that the throughput is less then optimal, the video streaming application can request a lower resolution stream from the content provider in order to improve the user experience. Similarly, if the network performance estimates indicate that the network performance is likely to be optimal or close to optimal, the video streaming application can request a high quality video stream.","Network performance can be measured in a number of metrics. For example, network performance of a performed network operation can be measured in terms of a realized throughput or a realized delay or latency (for purposes of explanation latency and delay will be collectively referred to as \u201cdelay\u201d). A network operation includes any operation performed by the mobile device over a communications network, such as transmitting data to and\/or receiving data from a web server. The realized throughput of a performed network operation can, for example, indicate the rate at which data is successfully delivered to or from the mobile device . The realized delay can include an amount of time for a packet to travel from the mobile device  to a node, e.g., the first web server , or vice-versa. The realized delay may also include a round-trip time for a data packet, that is\u2014the amount of time that a packet travels from the mobile device  to a node and back to the mobile device .","There are many factors that can contribute to a realized network performance. These factors include a condition of the network at the time of a performed network operation and the physical condition of the mobile device  at the time of the performed network operation. Examples of a network condition include a network type, a signal strength at an antenna of the mobile device , a network name, and the network provider. The network type is the type of network on which the network operation is being performed, e.g., WLAN, 3G, or 4G. The signal strength is a measure of the magnitude of the signal used to receive communications from a network during the network operation. In some embodiments, the signal strength can be represented by a percentage indicating the current magnitude of a signal in comparison to an optimal magnitude for the signal. The network name is a name that indentifies the network being used to perform the network operation. For example, the mobile device  may have the option of connecting to a plurality of WLANs, such that each WLAN has a different name associated thereto. The physical state of the mobile device  describes the physical condition of the mobile device at the time of the performed network operations. For instance, the physical condition of the mobile device  can include the geographic location of the mobile device , whether the mobile device is indoors or outdoors, whether the mobile device  is static or in motion, and if in motion, the speed and\/or direction of the mobile device . Additional information such as the time at the location of the mobile device and\/or day of the week when a network operation was performed may also be included in the physical condition of the mobile device .","Further, factors specific to the mobile device , such as an operating system type, a operating system version, and an antenna device driver and\/or firmware version may also impact the realized network performance. For purposes of explanation, these factors are collectively referred to as mobile device data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["100","100","202","204","206","208","210","212","100","200","200","100","106","108"]},"The network performance module  can log realized network performance data of performed network operations and estimate network performance for network operations that are to be performed. The network performance module  receives operational data collected by the mobile device  at a time of a performed network operation. The operational data may include network condition data indicative of the condition of a network at the time of a performed network operation, physical state data indicative of the physical condition of the mobile device  at the time of the performed network operation, and realized network performance data indicative of the realized network performance of the performed network operation. Examples of realized network performance can be a realized throughput of the performed network operation and a realized network delay of the performed network operation. The operational data can be obtained, for example, from the first sensor , the second sensor , the third sensor , the first communication module , or the second communication module . It is appreciated that the foregoing list is example in nature and the mobile device  can include additional components or alternative components and that the mobile device  can determine the operational data and the current condition data of the mobile device  in any suitable fashion. As will be described in greater detail below, the network performance module  logs the operational data, including the network performance data.","The network performance module  further receives requests for a network performance estimate from a requestor, e.g., the mobile device . The request for a network performance estimate can include current condition data indicating a current condition of the mobile device , including the current network condition and the current physical condition of the mobile device . The network performance module  uses the logged operation data of previous network operations to determine the estimate for an operation to be performed based on the current conditions of the mobile device .","The first sensor , second sensor , and third sensor  can be of any type of sensor sufficient to provide environmental data to the processor , including the physical state data. For instance, the first sensor  may be a photo sensor that monitors the intensity or type of lighting around the mobile device . The first sensor  can be used to gauge whether the mobile device  is indoors or outdoors based on the intensity or other characteristics of the observed light. The second sensor , for example, may be a global positioning system (GPS) sensor that provides location data to the processor . The third sensor  can be, for example, an accelerometer. The accelerometer provides motion data indicating the speed of a mobile device . It is appreciated that the third sensor  may further include or may be coupled to a directional sensor such as a compass that provides a direction of the mobile device , such that a velocity of the mobile device  can be provided to the processor . Additional sensors can also be integrated into the mobile device  in addition to the first sensor , second sensor , and third sensor . The types of sensors used provided in the above example are not intended to be limiting in any way.","The mobile device  can further include a first communication module  and a second communication module . The first communication module  is configured to communicate over a first network  and the second communication module  is configured to communicate over a second network . It is appreciated that the communication modules  and  may each include one or more antennas and a corresponding device driver and\/or firmware that in combination effectuate communication over the respective network. It is appreciated that the communication modules  and  can be configured to communicate over any suitable network type, now known or later developed.","In some embodiments, the first communication module  may be configured to communicate over a WLAN and the second communication module  may be configured to communicate over a cellular network, e.g., 3G, 4G, or later developed networks. It is further noted, that the mobile device  may further include additional communication modules (not shown) which can communicate over additional communications networks. For example, a mobile device  may have capabilities to communicate using WLAN, 3G cellular networks, and 4G cellular networks, each of which may require separate antennas.","The first communication module  and the second communication module  are configured to provide the network condition data and the realized network performance data to the processor . For instance, the first communication module  can provide the signal strength at the current time, the network type and\/or name that the mobile device  is connected to, and an identifier of the network provider. It is appreciated that depending on the type of network, some of the fields, such as network provider or network name may not be applicable. It is further appreciated that the communication modules  and  may provide additional types of network condition data. Furthermore, after a network operation is performed, the first communication module  or second communication module  may determine the realized throughput and\/or the realized of the performed network operation.","Referring to , in some embodiments the network performance module  is executed by the processor  of the mobile device . In these embodiments, the network performance module  is dedicated to the mobile device  and receives requests from the mobile device . Alternatively, referring to , in some embodiments the network performance module  is executed by the processor of a remote server (not shown), or \u201cfrom the cloud.\u201d In these embodiments, the network performance module  can be accessible by a plurality of mobile devices, including mobile device . Thus, the network performance module  can log and aggregate the operational data of a plurality mobile devices. When a mobile device  of the plurality of mobile devices requests a network performance estimate, the network performance module  can base the network performance estimate on the aggregated operational data of the plurality of mobile devices. It is further appreciated, that the network performance module  can be distributed between the mobile device  and a remote server, such that a first portion of the tasks performed by the network performance module  are performed at the mobile device and a second portion of the tasks are performed at the remote server.","In embodiments where the network performance module  is configured to log operational data from a plurality of mobile devices, the network performance module  can log additional types of data. For instance, the network performance module  can log mobile device data, i.e., data that corresponds to properties and\/or specifications of the mobile device  itself. Mobile device data can include the make and model of the mobile device , an operating system executing on the mobile device , the version number of the operating system, different hardware components of the mobile device  such as an antenna type, and current device drivers or firmware versions for components of the mobile device .","Mobile device data may also help mobile device manufacturers and users troubleshoot current configurations of the mobile device . For example, if a mobile device manufacturer observes that better network performances are observed for an earlier device driver for an antenna, the mobile device manufacturer can use this information to improve later versions of the device driver or to recommend downgrading device drivers to users.","Referring now to , an example embodiment of the network performance module  according to some embodiments of the present disclosure is depicted. In an example embodiment, the network performance module  includes a performance logging module , a performance analysis module , and a network performance database . The performance logging module  receives operational data from the mobile device  and logs the operational data in the network performance database . The performance analysis module  receives requests for a network performance estimate from the mobile device  and determines a network performance estimate based on current condition data indicated in the request and the contents of the network performance database .","As discussed above, the network performance module  can be used by the operating system and\/or by various applications to estimate network performance before performing a network operation. The operating system or an application will provide the network performance module  with a request for a network performance estimate. The request can be, for example, embodied as an instruction that is part of a network application programming interface (API). The request is received by the performance analysis module , which in turn determines and returns a network performance estimate to the requesting application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["200","304","400","402","404","100","400","402","400","400","404","400","404","200"]},"getThroughputAndDelay([IN] curr_conditions, [OUT] Throughput, [OUT] delay); where the current condition data is provided as input, and the estimated throughput and delay are returned as output. As will be discussed below, the throughput and delay can be provided as single values, e.g., median or mean values, or as distributions of values.","As mentioned, the performance logging module  receives operational data from one or more mobile devices  and logs the operational data in the network performance database .  illustrates an example method  that can be executed by the performance logging module  for logging operational data, including realized network performance data. As shown at step , the performance logging module  receives the operational data from the mobile device . The mobile device  can provide the operational data to the performance logging module , for example, upon performing a network operation. The mobile device  determines the network condition data at the time of the performed network operation, the physical state data at the time of the performed network operation data, and the realized network performance data corresponding to the performed network operation.","In determining the network condition data, the mobile device  can determine, for example, the signal strength at the time of the network operation, network type used to perform the network operation, and\/or the network name. In determining the physical state data, the mobile device  can determine, for example, whether the mobile device  was indoors or outdoors at the time of the operation, the speed of the mobile device  at the time of the operation, the geographic location of the device at the time of the operation, the time at which the network operation was performed, and\/or the day of the week on which the network operation was performed. In determining the realized network performance data, the mobile device  can determine, for example, the realized throughput and realized delay. The mobile device  then provides the operational data to the performance logging module . In some embodiments, the operational data may also identify a type of operation performed. As previously mentioned, in the embodiments where the performance logging module  receives operational data from a plurality of mobile devices, the received operational data may further include mobile device data indicative of information specific to the mobile device .","As was discussed, the network performance module  may be executed by the mobile device  or from a dedicated server, i.e., from the cloud. When receiving operational data from the mobile device , the performance logging module  may actually be receiving the operational data from the operating system of the mobile device  or an application executing on the mobile device . The term receiving data from the mobile device  is meant to include situations where the network performance module  is embodied on the mobile device  and\/or served from the cloud. Thus, the network performance module  may be implemented on the mobile device  and is still said to receive operational data from the mobile device .","Upon receiving the operational data of a particular performed network operation, the performance logging module  generates a performance log entry (step ) and stores the performance log entry in the network performance database  (step ).  illustrates an example performance log entry  according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. It should be appreciated that the performance log entry  can be any data structure sufficient for storage in the network performance database . The network performance database  is configured to store a plurality of performance log entries . A performance log entry  includes operational data corresponding to a performed network operation. An example performance log entry  can include a plurality of elements, including elements such as a signal strength element , a network type element , a motion element , an indoor\/outdoor flag , and a geographic location element . Further, an operation element  may indicate the type of network operation that was performed. As can be appreciated, the signal strength element  can indicate a signal strength value at the time of a corresponding network operation, typically measured as a percentage. The network type element  can indicate what type of network was used to perform the network operation. The motion element  can indicate whether the mobile device  was in motion at the time of the network operation, and if so, the speed of the mobile device  at the time of the network operation. The geographic location element  may include a longitude value and latitude value, such that the location of the mobile device  at the time of the network operation is logged. It is appreciated that other operational data may be represented in the performance log entry , such as the type of network operation that was performed, the time at which a network operation was performed, and a day on which the network operation was performed.","The performance log entry  further includes elements for one or more network performance metrics. For instance, the performance log entry  may include a realized throughput element  and a realized delay element . The realized throughput element  indicates the realized throughput for the performed network operation. The realized throughput can be represented by an amount of data per unit of time, such as megabytes per second. The realized delay element  indicates the realized delay for the performed network operation. The realized delay can be represented by an amount of time, such as milliseconds.","In some alternative embodiments, the network performance database  may be arranged into a plurality of \u201cbins.\u201d A bin can be thought of as a function of a specific combination of different operational data types and corresponding values. In these embodiments, a performance log entry may include the realized network performance data. The performance log entry for a performed network operation is stored in a particular bin based on the network condition data values corresponding to the performed network operation and the physical state condition values corresponding to the performed network operation. As can be appreciated, a subset of the operational data types is discretized. For instance, a network name, whether a device is indoors, and the network types are all discretized data types. Other data types are continuous, such as signal strength and the speed of the mobile device . The continuous operational data types are discretized into ranges. For example, signal strength can be divided into 10 ranges. For instance, the signal strength could be broken into the following ranges of a signal strength S:","0<S\u226610","10<S\u226620","20<S\u226630","30<S\u226640","40<S\u226650","50<S\u226660","60<S\u226670","70<S\u226680","80<S\u226690","90<S\u2266100.","It is appreciated that the forgoing ranges are examples and that any set of ranges can be used to express signal strength.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["306","702","704","706","702","702","1","702","1","702","2","702","2","704","706"]},"For purposes of explanation only, it is assumed that there are three types of operational data in the example of . In the example, the three types of operational data are (1) whether the mobile device  was indoors or outdoors at the time of the performed network operation, (2) whether the mobile device  was in motion at the time of the performed network operation, and (3) the signal strength of the mobile device  at the time of the performed network operation. Each bin of the N bins (in this example there would be 40 bins) corresponds to a particular combination of operational data values. The first bin  corresponds to performed network operations that were performed while the mobile device  was indoors, moving, and the signal strength was between 0% and 10%. The Jth bin  corresponds to performed network operations that were performed when the mobile device  was indoors, not moving, and the signal strength was between 11% and 20%. The Nth bin  corresponds to performed network operations that were performed while the mobile device  was outdoors, not moving, and the signal strength was between 91% and 100%. It is appreciated that the foregoing example is not intended to be limiting. Any number of operation data types may be used to implement the foregoing configuration of the network performance database .","Referring back to , the network performance log entries can be generated and stored in any other suitable manner. The method depicted in  can execute each time a network operation is performed, or can be done at predetermined intervals, such that batches of network performance log entries are stored at a single time. In either case, the performance logging module  generates a plurality of network performance log entries that are stored in the network performance database . Further, it is appreciated that variations of the method are contemplated and are within the scope of the disclosure.","Before a network operation is performed, the operating system or application that is to perform the network operation can request a network performance estimate from the network performance module . The request can indicate current conditions of the mobile device . The network performance module  responds with a network performance estimate that is based on the current conditions of the mobile device  and the performance log entries stored in the network performance database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","304","100","304"]},"Upon receiving the request, the performance analysis module  reads the current condition data of the mobile device  from the request (step ) and determines a network performance estimate based on the contents of the network performance database  and the current condition data received in the request (step ). The current condition data of the mobile device  can be obtained by the mobile device  from the first sensor , the second sensor , the third sensor , the first communication module , and\/or the second communication module . The current condition data is included in the request, such that the performance analysis module  uses the current condition data to determine the network performance estimate.","As discussed above, in some embodiments the network performance database  is arranged in bins corresponding to different combinations of operational data values. In these embodiments, the current condition data of the mobile device  received in the request is used to determine a bin corresponding to the current condition data. If more than one network performance log entry is stored in the bin corresponding to the current condition data, the performance analysis module  can determine a mean or median of the network performance data values stored in the bin. For instance, the performance analysis module  can provide the mean throughput and mean delay for the performance log entries stored in a particular bin. Furthermore, realized throughputs and\/or delays of more recently performed network operations may be weighted more greatly than older realized throughputs and\/or delays, such that a weighted average may be calculated. In some embodiments, the performance analysis module  may provide a distribution of throughput values and delay values.","In some embodiments, the performance analysis module  can execute a classification algorithm on the contents of the network performance database  and try to find a set of network performance log entries that are the most similar to the current condition data. For instance, the performance analysis module  can perform a \u201ck nearest-neighbor\u201d search on the network performance database . In these embodiments, the performance analysis module  will calculate distances from each of the network performance entries in the network performance database . The performance analysis module  then selects K network performance entries based on the calculated distances, where K is a predetermined value. Network performance estimates can be determined from the network performance data of the K network performance entries. For example, the network performance estimates may be a mean value or median value of the throughput and delay values of the K network performance entries. The performance analysis module  then returns the network performance estimates to the requesting entity.","It is appreciated that other suitable methods can be used to determine a network performance estimate and are within the scope of this disclosure. The method illustrated in  is example and not intended to be limiting.","A mobile device , and in particular the operating system or applications executing on the mobile device , can use network performance estimates for any suitable reason. For instance, a video streaming application may request a lower quality video stream in response to a network performance estimate indicating suboptimal network conditions. As described above, requests for network performance estimates can be embodied as part of an API. By making such an API request available to developers, developers of applications can choose on how best to optimize their respective applications based on received network performance estimates.","It is appreciated that while the foregoing disclosure describes a situation where the requestor of a network performance estimate is the mobile device , the foregoing disclosure includes embodiments where the requestor is a serving application that is serving a service-seeking mobile device.  illustrates an example embodiment where the network performance module  is configured to receive requests for a network performance estimate from an application server  executing a serving application , e.g., a video or audio streaming application.

In some example embodiments, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. The terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving,\u201d are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.","Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201csecond,\u201d and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.","As used herein, the term module may refer to, be part of, or include an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC); an electronic circuit; a combinational logic circuit; a field programmable gate array (FPGA); a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) that executes code, or a process executed by a distributed network of processors and storage in networked clusters or datacenters; other suitable components that provide the described functionality; or a combination of some or all of the above, such as in a system-on-chip. The term module may include memory (shared, dedicated, or group) that stores code executed by the one or more processors.","The term code, as used above, may include software, firmware, bytecode and\/or microcode, and may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, and\/or objects. The term shared, as used above, means that some or all code from multiple modules may be executed using a single (shared) processor. In addition, some or all code from multiple modules may be stored by a single (shared) memory. The term group, as used above, means that some or all code from a single module may be executed using a group of processors. In addition, some or all code from a single module may be stored using a group of memories.","The apparatuses and methods described herein may be implemented by one or more computer programs executed by one or more processors. The computer programs include processor-executable instructions that are stored on a non-transitory tangible computer readable medium. The computer programs may also include stored data. Non-limiting examples of the non-transitory tangible computer readable medium are nonvolatile memory, magnetic storage, and optical storage."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWINGS","p":["The drawings described herein are for illustrative purposes only of selected embodiments and not all possible implementations, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
