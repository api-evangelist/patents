{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent No. 61\/038,241 filed Mar. 20, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention concerns a method and system for creating a native application for a mobile communications device in real-time.","It is difficult for most people to create cross-platform mobile applications. Mobile communications devices operate on different platforms such as the Apple iPhone OS, Window Mobile, Symbian, Palm, S60 and Google Android. Each platform has its own programming language and requirements.","Traditionally, creating a native application on a specific platform requires learning and writing a computer language specific to that platform. Consequently, cross platform applications requires re-writing the application for each platform and programmers with expertise in multiple programming languages. This is time-consuming and expensive. Also, as new platforms emerge, authors of applications must familiarize themselves with the programming language of the new platform in addition to their knowledge of existing platforms.","Technologies such as Java\u2122 create a platform independent virtual machine to assist with the deployment of applications to multiple platforms. However, the user interface (UI) generated by Java applications are distinctively different from the native UI of the original platform. Firstly, the Java UI is not aesthetically pleasing. Secondly, the Java UI is slower than the native UI because the Java virtual machine acts as an additional layer between the Java program and the underlying native API\/operating system.","In a first preferred aspect, there is provided a method for executing an application on a mobile communications device. The method includes parsing a file containing mark up language to define the application. The method also includes generating the application during run time to create a native application for the mobile communications device. The method also includes generating user interface (UI) components for the native application by mapping procedures defined by the mark-up language to native application programming interface (API) calls of the operating platform of the mobile communications device.","The mark up language may be hypertext markup language (HTML) with extensions to the <a> tag, <div> tag, <input> tag, <select> tag, <table> tag and <td> tag.","The file may be parsed by a software client and the application is generated by the software client.","The software client may maintain an operation queue, node structure, database and view stack.","The method may further include loading a start page by inserting a root universal resource locator (URL) link into the operation queue. The method may also include storing a subset of elements in the node structure. The method may also include traversing the elements in the node structure, building a UI screen from the node structure using native UI components.","Data transfer between the software client and an external server may be mediated by an internal web server.","The internal web server may transfer the data communication between the software client and the external server without making any changes.","The internal server may be a fully functional backend that handles all the client requests such that the software client is able to function without being connected to the external server by allowing the internal web server to return cached files instead of fetching them from the external server.","An image node element may insert a load image operation into the operation queue such that the image is post-loaded as the image is loaded only after other UIs have been constructed","An outward link node element may insert a load page operation into the operation queue such that the page is pre-loaded as the page is loaded before the user sees it.","The method may further include handling navigation from a current screen to a next screen by inserting the link of the next screen into the operation queue and assigning it with the highest priority. The method may also include handling map and GPS interaction by inserting native controls above a map web view. The method may also include handling camera and file dialog by triggering a local camera and file dialog. If a user clicks on a link that leads away from the current page, the operation queue is emptied and the current screen is loaded to the view stack.","In a second aspect, there is provided a system for executing an application on a mobile communications device. The system includes a data source to supply a file containing mark up language to define the application. The system also includes a software client provided on a mobile communications device to receive and parse the file in order to generate the application during run time to create a native application for the mobile communications device and to generate user interface (UI) components for the native application by mapping procedures defined by the mark-up language to native application programming interface (API) calls of the operating platform of the mobile communications device.","The system may further comprise a map to define relationships between the procedures and native API calls for a plurality of operating platforms for mobile communications devices, the map being read by the software client when generating the application.","The system may further comprise a visual graphical user interface authoring tool to generate the file by visual manipulation of graphical components on a grid, and to provide templates for common operations.","The data source may be an external server accessible via the Internet or an internal web server.","In a third aspect, there is provided a software client for executing an application on a mobile communications device. The software client includes a receiver module to receive a file containing mark up language to define the application. The software client also includes a parser to parse the file in order to generate the application during run time to create a native application for the mobile communications device. The software client also includes a screen builder to generate UI components for the native application by mapping procedures defined by the mark-up language to native application programming interface (API) calls of the operating platform of the mobile communications device.","Referring to the drawings, a system for executing an application on a mobile communications device is provided. The system has a data source ,  to supply a file containing mark up language to define the application. The system also has a software client  provided on a mobile communications device to receive and parse the file in order to generate the application during run time to create a native application for the mobile communications device. Preferably, the mobile communications device is a mobile phone (using at least 2G for voice communication) and with Internet access. The software client also generates user interface (UI) components for the native application by mapping procedures defined by the mark-up language to native application programming interface (API) calls of the operating platform of the mobile communications device.","The system is an enabler which means that developers and authors can construct applications for mobile communications devices without requiring specific knowledge about each platform for every mobile communications device. Consequently, authors can focus their effort on the application itself such as its functionality, presentation and interaction with mobile phone users. It is hoped that better applications are developed because no time needs to be spent on learning and programming for every mobile platform. An author with some basic hypertext markup language (HTML) programming knowledge simply needs to build a website using HTML tags with some intuitive extensions. This leverages the author's familiarity with HTML tags to enable fast development of an application. Afterwards, the author provides the URL of their website to a service provider. The service provider creates the application for the mobile platforms requested by the author.","The application for the mobile communications device is generated in real time rather than traditionally in compile time. Real time means if the server changes the HTML, for example, adding a search bar, the change is reflected immediately in the application. This concept similar to a web browser but differs in that it is for an application which uses native user interface (UI) components instead of rendering standard HTML components in a web browser.","The software client called a Rosetta client  is created for each mobile platform. A cross platform UI specification called the Rosetta HTML specification is provided that is used by all Rosetta clients  and a Rosetta HTML file is received by a receiver  and parsed by a parser . The Rosetta client  generates the application using a screen builder . Based on the UI specification, the Rosetta client  generates the UI using the dynamic properties of the platform-specific UI libraries and the native application programming interface (API) of the mobile platform. The UI components that can be built that are as simple as a button or as complex as a map, camera or image editor.","Turning to , the Rosetta client  maintains the following data structures: operation queue , node structure , database  and view stack . All operations are performed by inserting themselves into the operation queue . The items in the operation queue  can be prioritized, change priority or removed at any time. After parsing a Rosetta HTML file, the result is stored in the node structure  which preferably is a tree. Each node of the node structure  is mapped to a corresponding function of a platform-specific software development kit (SDK). Mapping may be performed by reading a map  between the procedures of the Rosetta HTML specification and the native API of a specific mobile platform. The database is used for caching and accessing structural information. The current screen is always placed on the top of the view stack . The previous screen is hidden but not removed. Returning to the previous screen is done by popping the view stack . Progressing to the next screen is done by placing the screen on the top of the stack .","To execute the application on the mobile communications device, the Rosetta client  is started (). Every application has a root URL. The root URL is inserted () into the operation queue using a \u201cLoad Root URL\u201d operation.  depicts the operation of \u201cLoad URL A\u201d into the operation queue . The operation queue  maintains the sequence of operation for the Rosetta client . Next, the UI generation process is started (). The Rosetta client  downloads\/retrieves  the content from the root URL which is a Rosetta HTML file from an internal server  or via the Internet. An example Rosetta HTML file is depicted in . Next, the Rosetta client  parses () the HTML document to generate a HTML node tree as depicted in .  shows an example of the node structure for the example Rosetta HTML file of . After obtaining the HTML node tree, the Rosetta client  starts to build () the screen\/user interface using the native API provided by the platform specific SDK. An example of the building process is illustrated in  where the procedures in the Rosetta HTML file are mapped to the native API of the Android platform. The operation queue  is read when the screen is loaded. After building the screen, post-loading operations are added () to the operation queue if they exist such as loading images. For example, an image node inserts the \u201cLoad Image\u201d operation into the operation queue . This means the image is post-loaded because the image is only loaded after the UI has been constructed. This is depicted in . Another example is an outward link node which inserts the \u201cLoad page\u201d operation into the operation queue. This means that the page is pre-loaded because the page is loaded before the user sees it. The flow is modified such that after a1.html is pre-fetched, the user clicks on \u201chello 1\u201d, and in this case, \u201ca1.html\u201ddoes not need to load as it can be directly loaded from the cache  in the database .  depicts what occurs when a user clicks on the link \u201chello 2\u201d. The operation queue  is cleared and \u201cLoad URL a2.htmL\u201d is inserted in the operation queue . Also, preloading operations, such as loading HTML documents for a next screen, are added () to the operation queue . Next, the operations of the operation queue are executed () and the screen is created. Other pending operations in the operation queue  are executed () accordingly.","The operation queue can be preempted if the user interacts () with the application and triggers another page such as clicking on a button. The current screen is pushed () to the top of the view stack . The view stack  maintains the navigation sequence so that users can easily and quickly go back to the previous screen. The operation queue of the current screen is cleared () because of the loading of a new screen and the URL of the new screen is added () to the operation queue . The UI generation is started again ().","The data transfer between the Rosetta client and the external server  is mediated by an internal web server . On the one hand, the internal web server  can be simple and it passes the communication between the client  and external server  without any changes. On the other hand, the internal web server  can be a fully functional backend that handles all the requests of the client . In such a case, the Rosetta client  can function without being connected to the external server  (and without Internet access availability). Caching is done by letting the internal web server  return the cached files instead of fetching them from the external server .","In , some API calls of the Android API are depicted which have the following function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["API call","Function"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["setTitle","Change the title associated with this activity."]},{"entry":[{},"If this is a top-level activity, the title for its"]},{"entry":[{},"window will change.

The Rosetta client traverses the HTML node tree depicted in  to construct the user interface screen. Firstly, it obtains the title from the \u201ctitle\u201d node  in the HTML node tree and sets the title to native program . For example, the native API in Android platform for setting up the title is by calling the \u201cActivity\u201d typed instance with method \u201csetTitle\u201d (i) and pass the title to the activity.setTitle(title) method .","The \u201cbody\u201d node  is used to build the body part of the screen. For building the \u201ctable\u201d node , the Rosetta client builds the table UI component by using the native API such as \u201cLinearLayout\u201d class . \u201ctr\u201d node  and \u201ctd\u201d nodes  are used to control the orientation of the \u201cLinearLayout\u201d . The \u201ca\u201d node  is processed which has a URL of a1.html . The Rosetta client marks the \u201crow\u201d as focusable using native API, View.setFocusable(true) , and handles the click event action using native API by overriding the onClick method in View.OnClickListener interface .","The \u201cimg\u201d node  is processed which adds  the loading image operation to the operation queue by using internal queue API in the native platform, that is, queue.add . The postloading image is displayed by using ImageView. Next, the a1.html URL is added  to the operation queue for prefetching operation. For processing  a text node  with text \u201chello 1\u201d, the Rosetta client uses \u201cTextView\u201d native class to construct the text label with \u201chello 1\u201d text . The subtree of the second \u201ctr\u201d node  is operated on similarly as the first \u201ctr\u201d node .","The system extends existing HTML language to facilitate easier and quicker understanding of how to develop applications using the system.

Combining with the native client, it gives a seamless shopping experience. Another example is a contact application. Application may be created by integrating existing applications together. New applications can be created by customizing existing ones. For example, another user can just download a contact application created earlier, enrich it with a \u201cDate of birth\u201d and \u201cAddress\u201d field, and publish it as a new application. This may further speed up development time and reduce programming costs.","Visual GUI Authoring Tool","To help people without any programming knowledge create their own applications, a visual graphical user interface (GUI) may be provided. Internet users can create applications that run on the web and natively on mobile communications devices. The user can create a model and view visually in one unified step. A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interface creates the view, and the model is generated automatically. Common operations as are generalized as templates. Common operations are generalized and presented as templates. When users choose different templates using the WYSIWYG interface, they are actually choosing different controllers for their applications. All the views\/screens of an application are laid out on one consistent 2D grid. Typically, it is difficult for a user to conceptualize an application in pure source code. All the views or screens of the application including the search screen and the form screens are placed on a 2D grid. The grid provides a single place to hold all the screens and it is also a map to allow the user to navigate through different screens when using the application.","To create an application using the visual authoring tool involves three main steps: creating a form, specifying the layout of the form(s) and specify the index of the application for searching purposes. The user creates the form to store his data. In database terminology, a form corresponds to a record. The user specifies the layout of the forms which determines how should people browse through them. The user can pick different templates for the layout by answering how they will group the forms into columns and how the forms in a column should be sorted. The grouping and sorting are based on picking the fields created earlier. The last step in creating the application is to specify the index of the application that allows people to search the forms.","It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as broadly described.
