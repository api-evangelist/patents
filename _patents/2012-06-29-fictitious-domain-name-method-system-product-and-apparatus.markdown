title: Fictitious domain name method, system, product, and apparatus
abstract: A DNS server receives a DNS query based on a predetermined syntax, with the DNS query having a domain name having a highest level domain (HLD). The DNS server uses a root zone file having a resource record to resolve the DNS query in response to determining that the HLD is a top level domain alias (TLDA) that is not an HLD registered in the DNS server. The resource record of the root zone file includes an IP address corresponding to a network resource that is configured to determine a namespace provider that can process the domain name having the TLDA.

In the physical world, one relies on both street addresses and the postal system to send information back and forth between individuals and organizations. On the Internet, one relies on the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate domain names into Internet addresses.","In general, names are thought of as discrete emblems used to establish or designate identity; addresses are thought of as emblems designating location. Domain names might seem to be unusual because they appear to be both names and addresses; they both locate and identify Internet resources. Yet people's personal names, for example, establish identity, and such identifiers travel with the individual rather than changing when the person changes location. Street addresses or geographic names, by contrast, are more static in order to establish location. Yet such addresses and geographic names also serve to identify the physical place, differentiating it from other places.","Geographic names of all kinds\u2014street addresses, zip codes, counties\u2014are in fact overlays on an unchanging numerical system of longitude and latitude, which is a universally recognized designator and locator for a particular place on the earth's surface. In this sense, geographic names are much like Internet domain names, which are an overlay of Internet address number designations.","Name space is a set of names in which all names are unique. Address space is a set of addresses in which all addresses are unique. Names are commonly used as mnemonic devices to help remember information. For instance, names are used to remember telephone numbers, and domain names are used to remember Internet addresses.","Currently, national phone numbers take the form of an international dialing code, area code, prefix, and number (e.g., 1-212-555-1212). During the turn of the century, phone companies built \u201cexchanges\u201d known as Central Offices to serve a certain geographical area. The exchange was named after the first prefix installed in that office. Before phones had dials on them, an operator connected the caller's request to the name of the exchange and number, such as Spring 3456 or Pennsylvania 5000. In the late 1920's, once dials started appearing on phones, a caller could connect the phone number by first dialing the first three letters of the exchange and then the number. For example, the caller would dial the S-P-R in Spring and then the 3456 or the P-E-N in Pennsylvania 5000. Back then, phone numbers were written with the dialed letters capitalized such as SPRing 3456 and PENnsylvania 5000, as a mnemonic device.","By the 1930's, large cities were dropping the third letter from the dialing routine and replacing it with a number, in order to increase the available numbers for each exchange. So numbers such as SPRing 3456 would become Spring2-3456 and PENnsylvania 5000 would become Pennsylvania6-5000. This simple change added 80,000 new numbers to existing exchanges. Exchange names helped foster a sense of place, and community, in the same way that cities do. For over 30 years exchange names were published in phone directories and had become common use worldwide.","Area codes were being used up faster by the early 1960's than was predicted in 1947 when the area code scheme was finalized as part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). As a result, exchange names were continually being reassigned causing confusion and aggravation in communities throughout major cities in the country. During the early 1970's, as exchange names were phased out and 1-800 toll free numbers introduced, industry recognized and extended the use of mnemonics for commercial advertising and name branding. During the 1980's, 1-800 names were popularized to the point where brokers would buy names with the hope of selling or leasing the 1-800 names from their growing portfolio. In fact, courts have almost unanimously held that telephone mnemonics may be protected as trademarks. In recent years, the shortage of seven letter names used as a mnemonic device led to the strategy for obtaining telephone numbers that correspond to eight and nine letter names. In recent years, two new toll free exchanges (1-888, 1-877) were added because of the saturation of 1-800 numbers. Exchange names are but one example of name space.","Similarly, postal codes were developed to provide a hierarchical description for locating a post office. In June 1962, the Presidential appointed Advisory Board of the Post Office Department, after a study of its overall mechanization problems, made several primary recommendations. One was that the Department give priority to the development of a coding system, called the ZIP (Zoning Improvement Plan) Code, a five-digit code assigned to every address throughout the country. The first digit designated a broad geographical area of the United States, ranging from zero for the Northeast to nine for the far West. This was followed by two digits that more closely pinpointed population concentrations and those sectional centers accessible to common transportation networks. The final two digits designated small post offices or postal zones in larger zoned cities.","Introduced in 1983, the ZIP+4 code added a hyphen and four digits to the existing five-digit ZIP Code. The first five numbers continued to identify an area of the country and delivery office to which mail is directed. The sixth and seventh numbers denote a delivery sector, which may be several blocks, a group of streets, a group of post office boxes, several office buildings, a single high-rise office building, a large apartment building, or a small geographic area. The last two numbers denote a delivery segment, which might be one floor of an office building, one side of a street between intersecting streets, specific departments in a firm, or a group of post office boxes. Postal codes serves as another example of name space. A recent area of worldwide concern is the allocation of name space on the Internet.","The Internet is a vast computer network having many smaller networks that span the world. A network provides a distributed communicating system of computers that are interconnected by various electronic communication links and computer software protocols. Because of the Internet's distributed and open network architecture, it is possible to transfer data from one computer to any other computer worldwide. In 1991, the World-Wide-Web (WWW or Web) revolutionized the way information is managed and distributed.","The Web is based on the concept of hypertext and a transfer method known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which is designed to run primarily over a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) connection that employs a standard Internet setup. A server computer may provide data and a client computer may display or process it. TCP may then convert messages into streams of packets at the source, then reassemble them back into messages at the destination. Internet Protocol (IP) handles addressing, seeing to it that packets are routed across multiple nodes and even across multiple networks with multiple standards. HTTP protocol permits client systems connected to the Internet to access independent and geographically scattered server systems also connected to the Internet.","HTTP provides a method for users to obtain data objects from various hosts acting as servers on the Internet. User requests for data objects are made by means of a HTTP request, such as a GET request. A GET request is comprised of the GET request keyword, the full path of the data object, the name of the data object, and a HTTP protocol version, such as \u201cHTTP\/1.0\u201d. In the following GET request, a request is being made for the data object with a path name of \u201c\/example\/\u201d and a name of \u201cfile.html\u201d:","GET \/example\/file.html HTTP-Version","Processing of a GET request entails the establishing of an TCP\/IP connection with the server named in the GET request and receipt from the server of the data object specified. After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds in the form of a HTTP RESPONSE message. Response messages begin with a status line comprising a protocol version followed by a numeric Status Code and an associated textual Reason Phrase. Space characters separate these elements. The format of a status line is as follows:","Status-Line=HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase","The status line begins with a protocol version and status code, e.g., \u201cHTTP\/1.0 200\u201d. The status code element is a three-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy a prior request message. The reason phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the status code. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. There are five categories for the first digit. 1XX is an information response. It is not currently used. 2XX is a successful response, indicating that the action was successfully received, understood and accepted. 3XX is a redirection response, indicating that further action must be taken in order to complete the request. 4XX is a client error response. This indicates a bad syntax in the request. Finally, 5XX is a server error. This indicates that the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.","Web browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE), Netscape Navigator, and NeoPlanet provide graphical user interface (GUI) based client applications that implement the client side portion of the HTTP protocol. One format for information transfer is to create documents using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML pages are made up of standard text as well as formatting codes that indicate how the page should be displayed. The client side web browser reads these codes in order to display the page. A web page may be static and requires no variables to display information or link to other predetermined web pages. A web page is dynamic when arguments are passed which are either hidden in the web page or entered from a client browser to supply the necessary inputs displayed on the web page. Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard for running external programs from a web server. CGI specifies how to pass arguments to the executing program as part of the HTTP server request. Commonly, a CGI script may take the name and value arguments from an input form of a first web page which can be used as a query to access a database server and generate an HTML web page with customized data results as output that is passed back to the client browser for display.","There are many network access devices and program products that primarily serve as a navigation tool allowing a user to request network resources from resource identifiers. Navigating to a different network resource could happen as a result of external automation, internal automation from a script, the user clicking a hyperlink or typing in the address bar or location field of web browser, for example. All too often, such navigation tools can not always successfully access a network resource from an identifier for many reasons. Some reasons may include: domain name can not be translated into an IP address, invalid syntax, access denied, payment required, request forbidden, object not found, method is not allowed, no response acceptable to client found, proxy authentication required, server timed out waiting for request, user should resubmit with more info, resource is no longer available, server refused to accept request without a length, precondition given in request failed, network resource identifier is too long, unsupported media type, retry after doing the appropriate action, internal server error, server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request, error response received from gateway, temporarily overloaded, timed out waiting for gateway, attempt to redirect the navigation failed, and HTTP version not supported. In any event, a status message is usually displayed indicating that the network resource request has failed.","A network resource identifier such as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource. URIs are the generic set of all names and addresses that refer to objects on the Internet. A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) refers to the subset of URI that are required to remain globally unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable. A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) refers to the subset of URI that identify resources via a representation of their primary access mechanism (e.g., their network \u201clocation\u201d), rather than identifying the resource by name or by some other attribute(s) of that resource.","A URL is the address of a file accessible on the Internet. The URL contains the name of the protocol required to access the resource, a domain name or IP address that identifies a specific computer on the Internet, and a hierarchical description of a file location on the computer. In addition, the last (optional) part of the URL may be a \u201cquery string\u201d preceded by \u201c?\u201d or a \u201cfragment identifier\u201d preceded by \u201c#\u201d. The fragment identifier indicates a particular position within the specified file. For example the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.example.com:80\/index.html#appendix\u201d, where \u201chttp\u201d is the scheme or protocol, \u201cwww.example.com\u201d is the host server name or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), \u201c80\u201d is the port connection for the HTTP server request, \u201cindex.html\u201d is the filename located on the server, and \u201cappendix\u201d is the identifier to display a specific portion of the HTML file called \u201cindex\u201d. The URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.example.com\u201d also retrieves an HTML file called \u201cindex\u201d on the HTTP server called \u201cexample.com\u201d. By default, when either a port or filename is omitted upon accessing a HTTP server via a URL, the client browser interprets the request by connecting via port 80, and retrieving the HTML file called \u201cindex\u201d.","Because an Internet address is a relatively long string of numbers (e.g., 31.41.59.26) that is difficult to remember, Internet users rely on domain names, memorable and sometimes catchy words corresponding to these numbers, in order to use e-mail and to connect to Internet sites on the Web. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a set of protocols and services on a network that allows users to utilize domain names when looking for other hosts (e.g., computers) on the network. The DNS is composed of a distributed database of names. The names in the DNS database establish a logical tree structure called the domain name space. Each node or domain in the domain name space is named and can contain subdomains. Domains and subdomains are grouped into zones to allow for distributed administration of the name space.","The DNS provides a mechanism so backup databases can be identified in case the first one becomes unavailable. DNS databases are updated automatically so that information on one name server does not remain out-of-date for long. A client of the DNS is called a resolver; resolvers are typically located in the application layer of the networking software of each TCP\/IP capable machine. Users typically do not interact directly with the resolver. Application programs that use the DNS, such as mailers, mail servers, Web clients, Web servers, Web caches, IRC clients, FTP clients, distributed file systems, distributed databases, and almost all other applications on TCP\/IP rely on the resolver library.","Resolvers query the DNS by directing queries at name servers, which contain parts of the distributed database that is accessed by using the DNS protocols to translate domain names into IP addresses needed for transmission of information across the network. The function of translating a domain name into an IP address is known as name resolution. Name resolution is performed by a distributed system of name servers having resolvers to fulfill the resource request of the client by the successive hierarchical querying of the resource records from zone files.","The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) implements an Internet name server for the UNIX operating system. The BIND includes a name server and a resolver library. BIND is fully integrated into UNIX network programs for use in storing and retrieving host names and addresses by calling a routine from the resolver library called gethostbyname( ) which returns the IP address corresponding to a given Internet host name. Error return status from gethostbyname( ) is indicated by return of a NULL pointer.","At the core of Netscape client products lies the Netscape Network Library (NETL1B). A necessity of any network based client browser application is to send and receive data over a connection. This is accomplished in NETLIB by making a call to NET_GetURL( ). In order to resolve host names, NETLIB uses a standard DNS lookup mechanism. NET_FindAddress( ) makes the gethostbyname( ) call to lookup the IP address for the specified host from a DNS database stored on a DNS server, and is called from NET_BeginConnect( ). If a numeric IP address is passed into NET_FindAddress( ), it is passed directly into the gethostbyname( ) call which returns a success when an IP address is passed in. NET_FindAddress( ) is actually called repeatedly until it returns success or failure. Similarly, MSIE browser include objects such as WebBrowser Object and InternetExplorer Object, which contains events, methods, and properties. One event, called the Navigate Event navigates to a resource identified by a URL.","A domain name includes two parts: a host and a domain. Technically, the letters to the right of the \u201cdot\u201d (e.g., tlda.com) are referred to as Top Level Domains (TLDs), while hosts, computers with assigned IP addresses that are listed in specific TLD registries are known as second-level domains (SLDs). For the domain name \u201ctlda.com\u201d, \u201c.com\u201d is the TLD, and \u201ctlda\u201d is the SLD. Domain name space is the ordered hierarchical set of all possible domain names either in use or to be used for locating an IP address on the Internet. TLDs are known as top-level domains because they comprise the highest-order name space available on the Internet. Second-level domains, as well as third-level domains (3LDs) such as \u201cmy.tlda.com\u201d, are subsidiary to TLDs in the hierarchy of the Internet's DNS.","There are two types of top-level domains, generic and country code. Generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were created to allocate resources to the growing community of institutional networks, while country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) were created for use by each individual country, as deemed necessary. More than 240 national, or country-code TLDs (e.g., United States (.us), Japan (.jp), Germany (.de), etc.) are administered by their corresponding governments, or by private entities with the appropriate national government's acquiescence. A small set of gTLDs does not carry any national identifier, but denote the intended function of that portion of the domain space. For example, \u201c.com\u201d was established for commercial networks, \u201c.org\u201d for not-for-profit organizations, and \u201c.net\u201d for network gateways. The set of gTLDs was established early in the history of the DNS and has not been changed or augmented in recent years (COM, ORG, GOV, and MIL were created by January 1985, NET in July 1985, and INT was added in November 1988).","There are proposed solutions for revamping \u201c.us\u201d in order to create a more viable use for the United States TLD. On Aug. 3, 1998, a request for comments was printed in the federal register by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for public opinion on the enhancement of the \u201c.us\u201d Domain Space. At present, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) administers \u201c.us\u201d as a locality-based hierarchy in which second-level domain space is allocated to states and US territories. This name space is further subdivided into localities. General registration under localities is performed on an exclusive basis by private firms that have requested delegation from IANA. The \u201c.us\u201d name space has typically been used by branches of state and local governments, although some commercial names have been assigned. Where registration for a locality has not been delegated, the IANA itself serves as the registrar.","Some in the Internet community have suggested that the pressure for unique identifiers in \u201c.com\u201d could be relieved with commercial use of the \u201c.us\u201d space. Commercial users and trademark holders, however, find the current locality-based system too cumbersome and complicated for commercial use. Expanded use of the \u201c.us\u201d TLD could alleviate some of the pressure for new generic TLDs and reduce conflicts between American companies and others competing for the same domain name. Clearly, there is much opportunity for enhancing the \u201c.us\u201d domain space, and the \u201c.us\u201d domain could be expanded in many ways without displacing the current geopolitical structure. Over the next few months, the U.S. government will work with the private sector, along with state and local governments, to determine how best to make the \u201c.US\u201d domain more attractive to commercial users.","The Commercial Internet eXchange Association (CIX) is a non-profit, trade association of network service providers promoting and encouraging the development of the public data communications internetworking services industry, in both national and international markets. CIX has also been lobbying for better use of the \u201c.us\u201d system. According to a draft from CIX in March 1998\u2014in response to a White House \u201cGreen Paper\u201d released the previous month on the proposed rule for \u201cImprovement of Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses\u201d\u2014CIX states concerns that \u201c.us\u201d is not widely used for commercial purposes. Indeed, sites employing this domain may not be frequently visited. It is widely acknowledged that the \u201c.us\u201d domain suffers from structural deficiencies and requires extensive reform. The lack of a commercially viable name space for the U.S. contributes directly to the demand for \u201c.com\u201d SLDs and the alleged critical shortage of gTLDs. Therefore, reform of the \u201c.us\u201d may help alleviate the need for gTLDs and be more consistent with international practices of using ccTLDs, at least in the short and medium term.","The DNS is operated by a Network Information Center (NIC) in each country to act as authority for administering the respective ccTLD zone file portion of the DNS database. The Internet Network Information Center (lnterNIC) previously administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF), was formed to preside as Registry and have authority over the gTLD zone files. In 1993, InterNIC was privatized and Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), now VeriSign Global Registry Services (VeriSign GRS), was also chosen as Registrar to perform the registration and propagation of these key gTLDs, under a five-year cooperative agreement with the NSF.","Every request to resolve a domain name by locating a particular host on the Internet must necessarily, by default, refer to the root zone file on the NSI root nameservers in order to be directed to the appropriate nameserver containing the SLD names registered under the particular TLD indicated in the host's request. Accordingly, unless and until a TLD root nameserver, is referred to in the root zone file, that nameserver will not be globally recognized on the Internet and the names serviced thereby will not be universally resolvable.","In an effort to shift the overseeing of the Internet out of government hands and into the private sector, NSI's original extension to the cooperative agreement was extended six months to have then expired Sep. 30, 1998. Most recently, NSI and officials from the Department of Commerce's NTIA have agreed to a two-year extension of their Cooperative Agreement through Sep. 30, 2000. Included in the extension are provisions to transfer relevant US Government authority over some domain name system functions to a new non-profit corporation.","Incorporated and headquartered in California, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the non-profit corporation that was formed to take over responsibility for the IP address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment, domain name system management, and root server system management functions now performed under U.S. Government contract by IANA and other entities. The IANA, also headquartered in California, is the overall authority for day-to-day administration of the DNS. IANA staff carry out administrative responsibilities for the assignment of IP Addresses, Autonomous System Numbers, TLDs, and other unique parameters of the DNS and its protocols.","ICANN, NTIA, and NSI agreed to a migration to a shared registration system (SRS) in a phased approach beginning Mar. 31, 1999 with full implementation by Jun. 1, 1999. NSI has implemented a SRS to support multiple licensed, accredited registrars offering registration services. NSI and other domain name registrars function as retailers of domain name registration services through NSI's SRS. NSI will also continue in its role as the registry or wholesaler of \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.net\u201d, and \u201c.org\u201d domain name registrations. To date, more than 24,000,000 domain names, or SLDs, in \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.net\u201d, \u201c.org\u201d, and \u201c.edu\u201d have been registered.","The Internet domain name registration market is lucrative and rapidly growing. The demand over the past year for domain names or SLDs has exceeded 1,000,000 new registrations monthly. InterNIC also registers 3LDs, but the number of registrations is little in comparison to SLDs. The most common use of 3LDs is for the designation of DNS servers, e-mail servers, or other specialized computer functions whereas the primary use for SLDs are for accessing web sites and brand name recognition. Furthermore, the arbitrarily limited number of TLDs has created a severe shortage of desirable domain names in the \u201c.com\u201d registry, leading to substantial pent-up demand for alternative domain name resources.","Experimental registry systems offering name registration services in an alternative set of exclusive domains such as \u201c.space\u201d or \u201c.love\u201d developed as early as January 1996. Although visible to only a fraction of Internet users, alternative DNS systems such as the Name.Space, AlterNIC, and eDNS registries have contributed to the community's dialogue on the evolution of DNS administration. Competition argues that TLDs have become an issue of free speech and should not be restricted to the current limited set of gTLDs and ccTLDs.","Customers registering second-level domains in alternative TLDs cannot be reached by other Internet users because these domains, which are not listed in the root zone file, cannot be resolved by other Internet DNS name servers. Only if competitors individually negotiated with each of the scores of thousands of name server operators on the global Internet, something that is a physical and financial impossibility, for inclusion of alternative TLDs would there be any possibility that its domain names could be universally resolvable. As a result, competition has been unable to offer a commercially viable registration service in its TLDs, and has been unable to effectively compete in the domain name market. In March 2001, by partnering with several large ISPs to modify their nameservers, New.Net, Inc. opened their doors to serve as the most effective demonstration of how alternative TLDs are attempting to succeed in a fragmented market driven system.","The following excerpt is provided in, \u201cInformational RFC (Request for Comment) 2826: IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root\u201d, Internet Architecture Board, May 2000, \u201chttp:\/\/www.faqs.org\/rfcs\/rfc2826.html\u201d. To remain a global network, the Internet requires the existence of a globally unique public name space. The DNS name space is a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally unique root. This is a technical constraint inherent in the design of the DNS. Therefore it is not technically feasible for there to be more than one root in the public DNS. That one root must be supported by a set of coordinated root servers administered by a unique naming authority. Under agreements among ICANN, the U.S. Government, and NSI, ICANN (through IANA, now absorbed into ICANN), sends documentation for needed changes to the root zone file to the U.S. Department of Commerce, which directs Network Solutions to implement them by editing the authoritative root zone file.","A supplemental memo to RFC 2826 is provided in Simon Higgs, \u201cInformational Internet Draft: Root Zone Definitions\u201d, Higgs Communications, May 2001, \u201chttp:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-higgs-root-defs-01.txt\u201d. Within this memo, definitions are applied in an attempt to make other roots such as alternative or enhanced roots inclusive as part of a single, globally unique root implying that the single root comprises a plurality of root components distributed across many zone files. In another draft provided in Simon Higgs, \u201cInformational Internet Draft: Alternative Roots and the Virtual Inclusive Root\u201d, May 29, 2001, \u201chttp:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-higgs-virtual-root-00.txt\u201d, proposes a solution to the problem of duplicate colliding top level domains by identifying the virtual inclusive root (VIR), in compliance with the IAB's RFC 2826. Though the VIR is the sum of the consensus between all root zones on the public Internet, the VIR cannot support conflicting TLDs.","There is a particular increase in articles and publications emphasizing the importance of name space and the perceived shortage of \u201c.com\u201d names. References have been made that NASA is seeking authorization for \u201c.mars\u201d as an extension of terrestrial geography. Speaking on the opening day of the annual Internet Society (ISOC) conference in Geneva on Jul. 22, 1998, Vint Cerf, a founding President of ISOC, said the domain name debate should also encompass \u201c.earth\u201d or \u201c.mars\u201d because that's where real-time science data is going to travel from in the not-too-distant future. He said, \u201cThe idea is to take the interplanetary Internet design and make it a part of the infrastructure of the Mars mission.\u201d","Ironically that same day, an on-line Wired News article reports that Netword LLC has sued Centraal Corp. for patent infringement on its Internet keyword system. The system uses plain English instead of URLs to retrieve Web addresses. The technology lets companies and site owners register simple keywords that browsers can use to access Web sites. \u201cChevy,\u201d for example, could be used as an alias to replace the lengthier Web address \u201chttp:\/\/www.chevrolet.com\u201d.

The metadata may include a natural language name of the network resource, its location, its language, its region or intended audience, and other descriptive information.","In recent years there has been an increased convergence of emerging resource discovery providers including services such as Common Name Resolution Protocol (CNRP), Unified Resolution and Discovery Protocol (URDP), and Universal Directory, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) to name a few. In all cases such resource discovery services function as a layer on top of the DNS by intercepting an identifier before DNS resolution. To date, there are no known services that harmonize resource discovery services during DNS resolution.","In response to industry debate regarding how to modernize and extend the DNS to better support the Internet of the future, Teare submitted a white paper on Jul. 12, 2001 to the National Academies Computer Science and Telecommunications Board. The sub-committee, mandated by the US Congress, is examining Internet Navigation and the Domain Name System. The paper proposes a new naming and identity system for the Internet that would enable applications to access resources and information across multiple networks. The system would include DNS, Keyword-based namespaces, URL's and other namespaces. It would be based on a new unified, standards-based discovery and resolution layer capable of supporting multiple naming services, and directory services. The paper acknowledges that the DNS should remain essentially unchanged, with a single root, and that the proposed system would add new functionality on top of the DNS. Though the white paper proposes a promising vision of resource discovery unification, it still remains unclear as to how this proposed new layer will communicate seamlessly with the DNS, a common problem shared by the increased proposal of other similar resource discovery services.","Internet users all over the world whose native language is represented in character sets other than US-ASCII, and several popular Internet applications support international character sets to make these applications more widely useful. For example, international character sets are supported in today's electronic mail and web browser applications. However, they are not supported in the global DNS. More recently, technology has been developed to use international character sets as an alias for a domain name called a multilingual domain name (MDN) or international domain name (IDN). A native language name may be followed by a TLD or by a native language representation of a resolvable TLD to form a MDN.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,148 issued on Jan. 30, 2001 by Tout, entitled, \u201cMethod and system for internationalizing domain names\u201d discloses a method and system which allows domain names to be entered in any language without having to modify the existing Internet domain name servers. When a user enters a domain name including non-English characters into an internet program, a domain name transformer intercepts the domain name prior to reaching the resolver. The domain name is converted to a standard format which can represent all language character sets, such as UNICODE. The UNICODE string is then transformed to be in RFC1035 compliant format. Redirector information is then appended to the compliant string which identifies the delegation of authoritative root servers and\/or domain name servers responsible for the domain name. The compliant domain string is then resolved by the authoritative domain name server just as any English domain name.","There are further examples of how aliases may be used for requesting, identifying, and locating network resources. U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,707 issued on Feb. 27, 2001 by Minh, entitled, \u201cApparatus for implementing universal resource locator (URL) aliases in a web browser and method therefor\u201d discloses a method of universal resource locator (URL) alias implementation. The method includes the step of associating a user defined URL alias with a URL, wherein the URL alias is operable for accessing a web page corresponding to the URL. For example, the web browser may be configured to access a corresponding URL if the character set does not begin with \u201chttp,\u201d as a default measure. Though the '707 patent discloses how an alias may be used to access a URL, a URL alias is detected by determining that the scheme or protocol of the URL is an alias. In effect, alias detection relies upon the presence of some kind of protocol or scheme with no consideration given to methods of aliasing without relying upon protocol detection.","URLs are used in media and written in documents or typed within e-mail, and data files, etc. as a means to make reference to accessible online content that helps express the context of the ideas one wishes to communicate. URLs are generally written in an abbreviated manner as partial URLs or domain names (e.g., \u201chttp:\/\/www.example.com\u201d is the URL, \u201cwww.example.com\u201dis the FQDN, and \u201cexample.com\u201d is the domain name). During the early stages of commercialization on the Internet, businesses displayed the full URL when advertising a commercial or display ad as a means to locate the resources of the business on the Internet. Improvements have been made to recognize partial URLs when entered in the location field of a web browser or network accessible device for automatically appending protocol information so a full URL request can be made. By submitting a domain name or FQDN in the location field, the browser modifies the request by adjusting the partial URL and adding \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d in front of the domain name or FQDN in order to construct a valid URL. As a result of this convenience, companies have modified their advertising and distribution of URLs through print, film, radio, television and other media as \u201cexample.com\u201d or \u201cwww.example.com\u201d instead of the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.example.com\u201d.","The \u201cwww\u201d in \u201cwww.example.com\u201d has become the de facto standard for web server software to connect with hosts on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet. However, in an effort to shorten the URL length both in advertising and as a means of input, a DNS resource record has been used to create aliases for the actual FQDN. The CNAME Record are sometimes called \u201caliases\u201d but are technically referred to as \u201cCanonical Name\u201d (CNAME) entries. These records enable the use of pointing more than one domain name to a single host. Using canonical names makes it easy to host both an FTP server and a Web server on the same machine. The CNAME record \u201cexample.com. IN CNAME www.example.com.\u201d enables a domain name to become an alias of a FQDN. This alias allows resolvers to process input such as \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\u201d to resolve to a web server at the URI \u201chttp:\/\/www.example.com\u201d.","As explained in P. Mockapetris, \u201cInformational RFC (Request for Comment) 1034: DOMAIN NAMES\u2014CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES\u201d, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), November 1987, \u201chttp:\/\/www.faqs.org\/rfcs\/rfc1034.html\u201d. the principal activity of name servers is to answer standard queries. Both the query and its response are carried in a standard message format. A domain name identifies a node. Each node has a set of resource information, which may be empty. The set of resource information associated with a particular name is composed of separate resource records (RRs). The order of RRs in a set is not significant, and need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other parts of the DNS.","RRs with owner names starting with the label \u201c*\u201d are called wildcard resource records. Wildcard RRs can be thought of as instructions for synthesizing RRs. When the appropriate conditions are met, the name server creates RRs with an owner name equal to the query name and content taken from the wildcard RRs. The only example of wildcard RR usage in RFC 1034 is that of e-mail aliasing. Recently, ccTLD registries have used wildcard RRs to redirect a resolvable domain name back to the registrar component of the registry to perform registration requests. Performing this technique in a gTLD zone file would cause conflict enabling the Registry to bypass competition among multiple registrars in this very public component of the Internet's underlying technology. As a result a wildcard RR has never been used in a gTLD zone file. Furthermore, due to the global public nature with respect to the root zone file of the single, authoritative root DNS server or any other root DNS server for that matter, a wildcard resource record never been used in a root zone file.","The main use of a web browser location field is for resolving URLs to locate and access resources. Entering a URL in the location field of a web browser serves as a means to access a network resource corresponding to that URL. Because the location field is essential for accessing resources, the design of such location fields have rivaled much competition and innovation between existing web browser products from companies such as Netscape and Microsoft. Improvements to better track and organize sites of URLs that users have visited such as Bookmark folders, URL history, and the personal tool bar are all examples of functionality designed to help users navigate. Other improvements include spell checking and an autocomplete feature from the URL history as text is entered into the location field.","URLs can be removed or made temporarily unavailable for numerous reasons. When a file is removed from a directory, the URL that represents the file location no longer exists and therefore can not be found. It is quite common for users to modify a URL by deleting the file portion as an attempt to access the default \u201cindex.html\u201d file from the same directory path. For instance, the URL \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/first\/second\/file.html\u201d is not found, leaving the user to remove \u201cfile.html\u201d to try to access the modified URL, \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/first\/second\u201d. If the modified URL is still not found, then the user manually repeats such steps with the hope that some level of access to the computer resource is successful.","Another location field improvement includes a reverse autocomplete feature to help automate the process of systematically attempting to access a related resource similar to that of the original requested resource. U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,324 issued on Mar. 21, 2000 by Earl, et al., entitled, \u201cSystem and method for identifying valid portion of computer resource identifier\u201d discloses a method for receiving and validating user input for a computer resource entered into a computing system or network, and distinguishing valid and invalid portions of the user input. The most specific portion of the invalid resource identifier is removed from the invalid resource identifier to create a modified resource identifier, wherein the modified resource identifier is used to attempt to access a higher level computer resource. The fields corresponding to the most specific portion of the resource identifier are removed until the modified resource identifier proves to be a valid resource identifier which can access a computer resource.","The '324 patent treats all input determined to be invalid as an error or mistake without consideration to the benefits of intentionally receiving invalid input for the purpose of resource location. Though the '324 patent distinguishes a valid resource identifier from within an invalid resource identifier entered by the user, no consideration is given to further using the invalid portion of the resource identifier for other purposes such as navigation. The '324 patent treats the invalid identifier as if it was at one time valid.","A more recent feature called Smart Browsing is integrated into Netscape Navigator that uses Internet Keywords so users can streamline the use of URLs and get fast access to web sites using the browser's location field. Any single or multiword strings typed into the browser's location field that does not include a \u201c.\u201d are sent via HTTP to a server at \u201cnetscape.com\u201d. The keyword server pulls the string and compares it to several separate lists of keyword-URL pairs. If the keyword system finds a match, it redirects the user's browser to the URL of the keyword-URL pair. Failing a match against the lists, the user's browser is redirected to a Netscape Search page with the typed string as the search query. The \u201c.\u201d versus \u201c\u201c is a key factor in determining what services are used. Depending on context, the detection of only a \u201c.\u201d delimiter implies a domain name for name resolution services whereas the detection of only a \u201c\u201d delimiter implies a search request for directory services and the like.","The autosearch feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) is another example of an improvement to the location field of a web browser. The details of the autosearch feature is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,459 issued on Dec. 28, 1999 by Belfiore, et al., entitled, \u201cIntelligent automatic searching for resources in a distributed environment.\u201d The '459 patent specifies a mechanism for a computer system to automatically and intelligently determine what a user intended when the user entered text within the location field of a web browser. Often users improperly enter URLs or enter search terms in a user interface element that requires URLs. If the user enters text that is not a URL, the system may first try to construct a valid URL from the user-entered text. If a valid URL cannot be constructed, the browser then automatically formats a search engine query using the user-entered text and forwards the query to an Internet search engine.","In addition, the '459 patent specifies a template registry that categorizes the specific suitability of a plurality of search engines to locate web sites related to a determined meaning of the specified text. The template is an entry in the registry that includes replaceable characters that may be replaced with the processed text. An example template registry entry that causes the Yahoo! search engine to be called is \u201chttp:\/\/msie.yahoo.com\/autosearch?% s\u201d. The % s is filled in with information regarding the search terms.","RealNames Corporation provides a registry of registered keywords and phrases as an alternate means of resource location. In March 200, Microsoft in alliance with RealNames has configured MSIE AutoSearch feature to bypass DNS resolution and redirect input having only \u201c\u201c delimiters such as keywords and phrases to a RealNames resolver\/server in an attempt to find any registered keywords or phrases that match the search input to be used as an alternative navigational tool. If the Keyword has not been bought from a RealNames Registry or one of its Registrars, it is assumed that the user is searching instead of navigating and the input is further processed as a search request from the autosearch. There has never been any provision to perform a Keyword registration request or any identifier registration request from the autosearch. MSIE browser may redirect unresolvable input having only \u201c.\u201d delimiters to the autosearch feature, but is configured to prompt the client browser to display an error message. Such input has never been further processed by the autosearch or routed to another naming service provider for further processing.","U.S. patent application Ser.

The document focuses on the different steps that are taken after a user enters an IDN in the address bar of IE, up to when the relevant Web page is displayed in the user's browser. Though all input identifiers having only a \u201c.\u201d delimiter have only recently been configured to pass from the autosearch to a RealNames keyword resolver, the only further processing currently implemented is limited to that of IDN resolution only with the display of an error message for all other input.","An Internet draft provided in M.

The domain name system uses the domain \u201cin-addr.arpa\u201d to convert Internet addresses back to domain names. One way to view this is to say that \u201cin-addr.arpa\u201d forms the root of a separate hierarchy. This hierarchy has been made part of the main domain name hierarchy just for implementation convenience. While syntactically, \u201cin-addr.arpa\u201d is a second level domain (SLD), functionally it is a zero level domain (ZLD) in the same way as the \u201c.\u201d is a ZLD. A new ZLD is proposed for building the root of a new domain branch, and an encoding of the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646] into the limited character set of domain names.","An Internet draft provided in Mealling, et al, \u201cInformational RFC (Request for Comment) 2168: Resolution of Uniform Resource Identifiers using the Domain Name System\u201d, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), June 1997, http:\/\/www.faqs.org\/rfcs\/rfc2168.html, shows how a resolver discovery service (RDS) can be implemented by a new DNS Resource Record, NAPTR (Naming Authority PoinTeR), that provides rules for mapping parts of URIs to domain names. By changing the mapping rules, the host that is contacted to resolve a URI can change, resulting in a more robust URL handling over longer time periods, and form the foundation for URN resolution.","The \u201c.arpa\u201d domain has recently been designated to be used for Internet-infrastructure purposes. This TLD is managed by IANA in cooperation with the Internet technical community under the guidance of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB). More generally, this domain name undertakes a role as a limited use domain for Internet infrastructure applications, by providing a name root for the mapping of particular protocol values to names of service entities.","Another Internet draft provided in Mealling, \u201cURI Resolution using the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)\u201d, VeriSign, Inc., February 2001, \u201chttp:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-ietf-urn-uri-res-ddds-03.txt\u201d, provides a solution to allow for shortcutting for URN resolution. In the specification generic URI resolution starts by inserting rules for known URI schemes into the \u2018uri.arpa\u2019 registry, which serves as a ZLD. For the \u2018URN:\u2019 URI scheme, one of the rules found in \u2018uri.arpa\u2019 would be for the \u2018urn\u2019 URI scheme. This rule would simply delegate to the \u2018urn.arpa\u2019 zone which also serves as a ZLD for additional NAPTRs based on the URN namespace. URNs can now serve as a new domain branch by appending these new ZLDs to perform DNS resolution from a URN.","A \u201ccard.arpa\u201d ZLD is proposed in D.

Falstrom, \u201cInformational RFC (Request for Comment) 2916: E.164 number and DNS\u201d, Cisco Systems Inc., September 2000, \u201chttp:\/\/www.faqs.org\/rfcs\/rfc2916.html\u201d by showing how DNS can be used for identifying available services connected to a single E.164 phone number. Through transformation of E.164 numbers (ENUM) into DNS names and the use of existing DNS services like delegation through NS records, and use of NAPTR records in DNS, available services for a specific domain name can be discovered in a decentralized way with distributed management of the different levels in the lookup process. The domain \u201ce164.arpa\u201d, which serves as a ZLD is being populated in order to provide the infrastructure in DNS for storage of E.164 numbers.","For example, the E.164 number \u201c+1-216-555-1212\u201d can be translated into the \u201c2.1.2.1.5.5.5.6.1.2.1.e164.arpa\u201d domain having a zone that includes NAPTR resource records to help determine which resource to access in response to the ENUM request, however it remains the onus of industry to adapt how, where, and when this transformation takes place. Currently, there are no known tools to adapt the web browser or similar network navigation device to be ENUM enabled. Though the E.164 identifier holds great promise, the expression of the identifier is based on an international standard that may be awkward and unintuitive for quick adaptation by the public. Similar identifiers that represent ENUM may be adapted by the public more readily. There has been evidence over the years of a quicker adoption to informally express a phone number in a syntax similar to an IP address such as \u201c216.555.1212\u201d, for example.","Identifiers may exist across multiple namespaces, all with different ownership and rules, and different naming authorities. As shown, there is a recent convergence of attempting to map identifiers across multiple namespaces to access network resources via the DNS. The most common technique for mapping such identifiers is to automatically and transparently transform the identifier in a user's applications before a DNS query is sent. This method does not make any change to the DNS nor require separate DNS name servers. Other examples are proposals which have suggested that modifications are made to the DNS servers to accommodate international domain names, for example. While the proposed solution could work, it requires major changes to the Internet as it exists today. Domain name servers around the globe, which number in the hundreds of thousands, would have to be changed or updated.","An emerging economy of names has created a politically controlled TLD space due to the technical constraint of the DNS having a single authoritative root. Though alternative roots have surfaced to provide alternative TLDs, such services are criticized by supporters of the single root that such implementations disrupt DNS stability and fragment the Internet. However, the same critics encourage competition under the assumption that all such competition will inevitably threaten the stability of the DNS. There has long been an unfulfilled need for processing domain names having TLDs that are not resolvable by a single authoritative public root. Though alternative root servers have been deployed to recognize alternative TLDs, there has been little incentive by industry to move in this direction for concern that using such domain names would confuse the public, fragment the Internet, etc. Now that conventional namespace solutions have been traversed and exhausted, industry is only first beginning to attempt and expand domain namespace by offering proposed solutions with identifiers having only the \u201c.\u201d delimiter. It is an object of the present invention to provide a way to use \u201c.anything\u201d in any language without using alternative roots and without fragmenting the single, authoritative root.","Due to the perceived shortage of TLDs, the struggle to add new TLDs has enabled industry to overlook solutions for extending the use of the current domain name space. Such art clearly demonstrates that there is a need for a system to foster better use of domain name space.","Accordingly, in light of the above, there is a strong need in the art for a system and method for enhancing how domain name space can be more extensively used on a network such as the Internet.","The present invention provides know-how for new and creative purchasing strategies of domain names from countries around the globe. The invention enables users to create and distribute through at least one media source indicia such as a fictitious domain name (FDN) having a Top Level Domain Alias (TLDA) or a fictitious multilingual domain name (FMDN) having a Multilingual Top Level Domain Alias (MTLDA) for use in advertising in connection with a valid URI that can be calculated and\/or generated from such indicia. The present invention takes advantage of the reverse hierarchy of the DNS to create a mapping between trademarks and domain names. The invention enables the creative use of FDNs and FMDNs to emulate real domain names (RDNs). The present invention helps a user to enter less input while navigating online information more precisely in less steps. The invention enables a domain name holder such as an entity or individual to license subdomains for redirection or storage. The present invention allows the possibility for unlikely parties to exchange commerce through licensing and\/or partnering.","The present invention serves as a control point for an entity to track demographics, accounting data, or display targeted advertising to a user. The invention measures response rate per media to determine market share and effectiveness of targeted advertising. The present invention assures that the tracking of all TLDA redirection activity is logged and accounted for particularly when it pertains to the distribution of revenues to all parties involved. The invention does not have to rely upon any kind of translation database or registry to a resolvable URI from a FDN.","The present invention allows all of domain name space to be used instead of using only real domain name or valid domain name space. The invention provides a class of FDNs called Real MDNs (RMDNs) and FMDNs. The present invention uses a class of FDNs called Numerical Domain Names (NDNs) to process ENUM, SSN, ISBN, UPC, and credit card FDN identifiers through the DNS. The invention enables for quicker adaptation of the ENUM standard by enabling incomplete ENUM FDNs to be received to save time processing an E.164 identifier. The present invention enables ISBN and UPC FDNs in particular to be redirected to vertical e-commerce marketplace allowing FDNs to be used for ordering books, goods, and products, etc. The invention provides new use by enabling the location field of a network navigation device to also function as a calculator.","The present invention takes advantage of extending the use of postal and zip codes for locating resources. The present invention allows for port aliasing that is used for TLD redirection and querying of identifiers and URNs. The invention allows a registrant to register in any combination, a resolvable TLD, a method of resolution including a template, a PUR1as a suffix, prefix or both, a search string, an address corresponding to a prefix or suffix delimiter, or component data for the purpose of generating a resolvable URI from a TLDA. The present invention eliminates the extra step of accessing a resource and then searching from such resource by processing a TLDA as a search request in the form \u201cSLD.TLDA\u201d to simultaneously access and search the resource. The invention further allows for immediate personalized results based on providing geographic or other identifiers as the TLDA search term. The present invention provides URI redirection from HLDs and SLDs to vertical market directory services, which can be endorsed, branded, and sponsored by organizations that serve such markets. The invention allows for new information spaces to be created as a result of reorganizing how TLDA name space is distributed to SLD holders.","The present invention provides a definable ranking or hierarchy by enabling registrants to favor resolution methods that may provide a strategic buying advantage or gain broader appeal for the distribution of the registered name as indicia\/trademark. The invention allows SLD holders across different TLDs to register TLDA names and emulate a shared SLD name space reducing the likelihood of trademark disputes. The present invention allows for the automatic reception of indicia such as FDNs via print or machine readable code by any means such as but not limited to optical and magnetic data reading input devices to process such indicia and generate at least one valid URI for accessing resources in a network. The invention enables generated available TLDA names to be temporarily reserved which are targeted and personalized for distribution to potential users based on having some knowledge of geographic, demographic, or psychographic data about such potential users. The present invention enables query results to be used as survey data to promote statistics of what TLDAs may become prospective TLDs in the future, sales leads to contact companies and provide personalized demonstration of how TLDA names can be used for advertising, branding, market segmentation, and product differentiation.","The invention provides a distributed cache for minimizing bandwidth of server requests across the backbone of the Internet. The present invention allows for the extended use of registered names by submitting the registered TLDA name on behalf of the registrant if so desired to reserve such a name at a future date for newly approved TLDs of the DNS. The invention can use the MSIE autosearch feature for the purposes of FDN processing either before and\/or after a DNS query in addition to the purpose of searching in lieu of making browser modifications resulting in the savings of distribution costs for software updates.","The present invention enables fictitious domain name resolution either before, during, and\/or after a DNS query. The invention enables all identifiers having a TLDA resolvable through the DNS. The present invention enables any namespace to be transformed into a FDN for DNS resolution processing including reiterative and\/or recursive identifier transformations across multiple namespaces. The present invention enables the smallest possible modification to the DNS to achieve immediate ubiquity to FDN usage on the Internet without having to change MSIE autosearch or add new client resolvers. The invention enables the single authoritative root to process all HLDs as resolvable enabling the DNS to become all inclusive leaving alternative roots no choice but to create a system of virtually exclusive roots instead of VIRs. The present invention enables a new infrastructure domain such as \u201ctlda.arpa\u201d to be used as a Primary Virtual Zero Level Domain (PVZLD) for brokering FDN requests across multiple namespaces to namespace providers who manage Secondary Virtual Zero Level Domains (SVZLD).","In general, in accordance with the present invention a method includes the steps of determining that an identifier includes a fictitious domain name (FDN) and requesting a network resource from at least a portion of the identifier.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention a method for processing a network resource from a first identifier having an unresolvable domain name includes the steps of determining whether the domain name is fictitious, processing a registration request from at least a

claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail one or more illustrative aspects of the invention, such being indicative, however, of but one or a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a ","b":["100","110","120","130","100","110","120","130","130","110","120","110","130","110","130","116","130","130"]},"The client computers  may be any network access apparatus including hand held devices, palmtop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook, laptop, portable computers, desktop PCs, workstations, and\/or larger\/smaller computer systems. It is noted that the network access apparatus  may have a variety of forms, including but not limited to, a general purpose computer, a network computer, a network navigation device, a network television, an internet television, a set top box, a web-enabled telephone, an internet appliance, a portable wireless device, a television receiver, a game player, a video recorder, and\/or an audio component, for example.","Each client  typically includes one or more processors , memories , and input\/output devices . An input device may be any suitable device for the user to give input to client computer ; for example: a keyboard, a 10-key pad, a telephone key pad, a light pen or any pen pointing device, a touchscreen, a button, a dial, a joystick, a steering wheel, a foot pedal, a mouse, a trackball, an optical or magnetic recognition unit such as a bar code or magnetic swipe reader, a voice or speech recognition unit, a remote control attached via cable or wireless link to a game set, television, or cable box. A data glove, an eye-tracking device, or any MIDI device may also be used. A display device may be any suitable output device, such as a display screen, text-to-speech converter, printer, plotter, fax, television set, or audio player. Although the input device is typically separate from the display device, they could be combined; for example: a display with an integrated touchscreen, a display with an integrated keyboard, or a speech-recognition unit combined with a text-to-speech converter.","The servers  may be similarly configured. However, in many instances server sites  include many computers, perhaps connected by a separate private network. In fact, the network  may include hundreds of thousands of individual networks of computers. One aspect of the present invention includes a specific type of server system  called a DNS server system \u2032 which stores in memory a DNS database  having DNS records that translate domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. The DNS server system \u2032 is connected  to a network .","DNS is a distributed database  that holds mapping information in resource records. The DNS provides these resource records (from zone files) in response to queries it receives from programs called resolvers on individual computers throughout the Internet. The distributed database  is implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers (name servers) \u2032 and an application-layer protocol that allows hosts and name servers to communicate in order to provide the translation service. Name servers \u2032 are usually UNIX machines running BIND software. In order to deal with an issue of scale of the Internet, the DNS uses a large number of name servers \u2032, organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world. No single name server \u2032 has all of the mappings  (zone files) for all of the hosts in the Internet. Instead, the mappings  are distributed across many name servers \u2032.","Although the client computers  are shown separate from the server computers , it should be understood that a single computer can perform the client and server roles. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the computer environment  shown in is intended to be merely illustrative. The present invention may also be practiced in other computing environments. For example, the present invention may be practiced in multiple processor environments wherein the client computer includes multiple processors. Moreover, the client computer need not include all of the input\/output devices as discussed above and may also include additional input\/output devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be practiced with Intranets and more generally in distributed environments in which a client computer requests resources from a server computer.","During operation of the distributed system , users of the clients  may desire to access information records  stored by the servers  while utilizing, for example, the Web. The records of information  can be in the form of Web pages . The pages  may be data records including as content plain textual information, or more complex digitally encoded multimedia content, such as software programs, graphics, audio signals, videos, and so forth. It should be understood that although this description focuses on locating information on the World-Wide-Web, the system may also be used for locating information via other wide or local area networks (WANs and LANs), or information stored in a single computer using other communications protocols.","The clients  may execute Web browser programs , such as Netscape Navigator or MSIE to locate the pages or records . The browser programs  enable users to enter addresses of specific Web pages  to be retrieved. Typically, the address of a Web page is specified as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or more specifically as a URL. In addition, when a page has been retrieved, the browser programs  may provide access to other pages or records by \u201cclicking\u201d on hyperlinks (or links) to previously retrieved Web pages. Such links may provide an automated way to enter the URL of another page, and to retrieve that page.","A client of the DNS is called a resolver . Resolvers  are typically located in the application layer of the networking software of each TCP\/IP capable machine. Users typically do not interact directly with the resolver . Resolvers  query the DNS by directing queries at name servers, which contain parts of the distributed database that is accessed by using the DNS protocols to translate domain names into IP addresses needed for transmission of information across the network. DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols\u2014including HTTP, SMTP and FTP\u2014to translate user-supplied domain names to IP addresses. When a browser program  (e.g., an HTTP client), running on a user's machine, requests a URL having a resolvable domain name, in order for the user's machine to be able to send an HTTP request message to a server , the user's machine must obtain the IP address of the domain name. The user machine then runs the resolver  (DNS client) on the client-side of the DNS application. The browser  extracts the domain name from the URL and passes the domain name to the resolver  on the client-side of the DNS application. As part of a DNS query message, the DNS client  sends the domain name to a DNS server system \u2032 connected to the Internet. The DNS client  eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the domain name. The browser then opens a TCP connection  to the HTTP server process  located at the IP address.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b ","b":["112","112","132","132","134","132","134","136","132","138","112","132","140","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"c ","b":["146","144","144","148","110","120","146","122","150","152","154","156","158","160","162","164","166","165","168","170","172","174","176","178","122"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"d ","b":["146","144","144","148","110","120","146","122","180","181","182","183","184","185","186","187","188","189","190","191","192","193","194","122","168","170","172","154","154"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a ","b":["204","206","208","206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0167"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b ","b":["110","134","112","210","212","206","210","214","210","210","218","208","214","226","228","230"]},"When input includes a valid IP address (step ) or when input includes a valid domain name (step ), it may then be further determined in step  whether input  includes a valid URI. If there is no valid URI, then a valid URI may be generated in step  from input . For instance, if a scheme\/protocol is missing, the web browser may add the prefix \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d to the text or another scheme prefix. A valid URI includes either a valid IP address or a real domain name (RDN). A RDN is a valid domain name having a resolvable TLD. After performing input validity tests, the steps of domain name resolvability may be performed. When a network resource from a received (step ) or generated (step ) valid URI is determined accessible in step , then results, if any, may then be provided in step . However, when a network resource corresponding to a URI is determined not accessible in step , an error message may be displayed in step .","One example of such a prior art system is when a domain name (e.g., \u201cexample.com\u201d) is received from a network navigation device having a search function such as the location field  of a web browser program  like the MSIE browser. The MSIE browser generates a URI (e.g., \u201chttp:\/\/www.example.com\u201d) from the domain name. If the domain name is resolvable (e.g., the domain name is successfully translated into its corresponding IP address) then the web browser  attempts to access content from a web server  corresponding to the URI. If the domain name is not resolvable, then input  may be passed and the following URI is generated:","\u201chttp:\/\/auto.search.msn.com\/response.asp?MT=example.com&srch=3&prov=&utf8\u201d","The \u201c.\u201d is a delimiter of the DNS system whereas the \u201c\u201c is a delimiter of plain text language. When a keyword search is provided as input, (e.g., \u201csearch example\u201d) it may be determined that DNS name resolution is unnecessary and input  may be immediately redirected to the Microsoft Network (MSN) AutoSearch feature. In effect, all input that can not be successfully resolved\/located\/accessed may be redirected to the server at \u201cauto.search.msn.com\u201d and processed accordingly as either an error message or search request. The Netscape Navigator browser program does not provide additional processing when a domain name is not resolvable, and instead, displays the following error message: \u201cBrowser is unable to locate the server: example.com The server does not have a DNS entry.

A HLD that is determined not resolvable is referred to as a Top Level Domain Alias (TLDA) whereas a resolvable HLD is referred to as a Top Level Domain (TLD). A TLD\/HLD is resolvable when such a domain is included in the single authoritative root of the DNS. This is to be distinguished from alternative TLDs and those TLDs considered resolvable in an alternative root or virtual inclusive root and the like. Of course as reflected in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/125,531 filed Mar. 22, 1999 and its corresponding conversion patent application, alias detection is by no means limited to HLDs but is applicable across any domain level. For instance, a non-resolvable SLD is called a SLDA and a non-resolvable 3LD is called a 3LDA and so on.","RFC 1035 compliant domain names also called valid domain names (VDNs) offered by traditional domain name registries are restricted to a limited 7 bit ASCII character set: A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9, and hyphen. In addition, the maximum character length of any domain level is 63 octets\/characters. Any domain name that is not valid (e.g., SLD is greater than 63 characters, characters other than that of A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9, and hyphen, and\/or non-ASCII character sets used to represent multilingual\/international domain names) or any domain name having a domain alias such as a TLDA is called a fictitious domain name (FDN). For example, a VDN having a TLDA is a FDN. FDN may also be called an imaginary domain name (iDN) whereas a VDN having a resolvable TLD may also be called a real domain name (RDN).","A FDN may also be called a domain name alias (DNA), partial domain name (PDN), or relative domain name (rDN). Domain names that include at least one character\/symbol from any character set other than a 7-bit ASCII set are FDNs that can more specifically be called multilingual domain names (MDNs) or international\/internationalized domain names (IDNs). MDNs\/IDNs include either a resolvable TLD or a representation of a resolvable TLD. This class of TLDs are called Multilingual TLDs (MTLDs) or International TLDs (ITLDs). Furthermore MDNs\/IDNs can also be referred to as a real MDN (RMDN) or real IDN (RIDN) respectively. As will be shown MDNs\/IDNs may not be able to translate\/canonically map to a real domain name in one step and may first transform into a FDN and then a RDN. For instance, a MDN can have a Multilingual TLDA (MTLDA), which is a domain that maps to a TLDA instead of a TLD. Such MDNs and IDNs are called Fictitious MDNs (FMDNs) and Fictitious IDNs (FIDNs) respectively.","Though a RMDN\/RIDN is a specific class of FDN, to date, the HLD of a RMDN\/RIDN has been limited to the set of resolvable TLDs or the representation of the set of resolvable TLDs in non-ASCII character sets. There is yet a more specific class of FDNs called Hybrid Domain Names (HDNs). HDNs have a mixture of languages or character sets within a single domain name. For instance, the SLD of a domain name comprises a non-ASCII character set but includes an ASCII gTLD or ccTLD such as the representation of some MDNs\/IDNs. A HDN includes a non-ASCII character in at least one domain level and the limited 7-bit ASCII characters in at least one other domain level.","Domain level is a term of reference with respect to differentiating concatenated labels of a FDN or FMDN from one another and does not mean that FDNs or FMDNs are limited to having a hierarchical structure. In fact, in most cases FDNs and FMDNs are flat with no hierarchy or structure. FDNs and FMDNs can also be called fictitious domain identifiers (FDIs) and when applied to the DNS are represented by a character string having at least one delimiter such as the \u201c.\u201d delimiter. A URN, which is a resource name identifier, mayor may not be hierarchical and is usually represented by a character string having at least one delimiter such as the \u201c:\u201d delimiter. In most cases, a URN can be represented by a FDN, enabling name resolution through the DNS, autosearch feature, or keyword resolver.","For the purposes of illustration the use of TLDs, further includes the plurality of domains that do not represent a hostname. For instance, there are Generic Second Level Domains (gSLDs) that are lower level to ccTLDs (e.g., \u201c.com.au\u201d, \u201c.net.au\u201d are generic zones within the Australian domain) and for the purposes of simplifying discussion are considered TLDs. For example, the input \u201cexample.44106.us\u201d is received and it is determined that \u201c.us\u201d is resolvable. The list of resolvable TLDs further includes state level subdomains (e.g., \u201c.oh.us\u201d, \u201c.ca.us\u201d, \u201c.ny.us\u201d etc.) to assure ccTLD resolvability. Therefore when a ccTLD such as II.USII is detected, it may further be determined whether \u201c.44106\u201d is resolvable with respect to \u201c.us\u201d where the HLD in this case is defined as \u201c.44106.us\u201d and upon lookup determined to be not resolvable and therefore processed as a TLDA.","Input such as text or a character string may be comprised of at least one symbol having at least one domain. In most cases, the character string is comprised of a plurality of symbols separated by at least one delimited symbol. Delimiters are determined from a list of reserved symbols of a given character set. The character set is comprised of a symbol space used to generate at least one character string. A single character set such as UNICODE may represent many character sets and\/or many languages. The delimiter is what creates a plurality of domains. Each domain comprises at least one symbol. The minimum length of a character string having a plurality of domains is three.","Different reserved symbols may be used as equivalents for generating different character strings that yield the same destination (e.g., A.B=A B=A\/B=A!B, etc.). A character string having only one domain most commonly functions as a label or search term (e.g., \u201ca\u201d or \u201capple\u201d etc.), however a character string having a plurality of domains functions as a domain name (e.g., \u201ca.com\u201d or \u201csunday.comics\u201d). In some cases, the character string is also equivalent to a URI (e.g., \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/index.htm\u201d) or a domain name with a prefix delimiter (e.g., \u201c$name.game\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0184"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["e ","e "],"b":["210","210","210","266","265","210","267","269","268","267","270","274","272","270","276","280","278","276","282","210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0185"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"f ","b":["284","285","284","286","285","284","286","287","288","289","290","291","292","293","294","295","296","297","298","299"]},"Though not illustrated in this top level block diagram, VDNs and FDNs are by no means mutually exclusive spaces.

In most cases, a selected resolvable TLD is combined with a fictitious domain name having a TLDA or a portion thereof. For instance, the method of recursive truncation (discussed in conjunction with ) may be used to generate the valid URI, \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\u201d from the input \u201cunited.states\u201d where \u201c.states\u201d is a TLDA and \u201c.st\u201d (the truncation of \u201c.states\u201d) is a resolvable ccTLD (abbreviation for the country Sao Tome and Principe).","To generate a new URI, the parsed components (as illustrated in ) may be concatenated with a resolvable TLD. For example a fictitious URI (FUR1) such as \u201chttp:\/\/united.states\u201d is parsed, where \u201chttp\u201d is the scheme , there is no path  or port , the hostname  is \u201cunited\u201d, and the HLD  is \u201cstates\u201d. The HLD is determined in step  to be a TLDA, which is then modified by recursive truncation to yield the resolvable TLD \u201cst\u201d. The parsed components; scheme , hostname , and TLD may then be concatenated with the \u201c.\u201d delimiter to generate in step  a new URI\u201chttp:\/\/united.st\u201d. Another example, \u201chttp:\/\/united.stores\u201dwould also yield \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\u201d. Truncation enables a correspondence between abbreviations and names or words. This method yields know-how for new and creative purchasing strategies of domain names from countries around the globe.","When a fictitious telephone number such as \u20181-800-AUTOMOBILE\u2019 is advertised and a telephone used as a means to contact the advertiser, the telephone will connect the call when the caller \u2018dials\u2019 1-800-AUTOMOB regardless whether the caller has finished dialing the word AUTOMOBILE. Until now, there is no such method, device, or system to allow for the interpretation of fictitious URIs or domain names to be used as indicia in a similar manner. Recursive truncation becomes an inventive step to allow the location field  of a web browser  or command line of a device to function in the analogous manner of \u2018dialing\u2019 a telephone.","Though \u201c\u201c and united.states\u201cunited.stores\u201d etc. may be resolved as \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\u201d there are other methods of URI generation to create uniqueness from the use of a TLDA. For instance, the parsed components; scheme, TLDA, hostname, and TLD may be concatenated to generate \u201chttp:\/\/states.united.st\u201d or \u201chttp:\/\/stores.united.st\u201d etc. By rotating the TLDA from the HLD to the lowest level domain (LLD) uniqueness can be mapped. Other methods of concatenation may be used by those skilled in the art of string manipulation to generate URIs such as \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\/states\u201d or \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\/ates\u201d to provide an infinite one-to-one mapping between a TLDA and a resolvable URI. Though a plurality of URIs may be generated, the URIs generally have in common the same SLD which is assigned to a unique entity such as a corporation or individual. Therefore the domain name holder of \u201cunited.st\u201d may use redundancy to create uniqueness regardless of which generated URI is used. For instance, \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\u201d, \u201chttp:\/\/states.united.st\u201d, \u201chttp:\/\/united.st\/ates\u201d etc. may all be redirected to another URI such as \u201chttp:\/\/www.anywhere.com\u201d to create a unique destination for the fictitious domain name \u201cunited.states\u201d. Since generated URIs are calculated from fictitious domain names this invention does not have to rely upon any kind of database or registry to make such conversion from fictitious domain name to valid URI.","Another example is the resolution of a numerical TLDA. For instance, an entity who has registered the domain name \u201c212.com\u201d may create subdomains to yield domain names such as \u201c555.1212.com\u201d or \u201c800.555.1212.com\u201d. By so doing, the entity may lease out server space to subscribers who would like to associate their telephone number with a URI. There are roughly 200 area codes in the U.S., within each area code on average are about 10 prefixes which yields a targeted marketing list for an entity to call 2,000 telephone numbers to offer such services. Now consider received input such as the NDN \u201c1.800.555.1212\u201d. The input is parsed and it is determined that \u201c1212\u201d is a TLDA which is then rotated and replaced with a default TLD yielding \u201c212.1.800.555.com\u201d. Under this new system, an entity who has registered the domain name \u201c555.com\u201d can in effect yield a targeted marketing list of 10,000 numbers per area code for the entity to call 2,000,000 telephone numbers to offer such services. The use of TLDA rotation yields a shorter input creating a larger market group by a factor of 1,000.","A URI as a data structure has within it the concatenation of two separate name spaces. The first is the DNS which represents a hierarchical string of domains separated by the \u201c.\u201d delimiter which is read from right to left. The second is a path which represents a hierarchical string of directories separated by the \u201c\/\u201d delimiter which is read from left to right (e.g., http:\/\/third.second.first.com\/first\/second\/third\/file.html). The \u201c.\u201d is not a delimiter in the directory path name space but rather functions as a valid label character. For instance, \u201chttp:\/\/example.company\u201d does not include a RDN making a network resource corresponding to the URI in accessible, but \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/example.company\/index.htm\u201d is a valid URI. This fact enables further utilization of TLDA redirection. Input determined to have a TLDA, may all be redirected to the same domain name\/web server.","When input is of the form \u201cSLD.TLDA\u201d, a new domain name may be generated by adding a predetermined or registered RDN to yield results, for example, in the form of \u201cSLD.TLDA.RDN\u201d, \u201cRDN\/SLD.TLDA\u201d, \u201cRDN\/TLDA\/SLD\u201d, and \u201cRDN\/SLD\/TLDA\u201d. For instance, \u201ctop.stories\u201d may be redirected to \u201chttp:\/\/tlda.com\/top.stories\/index.htm\u201d (of the form \u201cRDN\/SLD.TLDA\u201d) which may be further redirected to \u201chttp:\/\/stories.top.com\/index.htm\u201d which may yet be further redirected to a final destination of \u201chttp:\/\/anywhere.com\u201d. By centralizing all TLDA requests to the same domain name\/web server assures that the tracking of all TLDA redirection activity is logged and accounted for, particularly when it pertains to the distribution of revenues to all parties involved. Another example of centralizing all TLDA requests to the same domain name is by redirecting \u201ctop.stories\u201d to \u201chttp:\/\/top.stories.tlda.com\u201d (of the form \u201cSLD.TLDA.RDN\u201d) or \u201chttp:\/\/tlda.com\/stories\/top\u201d (of the form \u201cRDN\/TLDA\/SLD\u201d).","With the exception of the DNS, most naming systems are interpreted from left to right. A telephone number, a zip code, an IP address, an odometer, and a directory path to name a few, are all data structures that represent descending levels of hierarchy. Trademarks can be considered a hierarchical system that is interpreted from left to right. Trademarks are used to identify a specific brand of product or service. The first part of the name specifies a particular company's version of a product or service. The second part of the name specifies the kind of product or service (e.g., AMAZON Books, KINKO'S Copies, BAYER Aspirin, IVORY soap etc.).","The domain name holder of \u201cexample.com\u201d may further differentiate products and services at the \u201cexample.com\u201d web site. For instance, \u201cnews at the \u201cexample.com\u201d web site may be published at the URI \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/news\u201d or published at the URI \u201chttp:\/\/news.example.com\u201d. In the latter, the web browser accesses a subdomain called \u201cnews\u201d from the web server, \u201cexample.com\u201d. The subdomain \u201cnews\u201d may be another server that is connected to and can only be accessed through \u201cexample.com\u201d. In general, most categories, products, and services have been independently coordinated from computer to computer in a similar manner, but yet it remains non-intuitive for a user to navigate directly to such a desired product or service. Typically, a user will first access the \u201cexample.com\u201d web site and then click on a hyperlink called \u201cnews\u201d requiring the user to take two steps to obtain desired results.","Advantage can be taken of the reverse hierarchy of the DNS to create a correspondence or mapping between trademarks and domain names. A RDN may take the form of \u201cSLD.TLD\u201d such as \u201cyahoo.com\u201d. From prior examples it is shown that the FDN of the form \u201cSLD.TLDA\u201d such as \u201cyahoo.mail\u201d (has 10 characters) is generated from the RDN of the form \u201cTLDA.SLD.TLD\u201d such as \u201cmail.yahoo.com\u201d (has 14 characters). This is the web address for accessing YAHOO mail. By using (as a trademark) the FDN \u201cyahoo.mail\u201d instead, a user can intuitively navigate (to a specific part of a web site) directly to a desired (result) product or service in one step (rather than two steps), while inputting 4 less characters. By using this system, companies that have invested in branding their \u201c.com\u201d identity can now advertise, for example, indicia such as \u201cmicrosoft.office\u201d (as a trademark), in addition to, \u201cmicrosoft.com\u201d for name branding, product differentiation, and helping customers streamline access to information.","Because FDNs are not web addresses but rather fictitious indicia, unlike RDNs, FDNs may be trademarked enabling a method for potentially increasing the registration of trademarks. For example, individuals and organizations may register a trade or service mark on a state, federal, or country level in the form of SLD.TLDA to gain first use rights of a FDN. Due to the emergence of WAP (wireless application protocol), FDNs (as trademarks) will become increasingly useful to the portable wireless device market. Users of hand-held network access devices (e.g., palm pilot, phone browser, pager, etc.) will benefit by entering less input while navigating information more precisely in less steps.","Now consider a company that owns the trademark AMAZON Bread.

With over twenty million \u201c.com\u201d registrations, it in effect creates the possibility for unlikely parties to exchange commerce through licensing or partnering.","There is yet another method of URI generation to consider. Take the \u201cSLD.TLDA\u201d, \u201ctop.stories\u201d and calculate from it a domain name to yield the form of \u201cSLD.TLDA.TLD\u201d, \u201ctop.stories.com\u201d. An issue is created with respect to the TLDA rotation method, which yields \u201cstories.top.com\u201d. Both URI generation methods allow for the domain name holders of \u201ctop.com\u201d and \u201cstories.com\u201d to form a cooperation by using both \u201cstories.top.com\u201d and \u201ctop.stories.com\u201d to redirect to the same web address. By so doing, uniqueness of resolution is assured adding value to all parties involved.","Currently, when a word such as \u201ctop\u201d is entered in the location field  of any web browser, the absence of a TLD is detected by the browser and a default TLD is concatenated to yield \u201chttp:\/\/top.com\u201d. However, when only part of a 3LD (e.g., \u201ctop.stories.com\u201d) is entered such as \u201ctop.stories\u201d, there are no such browsers or devices that have the ability to recognize the absence of a TLD. This indicates that such browsers or devices assume that \u201cstories\u201d is a TLD without confirming its resolvability, before performing a resource location request, and in turn, errors upon resolution. This fact demonstrates that no such inventive step for determining HLD resolvability yet exists (prior to DNS resolution) and has remain overlooked. There has not yet been a need to determine HLD resolvability because virtually all domain names registered to date have only two domain levels. Adding a TLD to create a domain name having a 3LD still remains unobvious to those skilled in the art. Only recently, as business partnerships and portal sites have grown, 3LDs are becoming more commonly used as a distinct address such as \u201cinfoseek.go.com\u201d or \u201chotbot.lycos.com\u201d.

The content  accessed from a network resource corresponding to the URI may be displayed in the second frame  of the displayed  web page. The URI having a TLDA is generated by the CGI script  and displayed in the title bar  of the displayed  web page and the web based location field  of the first frame may either persist by displaying input  or cleared out for entering the next web address. Furthermore, the first frame may further include a hyperlink  to a TLDA directory service and related context sensitive advertising  retrieved from an advertising cache  as will be discussed.","The displayed  web page may include an HTML <META> tag as a means to further redirect to another URI after a specified period of time to allow for comprehension of content, accounting or statistical processing on the server side, and to display advertising wherein the content of such advertisements  may be context sensitive with respect to the TLDA name. For instance, \u201csunday.comics\u201d is entered and resolved through the TLDA Rotation method yielding \u201chttp:\/\/comics.sunday.com\u201d. There is included in the page source a <META> tag with a ten second delay during which time an advertisement may be retrieved from an advertising cache  and displayed for MARVEL comics before the page is redirected to another web address.

Consider the input \u201cfree.love\u201d, \u201c.lo\u201d is not a resolvable ccTLD, therefore TLD calculation would not apply, yielding a default or selected TLD (e.g., \u201c.com\u201d) to generate \u201chttp:\/\/free.com\/love\u201d as one outcome. There are 676 two-letter permutations (e.g., the set [aa . . . zz]) whereas there are only 243 ccTLDs creating a discrepancy for the application of TLDAs allowing only 36% of words to be used as TLDAs that can be resolved through the method of recursive truncation. A solution to allow unlimited usage of TLDAs is to include the use of port aliasing for TLD redirection. An extension of the above example would process the input of the form \u201cSLD.TLDA:TLD\u201d to yield a result of the form \u201cSLD.TLD\/TLDA\u201d or \u201cTLDA.SLD.TLD\u201d (e.g., \u201cfree.love:to\u201d yields http:\/\/free.to\/love or \u201chttp:\/\/love.free.to\u201d).","If a TLD can not be generated from the port (step ) or through recursive truncation (step ) then a TLD may be selected in step .

First it is determined in step  whether the zip code TLDA is processed as a search request by retrieving the status of the postal code feature  from the configuration settings . When the zip code TLDA is processed as a search request, a valid URI may be generated in step  by including the zip code TLDA as a query.

For instance, \u201cexample.44116\u201d is entered as input and yields the resulting URI \u201chttp:\/\/example.rockyriver.oh.us\u201d. There are many zip codes that match a city and many cities that match a zip code. Because of this it is possible to yield many URIs from input thus creating a one to many correspondence between input and URI. illustrates the data structure of a zip code database that includes a logical field labeled \u201cdefault\u201d which is one technique used (as discussed in conjunction with ) to assure uniqueness of URI generation assuring a one to one correspondence between zip code and city.","The zip code database may be part of a larger more generalized postal code database.

The name is used as a send or return address indicia on mail and parcel either in print or as machine readable code. This allows recipients to respond electronically and allows postal workers to more quickly route materials to their destination. The indicia creates a way to easily connect an email address to a physical location to be used for sending billing information without disclosing a full mailing address.

For instance, protocol, hostname (including all domains and subdomains), port, path, query, or fragment of a URI are regarded as data elements used as component data for generating a resolvable URI. Other data components (not shown) may include such as Namespace ID, namespace provider, identifier resolver service , delimiters mappings, mapping rules, etc. All combinations for concatenating component data that does not yield a full URI is referred to as a Partial Uniform Resource Identifier (PURI). The same applies for Partial Uniform Resource Locators (PURLs) and other similar resources.","Since there are numerous combinations of PURIs within a given URI, each combination may be assigned a unique resolution\/generation\/calculation\/construction method for determining how to arrange the individual data elements of the component data to form a PURI. A set of rules for is in operative association for each resolution method. Such rules (not shown) may include URN namespace ID, resolver provider, namespace provider, naming service provider, one or more identifiers from another namespace, delimiter mappings, component data ordering, functions, procedures, recursive resolution, and any other technique used to construct a FDN, RDN, and\/or URI. Using the registry  or name translation database  for retrieving a registered resolvable TLD  is only one resolution method. TLDA truncation, TLDA rotation, TLDA path, delimit TLDA, or ignore TLDA etc. as discussed earlier are examples of other methods. In fact, any method including multi-resolution methods, port and recursive resolution, or zip code resolution of ZIPNAMES\u2122 may be used as a method of identifier resolution\/calculation\/generation\/construction of the present invention.","Each resolution method may be assigned a method number\/template number (templates can be selected and specified as will be discussed) which further corresponds to a set of heuristics or rules such as a database of procedure calls that specify a function with the associated parameters such as component data or other fields in the name translation database that are used for generating a resolvable URI from a registered name. For example, method number \u201c\u201d may call the TLDA Path procedure which uses a registered resolvable TLD as its only parameter. Method number \u201c\u201d may call the TLDA rotation procedure and so forth. As noted, the particular selection and arrangement of component data may be assigned a method number with a corresponding procedure call and parameters that are used for URI generation.","For instance, method number \u201c\u201d may equal the retrieval of scheme and port information only to be combined with the fictitious domain name in question to calculate and generate a valid URI whereas method number \u201c\u201d may equal the retrieval of port, path, and TLD information for URI generation. Furthermore, resolution methods may also be assigned to naming service providers and namespace providers such as vendors that maintain a combination of registries and\/or resolvers  in other name spaces or alternative naming systems (e.g., method number \u201c\u201d may represent the retrieval of a registered name from Netword's registry). In effect, registry usually called the TLDA registry  can serve as a registry about other registries and can also be called a Metaregistry.","Another resolution method is using the TLDA as a query to call a procedure and have the TLDA function as a search request or variable:","\u201ctop.stories\u201d=\u201chttp:\/\/top.st\/index.cgi?tlda=stories\u201d","Though a URI may be generated from the TLDA search method by default without a translation database, a more versatile approach for processing a TLDA as a search request is to allow a registrant to specify a search string as part of the registry along with a method number which denotes how the registered name is resolved.","For example, the registrant for \u201cyahoo.lawyer\u201d may select the TLDA search method from a list of resolution methods, which may include other variations of TLDA search or any other method type. The user might enter a search string such as \u201chttp:\/\/search.yahoo.com\/bin\/search?p=\u201d which is stored as component data in the registry or name translation database. After registration, when a device receives as input by any means, the fictitious domain name or registered name \u201cyahoo.lawyer\u201d for use by the invention, it is detected that \u201c.lawyer\u201d is a TLDA and then determined from the name translation database that method number \u201c\u201d which is a TLDA search method may be used to call a function which requires a registered search string corresponding to \u201cyahoo.lawyer\u201d for generating a resolvable URI. More specifically, method number \u201c\u201d concatenates the search string with the TLDA to form the URI. As a result of the function call, the valid URI generated and resolved is:","\u201chttp:\/\/search.yahoo.com\/bin\/search?p=lawyer\u201d","Quite often a zip code is used at a web site to help personalize search results by locating geographic specific information to the user. Another example of the TLDA search method is by receiving the name \u201cyahoo.44106\u201d to be processed by a device, network access apparatus , command line, or location field  of a web browser. By configuring and registering a resolution method to such a name, the steps of accessing a resource and then searching a resource are combined into a single step by simultaneously accessing and searching a given resource where \u201cSLD.TLDA\u201d takes the form \u201cSLD.SEARCHTERM\u201d creating a FDN. The search term used for personalized content is not limited to zip codes but may include any search term or identifier associated to the geographic, demographic, or psychographic identification or profile of a user (identifiers such as account number, license plate, telephone number, address, e-mail address, or social security number, trademark, etc.) wherein the results of such indicia or TLDA name form a sense of personalized results.","By registering a resolution method, the processing of a zip code TLDA as a ccTLD web address or as a search term may be determined. The present invention may be further modified to consider both methods appropriate and filter and display all available links of generated URis based on contemporaneously processing a plurality of methods.","For instance, \u201cweather.44116\u201d is received as input by a device.

This allows for variations of the same fundamental registered name to expand the functionality of its use. There are reserved symbols from a given character set that are assigned as prefix delimiters. The list of prefix delimiters listed above are only a few examples of extended usage for the purpose of illustration and such delimiters and their corresponding functions may be expanded as needed. In summary, the present invention may process both prefix and suffix delimiters to RDNs, FDNs, and FMDNs. An autosearch template may be established for each prefix and\/or suffix delimiter. The template can then be adapted to perform the desired identifier transformations.","The autosearch feature can also be configured to transform an identifier into mathematical arguments that can be processed by a calculator program or Java applet.

The entity may advertise \u201cunited.states\u201d on television, \u201cunited.steel\u201d in the newspaper, \u201cunited.stores\u201d on the radio, or \u201cunited.stamps\u201d on the Internet. All such indicia may be calculated to generate unique URIs that are resolvable through the \u201cunited.st\u201d domain and at the same time measure response rate per media to determine market share and effectiveness of targeted advertising.","The indicia is not limited to being advertised as readable characters but may be used for automated retrieval by encoding such indicia as machinereadable but practically indiscernible by most humans such as a glyph, or onedimensional or a two-dimensional bar code. Examples of one-dimensional bar codes include, but are not limited to, 3 of 9, UPC-A, Code 128, Codebar, MSI, Extended 3 of 9, Code 93, Extended Code 93, Industrial 2 of 5, Standard 2 of 5, Code 11, and UCC\/EAN-128. Examples of two-dimensional bar codes include, but are not limited to, Data Matrix and PDF417. The indicia may also be printed to be invisible to the end user but readable by an input device such as an optical reader. If desired, the indicia may be selected to be readable by more than one type of data reader. For example, printed data may be printed with a magnetic substance, such as magnetic ink, so as to be readable by both an optical reader and a magnetic reader.","Preferably, the data reader or input device includes an optical imaging reader such as a page scanner, a photograph reader, a business card reader, a scanning wand, a reader in a fax machine, a linear CCD (charge coupled device) reader, or a two-dimensional CCD reader.

The network access apparatus  receives content from the resource, and displays at least a portion of the content on a display device.","Extending Usage of Available Names","InterNIC's glossary defines domain name space as the sum total of domain names that currently represent networks and computers, as well as all of the possible domain names\u2014not yet in use\u2014which may potentially represent networks and computers. This means that registered domain names are only a part of the total domain name space. This definition of name space also includes the universe of domain names that do not exist as of yet.","Consider the heated political debates with respect to the so called depletion of \u201c.com\u201d and the struggle of lobbying for the addition of more gTLDs to the DNS (e.g., \u201c.info\u201d, \u201c.store\u201d, \u201c.web\u201d, \u201c.arts\u201d, \u201c.rec\u201d, etc.). In Fall of 1997 after years of speculation, it was expected that seven new gTLDs were to be added to the DNS in March of 1998 when the NSI contract was to originally have expired. As a result of this expectation, web sites offered pre-registration services by allowing a user to register potentially new domain names to be stored in a queue with a registration submission form forwarded on a first come first serve basis to a registrar in the event of new gTLD availability.

Program installation may be activated in response to accessing a web site or any resource corresponding to a URI.","Modifying the source code of the browser program  itself or as (e.g., Windows, Linux, NT, UNIX, MAC, etc.) may be more desirable, in effect, enabling tens or hundreds of millions of users to take advantage of more creative ways to use indicia such as FDNs as a means to access a valid URI. For any of the above implementations, HLD resolvability may be determined before, during, and\/or after DNS resolution on the client side, server side, or at any point at any point on a network including at a peer-to-peer machines, proxy servers, firewalls, hubs, routers, resolvers (e.g., DNS resolvers, RealNames resolvers, Netword Resolvers, UDDI resolvers, etc.), and nameservers, etc. In addition, the step of HLD resolvability may further reside in hardware, software and\/or firmware (e.g., network card, BIOS, adapter cards, etc.). HLD resolvability may be determined before processing a name resolution request or in response to determining that the domain name is unresolvable.","MSIE browser (or other programs that use the MSIE shell) may forward an identifier having an unresolvable domain name or FDN to the autosearch feature for further processing. Instead of prompting the client browser  to display an error message, the identifier may instead be processed by the autosearch and\/or routed to another naming service provider for further processing. For example, such input may be routed to a FDN registry or to a FDN translation service in operative association with a RealNames server and\/or similar resolver and the like. Modifications may be made to the script\/program\/template running the autosearch that generates the \u201cresponse.asp\u201d web page on the server \u201cauto.search.msn.com\u201d to enable FDN processing and\/or processing a search request having the FDN or unresolvable domain name.","An extra template  may be created and used in the registry of the MSIE autosearch feature. When the \u201cauto.search.msn.com\u201d server detects that the request includes a TLDA, the extra template may be used as a means to access an authorization database, registry, name translation database, or \u201cGO LIST\u201d, to determine how to generate a valid URI that corresponds to the received FDN having a TLDA. By using an extra template , the browser program does not have to be modified, thereby eliminating distribution costs for a browser version update. Currently, the resolution of MDNs require a client browser plug-in to intercept the MDN before reaching the DNS for name resolution. MSIE autosearch feature is not equipped to process MDNs. An extra MDN and FMDN template may be added to the registry of the MSIE autosearch feature to enable MDN and FMDN processing in response to unsuccessful DNS resolution. For instance, when a registered FDN (e.g., \u201caol.love\u201d) is processed by MSIE and determined to have a TLDA, an extra name\/value pair is passed generating the following URI:","\u201chttp:\/\/auto.search.msn.com\/response.asp?MT=aol.love&srch=3&prov=utf8&authorize=tlda.com\u201d","A specific template is accessed when the name\/value pair \u201cauthorize=tlda.com\u201d is parsed and passed as a variable. The fictitious domain name is inserted into the accessed template to generate the URI:","http:\/\/www.tlda.com\/cgibi n\/tlda\/authorize.cg i?name=aol.love&refer=msie","The accessed URI will authorize that \u201caol.love\u201d is a registered FDN name and retrieve \u201cTLDA rotation\u201d as the resolution method and retrieve \u201c.com\u201d as the resolvable TLD, to generate the valid URI, \u201chttp:\/\/love.aol.com\u201d. The browser is immediately redirected to the valid URI upon generation. The name\/value pair \u201crefer=msie\u201d is parsed and passed as a variable to determine the source of the URI redirection for the purposes of billing, tracking, and accounting. Other name\/value pairs can also be passed to determine whether the output is redirected to registration services, resolution services, and search services, alone or in any combination thereof. In the event that \u201caol.love\u201d is not authorized and remains an unregistered FDN then the FDN may be inserted into another template to generate the URI:","http:\/\/www.tlda.com\/cgi-bin\/tlda\/register.cgi?name=aollove&refer=msie","The browser may then be immediately redirected to the valid URI upon generation. Other templates  may be included and used for processing prefix\/suffix delimiters, URI redirection from SLD or HLD (e.g., \u201cacme.\u201d, \u201c.net\u201d, or \u201c.sports\u201d) to a corresponding vertical market directory service, using a TLDA as a customized search term (e.g., TLDA Query), using a template for each resolution method, and creating a user definable template in conjunction with specified component data at the time of registration or thereafter.","One method of implementation does not rely upon a TLD registry and instead a template may be made to use \u201c.com\u201d as a default TLD and use TLDA rotation or TLDA Query as a resolution method for valid URI generation. The template  may be distributed as part of a client and\/or server side script to simplify name translation and not rely on any kind of registration. Though the template  does not need to rely upon an authorization database to generate valid URIs from FDNs, it is preferred that the minimum of a \u201cGO L1ST\u201d is used to track and acknowledge name translation. Furthermore, entries of other gTLDs, may be added to override the concatenation of a default \u201c.com\u201d with \u201c.edu\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d, \u201c.int\u201d, and \u201c.mil\u201d instead. For instance, when the FDN \u201cuspto.5987464\u201d is received as input, an override is detected from the \u201cGO L1ST\u201d and \u201c.gov\u201d is used instead to construct a URI to access U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,464 from the \u201cuspto.gov\u201d web site instead of and\/or in addition to accessing information from \u201cuspto.com\u201d. Other override entries may include method number\/template number. In addition, the \u201cGO L1ST\u201d may be constructed in a manner similar to DNS resource records including time-to-live (TTL) values, etc. By so doing, updates may easily be propagated in a distributed system.","In one aspect of the present invention, name tracking databases, name translation databases, or registries may be centrally maintained and updated through redundant servers. The data structure of such information may be stored as metadata (e.g., XML) or in any other format to allow integration of such data with the data managed by other naming service providers. Through Application Programming Interface (API), naming service providers can communicate with such resolvers, registries, and\/or databases. Furthermore, access can be both platform and language independent. For instance, the TLDA registry can be accessed through any gateway such as Mobile Access Gateway. All requests may be routed to a NAPTR RR, SRV RR, or round-robin DNS for the purposes of distributing bandwidth and load balancing across a server farm. The server farm may include dedicated servers for each database or parts of a single database that operate in parallel to assure high throughput. In other aspects the name translation databases or registries may be maintained and updates propagated in a distributed hierarchy similar to that of the DNS.","The name tracking database may be enhanced by combining the data from the name translation database and storing it at the Internet Service Provider (SP) level to act as a distributed cache for minimizing bandwidth of server requests across the backbone of the Internet. The enhanced name tracking database may also be distributed as a client side cache for even quicker access, particularly when the network is unstable or unreliable causing retrieval delays, or when a network connection is lost. A method for distributing the enhanced name tracking database is to divide the database into zone files by truncating the TLDA. For instance, FDNs \u201cunited.states\u201d and \u201ctop.stories\u201d may be provided from a \u201cST\u201d zone file that is maintained by an authorized ISP. There are 676 two-letter zone files (zone files may be adapted and distributed to account for numeric symbols or symbols from other character sets accordingly) that may be distributed around the globe and updates may propagate through the FDN registry system similar to that of the DNS. In addition, such FDNs may be distributed by total character length of the FDN. For example, \u201cunited.states\u201d may be stored in and provided from a \u201c13 character\u201d zone file whereas \u201ctop.stories\u201d may be stored in and provided from an \u201c11 character\u201d zone file.","This invention may be implemented in networks and distributed systems of varying scope and scale. The registry, registration records, name translation database, or name tracking database may be located at separate sites and separate computers in a large distributed system. However, the various servers and clients described may actually be processes running on various computers and interacting to form a distributed and\/or peer-to-peer system. In smaller implementations, some or all of the various servers described may actually be processes running on a single computer. All such components of the fictitious domain identifier system are robust, secure, and scalable. Security methods including authorization techniques may be applied to all information records in the system including registries and DNS resource records.","Pre-navigation methods may also be applied to FDN detection techniques. Improvements may be made to the autosearch and\/or browser, for example to try and apply such FDN techniques in yet earlier steps or in later steps. There may further be included any number of other steps that may be performed between the step of determining a domain name is fictitious and processing the FDN such as requesting a network resource or performing a registration request and\/or search request. In effect, FDN detection may occur before any validity tests and after failed DNS resolution requests, for example.","The present invention is by no means limited to only process FDNs form a navigation request or network resource request. Other request types such as processing FDNs in a search request are provided in U.S. patent application Ser.

For instance, when it is determined that the search request does not include a registered phrase or keyword, then it may further be determined whether the search request includes a FDN, by consulting a registry . When the request is determined to include a FDN, it then may be determined whether to perform a search request with the input as a literal string. Search results may be retrieved. A search request may be initiated by selecting an exact phrase option from a listbox or surrounding the FDN with a delimiter such as the quote sign (e.g., \u201ctop.stories\u201d) to process the detected FDN as a literal string, otherwise a FDN detected from input may be processed as a registration and\/or resolution request. When it is determined that the input is instead processed as a resolution and\/or registration request, then the resolvability and\/or availability of the FDN may be determined.","To date, wildcard RR redirection in TLD zone files has only been used for the purpose of enabling a TLD registry to also become a registrar and provide domain name registration services.

Though alternative roots have surfaced to provide alternative TLDs, such services are criticized by supporters of the root that such implementations disrupt the DNS and fragment the Internet. A wildcard RR has until now never been added to the root zone file of the authoritative root server of the DNS or of any other alternative root system. By adding a wildcard RR, all domain names that do not have a resolvable TLD (e.g., any domain name having a TLDA) can be redirected to a TLDA resolver  and\/or registry  to determine how to further resolve the domain name identifier.

The IP address corresponds to the network resource wherein the network resource is adapted to determine which namespace provider of a plurality of namespace providers can process the FDN. The network resource manages a primary virtual zero level domain (PVZLD). The namespace provider is a naming authority to at least one secondary virtual zero level domain (SVZLD) and the PVZLD is adapted to distribute the DNS query including the FDN having the TLDA to the at least one SVZLD.","A DNS server includes a root zone file and a resource record adapted to resolve a DNS query including a domain name having a top level domain alias (TLDA). The DNS server can be a single authoritative root server, alternative root server, and virtual inclusive root server. The resource record is a wildcard resource record and can include an IP address. The IP address corresponds to a network resource adapted to determine which namespace provider of a plurality of namespace providers can process the domain name having the TLDA. The network resource is adapted to manage a primary virtual zero level domain (PVZLD). The namespace provider is a naming authority to at least one secondary virtual zero level domain (SVZLD) and the PVZLD is adapted to redirect to at least one SVZLD in response to the resolved DNS query including said domain name having said TLDA.","When it is determined that the first domain name is resolvable it can be determined whether the network resource can be located and when it is determined that the first domain name is not resolvable, a registration request can be processed. When it is determined that the network resource can be located it can be determined whether the network resource can be accessed and when it is determined that the network resource can not be located, a registration request can be processed.","A domain name can be translated into an IP address by accessing at least one resource record from at least one zone file or file cache. A resource record can be a wildcard resource record having an IP address corresponding to a network resource adapted to determine which domain name registration provider of a plurality of domain name registration providers can process the registration request when it is determined that the first domain name is available for registration.","The registration request can be a domain name registration request and\/or keyword registration request. The domain name registration request and keyword registration request can be contemporaneously processed. Domain name registration provider can be a domain name registrar, domain name reseller, or domain name affiliate. Keyword registration provider can be a keyword registrar, keyword reseller, and keyword affiliate. A keyword registration provider of a plurality of keyword providers can be selected to process the keyword registration request.","In a keyword registration request, at least one keyword can be generated from the identifier and determined whether the at least one keyword is resolvable. A keyword resolution request can be processed from the at least one keyword when the at least one keyword is determined resolvable. It can be determined whether the at least one keyword is available for keyword registration when the at least one keyword is determined not resolvable.","The keyword resolution request can be processed by accessing at least one network resource from the at least one keyword. At least one of a keyword resolver system and file cache can be queried to determine whether the at least one keyword is resolvable. A keyword registration form can be generated when the at least one keyword is determined available for registration and keyword registrant information can be provided when the at least one keyword is determined not available for registration. The keyword registration form can include a domain name registration form.","Related domain names may be generated from a first domain name and determined whether such generated domain names are available for registration by performing a WHOIS request on the first domain name and any the related domain names when processing a domain name registration request. A domain name registration form may be generates for each domain name determined available for registration and registrant information may be provided for each domain name determined not available for registration. A domain name registration form also includes a keyword registration form or may include any other identifier registration form.","The domain name registration provider is at least one of a domain name registrar, domain name reseller, and domain name affiliate. It can be determined which domain name registration provider of a plurality of domain name registration providers will process the domain name registration request by retrieving one of a default named domain name registration provider and a method of selecting a domain name registration provider from one of an autosearch template and modifiable configuration settings. The method of selecting a domain name registration provider is chosen from the least cost domain name registration provider, a preselected list of domain name registration provider, and a random choice of domain name registration provider. The method of selecting the least cost domain name registration provider can include the step of consulting a table of registration cost information updated in real time.","The first domain name can be a FDN and a valid domain name can be generated from at least a portion of the identifier and determined whether the network resource can be accessed from the valid domain name. A registration request having the FDN can be processed when it is determined that the valid domain name can not be accessed. The valid domain name can be generated from an autosearch.","An apparatus includes a processor, a memory in operative association with the processor, means for determining that an identifier includes a fictitious domain name (FDN), and means for requesting a network resource from at least a portion of said identifier. A computer program product includes computer readable program code stored on a computer readable medium, the program code adapted to execute the method for determining that an identifier includes a fictitious domain name (FDN), and requesting a network resource from at least a portion of the identifier.","Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to a certain preferred aspect or aspects, it is obvious that equivalent alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification and the annexed drawings.
