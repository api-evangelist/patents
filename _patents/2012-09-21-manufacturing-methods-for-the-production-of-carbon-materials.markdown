The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.","1. Technical Field","The present invention generally relates to polymer gels, polymer cryogels, activated carbon materials, and methods for making the same.","2. Description of the Related Art","Activated carbon is a highly porous form of elemental carbon, typically having a surface area of at least 500 m\/g. Activated carbon materials are useful in many different applications. For example, activated carbon materials are used, inter alia, for chemical adsorption, gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis, and in energy storage devices. Given the broad demonstrated utility of activated carbon materials, efficient methods for their production are needed in the art.","One traditional approach to produce high surface area activated carbon materials, such as for use in ultracapacitor electrodes and other energy storage devices, has been to pyrolyze an existing carbon-containing material (e.g. coconut fibers or tire rubber). This results in a char with relatively low surface area which can subsequently be over-activated to produce a material with the porosity necessary for the desired application. Such an approach is inherently limited by the existing structure of the precursor material. This approach also typically results in low process yields due to removal of a large portion of the original char during the activation step.","Another approach for producing high surface area activated carbon materials has been to prepare a synthetic polymer from carbon-containing organic building blocks (e.g. a polymer gel). As with the existing organic materials, the synthetically prepared polymers are pyrolyzed and activated to produce an activated carbon material. In contrast to the traditional approach described above, the intrinsic porosity of the synthetically prepared polymer results in higher process yields because less material is lost during the activation step. In addition, some control over the pore size distribution of the final activated carbon material can be exerted by using different building blocks and\/or polymerization conditions.","Although preparing activated carbon materials from synthetic polymers has several advantages over pyrolysis and activation of existing precursor materials, the known methods have several disadvantages. For example, preparation of activated carbon materials from synthetic polymers typically requires a time-consuming and expensive solvent exchange step prior to supercritical drying or freeze drying. Furthermore, the dried polymer material (e.g. polymer cryogel or aerogel) typically contains a residual amount of organic solvent. A viable manufacturing process for activated carbon materials must overcome these and other limitations of the existing methods.","While significant advances have been made in the field of activated carbon materials, there continues to be a need in the art for new and improved carbon materials and related methods. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages.","In general terms, the present invention is directed to activated carbon materials processes for preparing the same. In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for making frozen polymer gel particles comprising rapidly freezing polymer gel particles, wherein the polymer gel particles have been generated from a polymer gel, and wherein the polymer gel has been prepared by reaction of one or more polymer precursers.","In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a polymer cryogel comprising less than about 1000 ppm of organic solvent.","In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides activated polymer cryogel particles prepared according to the methods disclosed herein, wherein the activated polymer cryogel particles have a specific surface area of at least about 1000 m\/g.","In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides pyrolyzed polymer cryogel particles prepared according to the methods disclosed herein, wherein the pyrolyzed polymer cryogel particles have a specific surface area of about 500 to about 800 m\/g.","These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent upon reference to the attached drawings and following detailed description.

Admixing appropriate precursors (e.g. resorcinol and formaldehyde in a 1:2 ratio) in stirred DI water and then adding catalyst (e.g. sodium carbonate) at room temperature.","2. The resulting sols are then sealed in glass ampoules or vials and gelled at 90\u00b0 C. for at least 24 h or until gelation was complete.","3. The resulting hydrogels are then subjected to solvent exchange to replace water with an organic solvent (e.g. tert-butanol) by rinsing three times in fresh organic solvent for 24 h each time.","4. The solvent exchanged gels are then subsequently freeze dried (i.e. lyophilized) for 3 days.","5. The resulting cryogels are then pyrolyzed at set times and temperatures","6. The polymer cryogels are then activated to produce an activated carbon material that could be used, for example, as an ultracapacitor electrode.","The method described above suffers from several disadvantages. For example, the solvent exchange step is time consuming, expensive, and environmentally unfriendly. In addition, the resulting cryogel comprises residual amounts of the organic extraction solvent. A viable manufacturing process must address these disadvantages.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of preparing polymer cryogels wherein the solvent exchange step is eliminated. Instead, the polymer gels are rapidly frozen and lyophilized without undergoing solvent exchange. The resulting polymer cryogels are substantially free of organic extraction solvent, for example t-butanol or acetone.","As noted above, the processing techniques generally employed in the production of activated carbon are relatively inexpensive and scalable, with the exception of performing a solvent exchange of the aqueous solvent for an organic solvent, such as t butanol prior to freeze-drying. Solvent exchange has generally been used so that the dried material retains the pore structure built during the water-based gelation process described herein. This exchange step is one variable that contributes to the high mesoporosity of an activated carbon material and correspondingly the high power performance demonstrated in ultracapacitors using such an activated carbon.","Without being bound by theory, freeze-drying the polymer gel, as opposed to air-drying which is generally employed in the preparation of xerogels, is thought to prevent or minimize capillary forces within the pores of the polymer. In the freeze-drying process, after the solvent present in the polymer gel freezes, it is sublimated directly to a gas and no meniscus forms that could destroy the pore structure. An organic solvent, such as t butanol or acetone, is routinely used as the solvent during freeze drying instead of water because of the difference in the expansion coefficients of the solvents during freezing. When water freezes inside the pores of a polymer gel, the water expands as it becomes solid and destroys the polymer network; t butanol can be easily frozen due to its near-room temperature freezing point (25\u00b0 C.) and does not exert the same destructive pressure on the pore walls as the freezing of water does. Unfortunately, t-butanol is expensive, potentially damaging to the environment, and generally a large volume of it is needed to produce a solvent exchanged gel (the volume of solvent used is approximately 10 times the volume of the gel being dried).","One approach used by the inventors to avoid the limitations associated with the use of t-butanol or other organic extraction solvents is to eliminate the step of solvent exchange of water for t butanol or other organic extraction solvents and directly freeze the water inside the polymer gel quickly. The crystal structure of solid phase water takes up a larger volume than does the disorganized liquid phase. However, it is possible to produce water in a solid state without allowing it to crystallize and expand. If the temperature of water is reduced at a fast enough rate, the water molecules do not have time to organize into an ordered crystal structure. The result is super-cooled water which transforms into an amorphous phase of solid, frozen water. The coefficient of expansion of this material relative to liquid water is nearly 1.0. So the structure of a polymer gel filled with \u201cice\u201d (super-cooled water) of this type is subject to only very minimal freezing stresses.","There are several approaches for inducing a super cooled state on water trapped inside a small volume. Such techniques have been employed to induce a super cooled state on the water in the pores of a polymer gel as disclosed herein. In one embodiment, super-cooling water in the pores of a polymer gel is performed by rapidly cooling small particles of polymer gel (having an average particle size of less than about 30 mm) by immersing them in a suitably cold liquid, for example, liquid nitrogen at \u2212196\u00b0 C. or ethanol cooled by dry ice. In another embodiment, the polymer gel is rapidly frozen by co-mingling or physical mixing of polymer gel particles with a suitable cold solid, for example, dry ice (solid carbon dioxide. Another method is to use a blast freezer with a metal plate at \u221260\u00b0 C. to rapidly remove heat from the polymer gel particles scattered over its surface. A third method of rapidly cooling water in a polymer gel particle is to snap freeze the particle by pulling a high vacuum very rapidly (the degree of vacuum is such that the temperature corresponding to the equilibrium vapor pressure allows for freezing). However, this method does not achieve the targeted very low temperature of the material during the freezing step; for example, the temperature of the material prior to snap freezing may be close to 0\u00b0 C., and upon rapid exposure to a high vacuum the material remains around 0\u00b0 C. Yet another method for rapid freezing comprises admixing a polymer gel with a suitably cold gas. In some embodiments the cold gas may have a temperature below about \u221210\u00b0 C. In some embodiments the cold gas may have a temperature below about \u221220\u00b0 C. In some embodiments the cold gas may have a temperature below about \u221230\u00b0 C. In yet other embodiments, the gas may have a temperature of about \u2212196\u00b0 C. For example, in some embodiments, the gas is nitrogen.","In one embodiment, milled samples of polymer gel particles are loaded into an appropriate freezer (blast or snap freezing) and frozen. In another embodiment, liquid nitrogen quenching is accomplished with a particulate sample. For example, a sample to be quenched is added at a rate of 5 g per minute to a 1-L bowl shaped Dewar containing liquid nitrogen, thereby allowing time for the sample to quench, freeze, and sink to the bottom of the bath. In another analogous embodiment, ethanol cooled by dry ice is used instead of liquid nitrogen. The milled polymer gel particles may have a diameter prior to freezing of less than about 30 mm, for example, between about 0.01 mm and about 25 mm; alternately, the average diameter of said polymer gel particles prior to freezing is between about 0.1 mm and about 10 mm, or about 0.7 mm and about 7 mm. In some examples, the polymer gel particles are between about 2 mm and about 5 mm.","The rapidly frozen particles may be collected using various approaches known to those of skill in the art, for example by sedimentation, by centrifugation, by containment in a permeable membrane, comprised of a stainless steel or polymeric fiber mesh.","After collecting the rapidly frozen sample, they are transferred to a standard freezer for temporary storage. They are placed in the freeze dryer within 48 hours in carefully timed batches to prevent occurrence of a water phase transition from amorphous to crystalline ice. After removal from the freeze dryer, samples can be stored under a nitrogen blanket in a closed container for long periods of time.","While it is not generally practical to process material that has too small of a particle size, particularly when dealing with large kilns with controlled gas environments, as in the later pyrolysis\/activation steps, it is beneficial to the super cooling process to have small particles size. The cooling rate is an important variable in achieving a super cooled state. Smaller particles cool quicker much the same way that a droplet of water might freeze instantaneously whereas a full glass takes many hours. For the snap freezing option, smaller particles would also be better because there is more surface area available for evaporation\/sublimation\u2014both cooling processes\u2014to occur. A finer mesh size has more surface area per pound of gel and hence cools faster when a vacuum is applied. The relationship between mesh size of the polymer gel particles and the super cooling method is related to the mesopore volume and can be optimized based on the approaches disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, the particles of polymer gel are solid particles. In other embodiments, the particles of polymer gel are suspended in a suitable liquid medium to form a suspension of polymer gel particles. In yet other embodiments, the particles of polymer gel are solubilized in a suitable solvent. Examples of polymer gels that can be formulated as solutions or suspensions include but are not limited to polymer gels prepared from resorcinol and formaldehyde, saccharide polymers such as starch and dextran, poly(ethylene glycols), polyacrylates, polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyimides, and polystyrenes. The polymer can be in the form of a polymer or co-polymer, or mixture of polymers. The molecular weight of the polymer can be unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal in character, or, for example, a mixture of polymers of various molecular weights.","In some embodiments, atomized liquid nitrogen, as opposed to bulk liquid nitrogen, is used for rapidly freezing polymer gels. Atomized liquid nitrogen can be formed by various methods known in the art, for example, single-fluid and two-fluid atomization.","In some embodiments, atomized or bulk liquid nitrogen is used for spray freezing a polymer gel which is suspended in a sprayed droplet of a suitable fluid. The frozen spray is formed from liquid droplets having an average diameter of less than 10,000 microns, less than 1000 microns, less than 100 microns, or even less than 10 microns.","In some embodiments, an atomized liquid is used for rapidly freezing solid particles of polymer gel. For example, in some embodiments, the atomized liquid may have a temperature of less than about \u221210\u00b0 C. In other embodiments, the atomized liquid may have a temperature of less than about \u221220\u00b0 C. In yet other embodiments, the atomized liquid may have a temperature of less than about \u221230\u00b0 C. In other embodiments, atomized liquid nitrogen is used for rapidly freezing solid particles of polymer gel, as opposed to a bulk form (e.g., bulk solution or bulk monolith). The frozen particles can be comprised of solid particles having an average diameter of less than 10,000 microns, less than 1000 microns, less than 100 microns or even less than 10 microns. In other embodiments, droplets comprised of multi-phasic systems, such as suspensions or emulsions, can also be rapidly frozen under the conditions disclosed herein","In another embodiment, the polymer gel particles are comprised of a viscous polymer gel, for example a polymer gel having a viscosity in the range of less than about 10 cP, or less than about 100 cP, or even less than about 1000 cP viscosity. The viscous polymer gel may be produced by a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the viscous polymer gel may be comprised of a partially polymerized form of the polymer gel, and\/or may be comprised of a relatively low molecular weight form of the polymerized polymer gel. Alternately, the viscous polymer gel may be formed at an elevated temperature, such as for example, 80-100\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, lower temperatures can be used in conjunction with an increase in gelation time. With sufficient time, complete gelation can occur at temperatures as low as 20\u00b0 C., so the range of applicable temperatures is from 20-100\u00b0 C., depending on the time required for gelation. Alternately, gelation can occur at temperatures higher than 100\u00b0 C. in a 100% humidity environment. In some embodiments, Temperatures up to 200\u00b0 C. may be used. Such temperatures can be achieved, for example, by the use of steam. The resulting polymer gel is maintained at that elevated temperature during the atomization step described below.","The viscous polymer gel prepared as described above is atomized by various approaches known to those of skill in the art for atomizing viscous materials, for example, using high-pressure single-fluid atomization or two-fluid atomization, sonication nozzle atomization, spinning disk atomization, or electrostatic atomization. Following atomization, droplets of the highly viscous polymer gel are frozen rapidly, for example by spray freezing, as described above (i.e. the atomized spray is contacted with a suitably cold medium, for example, liquid nitrogen or ethanol cooled by dry ice). For example, in some embodiments, the suitably cold medium may have a temperature of less than about \u221210\u00b0 C. In other embodiments, the suitably cold medium may have a temperature of less than about \u221220\u00b0 C. In yet other embodiments, the suitably cold medium may have a temperature of less than about \u221230\u00b0 C. The rapidly frozen particles are then collected and the resulting ice formed therein is removed by sublimation. Sublimation of the ice is accomplished by lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described in more detail herein.","In another embodiment, the polymer gel is rapidly frozen before polymerization is complete. For example, droplets of a resorcinol\/formaldehyde\/sodium carbonate mixture may be rapidly frozen, for example by spray freezing. The rapidly frozen particles are then collected, and polymerization of the mixture is completed within the frozen particle. Analogously, droplets of a resorcinol\/formaldehyde\/sodium carbonate mixture in which polymerization has not yet been initiated may be rapidly frozen, for example by spray freezing. Polymerization may then be initiated and completed within the rapidly frozen droplet.","Polymerization within the frozen particles may be accomplished using a method other than heating, for example by microwave irradiation. As disclosed herein, the polymerization conditions can employ relatively low temperatures, for example in the range of less than 100\u00b0 C. or less than 50\u00b0 C. over a relatively long time for example more than 1 day or more than several days compared to conventional conditions where polymerization is accomplished at relatively high temperatures for example above 50\u00b0 C. or above 100\u00b0 C. and for a relatively short time, for example, less than several days, preferably less than one day. After the polymerization is deemed complete, the ice formed in the freezing process can be removed by sublimation, such as by lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described in more detail below.","In one embodiment, polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde or other polymer precursors can be started before the freezing step and completed in the frozen particle. In another embodiment, polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde or other polymer precursors can be started before the freezing step and completed in the freeze dried particle (i.e., after lyophilization). In yet another embodiment, polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde or other polymer precursors can be started in the frozen particle (after freezing step is completed), and completed thereafter in the freeze-dried particle. In yet another embodiment, polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde or other polymer precursors can be started and completed in the freeze dried particle.","In yet another embodiment, the polymer gel particles may be comprised of microspheres that are created by an emulsion approach, such as a water-in-oil (w\/o) emulsion, oil-in-water (o\/w) emulsion, oil-in-water-oil (o\/w\/o) emulsion, water-in-oil-in-water (w\/o\/w) emulsion, and water-in-oil-in-oil (w\/o\/o) emulsion. In such microspheres, the aqueous phase may contain polymer precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, wherein the polymerization has either not yet been initiated or has been initiated but not yet completed, and the organic phase can comprise an appropriate organic solvent. Polymerization can be confined to the aqueous phase (within the w\/o, w\/o\/w\/ or w\/o\/o emulsion) comprising the polymer precursors. Such microspheres can additionally contain surfactants, such as, but not limited to nonionic (e.g. SPAN80), cationic (e.g. trimethylstearylammonium chloride, C18), nonionic polymeric fluorinated (e.g. FC4430), and nonionic polymeric surfactants. When nonionic surfactants are present, the ratio of the emulsifiers to solvent, the temperature of the emulsification and the holding time of the emulsification may all play a role in the properties of the resulting polymer cryogel microspheres.","In another embodiment, a solution of polymer precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, in which polymerization is not yet initiated may be emulsified in an organic phase, for example to create a w\/o emulsion. In yet another embodiment, a solution of polymer precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, in which polymerization is partially progressed is emulsified in an organic phase. Emulsification can be accomplished by various means known to the art including but not limited to high-speed mixing, sonication, homogenization (for example rotor stator homogenization), etc. Polymerization to yield a polymer gel is carried out under conditions known to those of skill in the art and as disclosed herein. The microspheres comprising polymer gel are harvested using methods familiar to those of skill in the art.","In these embodiments, the harvested microspheres are rapidly frozen, for example by spray freezing. The spray freezing is accomplished by contacting the atomized droplets of the w\/o produced microspheres with atomized droplets of liquid nitrogen, or bulk liquid nitrogen, or another suitably cold fluid, for example, ethanol in dry ice or ethanol cooled by another means. The w\/o microspheres are frozen via spray freezing over a length of time that ranges from several seconds to substantially less than one second. Generally the w\/o microspheres are frozen via spray freezing over a period of substantially less than one second. The rapidly frozen w\/o microspheres are collected by various approaches known to those of skill in the art, for example by sedimentation, by centrifugation, by containment in a permeable membrane, for example comprised of a stainless steel or polymeric fiber mesh, etc. Sublimation of ice from the collected microspheres is accomplished by lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described in more detail below.","Alternatively, the solution of polymer precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, is emulsified in an organic phase, and further emulsified in a second organic phase to create a w\/o\/o emulsion. Emulsification to create the double emulsion can be carried out by various means known in the art, as described above. Polymerization is then carried out under conditions known to those of skill in the art, and the microspheres harvested using methods disclosed herein. The microspheres are rapidly frozen, for example by spray freezing. The spray freezing is accomplished by contacting the atomized droplets of the w\/o\/o produced microspheres with atomized droplets of liquid nitrogen, or bulk liquid nitrogen, or another suitably cold fluid, for example, ethanol in dry ice or ethanol cooled by another means. The rapidly frozen w\/o\/o microspheres are collected and the ice formed during the rapid freezing step is removed by sublimation. Sublimation of ice is accomplished by lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described in more detail below.","In another alternative embodiment, the solution of polymer precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, is emulsified in an organic phase, for example, to create a w\/o emulsion. Polymerization is then carried out under conditions known to those of skill in the art, and the microspheres are rapidly frozen, for example, by spray freezing into a second organic phase, creating a w\/o\/o particle. Similar methodologies as described above for spray freezing the single emulsion embodiment can also be employed for spray freezing the w\/o\/o particle. In this case, the spray freezing is accomplished by contacting the atomized droplets of the w\/o produced microspheres with atomized droplets of liquid cold second organic phase, or contacting the atomized droplets with a cold bulk second organic phase. The rapidly frozen w\/o\/o particles are collected and ice is removed by sublimation such as by lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described in more detail below.","In yet another embodiment, the solution of polymer precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, is emulsified in an organic phase, and further emulsified in a second aqueous phase to create a w\/o\/w emulsion. Similar methodologies as described above for spray freezing the single emulsion embodiment and the w\/o\/w embodiment can also be employed for spray freezing the w\/o\/w particle. Polymerization is carried out under conditions known to those of skill in the art, and the microspheres are harvested. The harvested microspheres are rapidly frozen, for example by spray freezing. The rapidly frozen w\/o\/w microspheres are collected and ice removed by lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described in more detail below.","In another embodiment of the present disclosure, spray freezing can be performed on an aqueous or organic solution or suspension of a polymer gel. Use of a pre-formed polymer obviates the need for a polymerization step in the process disclosed above since the starting material is already polymeric. The solution or suspension can be atomized by methods known to those of skill in the art. The atomized material is then subject to spray freezing. The rapidly frozen particles are collected and the ice removed by sublimation such as lyophilization under conditions suitable to maintain the fine ice crystal structure as described herein. In the case of an aqueous milieu, freeze drying is employed to remove water ice, and in the case of an organic milieu, freezing drying or other suitable technique is employed to remove the frozen crystals of the organic solvent.","The rapid freezing approaches described herein allow fine ice formation via a high degree of nucleation with little time for crystal growth due to the extremely rapid freezing rate. Without wishing to be bound by theory, freezing models may be used to optimize freezing conditions. For example, consider a freezing model based on a steady-state heat transfer phenomenon in which the heat is transported from the cold environment (Tc) through the freezing front (the frozen layer, dr, at a temperature of Tf):\n\n()\/()\n\nwhere Q is the heat transfer rate (J\/sec), A is the surface area of the freezing layer equal to 4\u03c0r2, and K is thermal conductivity of the matrix, e.g., ice (\u02dc2.2 watt m\u22121 K\u22121 at about 0\u00b0 C.). Assuming that the heat transferred is consumed for water freezing into ice, and using \u0394H the latent heat of water freezing (3.34\u00d7105 J\/kg), \u03c1 the density of water (1000 kg\/m3), \u0394T=(Tf\u2212Tc), and rearranging and integrating yields:\n\n\u0398=(\u03942)\/(2)\n\nwhere \u0398 is the time to complete freezing, i.e., the \u201cfreezing time.\u201d According to this model, for droplets of R=1, 10, and 100 m, freezing time would be \u02dc4\u00d710-7 s, \u02dc4\u00d710-5 s, \u02dc4\u00d710-3 s, respectively.\n","Thus, freezing time is proportional to length of material to freeze squared, or another way to look at it is that freezing rate is proportional to \u0398-1 or length-2. For \u201cclassical\u201d freeze drying, even \u201crapid\u201d freezing from a lyophilized shelf would be on the order of 1-10 sec, which allows for ice crystal growth. For the case where freezing is very rapid, thus providing lots of ice nucleation but not much time for growth, calls for a product \u201cthickness\u201d for example no greater than 1000 \u03bcm, or no greater than 100 \u03bcm, or no greater than 10 \u03bcm.","The melting point of water Tm (K) is lowered by confinement inside a pore texture (for example that present in a polymer hydrogel) and related to the pore radius (nm) according to:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0138"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","p"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"0.57","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":"64.7","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["T","m"]},"mo":"-","mn":"273"}}}}}}}},"For example, water confined in a 10 nm pore melts at temperatures higher than \u22127\u00b0 C.

Generally polymerization can be accomplished between about 6 and about 24 hours at about 90\u00b0 C., for example between about 18 and about 24 hours at about 90\u00b0 C.","The synthetic polymer precursor materials as disclosed herein include (a) alcohols, phenolic compounds, and other mono- or polyhydroxy compounds and (b) aldehydes, ketones, and combinations thereof. Representative alcohols in this context include straight chain and branched, saturated and unsaturated alcohols.

Such solvents are useful for dissolution of the synthetic polymer precursor materials, for example dissolution of the phenolic compound. In addition, in some processes such solvents are employed for solvent exchange in the polymer gel (prior to freezing and drying), wherein the solvent from the polymerization of the precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, is exchanged for a pure alcohol.

Milling of Polymer Gels","A monolithic polymer gel can be physically disrupted to create smaller particles according to various techniques known in the art. The resultant polymer gel particles generally have an average diameter of less than about 30 mm, for example, in the size range of about 1 mm to about 25 mm, or between about 1 mm to about 5 mm or between about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm. Alternatively, the size of the polymer gel particles can be in the range below about 1 mm, for example, in the size range of about 100 to 1000 microns. Techniques for creating polymer gel particles from monolithic material include manual or machine disruption methods, such as sieving, grinding, milling, or combinations thereof. Such methods are well-known to those of skill in the art. Various types of mills can be employed in this context such as roller, bead, and ball mills.","In a specific embodiment, a roller mill is employed. A roller mill has three stages to gradually reduce the size of the gel particles. The polymer gels are generally very brittle for a \u2018wet\u2019 material and are not damp to the touch. Consequently they are easily milled using this approach, however, the width of each stage must be set appropriately to achieve the targeted final mesh. This adjustment is made and validated for each combination of gel recipe and mesh size. Each gel is milled via passage through a sieve of known mesh size. Sieved particles can be temporarily stored in sealed containers.","Milling can be accomplished at room temperature according to methods well known to those of skill in the art. Alternatively, milling can be accomplished cryogenically, for example by co-milling the polymer gel with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) particles. In this embodiment, the two steps of (a) creating particles from the monolithic polymer gel and (b) rapid, multidirectional freezing of the polymer gel are accomplished in a single process.","C. Rapid Freezing of Polymer Gels","After the polymer gel particles are formed from the monolithic polymer gel, freezing of the polymer gel particles is accomplished rapidly and in a multi-directional fashion as described in more detail above. Freezing slowly and in a unidirectional fashion, for example by shelf freezing in a lyophilizer, results in dried material having a very low surface area as evidenced in an example herein. Similarly, snap freezing (i.e., freezing that is accomplished by rapidly cooling the polymer gel particles by pulling a deep vacuum) also results in a dried material having a low surface area. As disclosed herein rapid freezing in a multidirectional fashion can be accomplished by rapidly lowering the material temperature to at least about \u221210\u00b0 C. or lower, for example, \u221220\u00b0 C. or lower, or for example, to at least about \u221230\u00b0 C. or lower. Rapid freezing of the polymer gel particles creates a fine ice crystal structure within the particles due to widespread nucleation of ice crystals, but leaves little time for ice crystal growth. This provides a high specific surface area between the ice crystals and the hydrocarbon matrix, which is necessarily excluded from the ice matrix.","D. Drying of Polymer Gels","In one embodiment, the frozen polymer gel particles containing a fine ice matrix are lyophilized under conditions designed to avoid collapse of the material and to maintain fine surface structure and porosity in the dried product. Details of the conditions of the lyophilization are provided herein. Generally drying is accomplished under conditions where the temperature of the product is kept below a temperature that would otherwise result in collapse of the product pores, thereby enabling the dried material to retain an extremely high surface area.","One benefit of having an extremely high surface area in the dried product is the improved utility of the polymer cryogel for the purpose of fabrication of capacitors, energy storage devices, and other energy-related applications. Different polymer cryogel applications require variations in the pore size distribution such as different levels of micropore volume, mesopore volume, surface area, and pore size. By tuning the various processing parameters of the polymer cryogel, high pore volumes can be reached at many different pore sizes depending on the desired application.","The structure of the carbon is reflected in the structure of the polymer cryogel which is in turn is established by the polymer gel properties. These features can be created in the polymer gel using a sol-gel processing approach as described herein, but if care is not taken in removal of the solvent, then the structure is not preserved. It is of interest to both retain the original structure of the polymer gel and modify its structure with ice crystal formation based on control of the freezing process. In some embodiments, prior to drying the aqueous content of the polymer gel is in the range of about 50% to about 99%. In certain embodiments, upon drying the aqueous content of the polymer cryogel is than about 10%, alternately less than about 5% or less than about 2.5%.","Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data for a polymer hydrogel demonstrates a large exothermic event at \u02dc\u221218\u00b0 C. (see ). These data are consistent with freezing of water inside a pore of \u02dc4 nm radius. These findings indicate that the extremely rapid freezing for the purposes of the current application not only constitutes a rapid freezing rate, but also that the extent of the decrease is such that the material is brought below at least \u221218\u00b0 C.","The DSC data also demonstrate that upon warming, there is a broad, complex endothermic behavior, with the onset about \u221213\u00b0 C. and a midpoint of about \u221210\u00b0 C. There appears to be a thermal transition at about \u22122\u00b0 C., and final melting at about +1\u00b0 C. The various events may correspond to melting of different types of microstructures. The data suggest that in order to avoid loss of fine product structure in the frozen state, product temperature during initial (e.g., primary) drying should be maintained below \u221213\u00b0 C. This is accomplished, for example, in a drying step where heat transfer during primary drying is dominated by convection rather than conduction, thus the product temperature during sublimation will correspond to the temperature of ice at equilibrium with the chamber pressure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0170"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"E. Pyrolysis and Activation of Polymer Cryogels","The pyrolysis and activation of the freeze dried polymer cryogel can be accomplished by methods described in the art and in more detail below. The porous structure of the resultant activated carbon is reflected in the structure of the dried polymer cryogel, which is in turn established by the polymer gel properties. These features can be created in the polymer gel using a sol-gel processing approach, but if care is not taken during drying (e.g. removal of the solvent, often water), then the structure is not preserved and the desired structural properties are not translated through the pyrolysis and activation processes.","As noted above, another embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for making an activated carbon material comprising pyrolysis and activation of a cryogel disclosed herein. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, an activated carbon material having a specific surface area of at least about 1000 m\/g is provided. Alternatively, the activated carbon has a specific surface area of at least about 1500 m\/g. Alternatively, the activated carbon has a specific surface area of at least about 2000 m\/g. Alternately, the activated carbon has a specific surface area of at least about 2500 m\/g. Alternately, the activated carbon has a specific surface area of at least about 3000 m\/g.","Generally, in the pyrolysis process, dried polymer cryogels are weighed and placed in a rotary kiln. The temperature ramp is set at 5\u00b0 C. per minute, the dwell time and dwell temperature are set; cool down is determined by the natural cooling rate of the furnace. The entire process is usually run under an inert atmosphere, such as a nitrogen environment. Pyrolyzed samples are then removed and weighed. Other pyrolysis processes are well known to those of skill in the art.","In some embodiments, pyrolysis dwell time (the period of time during which the sample is at the desired temperature) is from about 0 minutes to about 120 minutes. In other embodiments, the dwell time is from about 0 minutes to about 60 minutes. In other embodiments, the dwell time is from about 0 minutes to about 30 minutes. In yet other embodiments, the dwell time is from about 0 minutes to about 10 minutes.","In some embodiments, pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 650\u00b0 C. to 1800\u00b0 C. In other embodiments pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 700\u00b0 C. to about 1200\u00b0 C. In other embodiments pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 850\u00b0 C. to about 1050\u00b0 C. In other embodiments pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 800\u00b0 C. to about 900\u00b0 C.","Activation time and activation temperature both have a large impact on the performance of the resulting activated carbon material, as well as the manufacturing cost thereof. Increasing the activation temperature and the activation dwell time results in higher activation percentages, which generally correspond to the removal of more material compared to lower temperatures and shorter dwell times. Higher activation often increases performance of the final activated carbon, but it also increases cost by reducing overall yield. Improving the level of activation corresponds to achieving a higher performance product at a lower cost.","Pyrolyzed polymer gels may be activated by contacting the pyrolyzed polymer gel with an activating agent. Many gases are suitable for activating, for example gas which contains oxygen. Non-limiting examples of activating gases comprise carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, steam, and oxygen. Activating agents may also include corrosive chemicals. Other activating agents are known to those skilled in the art.","In some embodiments, the activation time is from about 1 minute to about 48 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is from about 1 minute to about 24 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is from about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is from about 5 minutes to about 5 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is from about 5 minutes to about 1 hour. In other embodiments, the activation time is from about 5 minutes to about 10 minutes. In other embodiments, the activation time is from about 1 minute to about 10 minutes.","Generally, in the activation process, samples are weighed and placed in a rotary kiln, for which the automated gas control manifold is set to ramp at a 20\u00b0 C. per minute rate. Carbon dioxide is introduced to the kiln environment for a period of time once the proper activation temperature has been reached. After activation has occurred, the carbon dioxide is replaced by nitrogen and the kiln is cooled down. Samples are weighed at the end of the process to assess the level of activation. Other activation processes are well known to those of skill in the art. In some of the embodiments disclosed herein, activation temperatures may range from about 800\u00b0 C. to about 1300\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, activation temperatures may range from about 900\u00b0 C. to about 1050\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, activation temperatures may range from about 900\u00b0 C. to about 1000\u00b0. One skilled in the art will recognize that other activation temperatures, either lower or higher, may be employed.","The degree of activation is measured in terms of the mass percent of the pyrolyzed cryogel that is lost during the activation step. In one embodiment of the methods described herein, activating comprises a degree of activation from about 5% to about 90%; or a degree of activation from about 10% to about 80%; in some cases activating comprises a degree of activation from about 40% to about 70%, or a degree of activation from about 50% to about 60%.","In the methods disclosed herein for the production of high surface area activated carbon materials, the polymer gel is engineered to produce a material which is already highly porous and contains within its polymer framework a carbonic structure which, when pyrolyzed and activated, will produce an activated carbon that contains a targeted mix of mesopores and micropores. By producing polymer gel with the appropriate targeted mix of meso- and micro-pores, the amount of required activation is reduced, thereby improving yield and reducing cost. Also, the ability to tune the properties (e.g. pore size) of the intermediates introduces a degree of tuneability that has not been realized by a more traditional approach of pyrolyzing and over-activating existing carbon material. For example, manipulating the processing variables of the intermediates as described herein has a more important impact on the final carbon nanostructure than the traditional methods of adjusting pyrolysis and activation variables.","The ability to scale up a manufacturing approach as disclosed herein to meet the high demand expected for the activated carbon materials disclosed herein has been demonstrated. Three parts of the process can be identified: 1) polymerization from precursor polymer materials; 2) freeze drying; and 3) pyrolysis\/activation. In one embodiment, each of these steps may be scaled employing standard manufacturing equipment of three existing industries, for example, specialty chemical companies working with adhesives and epoxies; pharmaceutical and food related freeze drying providers; and manufactures of low grade activated carbon, respectively.","It has been shown that the amount of catalyst and percentage of water in the initial sol has a significant impact on the final performance of the activated carbon material (e.g. when used in a supercapacitor). The large number of process variables and the interaction between these variables enables continuous refinement of the process and allows for some control over the final carbon structure. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present disclosure provides refinement of the process variables. The disclosed refinements result in an ability to exert control over the final carbon structure in a manner that was previously unobtainable.","The most common approach to refining process variables used in the art is to hold all but one variable constant and determine the effect of varying that one parameter. Alternately, and as described herein, the combination of statistical analysis methods, DFE Pro Software, and a factorial design of experiments approach, were used to systematically vary multiple parameters simultaneously to obtain an optimized process for preparing activated carbon material. By using this approach, the impact of each of these variables on a range of different metrics (e.g. surface area, density, pore volume, etc.) related to the activated carbon material's structure are evaluated. When the activated carbon material is employed in a supercapacitor, additional performance metrics may be evaluated. For example, capacitance, density and power density may be evaluated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0186"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0187"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0188"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},"Characterization of Cryogels and Activated Carbon Materials","The structural properties of the final activated carbon material, the carbon (e.g. resorcinol\/formaldehyde) cryogels, and the pyrolyzed, but unactivated polymer cryogels are measured using Nitrogen sorption at 17K, a method known to those of skill in the art. The final performance and characteristics of the finished activated carbon material is important, but the intermediate products (both polymer cryogel and pyrolyzed, but not activated, polymer cryogel), can also be evaluated, particularly from a quality control standpoint, as known to those of skill in the art. The Micromeretics ASAP 2020 is used to perform detailed micropore and mesopore analysis, which reveals the pore size distribution from 0.35 nm to 50 nm. The system produces a nitrogen isotherm starting at a pressure of 10-7 atm, which enables high resolution pore size distributions in the sub 1 nm range. The software generated reports utilize a Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to calculate properties such as pore size distributions, surface area distributions, total surface area, total pore volume, and pore volume within certain pore size ranges.","The pyrolyzed polymer cryogels may have a surface area from about 100 to about 1200 m\/g. In other embodiments, the pyrolyzed polymer cryogels may have a surface area from about 500 to about 8000 m\/g. In other embodiments, the pyrolyzed polymer cryogels may have a surface area from about 500 to about 600 m\/g.","The pyrolyzed polymer cryogels may have a tap density from about 0.1 to about 1.0 cc\/g. In other embodiments, the pyrolyzed polymer cryogels may have a tap density from about 0.4 to about 0.6 cc\/g. In other embodiments, the pyrolyzed polymer cryogels may have a tap density from about 0.45 to about 0.5 cc\/g.","Tuning the Pore Size and Other Properties of Polymer Cryogels","As noted above, activated polymer cryogels synthesized from synthetic, well-characterized precursors are different from activated carbon from natural sources such as coal, pitch, coconuts, etc. This is due in part to the fact that they can be tuned in both micropore and mesopore structure and chemistry by carefully predesigned and executed processing controls. Additionally, an activated polymer cryogel as described herein can contain a porous structure which can be optimized for a given application (e.g. when used in a supercapacitor or other energy storage device). With the ability to tune the carbon nanostructure, performance exceeding current performance data from traditional activated carbons is attained. Important variables include large accessible surface area, short micropores for electrolytic salt diffusion, and minimization of wasted pore volume to enhance specific capacitance.","As noted above, manipulation of the process variables allows production of activated carbons that have properties that suits the desired application. Accordingly, in one embodiment a method of optimizing the process variables for production of polymer gels, polymer cryogels, pyrolyzed polymer cryogels and activated polymer cryogels is provided. As described in more detail in the examples that follow, one approach for optimization of process parameters comprises a design of experiments strategy. Using this strategy, the influence of multiple process variables (e.g. up to 8 variables) can be studied with relatively few experiments. The data obtained from the design of experiments can be used to manipulate process variables to obtain specific properties in the polymer gels, polymer cryogels, and activated polymer cryogels. For example, in some embodiments, the process parameters which are manipulated to obtain the desired product characteristics are selected from: Resorcinol\/Catalyst Ratio, Resorcinol\/Water Ratio, Particle Size at Freezing Step, Quench Temperature, Pyrolysis Time, Pyrolysis Temperature, Activation Temperature, and Activation Time and combinations thereof.","The polymer gels, cryogels, pyrolyzed cryogels, and activated carbon materials disclosed in the following Examples were prepared according to the methods disclosed herein. The following chemicals were used in their preparation: resorcinol (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), formaldehyde solution (37%\u2014stabilized with methanol, Fisher Scientific), sodium carbonate (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich). The chemicals were used as received from the supplier without further purification.","Unless indicated otherwise, the following conditions were generally employed. Resorcinol and formaldehyde were reacted in water in the presence of a sodium carbonate catalyst. The molar ratio of resorcinol to formaldehyde was typically 0.5 to 1. The reaction was allowed to incubate in a sealed glass ampoule at 90\u00b0 C. for at least 24 hours or until gelation was complete. The resulting polymer hydrogel contained water, but no organic solvent; the polymer hydrogel was optionally washed with water to remove unreacted precursors, but was not subjected to solvent exchange of water for an organic solvent, such as t-butanol. The polymer hydrogel monolith was then physically disrupted, for example by milling, to form polymer hydrogel particles having an average diameter of less than about 30 mm. Unless stated otherwise, the particles were then rapidly frozen, generally by immersion in a cold fluid (e.g. liquid nitrogen or ethanol\/dry ice) and lyophilized. Generally, the lyophilizer shelf was pre-cooled to \u221250\u00b0 C. before loading a tray containing the frozen polymer hydrogel particles on the lyophilizer shelf. The chamber pressure for lyophilization was typically in the range of 50 to 1000 mTorr and the shelf temperature was in the range of +10 to +25\u00b0 C. Alternatively, the shelf temperature can be set lower, for example in the range of 0 to +10 C. Alternatively, the shelf temperature can be set higher, for example in the range of 25 to +40 C.","The dried polymer hydrogel was typically pyrolyzed by heating in a nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 1000-1200\u00b0 C. for a period of time as specified in the examples. Activation conditions generally comprised heating a pyrolyzed polymer hydrogel in a COatmosphere at temperatures ranging from 900-1000\u00b0 C. for a period of time as specified in the examples.

The results of this study are depicted in ,  and , which are graphs of surface area vs. pore size distribution for activated carbons made from the same dried polymer RF gels but activated under different process conditions as described below.","The curve shown in  corresponds to material pyrolyzed for 60 min at 1200\u00b0 C. and activated for 10 min at 900\u00b0 C. to yield a BET surface area of 1376 m\/gm. The typical large surface area peak between 0.5 and 0.6 nm as depicted in  is also present in this sample. In addition, significant well-defined surface area peaks are present at pore sizes between 0.7 and 0.8 nm and also at 1.2 nm. Re-activation of this same sample to a BET surface area of 2106 m\/gm (curve shown in ) maintained the same peak distribution but uniformly increased the peak height over the entire size range.","In the case of the curve shown in , the pyrolysis and activation conditions were modified as follows: pyrolysis for 60 min at 900\u00b0 C. followed directly by in situ activation for 14 min at 900\u00b0 C. This resulted in activation to 2930 m\/gm. The resulting surface area\/pore size distribution was significantly changed from the earlier processing conditions. The peak heights at pore sizes 0.7 nm to 0.8 nm and at 1.2 nm were higher, consistent with the increased total BET surface area. However, the peak centered at 5.5 nm disappeared and was replaced by two large peaks\u2014one centered at 0.5 nm and the other at 0.59 nm.","An RF hydrogel was prepared and sieved by hand to create polymer hydrogel particles as described below. The polymer hydrogel particles were frozen by gradually dropping the material into a stainless steel beaker containing liquid nitrogen. Once the entire sample was completely frozen, the frozen slurry of particles in liquid nitrogen was carefully poured into an 8-inch pan, which had been pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen, and the pan was placed on a lyophilization shelf (typically pre-cooled to at least \u221230\u00b0 C.).","For each freeze drying run in which a combination of shelf temperature and chamber pressure were tested, three samples were generated with different loadings and sieving. Two thermocouples were placed within each sample, with care taken to place thermocouples in the center, bottom of each sample, preferably without having the thermocouple directly contacting the pan. After the majority of liquid nitrogen boiled off from the samples loaded in the lyophilizer (as ascertained by visual inspection), the lyophilizer doors were sealed and vacuum pump started.","Samples were harvested after product thermocouples were within 2\u00b0 C. of the lyophilizer shelf. For runs conducted at a shelf temperature of +10\u00b0 C., the shelf was raised to +25\u00b0 C. for at least an hour prior to harvest to avoid possible condensation on the dried product. For the purpose of statistical modeling, drying time was defined as the time for all product thermocouples to reach at least within 2\u00b0 C. of the shelf temperature. An alternate analysis was conducted using an alternative definition for drying time as the time for all product thermocouples to reach at least within 4\u00b0 C. of the shelf temperature. The typical outputs (characteristics measured) were visual appearance (e.g., color) and low magnification stereomicroscopy, product yield (weight loss), tap density, and specific surface area.","A custom design of experiments (DOE) approach was employed to examine the effect of various input factors on the output. The input factors examined were: sample loading\/depth (two levels: 2 and 4 g\/in), gel particle\/sieving size (2 levels: 2000 microns and 4750 microns), shelf temperature setpoint (2 levels: 10\u00b0 C. and 25\u00b0 C.), and chamber pressure setpoint (4 levels: 100, 300, 700, and 1000 mTorr). In general, the actual measured chamber pressures and shelf temperatures were close to the intended setpoint. Additional runs were conducted in duplicate at a chamber pressure setpoint of 50 mTorr and shelf temperature setpoint of +10\u00b0 C. However, in this case, during the primary drying phase (first several hours of drying) the actual measured pressure was higher than the intended setpoint, with a reading spiking to a level in the range of 200-250 mTorr. A total of 11 runs are included herein, with three samples per run and two thermocouples in each sample to provide a grand total of 66 data points for the statistical analysis.

The product yields were very consistent among the various samples, ranging from 78-81%, with an average of about 81%. The measured tap densities ranged from about 0.15 to about 0.27 cc\/g (average=0.191 cc\/g, standard deviation=0.032 cc\/g). The various samples were analyzed for BET specific surface area. As the first step in the procedure, the samples were de-gassed. The weight loss for the various samples upon degassing ranged from 2.5% to 12.3% (average=5.7%, standard deviation=2.1%). Presumably, this variability in weight loss upon degassing illustrated the variation in residual moisture in the various samples after freeze drying and storage prior to the BET analysis. There is no obvious pattern between the weight loss upon degassing and other dried polymer gel characteristics or the lyophilization conditions tested.","A graph of the tap density vs. the specific surface area is presented in . The data show the general correlation that tap density decreases with increasing specific surface area (R=0.74). The relationship is logical considering that particles with higher specific surface area (and correspondingly higher specific pore volume) will have a lower envelope density, which would translate into a lower tap density for a given dried particle size.","There was a general trend that higher product loading and lower sieving size resulted in lower specific surface area. This trend is more evident when analyzing a particular experiment (where chamber pressure and shelf temperature are fixed).","Comparison of the data for specific surface area and the chamber pressure revealed a dramatic relationship (). There is correlation that specific surface area of the lyophilized polymer gel decreases with increasing chamber pressure during lyophilization (R=0.90). This finding demonstrates that, for a fixed polymer gel composition and fixed freezing method, control of the specific surface area in the dried polymer gel can be modulated by control of the lyophilization chamber pressure. This relationship can be rationalized, at least in part, by the concurrent observation that the product temperature during the initial phase of drying (i.e., primary drying) is also dependent on the chamber pressure; specifically, the lower the chamber pressure, generally the lower the product temperature during primary drying. A lower temperature during primary drying should also minimize the opportunity for collapse of product porosity in the frozen state, and hence provide higher surface area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0230"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of Characterization of Freeze Dried Samples"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Cham-",{},{},{},{},"Wt.","BET"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ber",{},"Siev-",{},"Tap","loss on","Specific"]},{"entry":[{},"Shelf","Pres-","Product","ing",{},"Den-","drying","Surface"]},{"entry":["Sam-","Temp","sure","Loading","Size","Yield","sity","for BET","Area"]},{"entry":["ple","(\u00b0 C.)","(mTorr)","(g\/in)","(um)","(%)","(cc\/g)","(%)","(m\/g)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["015-1","10","50","2","4750","81","0.162","6.7","390; 82"]},{"entry":["015-2",{},{},"4",{},"81","0.156","5.1","399"]},{"entry":["015-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.166","5.8","379"]},{"entry":["016-1","10","50","2","4750","80","0.170","5.6","367"]},{"entry":["016-2",{},{},"4",{},"80","0.161","3.9","342"]},{"entry":["016-3",{},{},"4","2000","80","0.197","12.3\u2002","332"]},{"entry":["008-1","10","100","2","4750","81","0.151","5.2","365"]},{"entry":["008-2",{},{},"4",{},"81","0.158","3.7","349"]},{"entry":["008-3",{},{},"4","2000","ND","0.171","4.6","347"]},{"entry":["006-1","10","300","2","4750","81","0.168","8.6","323"]},{"entry":["006-2",{},{},"4",{},"81","0.180","4.3","303"]},{"entry":["006-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.222","2.5","287"]},{"entry":["005-1","10","700","2","4750","78","0.220","5.7","250"]},{"entry":["005-2",{},{},"4",{},"80","0.222","3.8","246"]},{"entry":["005-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.244","ND","213"]},{"entry":["007-1","10","1000","2","4750","80","0.218","9.9","236"]},{"entry":["007-2",{},{},"4",{},"80","0.200","7.7","221"]},{"entry":["007-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.274","6.1","183"]},{"entry":["009-1","25","100","2","4750","80","0.155","6.4","372"]},{"entry":["009-2",{},{},"4",{},"80","0.152","6.3","358"]},{"entry":["009-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.211","3.9","347"]},{"entry":["014-1","25","300","2","4750","81","0.160","8.0","357"]},{"entry":["014-2",{},{},"4",{},"81","0.170","5.0","353"]},{"entry":["014-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.200","5.9","324"]},{"entry":["013-1","25","700","2","4750","80","0.190","5.0","245"]},{"entry":["013-2",{},{},"4",{},"81","0.210","5.7","254"]},{"entry":["013-3",{},{},"4","2000","81","0.240","5.7","250"]},{"entry":["012-1","25","1000","2","4750","81","0.155","5.1","215"]},{"entry":["012-2",{},{},"4",{},"81","0.152","2.3","199"]},{"entry":["012-3",{},{},{"sup":"\u2002"},"2000","81","0.211","5.2","150"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The RF hydrogel employed as the starting material in Example 3 was used herein to compare freezing of polymer hydrogel particles via snap freezing to freezing by immersion in liquid nitrogen.

A summary of the sample, the control, and the data for tap density and specific surface area for the dried polymer hydrogel are given in Table 7.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0231","num":"0232"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of Samples and Data for Example 4."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Siev-",{},"Specific"]},{"entry":[{},"Shelf","Chamber","Product","ing","Tap","Surface"]},{"entry":[{},"Temp.","Pressure","Loading","Size","Density","Area"]},{"entry":["Freezing","(\u00b0 C.)","(mTorr)","(g\/in)","(um)","(g\/cm)","(m\/g)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Liquid nitrogen","10","50","4","4750","0.16","349"]},{"entry":"freezing"},{"entry":"(control)"},{"entry":["Snap frozen",{},{},{},{},"0.42","0.3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The data reveal that snap freezing results in very low specific surface area of the dried polymer cryogel, only about 0.3 m\/g. In contrast, the control sample freeze dried in the same experiment exhibited a specific surface area of 349 m\/g. It was also noted that the snap frozen sample was very dense, exhibiting signs that \u201ccollapse\u201d had occurred upon lyophilization. To provide a quantitative comparison, the tap density of the snap frozen sample was measured and was indeed much greater than the control sample; 0.42 vs. 0.16 g\/cm, respectively.","This example illustrates that the relatively rapid freezing at relatively high temperature provided by snap freezing was not capable of yielding the high specific surface area that can be achieved by rapid, multidirectional freezing at very low temperature, for example, that accomplished by immersion of RF hydrogel particles in liquid nitrogen.","The RF hydrogel of Example 3 was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to discern the nature of any thermal events occurring during freezing. A representative thermogram is depicted in . The data show a large exothermic peak exhibited upon cooling at approximately \u221218\u00b0 C. This event suggests that in order to achieve complete freezing of the material that the temperature must be brought to at least this temperature or below. Upon warming, there was a complex behavior seen, with several melting endotherms over the range of about \u22122 to +1 C, suggesting melting of different types of microstructures, and further supporting the conclusion that freezing drying conditions should be carefully selected to maintain fine product structure during the initial drying stage as discussed in more detail above.","The various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments.
