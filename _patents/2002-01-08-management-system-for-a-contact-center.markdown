{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to a management system for use in forming a contact centre, a system and method for controlling access to an application, and to a system and method for managing the relationship between parties using a contact centre.","Large businesses have traditionally created call centres to handle telephone enquiries, telesales, service requests, and complaints from their customers. A contact centre is the modern equivalent of the call centre, providing access through the Internet in addition to the traditional telephone service. The Internet allows a business contact centre to provide customer service by a wide variety of means, including web-based forms and information pages, email, voice-over-IP (VoIP), internet relay chat (IRC) and streaming video. However, contact centres can be difficult and expensive to create and manage. Moreover, the dynamic nature of businesses today means that the needs of their customers are also dynamic. To service their customers, businesses may find that they need to create a new contact centre, hire and train customer service representatives, and bring the centre online, all at short notice. Even businesses with existing call centres may need to enlarge them for a short period of time\u2014just after a new product release, for example\u2014and then subsequently re-dimension them again by reducing their size some time later.","The operation of a call centre typically involves a large number of relationships between the various parties involved. In particular, the staffing of a call centre with customer service representatives may involve direct recruitment, or indirect recruitment through engaging the services of one or more customer service representative brokers. The maintenance of these relationships and up-to-date information on the various parties can be complex, time-consuming and expensive.","Customer service representatives working in call centres utilise customer and product\/service information to effectively serve customers. Consequently, the customer service representatives are given access to the database applications used within the business that provide the necessary information. These applications can be partially integrated in the call centre by computer telephony integration (CTI). For example, when a customer telephones the call centre, CTI provides the customer's telephone number to a database application which can use the n umber to automatically retrieve the customer's records for the customer service representative. However, this requires the database application to support CTI, and the customer service representative to be physically present in a contact centre equipped with CTI infrastructure. Moreover, the database application may be distinct from the application used to service customers, and the process of integrating the two may be difficult and time-consuming.","It is desired, therefore, to provide a method and system for controlling access to an application, a system and method for managing the relationship between parties using a contact centre, and a contact centre management system that alleviate one or more of the above difficulties, or at least provide a useful alternative.","In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for sending application data to an application, including","generating control data by monitoring interactions between said application and a user of said application; and","sending application data to said application on the basis of said control data.","The present invention also provides a method for extracting application data from output of an application, including","generating control data by monitoring interactions between said application and a user of said application; and","extracting application data from output of said application on the basis of said control data.","The present invention also provides a method for extracting data from an application, including:","generating control data by monitoring interactions between said application and a user of said application;","sending first application data to said application on the basis of said control data; and","extracting second application data from output of said application on the basis of said control data.","The present invention also provides a method for transferring application data from a first application to a second application, including:","generating first control data by monitoring interactions between said first application and a user of said first application;","generating second control data by monitoring interactions between said second application and a user of said second application;","extracting application data from output of said first application on the basis of said first control data; and","sending said application data to said second application on the basis of said second control data.","The present invention also provides a method for sending application data to an application, including","sending, to a computer system hosting said application, a learning robot adapted to generate control data by monitoring interactions between said application and a user of said application; and","sending application data to said application on the basis of said control data.","The present invention also provides an application management system, including","a learning robot adapted to generate control data by monitoring interactions between an application and a user of said application;","an execution robot for sending application data to said application on the basis of said control data.","The present invention also provides a management system, including:","an access component for obtaining access data for connecting to a system of a business adapted to execute an application;","a learning robot for monitoring execution of events to use said application; and","an execution robot adapted to provide remote access to said application on the basis of said access data and said events.","The present invention also provides a method for configuring access to an application, including:","receiving at a server interface access data for connecting to a business system adapted to execute the application;","transmitting to the business system a learning robot adapted to monitor operating system events generated during use of the application; and","remotely accessing and executing the application on the basis of said access data and said events.","The present invention also provides a management system for a contact centre, including:","an interface for receiving configuration data from an administrator of said contact centre;","a database for storing said configuration data; and","a configuration component adapted to configure components of a contact centre on the basis of said configuration data.","The present invention also provides a relationship management system, including:","a messaging component for receiving and sending relationship data between parties involved in operating a contact centre; and","a database component for maintaining profile data on said parties, said profile data including association data representing associations established between said parties.","A contact centre management system (CCMS) , as shown in , automates the processes of creating, activating, re-dimensioning and deactivating contact centres. In particular, it enables businesses to create one or more contact centres on demand. The contact centre management system  has a web-based application  that provides a network-accessible interface between a party  and a contact centre management (CCMS) server  of the system . The party  may be a business, a customer service representative broker (CSRB), customer service representative (CSR), or a contact centre (CC) administrator who accesses the CCMS  using a computer system or device. Access may be local, or remote over a communications network, such as the Internet. The server  stores and retrieves contact centre management data contained in a database . The database  includes profiles for businesses, services, billing, customer service applications, customer service representative brokers, customer service representatives, workforce management and call routing, etc. The server  also interfaces with contact media , a billing engine , a customer service application management system (CSAMS) , a relationship management server (RMS)  and a number of middle-tier application products . The middle-tier application products  are used by the contact centre management system  for managing contacts, including contact queuing, routing, monitoring and history tracking. In the described embodiment, the components or modules  to  of the CCMS  are implemented as software modules executed on standard computer systems such as Intel\u00ae-based computer systems running a Windows\u00ae operating system. However, it will be apparent that at least some or parts of the modules can be implemented by dedicated hardware circuits such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).","A contact centre administrator within a business is able to use a web browser to create a new account and to request the creation of a new contact centre configuration by completing and submitting application forms provided by the web interface  of the contact centre management system . In order to create a new contact centre, customer service representatives (CSRs) are hired and trained. Alternatively, the business may already have some trained CSRs within the business. A customer service representative broker (CSRB) is a company that provides CSRs for contact centres. The process of staffing a contact centre with CSRs involves a number of key relationships, particularly those between the business wanting the new contact centre and one or more CSRBs and\/or CSRs, and those between CSRBs and CSRs. These relationships are managed by the relationship management server (RMS) . The RMS  provides a central point of access for the business to review the portfolios of various CSRBs and\/or CSRs and to request their services if desired. Alternatively, CSRBs can bid against other CSRBs on a contact centre service trading platform to provide their services to the business. The contact centre service trading platform is a generic trading product which is integrated within the CCMS (whether it is activated will depend on the business that operates the contact centre management system  (the contact centre service provider)), but can alternatively be provided by an external organisation.","The relationships between CSRs and CSRBs are managed by the RMS  in a similar fashion to the business\/CSRB relationship. The subsequent steps of negotiating service agreements between the parties involved, and the coordination of these activities with the contact centre service provider (CCSP) are all managed by the RMS . The processes executed by the RMS  are described in more detail below.","The business contact centre administrator initiates configuration of the various components of the contact centre by completing and submitting the web-based forms. The information provided includes the location of the business knowledge base (i.e., information about the products and\/or services of the business, preferably in electronic form, in which case the location can be a universal resource indicator, network address, pathname, etc.) and training materials, any required customer service applications (CSAs), the required contact queues and routing strategy, what media are to be enabled to handle contacts (e.g., PSTN, VoIP, email, chat, video, IVR, &c.), the scheduling of CSRs, and the messages to be used in response to callers. This information is stored in the database , and is used to configure the underlying contact centre servers (e.g., PSTN, VoIP call handling servers, chat, co-browse, IVR, speech recognition, desktop interaction servers), and the web application  using application programming interface (API) calls and\/or direct database modification. After configuration of these or other necessary components, the contact centre administrator nominates the time at which the contact centre is to become active and its operating hours.","At any time, the business contact centre administrator can use the interface  to review the status of the contact centre either before activation, during operation or after termination. During operation, the contact centre administrator can review statistics on the performance of the contact centre, and can reconfigure, redimension, pause or terminate the contact centre. The contact centre management system  provides administrators with a simple tool for identifying contact centre requirements (e.g., number of CSRs, operating hours, routing, media, CSR schedules, etc.), and facilitating the management of CSRBs and CSRs through relationship and workforce management. Administrators can use the interface  to activate the requirements, once they have been identified, and to continually manage the states of business relationships and the scheduling of CSRs. The activation and management is performed by the CCMS server , which configures the contact centre components and the middle-tier products  using API calls and\/or direct database manipulation.","Customer service representatives (CSRs) working for contact centres need to access customer, product and service information that is accessed through customer service applications (CSAs) belonging to the business requiring the contact centre. The customer service application management system (CSAMS)  integrates existing business applications with the contact centre management system , and allows CSRs to access customer service applications locally and\/or remotely.","As shown in , the CSAMS  includes CSAMS server(s) , CSA proxy server(s) , a CSA learning robot ,  and a CSA execution robot , . The CSA learning robot ,  comprises a CSA learning robot front-end or graphical user interface (GUI) component , and a CSA learning robot back-end component . Similarly, the CSA execution robot ,  comprises a CSA execution robot front-end or GUI component , and a CSA execution robot back-end component . The CSAMS  automates many of the tasks involved in accessing, navigating and exchanging data with a customer service application (CSA). Typically, a business protects its networks  by placing a main firewall  between the networks  and the Internet . This firewall  allows outside access to a public web server  that provides information to the general public. An intranet firewall  prevents public access to the business intranet  for security purposes. The intranet  provides access for CSRs located within the business to CSA host computers  and . One host computer  may include Windows\u00ae, Unix like or mainframe based CSAs, and may be served directly or via a Windows\u00ae terminal server, whereas the other host computer  may be a web server having web-based CSAs.","The CSAMS  executes a configuration process, as shown in . The CSAMS server  stores one or more profiles for each CSA which contain all of the access and automation information on that CSA. When a business administrator accesses the CSAMS server  (at step ), the server  asks (at step ) whether the administrator wishes to create a new CSA profile. If the answer is no, the administrator is asked (at step ) to choose an existing CSA profile to reconfigure. If a new profile is required, the CSAMS server  creates a new CSA profile (at step ). At step , the CSAMS server  prompts for the CSA type and instructs the administrator to change (if required) the configurations of the main firewall  and the intranet firewall  of the business network  to ensure that the CSA host computers ,  are accessible via the Internet . The CSAMS server  also prompts for the locations of the CSA host computers ,  (e.g., URLs, network addresses, etc.) and instructs the business to make any necessary changes to the CSA and support infrastructure to allow the CSA to be accessed via the Internet , and if desired, in a secure manner. During this step, the CSAMS server  also prompts the business to supply information on how CSRs can access the CSA, including whether the CSA requires user authentication. At step , the CSAMS server  asks the administrator whether the CSA can be successfully launched locally and\/or remotely (as required), using a web-based desktop application configured on the basis of the supplied information. In response, the administrator attempts to launch the application as instructed. At step , the administrator selects a button to indicate the test result. If the test failed, the CSAMS server  leads the business through the configuration of step  again until either the access test succeeds or the business pauses the configuration procedure (giving the business the chance to rectify the problems and resume the configuration at a later time).","Once the administrator is able to access the CSA (securely if required by the business) based on the information collected by the CMAMS server , at step  the CSAMS optionally offers to maintain the username\/password pairs on the CSAMS server  so that it can auto-login CSRs. If this option is not available, or offered but declined, the CSRs will have to login to the CSA manually. At step , the CSAMS prompts the business to choose a level of CSA automation: basic, which merely launches the CSA, or advanced, which retrieves the customer record and is able to perform complex CSA interaction on behalf of the CSR.","In order for the CSAMS  to automate the interactions with a CSA, it must learn how to interact with the CSA by monitoring, at step , the interaction between a human and the CSA during a training process, described in detail below. Later, the CSAMS  can replicate those interactions in order to reach a certain screen of the CSR, starting from a known base screen, enter and\/or retrieve some data from an editable field, and return to the base screen (if required), for example. After the training process, the business administrator's demonstrated interactions with the CSA are replayed by executing at step  one or more compiled automation scripts with the CSA. If the administrator is not satisfied with the automation (step ), the script(s) may be modified manually, or the training repeated (returning to step ). Otherwise, the configuration is completed and the profile is updated (step ). The CSA profile is then ready for use.","To train the CSAMS  how to interact with a particular CSA (step ), the business administrator loads a page via the web interface  that downloads the CSAMS learning robot front-end  from the CSAMS server  to the administrator's computer . The CSAMS learning robot front-end  is a software module that executes on the administrator's computer  and communicates with and provides a graphical user interface to the CSAMS learning robot back-end . The CSAMS learning robot back-end  is a software module, that runs in the background and monitors the administrator's interactions with the CSA. The location of the CSAMS learning robot back-end  depends upon the type of CSA being trained. For example, if the CSA is a Windows\u00ae application executing locally on the administrator's computer , then the CSAMS learning robot back-end  executes also locally on the administrator's computer . This also applies if the CSA is a web-based application executing on the web server , being accessed by a web browser application executing on the administrator's computer . However, CSAs are often Windows\u00ae applications executing remotely on the application server , in which case the CSAMS learning robot back-end  also executes remotely on the application server , and this is the situation shown in . This also applies to the location of the CSAMS execution robot back-end .","The training process, as shown in , begins when, upon loading, the CSAMS learning robot ,  launches the CSA automatically (step ). Using a menu of the CSAMS learning robot front-end , the administrator instructs (step ) the CSAMS learning robot back-end  to begin recording the interactions with the CSA. The CSAMS learning robot back-end  includes sub-modules for each type of CSA (e.g., local and remote Windows\u00ae-based CSAs, and web-based CSAs). For Windows\u00ae-based CSAs (including terminal emulation CSAs), the CSAMS learning robot back-end  starts monitoring operating system events (e.g., Windows\u00ae events) in order to record the data being sent from the keyboard and\/or other user input devices to the CSA.","Prior to training, the administrator enters a list of call parameters that would normally be collected from the caller (e.g., through an IVR and\/or web forms). During training, these parameters are associated with CSA usage (e.g., entered data, menu options, etc.). At step , the CSAMS learning robot back-end  monitors and records keystrokes (e.g., TAB, ALT-F, ENTER, etc.) and optionally, events generated by other user input devices such as a mouse.","The administrator navigates to the appropriate screen and fields in order to enter some data, for example, a customer identification number, customer name, telephone number or product type etc. After reaching the desired screen of the CSA, the administrator instructs the learning robot back-end  to stop recording by selecting from a menu (step ). The recorded session is then displayed as a script of the interactive session to allow the administrator to review and edit the script (step ). At step , the administrator selects another menu of the CSAMS learning robot front-end  and identifies the call parameters to be associated with each field. Each CSA application menu and\/or menu option can also be associated with one or more call parameters. For example, the administrator can associate data entered into a particular field by selecting the data from the displayed session script, and then selecting one of the available call parameters from a list box displayed by the learning robot front-end . This replaces the data in the script with a tagged reference to the selected call parameter. The scripts therefore include parameter tags which are replaced during call handling by the data accompanying the call (call parameters). The parameter tags are used later by the CSAMS execution robot ,  to enter data or select a CSA menu option based on the actual data obtained during the call. The script is saved at step  when the administrator, through a menu, instructs the CSAMS learning robot ,  to do so. As an alternative to making field-parameter associations after learning, the administrator can make associations during CSA interactions. In this case, the script is not presented to the administrator until the recording is stopped.","Optionally, the user can enter conditional statements to define script flows or execution steps based on the actual data obtained during the call. This allows for different CSA usage based on different data received.","Upon completion of learning, the administrator can instruct (step ) the CSAMS learning robot ,  to replay the recorded interactions for verification. If one or more associations were made, the learning robot ,  prompts the administrator for call parameter value(s) so that they can be inserted into their associated field(s), menu(s) and\/or menu options(s) during the verification process. If the administrator is not satisfied with the replayed automation, the script may be modified manually (step ), or the script deleted (step ) and the training repeated (step ). Otherwise, the administrator instructs the CSAMS learning robot ,  to complete training via a menu, and the learning robot ,  automatically uploads the final script to the CSAMS server  at step .","Web-based CSAs are handled in a similar fashion. During training, the CSAMS learning robot back-end  executing on the business computer  monitors user interactions and web-browser events locally. An alternative method for web-based CSA training is also provided, whereby the administrator is asked to set focus on a web page field and then select the associated call parameter(s) from a call parameter window of the CSAMS learning robot front-end . This process can be repeated as necessary to create the required call parameter associations.","The administrator can optionally create return-scripts by training the CSAMS learning robot  to return the CSA to its initial state, or to return to a certain screen from another one. For example, before executing an automation script, the robot determines the application's current active screen (in focus) and executes a return-script in order to return the application to the base screen prior to executing the automation script. The return-script training process is similar to that described above.","When the training is complete, the CSAMS learning robot back-end  compiles CSA automation scripts and, if required, return-scripts for that CSA, and subunits them to the CSAMS server .","The CSAMS execution robot front-end  executes on a computer  used by a CSR to handle contacts. As described above, the CSAMS execution robot back-end  executes remotely on the application server , as shown in , for Windows\u00ae-based CSA applications also executing on the application server . For web-based or locally executing applications, the CSAMS execution robot back-end  executes locally on the CSR's computer . Similar to the CSAMS learning robot back-end , the CSAMS execution robot back-end  includes sub-modules for each type of CSA (e.g., local and remote Windows\u00ae-based CSAs, web-based CSAs etc.) The process used to control CSAs is shown in . When a CSR logs into the contact centre management system  (step ), the CSAMS  optionally enables network access and launches all of the CSAs for each business that the CSR works for (step ). For a local Windows\u00ae-based CSA, the CSAMS execution robot ,  launches it locally on the CSR's computer . For a remote Windows\u00ae-based CSA, the CSAMS execution robot ,  opens a network connection between the Windows\u00ae application server  and the CSR's computer  and launches the appropriate CSA. For a web-based CSA, the CSAMS execution robot ,  loads the CSA either directly from a business web server  or via the CSA proxy server .","When the CSR handles a contact which requires access to a CSA, the system behaviour depends upon the level of automation selected during the configuration process. Regardless of the automation level, the CSAMS execution robot ,  first launches the CSA and performs auto-login if required (step ), and makes visible the local CSA, the web page or terminal client window on the CSR's computer  to provide access for the CSR to the CSA. If the automation level for the CSA was selected as basic, then the CSR interacts with the CSA in the usual manner by entering data and navigating through the CSA manually. Alternatively, if the automation level was selected as advanced the appropriate automation steps are executed. For example, known data fields can be filled in and\/or menu options selected automatically using the call parameters so that the appropriate information and\/or screen is displayed to the CSR as the call is being handled. The CSAMS execution robot ,  makes such automation possible by replacing (step ) the tagged call parameter names in the automation scripts created by the CSAMS learning robot ,  during the training process with their corresponding values for the current call, and replaying (step ) the resulting scripts.","For example, a CSA script that enables viewing of a customer insurance policy based on the customer's policy number may include a tag called <policy_number> that is replaced by the actual policy number collected by an IVR system or a web form etc. Similarly, CSA menu options are described in the scripts by menu\/option tags, which are replaced during call handling by the data accompanying the call. For example, menu or dialog items can be handled by using keyboard shortcuts, in which case the selection of an item is represented simply as a series of keystrokes, such as ALT-F+S effecting selection of the Save option in the File menu of a typical Windows\u00ae application. Alternatively, if a shortcut is not defined for an option, the ALT, arrow, TAB and\/or ENTER keys can be used. Otherwise, menu selection events can be sent to the application by the CSAMS execution robot back-end . Optionally, when the CSR accepts a call related to another business, the previous business'CSA screen is disabled prior to enabling the next business'CSA screen.","After replacing the tagged parameters with the corresponding call parameter values, the resulting script is replayed and the CSA displays the desired screen and data (step ). When the CSR is ready to accept another call, the CSAMS execution robot ,  optionally executes return-script(s) to bring the CSA back to a particular state and\/or screen (step ).","During the execution of scripts for time-critical CSAs, the CSAMS execution robot ,  optionally checks the state of the CSA before replaying each recorded event in order to ensure events are replayed at the appropriate destination.","It will be apparent that the locations of various components described are not limited to those described above. For example, CSA hosts ,  for remote access may reside outside of the business' network , such as on a third-party application hosting service provider's network, or even on the CCSP's network. Similarly, the business computer , which the business administrator uses for CSAMS configuration, can reside within or outside the business' network , or on the CCSP's network. This flexibility also applies to the CSR computer .","The CSAMS  therefore provides a tool for interfacing with existing and future CSA applications. It integrates any customer service application with the contact centre management system , providing screen pop-up functionality and auto data entry and retrieval without the need for software integration. It will be apparent that the CSAMS  can also be applied to applications that are not associated with a contact centre. For example, the learning and execution robots  to  can be utilised to extract data from one application and insert it into another, without requiring software integration. These applications can be of a wide variety of types and located anywhere that is accessible by a communications network. In this scenario, a first CSAMS execution robot back-end  uses one or more first automation scripts with tagged parameters for a first application to send data to that application, as described above. A second CSAMS execution robot back-end  uses one or more second automation scripts with tagged parameters for a second application to extract data from the output generated by that application. The second CSAMS execution robot back-end  automation scripts are triggered through one or more defined user-generated events within the automation scripts. For example, on clicking a specific button or a field losing focus within the second application, the second CSAMS execution robot back-end  executes a data gathering automation script, collecting data desired before transferring it on to the first CSAMS execution robot back-end . The first CSAMS execution robot back-end  executes an automation script using the data received from the second CSAMS execution robot back-end . The data is extracted by using the second automation script as a template for comparing with the output generated by the second application. A data field is identified by matching an alphanumeric string appearing at the location of the parameter in the automation script. For more complex data values, regular expressions can be included in the automation script, either within the tagged parameter fields or in the remainder of the script. Parameters extracted in this way can then be sent to the other CSAMS execution robot back-end , possibly executing on a remote computer system, which then inserts one or more of the extracted parameters into the automation script for the first application. Thus data generated by the second application is automatically extracted from its output, and provided to the first application, effectively integrating the two applications without requiring any modification of either application. In some situations, the second CSMAS execution robot back-end  and second application may not be required, with access to the first application occurs through programmed APIs. The APIs allow the specification of automation scripts and parameter data. It will also be apparent that data can be sent to and extracted from the same application.","The relationship management server (RMS)  is the component of the CCMS  that controls the relationship between a business requiring a contact centre and a customer service representative broker (CSRB), as shown in . The process as executed can be broken up into four major steps: (i) the initiation of the relationship , (ii) the commencement, pausing, or termination of the relationship by the business , or (iii) by the CSRB , and finally (iv) the operation of the relationship during the business\/CSRB association . Each of these steps comprises a number of sub-steps. The process can be modified to suit each individual business\/CSRB relationship. A business or CSRB can modify the process to suit their relationship requirements by altering the order of steps, remove steps or add steps. Hence, when controlling the relationship between a business and CSRB, the RMS  uses the corresponding modified execution process.","The relationship may be initiated by either the business or the CSRB. If the business initiates contact, then the process begins with the business initiating contact at step . First, a business retrieves from the RMS  a list of CSRBs wishing to serve a contact centre and their portfolios (step ). From this list, the business posts a \u201crequest of interest\u201d in a particular CSRB with the RMS , along with a description of the contact centre requirements (step ). The RMS  forwards this request to the intended CSRB for consideration (step ). If the CSRB wishes to establish a relationship with the business, then it notifies the business directly (step ).","Alternatively, a relationship between a particular business and a particular CSRB can be initiated by the CSRB (step ). In this scenario, the business posts a request for service from interested CSRBs to the RMS  (step ). A CSRB interested in establishing new relationships can retrieve from the RMS  a list of any businesses requesting CSRB services and their portfolios (step ). The CSRB can then approach the business with the intention to establish a business relationship (step ).","Alternatively, to alleviate the need for either a business or a CSRB to initiate contact, both parties may approach a contact centre service trading platform. As a service offered by the CCSP or an external organisation, the trading platform allows CSRBs to bid against each other for the right to serve a business's contact centre. Bidding can involve the offering of price, quality, or any other feature that a CSRB can offer as part of their service to a business's contact centre. Alternatively, the initiation of a business relationship can also be achieved without the assistance of the RMS . Ultimately, the RMS  needs only to know if an association should exist between any registered CCSP parties (business, CSRB, CSR) for the contact centre management system  to perform correctly.","When a business and a CSRB wish to establish a business relationship, they externally negotiate all conditions of contract independently of the RMS  (step ). Once settled, the RMS  is informed by the business of the new business relationship (step ). The business also submits a service level agreement (SLA) to the RMS  (step ), defining the conditions of the business\/CSRB relationship. The SLA can act as a guide for the RMS  to notify either party of breaches in the conditions of contact. The SLA contains a number of parameters that relate to the operation of the contact centre (for example, end-user queuing time, end-user handling time, average agent grading, etc.). These parameters can be monitored by the contact centre management system , and a notification sent to the appropriate parties if any of these parameters are breached. The RMS  notifies the CSRB of the association (step ), and the CSRB then accepts or declines the association (step ). If accepted, then the RMS  forms an association between the two parties and notifies the business that the association is recognised by the CCSP (step ). The RMS  does not need to know the details of a business relationship existing between any two parties, but only whether or not they should be interacting in accordance with their association.","The association between a business and a CSRB may be started, paused or terminated at any time (steps , ). This may be initiated by the business notifing the RMS  of the change in status (step ), in which case the RMS  notifies the CSRB (step ). Conversely, the CSRB may notify the RMS  of the change in status (step ), and the RMS  then notifies the business (step ).","Having established their association, the business and the CSRB work together to staff the business contact centre (step ). As the CSRB is the supplier of CSRs, the CSRB first nominates a list of CSRs to serve in the contact centre and sends this to the RMS  (step ). The RMS  notifies the business of the proposed CSRs (step ). The business reviews the list and informs the RMS  which CSRs it deems acceptable to train for the contact centre (step ). The RMS  forwards this information to the CSRB (step ) and the CSRB trains the approved CSRs. When the training is complete, the CSRB notifies the RMS  whether it confirms or denies that each CSR is appropriately trained (step ). When confirmed, the RMS  notifies the business (step ) that there are trained CSRs that wish to be certified, and the business subsequently performs the contact centre examination (step ). The business grades the CSRs and informs the RMS  of the result (step ). If the CSR performed adequately in the examination, the business notifies the RMS  that the CSR is approved to work in the contact centre (step ). The RMS  subsequently informs the CSRB that the CSR is approved to begin work (step ), and the CSRB grants or denies approval for the CSR to begin work (step ).","During the staffing of the business contact centre, the CSRB nominates the working hours and percentage of time that each CSR can be allocated to the business. The business then uses a Workforce Management System to schedule the CSRs on contact centre activities within the boundaries provided by the CSRB.","The RMS  also controls the CSRB\/CSR relationship, as shown in . This relationship may be divided into four major parts: (i) initiation , (ii) CSRB-initiated status changes , (iii) CSR-initiated status changes , and (iv) normal association . The initiation phase  can begin with CSR-initiated steps  or CSRB-initiated steps . A CSR can begin the relationship by registering with the CCSP on the RMS  (step ). After registration, the CSR retrieves a list of CSRBs requesting CSRs and their portfolios from the RMS  (step ). If the CSR wishes to register with a particular CSRB, the CSR makes direct contact with the CSRB, indicating the desire to establish a business relationship (step ).","Alternatively, the process can begin when a CSR notifies the RMS  that he or she wishes to work for a CSRB (step ). A CSRB requests from the RMS  a list of available CSRs and their portfolios (step ). If the CSRB wishes to employ a particular CSR, the CSRB notifies them directly (step ).","Having made contact, the CSRB and CSR negotiate the terms of their business relationship (step ). The CSRB then informs the RMS  of the desire to form a new association with the CSR (step ), and the RMS  notifies the CSR (step ). The CSR then accepts or declines the association (step ), and the RMS  sends confirmation messages to both parties (step ).","Once initiated, the association between a CSRB and a CSR can be started, paused, or terminated when the CSRB sends a message to the RMS  (step ) and the RMS  notifies the CSR (step ). Alternatively, the relationship can be started, paused, or terminated when the CSR sends a message to the RMS  (step ) and the RMS  notifies the CSRB (step ).","During their association, the CSRB can post to the RMS  an updated list of business contact centres that the CSRs can service (step ). CSRs can retrieve this list (step ) and notify the RMS  of those contact centres that they wish to serve (step ). The RMS  informs the CSRB of this choice (step ).","When a CSR wishes to work for a particular contact centre, they must first be trained. Having received a list of the contact centres that a particular CSR wishes to work for, the CSRB grants permission to the CSR to begin training for each contact centre that it chooses, by sending a message to the RMS  (step ), which then informs the CSR (step ). The CSR learns the appropriate training materials and then responds to the RMS  when they are ready to be examined (step ). The CSR performs the contact centre examination (step ) and, if appropriate; the CSRB sends a message to the RMS  granting permission for the CSR to begin serving the contact centre (step ). The RMS  notifies the CSR (step ). When the CSR wishes to begin working for the contact centre, the CSR notifies the RMS  (step ) which notifies the CSRB (step ).","At any time, the CSRB can start, pause or terminate the contact centre service by sending a message to the RMS  (step ), which notifies the CSR (step ). Conversely, the CSR can notify the RMS  that they wish to start, pause or terminate their contact centre service (step ), and the RMS  notifies the CSRB (step ).","Many modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"p":["Preferred embodiments of the present invention are hereinafter described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
