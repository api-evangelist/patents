Technical Field","Example embodiments of the present invention relate in general to a group control method for providing a machine type communication (MTC) service and a mobile communication system using the method, and more particularly, to a group control method for an MTC service that controls an MTC group consisting of a plurality of MTC devices in a mobile communication system based on Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced and a mobile communication system using the method.","2. Related Art","MTC or machine-to-machine communication (M2M) is a form of data communication which involves one or more entities that do not necessarily need human interaction. A service optimized for MTC differs from a service optimized for human-to-human communication. In comparison with a current mobile network communication service, MTC can bpe characterized by a) several market scenarios, b) data communications, c) lower cost and less effort, d) a potentially larger number of communicating terminals, e) a wider service area, and f) very low traffic per terminal.","MTC may be implemented in various forms of service, for example, smart metering, tracking and tracing, remote maintenance and control, and e-health.","Lately, 3GPP has also been working on MTC standardization for intelligent communication between a human and a machine and between machines. For various types of MTC applications having main functions of smart metering, remote control, etc., a huge number of MTC devices are disposed and managed.","In 3GPP LTE systems, MTC devices and general user equipments (or user terminals) are both treated as user equipments (or user terminals), and thus MTC devices also need to be individually registered in an LTE network. The disposition of multiple MTC devices causes scheduling competition for channel allocation, exhaustion of radio resources, overload resulting from signal generation, and so on, thereby exerting a bad influence on general user equipments. With an emphasis put on minimization of the adverse effect caused by the disposition of MTC devices, 3GPP has been working on standardization.","Meanwhile, due to characteristics of MTC devices, an operator can categorize multiple MTC devices of the same kind as one group and manage the devices together. When MTC devices are categorized as an MTC group and managed, several advantages can be obtained in terms of device control and management, billing, etc., and signal overload can be reduced compared to individual terminal control. In particular, network resources are saved when there are many MTC devices.","Although 3GPP has adopted the concept of categorizing and managing MTC devices as an MTC group and is currently drawing requirements from the concept, no effective solution has been proposed yet.","Accordingly, example embodiments of the present invention are provided to substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","Example embodiments of the present invention provide a method of allocating a machine type communication (MTC) device to an MTC group in a mobile communication system based on Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced, a group control method for an MTC service controlling an MTC device belonging to an MTC group using the method, and a mobile communication system using the group control method.","In some example embodiments, a group control method for an MTC service includes: categorizing one or more MTC devices into one or more MTC groups, and assigning MTC group Identifiers (Identifiers) to respective MTC groups; setting MTC radio network temporary identifiers (RNTIS) according to the MTC group Identifiers; and using the MTC_RNTIs for addressing the MTC devices belonging to the respective MTC groups.","Categorizing the one or more MTC devices into the one or more MTC groups, and assigning the MTC group Identifiers to the respective MTC groups may include: determining, by a mobility management entity (MME) receiving an attach request from a terminal, whether or not the terminal is an MTC device, and whether or not the terminal belongs to an MTC group; and when the terminal having requested the attachment is dete mined to be an MTC device, including, by the MME, an MTC group Identifier in an attach accept message and transmitting the attach accept message to a base station.","Setting the MTC_RNTIs according to the MTC group Identifiers may include: receiving, by the base station, an attach accept message including the MTC group Identifiers from a network; allocating the MTC_RNTIs according to the MTC group Identifiers; and transmitting mapping information between the MTC group Identifiers and the MTC_RNTIs to the MTC devices.","The mapping information between the MTC group Identifiers and the MTC_RNTIs may be transmitted by a radio resource control (RRC) connection reconfiguration message.","Setting the MTC_RNTIs according to the MTC group Identifiers may further include: registering, by the MTC devices receiving the MTC group Identifiers and the MTC_RNTIs, the MTC group Identifiers as their Identifiers.","Using the MTC_RNTIs for addressing the MTC devices belonging to the MTC groups may include: transmitting, by the base station, a paging message including the MTC group Identifiers and paging record information; obtaining, by one or more MTC devices in the corresponding MTC group receiving the paging message, record information corresponding to their MTC group Identifiers; transmitting, by the base station, downlink data addressed with an MTC_RNTI of the MTC group; and receiving, by the one or more MTC devices in the MTC group, the downlink data addressed with the MTC_RNTI.","The base station controls a transmission time and the MTC device controls a reception time so that the downlink data transmission can be performed in a reception window time period of the MTC_RNTI a predetermined time after transmission of the paging message.","In other example embodiments, a mobile communication system performing group control for an MTC service includes: an MME configured to categorize one or more MTC devices into one or more MTC groups, and assign MTC group identifiers to respective MTC groups; and a base station configured to set MTC_RNTIs according to the MTC group identifiers, and use the MTC_RNTIs for addressing the MTC devices belonging to the MTC groups.","In other example embodiments, a base station communicating with a network and one or more MTC device receives MTC group identifiers from the network, sets MTC_RNTIs according to the MTC group identifiers, and uses the MTC_RNTIs for addressing the MTC devices belonging to MTC groups.","The base station may perform addressing using RNTIs distinguished according to the MTC devices when communication between the base station and the MTC devices is performed in a one-to-one mode, and using the MTC_RNTIs when the communication between the base station and the MTC devices is performed in an MTC group mode.","Using the constitution according to example embodiments of the present invention, MTC devices can be categorized into MTC groups and controlled in a 3GPP LTE-Advanced system. Thus, it is possible to reduce the load of controlling a network for the MTC devices and save wired and radio resources.","Example embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein.

The MTC server  has an interface that can be accessed by the MTC user , and provides service for the MTC user . The MTC user  uses the service provided by the MTC server .","In the constitution of , the MTC server  is controlled by a network operator, who provides an application programming interface (API) to the MTC server . The MTC user  accesses the MTC server  of the network operator through the API.","In , the MTC server  is included in a network operator domain. However, the MTC server  may not be located in the network operator domain but may be located outside the network operator domain. In this case, the MTC server  is not controlled by the network operator.","Also, the MTC device  needs to communicate with the MTC server , etc. disposed in the network through a base station (not shown). A base station according to an example embodiment of the present invention sets MTC radio network temporary identifiers (MTC_RNTIs) according to MTC group identifiers (IDs), and uses the MTC radio network temporary identifiers for addressing MTC devices belonging to MTC groups.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"A terminal needs to be registered in a radio communication network so as to access the network and receive service.  illustrates a general registration process of a terminal in which attachment is used.","A base station  and an MME  in a network perform a terminal registration process. Here, the MME  is a control node that processes signaling between a UE and a core network (CN). Main functions of the MME  include functions related to bearer management and functions related to connection management.","The network includes a database as a means of the registration process. An attach request from a general terminal  is transferred via the base station  (S) to the MME  (S), and the MME  receiving the attach request in the network responds to the attach request with an attach accept message (S and S). In this process, radio resource control (RRC) connection reconfiguration is performed between the terminal  and the base station  (S and S). In the meanwhile, initial context setup is performed between the base station  and the MME  (S and S). The terminal  receiving the attach accept message transfers an attach complete message to the network (S and S), thereby informing the base station  and the MME  that the attachment process has been successfully completed.","The network defines a state of the terminal  that has been attached to the network as \u201cREGISTERED\u201d and manages all the following context. However, the process of  does not show a process of assigning a terminal that is an MTC device to an MTC group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"When a terminal transfers an attach request to a network (S and S), the network determines whether the terminal is an MTC device, and whether the terminal belongs to an MTC group. When the terminal having transmitted the attach request is determined as an MTC device , an MME  responds to the attach request by including an MTC group Identifier (MTC_group ID) in an attach accept message (S). A base station  receiving the attach accept message from the MME  allocates an MTC_RNTI according to the MTC group Identifier (S). In other words, cell (C)_RNTIs are not allocated according to terminals, but MTC_RNTIs are allocated according to MTC group identifiers.","The base station  inserts the MTC_RNTI allocated according to the MTC group and the attach accept message including the MTC group Identifier into an RRC connection reconfiguration message, and transmits the RRC connection reconfiguration message to the MTC device  (S). The MTC device receiving the RRC connection reconfiguration message registers the MTC group Identifier as its ID and thereafter uses the ID for control.","In this way, an MTC group Identifier is assigned to an MTC terminal according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Also, by assigning an MTC_RNTI to an MTC group, MTC devices can all be controlled together through MTC group control. Downlink reception of a 3GPP LTE-Advanced system is performed with priority given to a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). A PDCCH is configured to address a specific RNTI, and a terminal capable of receiving the RNTI receives data (a signal message or traffic) via a related physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH).","Thereafter, completion of RRC connection reconfiguration (S), response to initial context setup (S), and transfer of an attach complete message (S and S) are the same as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In , each terminal only receives a C_RNTI addressed to itself with its unique C_RNTI and PDSCH data related to the C_RNTI. In other words, terminals A, B and C receive data through C_RNTI(a) addressing, C_RNTI(b) addressing and C_RNTI(c) addressing, respectively. Thus, a base station allocates as many PDCCHs and PDSCHs as the number of terminals managed by itself, and a large amount of resources corresponding to the PDCCHs and PDSCHs is consumed. Here, each terminal denotes an MTC device according to an example embodiment of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"MTC devices designated as one MTC group have the same MTC_RNTI. When a plurality of MTC devices can receive the same RNTI, the MTC devices do not need to individually receive data transferred by a base station, like unit terminals. As shown in , different RNTIs are not given to MTC device A, MTC device B and MTC device C respectively, but the same MTC_RNTI(m) is given to them for addressing. System broadcasting or paging may be an example embodiment in which MTC group addressing with an MTC_RNTI can be used.","A base station  manages an RNTI of a cell. The base station  maps an MTC_RNTI to an MTC group Identifier. When an MTC group Identifier is initially input, the base station  allocates and maps a new MTC_RNTI to the MTC group Identifier. When a mapping relation between an MTC group Identifier and an MTC_RNTI has been set already, no new operation is required.","Mapping information between an MTC group Identifier and an MTC_RNTI is transferred through an RRC connection reconfiguration message. A terminal receiving the RRC connection reconfiguration message registers the MTC_RNTI in an RNTI combination that the terminal can receive, and thereafter properly uses the MTC_RNTI for message receiving. In this way, an MTC_RNTI may be assigned to an MTC device according to an example embodiment of the present invention.","However, an MTC device does not only receive an MTC_RNTI. Before an attach request is transferred, a terminal is allocated a C_RNTI through an RRC connection establishment process. Thus, an MTC device can be controlled in a one-to-one mode or an MTC group mode.","A base station may control an MTC device using a C_RNTI in the one-to-one mode as shown in , and using an MTC_RNTI in the MTC group mode. In this way, a device can be controlled using different types of RNTIs according to another example embodiment of the present invention.","In other words, in an example embodiment of the present invention, RNTIs distinguished according to MTC devices are used when communication between a base station and an MTC device is performed in the one-to-one mode, and MTC_RNTIs are used when communication between a base station and an MTC device is performed in the MTC group mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"In most cases, MTC devices do not perform continuous communication with a network. Thus, an RRC connection state between an MTC device and a base station is mostly an idle state. Basically, MTC group mode control is performed without considering respective RRC states of MTC devices.","Thus, as shown in , a base station transmits a paging message to an MTC group to wake MTC devices in the MTC group (S). In , MTC device  to MTC device k belong to one MTC group, and a base station  wakes MTC device  to MTC device k using one paging message including a common MTC group Identifier.","The paging message includes paging record information about the MTC group Identifier. An MTC device receiving the paging message receives record information corresponding to its MTC group Identifier, and accesses a network or receives downlink data according to the record information (S). In case a network access is performed, the network access process follows a conventional random access process. In the case of receiving downlink data, the MTC device receives a PDCCH addressed with an MTC_RNTI and operates to receive PDSCH data indicated by the PDCCH (S).","In consideration of power saving of an MTC device communication module, the base station  controls a transmission time, and the MTC device controls a reception time so that downlink data transmission is performed in a reception window time period of the MTC_RNTI a predetermined time after transmission of the paging message. In this way, an MTC group can be controlled through MTC group mode control according to still another example embodiment of the present invention.","While the example embodiments of the present invention and their advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations may be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["Example embodiments of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail example embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
