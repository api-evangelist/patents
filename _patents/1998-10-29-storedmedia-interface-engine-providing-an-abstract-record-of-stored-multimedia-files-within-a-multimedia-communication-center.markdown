{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED DOCUMENTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of copending patent application Ser. No. 09\/151,429, filed on Sep. 11, 1998.","The present invention is in the field of telecommunication encompassing all existing sorts of interaction multimedia technology, and pertains more particularly to methods and apparatus for providing an abstract record of all multimedia and text interactions within a multimedia communication center using existing enterprise rules.","In the field of telephony communication, there have been many improvements in technology over the years that have contributed to more efficient use of telephone communication within hosted call-center environments. Most of these improvements involve integrating the telephones and switching systems in such call centers with computer hardware and software adapted for, among other things, better routing of telephone calls, faster delivery of telephone calls and associated information, and improved service with regard to client satisfaction. Such computer-enhanced telephony is known in the art as computer-telephony integration (CTI).","Generally speaking, CTI implementations of various design and purpose are implemented both within individual call-centers and, in some cases, at the telephone network level. For example, processors running CTI software applications may be linked to telephone switches, service control points (SCPs), and network entry points within a public or private telephone network. At the call-center level, CTI-enhanced processors, data servers, transaction servers, and the like, are linked to telephone switches and, in some cases, to similar CTI hardware at the network level, often by a dedicated digital link. CTI processors and other hardware within a call-center is commonly referred to as customer premises equipment (CPE). It is the CTI processor and application software is such centers that provides computer enhancement to a call center.","In a CTI-enhanced call center, telephones at agent stations are connected to a central telephony switching apparatus, such as an automatic call distributor (ACD) switch or a private branch exchange (PBX). The agent stations may also be equipped with computer terminals such as personal computer\/video display unit's (PC\/VDU's) so that agents manning such stations may have access to stored data as well as being linked to incoming callers by telephone equipment. Such stations may be interconnected through the PC\/VDUs by a local area network (LAN). One or more data or transaction servers may also be connected to the LAN that interconnects agent stations. The LAN is, in turn, typically connected to the CTI processor, which is connected to the call switching apparatus of the call center.","When a call arrives at a call center, whether or not the call has been pre-processed at an SCP, typically at least the telephone number of the calling line is made available to the receiving switch at the call center by the network provider. This service is available by most networks as caller-ID information in one of several formats such as Automatic Number Identification (ANI). Typically the number called is also available through a service such as Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS). If the call center is computer-enhanced (CTI), the phone number of the calling party may be used as a key to access additional information from a customer information system (CIS) database at a server on the network that connects the agent workstations. In this manner information pertinent to a call may be provided to an agent, often as a screen pop on the agent's PC\/VDU.","In recent years, advances in computer technology, telephony equipment, and infrastructure have provided many opportunities for improving telephone service in publicly-switched and private telephone intelligent networks. Similarly, development of a separate information and data network known as the Internet, together with advances in computer hardware and software have led to a new multimedia telephone system known in the art by several names. In this new systemology, telephone calls are simulated by multimedia computer equipment, and data, such as audio data, is transmitted over data networks as data packets. In this system the broad term used to describe such computer-simulated telephony is Data Network Telephony (DNT).","For purposes of nomenclature and definition, the inventors wish to distinguish clearly between what might be called conventional telephony, which is the telephone service enjoyed by nearly all citizens through local telephone companies and several long-distance telephone network providers, and what has been described herein as computer-simulated telephony or data-network telephony. The conventional systems are referred to herein as Connection-Oriented Switched-Telephony (COST) systems, CTI enhanced or not.","The computer-simulated, or DNT systems are familiar to those who use and understand computers and data-network systems. Perhaps the best example of DNT is telephone service provided over the Internet, which will be referred to herein as Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT), by far the most extensive, but still a subset of DNT.","Both systems use signals transmitted over network links. In fact, connection to data networks for DNT such as IPNT is typically accomplished over local telephone lines, used to reach points in the network such as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The definitive difference is that COST telephony may be considered to be connection-oriented telephony. In the COST system, calls are placed and connected by a specific dedicated path, and the connection path is maintained over the time of the call. Bandwidth is basically assured. Other calls and data do not share a connected channel path in a COST system. A DNT system, on the other hand, is not dedicated or connection-oriented. That is, data, including audio data, is prepared, sent, and received as data packets over a data-network. The data packets share network links, and may travel by varied and variable paths.","Recent improvements to available technologies associated with the transmission and reception of data packets during real-time DNT communication have enabled companies to successfully add DNT, principally IPNT, capabilities to existing CTI call centers. Such improvements, as described herein and known to the inventor, include methods for guaranteeing available bandwidth or quality of service (QoS) for a transaction, improved mechanisms for organizing, coding, compressing, and carrying data more efficiently using less bandwidth, and methods and apparatus for intelligently replacing lost data via using voice supplementation methods and enhanced buffering capabilities.","In addition to Internet protocol (IPNT) calls, a DNT center may also share other forms of media with customers accessing the system through their computers. E-mails, Video mails, fax, file share, file transfer, video calls, and so forth are some of the other forms of media which may be used. This capability of handling varied media leads to the term multimedia communications center. A multimedia communications center may be a combination CTI and DNT center, or may be a DNT center capable of receiving COST calls and converting them to a digital DNT format. The term communication center will replace the term call center hereinafter in this specification when referring to multimedia capabilities.","In typical communication centers, DNT is accomplished by Internet connection and IPNT calls. For this reason, IPNT and the Internet will be used in examples to follow. IT should be understood, however, that this usage is exemplary, and not limiting.","In systems known to the inventors, incoming IPNT calls are processed and routed within an IPNT-capable communication center in much the same way as COST calls are routed in a CTI-enhanced call-center, using similar or identical routing rules, waiting queues, and so on, aside from the fact that there are two separate networks involved. Communication centers having both CTI and IPNT capability utilize LAN-connected agent-stations with each station having a telephony-switch-connected headset or phone, and a PC connected, in most cases via LAN, to the network carrying the IPNT calls. Therefore, in most cases, IPNT calls are routed to the agent's PC while conventional telephony calls are routed to the agent's conventional telephone or headset. Typically separate lines and equipment must be implemented for each type of call weather COST or IPNT.","Due in part to added costs associated with additional equipment, lines, and data ports that are needed to add IPNT capability to a CTI-enhanced call-center, companies are currently experimenting with various forms of integration between the older COST system and the newer IPNT system. For example, by enhancing data servers, interactive voice response units (IVR's), agent-connecting networks, and so on, with the capability of conforming to Internet protocol, call data arriving from either network may be integrated requiring less equipment and lines to facilitate processing, storage, and transfer of data.","With many new communication products supporting various media types available to businesses and customers, a communication center must add significant application software to accommodate the diversity. For example, e-mail programs have differing parameters than do IP applications. IP applications are different regarding protocol than COST calls, and so on. Separate routing systems and\/or software components are needed for routing e-mails, IP calls, COST calls, file sharing, etc. Agents must then be trained in the use of a variety of applications supporting the different types of media.","Keeping contact histories, reporting statistics, creating routing rules and the like becomes more complex as newer types of media are added to communication center capability. Additional hardware implementations such as servers, processors, etc. are generally required to aid full multimedia communication and reporting. Therefore, it is desirable that interactions of all multimedia sorts be analyzed, recorded, and routed according to enterprise (business) rules in a manner that provides seamless integration between media types and application types, thereby allowing agents to respond intelligently and efficiently to customer queries and problems.","An issue that remains to be solved with respect to current multimedia storage and access is that agents have a lager workload because of the varying media that must be reviewed and disseminated when conducting reviews, research, and the like. Threaded contact histories that are text-based are insufficient for the purpose of aiding audits or reviews. This is due to the fact that multimedia interactions are stored separately and must be tracked as well as text-based interactions. Current threaded contact histories do not include these multimedia interactions.","Furthermore, an enterprise may desire to perform certain calculations or conduct research with automated systems that may be directed and adapted to streamlining or improving overall performance. A basic example of such a researched calculation may be a desire to determine the communication center's top 500 customers in terms of profitability. Such research may be time consuming and difficult at best, especially in a multimedia communication center. Such communication centers may have many databases wherein variant types of media may be stored. An agent or system may be required to access media records wherein differing types of programs are required to access and review the media. Furthermore the very nature of non-text multimedia files ensures a very large amount of data. Graphics files, audio files, video conference files, and the like require much more digital data than do text files. For this reason alone, direct access to the multimedia databases will be time consuming.","A system known to the inventor and termed herein a customer-interaction-operating-system (CINOS) enables multimedia threading wherein a contact history not only contains a text record of all interactions regardless of media, but also provides direct access from the threaded contact history to related recorded multimedia interactions such as are described by the text. Such access may be accomplished from within the same application. This capability is covered in various patent applications authored by the inventor and listed in the section entitled Cross-Reference to Related Documents to which the present application is related. All of these related documents have been included by reference in the present application, and their disclosure is a part of the present disclosure.","It is desirable, within a multimedia communication center, to not only provide a multimedia-capable storage system that may be accessed via agents or the like, but also, to provide a way to automatically access and present such stored information to other systems quickly without having to invoke actual media or to access the actual multimedia data repository.","What is clearly needed is a method and apparatus for automatically presenting, upon request or by predefined process, a complete up-to-date abstract model representing all of the important data relating to both text-based and multimedia interactions such as may be recorded and stored within a multimedia communication center. Such a model would allow other systems to perform calculations and achieve objectives using such presented data without specifically invoking related media or accessing the multimedia repository.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention an Interaction Object Model (IOM) Interface to a data repository is provided, comprising objects representing files in the data repository; standardized information about each file, the information associated in the IOM with each object; and an updating interface communicating with the data repository, keeping objects conformal with the files in the data repository.","In preferred embodiments the IOM further comprises an interaction interface to system function modules requiring data associated with the files in the data repository, wherein through the interaction interface the system function modules are enabled to retrieve required data from the IOM without accessing the data files in the data repository directly. The repository may be a multimedia repository in a multimedia call center, storing text and non-text transactions of the call center. The system function modules may include one or more of a customer-information system, a communication routing system, an audit system, and messaging systems.","The Interactive Object Model of the present invention, taught in enabling detail below, provides a facility for manual and automatic functions requiring data from a data repository to quickly access such data without being required to actually peruse the repository itself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00040","num":"00040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["11","17","13","15"]},"In this particular embodiment communication center  handles both conventional telephone calls, which may be categorized as connection oriented switched telephony (COST) calls, and data network telephony (DNT) calls, which may be DNT calls over a private digital network or calls according to a protocol such as the well-known Internet protocol. DNT calls are characterized in that data is transmitted as addressed data packets as opposed to dedicated connections in COST calls. As indicated, PSTN  may be a private rather than a public network. WAN  may be a company Intranet, the Internet, or another type of WAN known in the art. The particular method of call delivery and call center integration is not particularly relevant for the purposes of this invention. There are many ways known both to the inventor as well as known in the art. Particular issues discussed in the disclosure between the telephones and the computers might be implemented differently depending on the actual system, but shall be deemed equivalent for all purposes of this invention.","Incoming COST calls arrive at a network-level telephony switching apparatus  in network cloud  and are connected over trunk  to a central telephony switching apparatus  within communication center . From switching apparatus , calls are routed according to existing routing rules over internal wiring  to agents' telephones , , , and  residing at agents' workstations , , , and  respectively.","Incoming DNT calls, and other communication events such as e-mail, file transfers and the like, arrive at a routing node  in WAN  and are passed on over digital connection  to a routing server  within communication center . Once calls arrive at server , they may, in some embodiments, be routed directly over LAN  according to existing routing rules to personal computer\/video display units (PC\/VDU) such as PC\/VDU , , , or  located at agent's workstations , , , and  respectively.","In this embodiment, switch-connected telephones - are also connected to PC\/VDU's - via a headset to computer sound-card according to technique known to the inventor and accomplished via an I\/O cable. Thus connected, agents may respond to incoming COST and DNT calls with the same headset.","In the exemplary system and communication center shown, the equipment and applications are adapted to provide for multimedia operation at each of the agent stations, so the agents can interact with clients in many different ways, as are known in the multimedia arts.","Computer telephony integration (CTI) enhancement is, in this embodiment, provided both at communication center  and in PSTN . For example, in PSTN , a processor  running instances of a CTI application known as a T-server (TS) to the inventors, and a statistics server (Stat) is connected to telephony switch  via CTI link . An intelligent peripheral  of the form of an interactive voice response unit (IVR) is connected to processor  via data connection . Similar CTI equipment is illustrated within communication center . Namely, a processor  running instances of TS and Stat and connected to telephony switch  via CTI link , and an IVR  connected to processor  via a data connection , with processor  further connected to a local area network (LAN)  within communication center .","In alternative embodiments there may also be a CTI processor  in WAN  connected to server  by a CTI link . Also in some embodiments a separate data network  connects these CTI processors. In this way, intelligent routing may be performed at the network level with negotiation and direction from within communication center .","It will be appreciated by those with skill in the art that the CTI enhancements, as immediately described above, may be hosted on one processor at PSTN  and on one processor at communication center  without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The inventor has chosen to show separate processors having separate functions for exemplary purposes only. It will also be appreciated by the skilled artisan that there may be many more or fewer than the four agent stations shown in communications center , and hardware and software arrangements may be made is a variety of ways. Also, home agents might be connected in a variety of ways to the call center.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a customer-interaction network operating system, hereinafter termed (CINOS), is provided for the purpose of managing communications center , and optimizing and recording all agent\/customer interactions received at communication center  from networks  and . CINOS is unique in the fact that it is a multi-tiered object- and process-orientated system wherein logic regarding the various aspects of it's functionality is achieved via knowledge-based architecture and object modeling. Various functions of CINOS, more fully described below, include capturing (recording), analyzing, routing, and, in many instances, responding via automated process to customers engaged in interactions with the enterprise (company hosting the communication center). CINOS is adapted to support all planned communication mediums such as multimedia DNT applications including e-mail, video mail, file transfers, chat sessions, IP calls, and CTI COST transactions such as voice calls, voice mails, faxes, and so on.","Referring back to , CINOS utilizes various LAN-connected machines in order to perform various operations. Among these various hardware implementations are a multimedia server (MIS)  adapted to physically store and serve all multimedia transactions, and a customer-information-system server (CIS)  adapted to physically store and serve information relevant to customers such as purchase history, financial status, product preferences, contact information, etc. A central server (COS)  acts as a host location for a CINOS manager application (noted in text balloon) which is, in effect, the parent application that controls all of the operation and functionality of the system.","In addition to the above-mentioned machines hosting CINOS routines, each PC\/VDU such as PC\/VDU , for example, has a CINOS-agent desktop interface or client application (not shown) adapted to interact with the parent application. Also, each machine that provides particular dedicated function to communication center  such as switch-connected CTI processors, IVR'S, and other related equipment host instances of CINOS application-program interfaces (API's) to enable seamless integration of differing parameters and\/or protocols that are used with various planned application and media types utilized within communication center . Such programs may also co-reside or be in any combination or hosted by themselves. Additionally, for performance purposes, additional dedicated network links may exist between those servers, but essentially they are only performance boosters, and hence for clarity purposes, only a simple network is shown.","As previously described, CINOS comprises a multi-tiered architecture. This unique architecture comprises an external media layer for interfacing with the customer or business contact, a workflow layer for making routing decisions, organizing automated responses, recording transactions, and so on, and an internal media later for interfacing and presenting interactions to an agent or knowledge worker. An innovative concept associated with CINOS involves the use of tooled process models, knowledge bases, and other object models as base instruction for it's various functions. These modular conventions may be inter-bound with each other, and are easily editable providing a customizable framework that may conform to virtually any existing business logic.","In simple operation, and after any network level routing, COST calls and DNT calls including other media events arrive at communication center  to telephony switch , and routing server  respectively. Network level routing, as defined herein, includes any intelligent implementation that may be in place and aided via processors , , and . Load balancing to multiple communication centers, and transferring customer data obtained at network-level over data-network connection  would be examples of such network-level routing.","Once a call or other communication event registers at either switch  or routing server , CINOS immediately identifies the media type associated with the call and begins it's processes depending on enterprise rules. For example, a live COST call may first be routed to IVR  whereby the customer can be presented with varying choices such as leaving a voice message, waiting in queue, receiving a call back, or perhaps an e-mail, and so on. Interaction by IVR , in this instance, will preferably be via voice recognition technique such as is known in the art, but may also be via touch tone response or other known method. As previously described, the caller may elect from a number of options, such as to hold for a next available agent, select an automated response such as a fax back, or perhaps a later agent-initiated response such as an e-mail or call back. In all cases, CINOS seamlessly processes and executes the logic required to accomplish the goal of the caller in a media and application-independent fashion.","DNT events are handled much the same way as described above for live callers. For example, an IP call may be routed to a digital equivalent of an IVR for interaction or queued for a next available agent, and so on. In one embodiment, IVR  may be adapted to handle both COST and DNT interaction.","All interactions with live external media, including actual text-based events whether live or not, are recorded and stored in MIS  with an associated text version of the media stored as well, and becoming part of an overall threaded contact history. This is accomplished in varying ways according to existing parameters such as media type, whether the event is a live call, and so on. For example, CINOS may execute a command directing IVR  to digitally record an incoming COST call during customer interaction and then store the voice recording of the transaction in MIS . A text version of the recording either created simultaneously from the voice recording via voice-to-text techniques (known in the art), or created by a live attendant via manual annotation may be sent to and stored in DB . An IPNT call arriving at routing server  may be similarly recorded and stored in MIS  with an associated text version of the interaction stored in DB . E-mails, video calls, voice mails and so on are similarly handled. For example, an incoming e-mail is stored in MIS server  while text from the e-mail may be extracted and stored associated with the e-mail.","The purpose of the text version of the event is twofold. Firstly, a complete text-based transaction history of communication center  may be compiled and reserved for later access and audit. Secondly, an agent or knowledge worker may, in some instances, see the text version of the event at the same time that he receives routed notification of the event. In this way, an agent may begin mental preparation before taking a call. The text version of an event must be machine-readable and human readable at times displayed. Interactive media-independent viewers, part of the agent's client application, may be used to disseminate information which may initially not be human readable.","It is important to note here that the text-based version of an event may or may not be a complete and verbatim rendition of an actual media event. For example, an e-mail may contain many documents each having many pages of text. Therefore, the text-based version of a particular e-mail event may simply contain the name and particulars regarding the author, a purchase order, and a list of the enclosed documents by title, and basic content or memo as well as a possible manual annotation. The attachments to the e-mail may be stored separately, and be also cross-indexed and retrievable. Seeing the purchase order when the event is routed to an agent desktop tells the agent that this e-mail is important.","A fax, stored originally as a bit-mapped document, may be converted to text in the system via optical recognition (OCR) technique wherein sometimes only certain content such as the authors contact information, basic intent of the fax, and perhaps special numbers or codes contained in the original fax are recorded in a text version , sometimes the whole text is OCR'd, while the original fax is stored in it's entirety in DB . Such codes or numbers that are specifically parsed from actual media may be part of a unique coding system set up by the enterprise whereby customers are directed to include such codes or numbers with their orders, service requests, and so on.","Parsing text messages is accomplished via a text-analyzer known to the inventor. In other non-text media types, such as video or graphics, descriptive notes may be taken via live attendant and stored in DB  as previously mentioned. Voice recognition technology may also be used in a case of recorded sound or video with sound. All transactions regardless of media type are thus recorded and stored according to enterprise rules with at least a meaningful part of the content if not all of the content of such transactions converted to text and stored in DB  associated with the recording of the event. Again, the importance of the text version is that the extracted knowledge of the transaction therein is in machine-operable code, allowing search and cross-referencing functions that may otherwise not be possible.","After incoming events are analyzed and processed with regards to queuing, recording, storing, etc. CINOS decides the disposition paths of each event. For example, live calls in queue are routed to live agents if available, if this is the priority action in the enterprise rules. E-mails are either routed to next available agents using a push technology, or simply stored in MIS server  where they may be retrieved by agents after receiving notification. Recorded events such as IVR voice requests are stored in MIS server  where they may be retrieved by agents, and so on.","By the use of routing and routing notification events, any media may be routed to an appropriate agent based on skill, or any other rule-based routing method over LAN . Actual multimedia events may be accessed from MIS server  at the agent's discretion, or by rule, and text-based versions of those events stored in DB  may be mirrored and routed to the agent along with notification of the incoming event.","Other services may be performed by CINOS such as responding to media requests without agent participation via initiating automated fax responses, out-bound dialing campaigns wherein recorded information is given to a customer perhaps concerning an order placed by the customer, and so on. Networking via business or chat applications between several business partners, customers, agents, and so on, is possible wherein each entry may be stored in DB  as part of a discussion thread including responses of another media type, perhaps initiated by a communication-center agent to one of the participants during the discussion.","As a general rule, full multimedia storage is done in a mass storage server, and linked by cross-indexing to the database. Depending on the business model, full text or only partial annotation is stored in the database, or a mix therof, e.g. by media type.","In addition to supporting a wide variety of applications and protocol, CINOS is provided with the tools for building media-independent self-help wizards that are adapted for problem solving and reduction. Similarly, external and internal interaction media viewers are provided and adapted to support any media of choice.","CINOS uses object modeling and linking techniques that are known in the art to effect much of it's goal of presenting a seamless customer interaction with an enterprise agent or knowledge worker operating in a communication center such as center . For example, an interaction object model (IOM) represents a transcript of all interaction history stored in DB  and provides an audit trail of the state of transactions of all interactions. An interaction process model (IPM) controls how events are handled within the operating system.","An additional set of models handle how agents receive their routed media such as via traditional push model, blended push model, publish and subscribe model, or interrupt model. Prioritizing interaction events may also be accomplished through varying the push theme or scheme. For example, traditional push technology for e-mail means that only e-mail (media type) is being worked on by an agent. By blending the push model with a publish and subscribe model, the interrupt model is created wherein the agent may subscribe to various routed media such as answering phones, and responding to faxes, but may be interrupted for an important interaction of another media type such as e-mail and so on. In this way an agent's time may be utilized according to enterprise rules within an automated environment.","Outbound campaigns may be configured according to enterprise rules and media preference using a single rule-set knowledge-base. This single set of outbound tools can be used to initiate customer dialog via predictive dialing, e-mail push, automated recorded messages, and so on.","It will be apparent to those with skill in the art that common object modeling (COM) can be used to create virtually any type of model for any type of enterprise situation. It is the intention of the inventor to provide the applicable control codes known in the art for building process and object models and enabling the linking and interaction between the models. As previously described, it is partly the fact that CINOS uses these various models and knowledge bases to achieve desired interaction that sets it above current-art systems. The inventor knows of no such network interfacing operating system that is based on the above described technology.","CINOS may be implemented in a number of different topologies. For example, CINOS may be implemented as a centralized topology with one communication center as shown here in , a distributed topology wherein a single communication center may span multiple physical locations, a segmented communication center wherein a single pool of agents services more than one company or customer base, or a wide communication network wherein a plurality of communication centers such as center  cooperatively service a common pool of customers or a customer base. Enterprises involved in commerce such as large financial institutions hosting many geographically separate communication centers may build their entire networking system using CINOS architecture in standardized and distributed fashion. There is no limitation to the type of enterprise that may use CINOS as it may be tooled to accommodate virtually any network architecture linked to a communication center having DNT capability.","It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art that CINOS routines according to various embodiments of the present invention may be included and implemented at the network level without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention such as in processor , and IVR  in PSTN , or in routing node  in WAN .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00072","num":"00072"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["83","85","87","83"]},"External media layer  may, in one embodiment, be a multifaceted, web-based self-help interface providing news information and a host of other services that may be personalized by the customer. In many respects, external media layer  in this embodiment is similar to a web browser.","Workflow layer  comprises  basic function categories beginning with a content analysis category  wherein textual analysis, voice analysis, IVR interaction, recording and storing takes place. A next category is context resolution . Context resolution involves customer identification, business process binding, preparation for routing, and so on. A third category termed interaction routing  comprises various processes associated with the presentation of the interaction to agents, service persons, knowledge workers, business partners, customers and the like, that is, all transaction partners. Category  covers queuing, skill-based routing, automated treatment, workflow models, and so on.","Internal media layer  comprises an agent desktop interface not shown in , but described in more detail below. Both external layer  and internal layer  contain the required tools for enabling media and application-independent interfacing such as previously mentioned self-help wizards, media viewers, and other controls as prescribed via enterprise rules.","Internal media layer  provides an agent with, among other options, information about the customer or contact, information about current or historical business processes, information about current interactions and their relationship to business processes, and a knowledge-base to guide the agent or knowledge worker with interaction response and workflow. An agent a, and agent b, and a knowledge worker c are shown herein interacting with the system as illustrated via bi-directional arrows. The skilled artisan will recognize these are merely examples, and there may be many more such persons, and interactions in some instances may be routed to machines for response.","It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the multi-tiered architecture of CINOS such as is illustrated herein may comprise many more or differing steps or processes without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00078","num":"00078"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["95","17","97"]},"All transactions, whether live calls, such as video calls, DNT calls and COST calls, or text-based documents, such as e-mails, are recorded and stored in one or more mass storage devices handled by one or more database applications. This may be taken as server  of , although the diagram of  is exemplary.","A principle object of the invention is to extract maximum information from every transaction for building a knowledge base that can be used for dynamic management and future analysis and development. This is done primarily by data mining, which is applicable to machine-operable code, that is text. Because of the nature of the extraction, there is a difference in the way live calls and text-based media is handled.","Discrimination as to the text nature of the media is made at step . If the media chosen by the customer is already text-based, then the transaction is recorded as received (), and a data mining application extracts important information in step  and stores it in the knowledge base. The distinct portions and versions of the transaction, such as the originally recorded version and any extracted data are related to one another and to other knowledge previously stored, and become part of a threaded interaction history associated with an ongoing interaction and ultimately of an overall contact history.","If the media chosen by the customer is determined in step  to be a live interaction such as a COST or IPNT call, then the existing knowledge base is accessed at step , and the call is routed to the best fit agent. This may, of course, be done in a number of ways, such as an ADC, skill-based routing as known to the inventors, transfer to an IVR for automatic processing, and so on, as may be dictated by enterprise rules.

In some cases access may be controlled through subscription, or according to other qualifying criteria such as may be deemed appropriate by the enterprise. For example, if the enterprise is an exclusive investment club, membership may be required. Categorizing criteria may include demographic information such as income level, credit history, or any other attribute that may be quantified and used to categorize a customer.","An enterprise-controlled access point may be defined as an interfacing window or portal created and maintained at a typical customer entry point in a network as may be known in the art. Such interfaces may take the form of a WEB-based customer interface (a WEB page), an interactive voice response (IVR) unit, a service control point (SCP), or some other customer-facing system or apparatus as may be known in the art.","For the purposes of this specification, an example of an enterprise-controlled WEB-form access and interface window is illustrated as an example for a preferred embodiment.

Such a tool kit may be located on an agent's desktop, perhaps part of an agent's HTML client such as client  of FIG. . In one embodiment, it may be part of a system administrator's tool kit.","Window  contains interactive options directed at various categories and functions. For example, a new client section  contains interactive options related to adding a new client to the active customer base of the enterprise. A customer service section  contains interactive options presented to existing clients needing service. A new order section  contains interactive options presented to existing clients wishing to do new business.","Each offered interactive option is an embedded executable function having the appropriate links to other system areas of CINOS such as may be relevant to the immediate interaction such as to services offered, routing routines, database searching, interaction recording, and so on.","An innovative function of window  is to provide front-end control of access to the enterprise by existing and potential clients\/customers. For example, as a client, contact, or potential client interacts with the various media and functional options presented by the enterprise in window , he or she is being directed according to enterprise rules in such a way that he or she may first be qualified or not to patronize the enterprise. Secondly, the contacting person may be categorized and sorted as to type of qualified customer. Thirdly, the person contacting person may be directed to pre-selected media options by the enterprise for various services offered including but not limited to routing live interactions, and so on.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, access window  is fully customizable, based on customer data and enterprise rules with the focus of such customization directed toward benefiting the enterprise and ultimately the client. That is, the client's options within window  are pre-selected and preferred by the hosting enterprise based in part on data about the client, details about the client's communication equipment and software, and enterprise rules and constraints. In some embodiments, the client may aid in customizing window . However, as it is desired by the enterprise to provide service in a cost-effective manner, the client will be presented with options as preferred by the enterprise in most cases.","To further illustrate, refer now to new client section . If window  is part of the enterprise WEB page, as is the case with this example, there will be a variety of visitors which may or may not be pre-qualified by the enterprise. Therefore, an interested party would begin (and be restricted to) taking a new client survey, illustrated as one of the options in section . If the enterprise rules require this as a first step, then the other options may be enabled only upon completion of the survey. By choosing new client survey, a second window may contain various survey options such as via e-mail, interactive voice recording, type and send method, or the like.","Information taken in the client survey is recorded and entered into a CINOS database such as DB  of FIG. . Such information may also be compared against enterprise rules or constraints, and other known information as may be available to the enterprise. Assuming the client is now recognized by the enterprise, the client's media hardware and telephony information may be recorded for future interaction purposes. Such information may include the client's personal computer parameters including modem type, Internet connection type, computer platform type, type of Internet phone application installed, etc. Similarly, COST telephone parameters may be recorded, such as personal phone number, business phone number, cellular phone number, forwarding numbers, and so on. Such data will influence latter customization of his personal window  for the particular client including the types of media that will be offered.","Finally, the client may be asked to create a password for the purpose of accessing CINOS. A section  is provided containing a network log-in option along with download sections for obtaining permanent and or temporary software as may be desired or needed, or, in some cases, required for the client to access certain services, view certain content, and so on.","Section  presents media options for clients seeking customer service from the enterprise. These options are, in a preferred embodiment, presented in a customized or personalized fashion within the client's window  as was described above. Therefore, each client patronizing the enterprise may access a version of window  that differs in look and functionality than that of another client. In this example, service section  contains options for e-mail, chat program, fax program, a self-help wizard, and a voice wizard. Other media types may be added or subtracted from the client's window  depending on any of several criteria. Personalization of widow  takes into account client information as stored in CINOS database , service-agent media availability and preferences, and perhaps any overriding enterprise rules. Unless and until a client is identified there are typically no options presented to the client for continuing a transaction with the enterprise.","For an identified client, by selecting the e-mail option, the client's preferred e-mail program may be activated for the purpose of sending a message to or soliciting a reply from a service agent. By selecting chat program, the client may be launched into a scheduled service seminar featuring many clients interacting with a service expert regarding a certain subject. One enterprise rule regarding section  may be that there is no telephone or I-phone media option for customer service for a client in the absence of an ongoing project with the particular customer. In this sense an ongoing project includes any unfinished business that the client is involved in with the enterprise.","Self-help wizards and voice wizards as illustrated in section  may be offered to help a client resolve an issue without taxing further resource. Such wizards may be customized based on a client's recorded data, perhaps confirming past interactions, providing account or order status, and so on. In some embodiments, selecting an option might avail several additional options. For example, selecting chat program may avail three possible chat programs to choose from with different schedules, content, and functionality attributed to each individual program.","New order section  in this example contains various options adapted to facilitate placing orders. The options as illustrated herein include, but are not limited to, I-phone, call back, promotional models, video presentations, an on-line viewer, and an order wizard. Interaction is the same as was stated with regards to section . For example, selecting promotional models, accesses a database containing the current promotional information and features of products which may be viewed interactively by the client using an on-line viewer offered as one of the functional options (tool). The options presented in the New Orders section may also be customized according to client identity, demographics, transaction history, and enterprise rules.","On-line viewers may enable the client to view documents that are not supported on his computer platform. Selecting video presentation may avail several types of videos for viewing, such that the client may choose one. If the client does not have a viewer installed on his computer which will support the offered video, perhaps the on-line viewer may play the video, or the client could download a temporary viewer from section , etc. Selecting call back may bring up a second array of media choices made available by the enterprise for receiving a reply interaction from an agent.","By providing a controlled interface window such as window  the enterprise may control routing and interaction right from the beginning of customer contact. Through the innovative method of linking and reporting to other CINOS functions, and repositories, much real-time personaliation of window  according to enterprise rules and customer parameters may be made automatically. For example, if a client's history indicates a propensity toward frequent buying, an I-phone option may be presented in customer service section  in his window  immediately after such a determination so that he may get direct customer service at all times.","Certain media options, as described above, may be afforded a certain priority over one another regarding interaction with the enterprise. For example, a VIP client may have live interactive media choices offered in window  such as I-phone, call back to COST phone, video phone, etc. A client known for infrequent contact or troublesome interactive history may be limited to text-based interaction such as e-mail and so on.","As an integral part of CINOS functionality, window  acts as a portal through which existing and potential clients may be screened, categorized and routed according to enterprise rules. Customer interfaces such as window  may be provided at various locations on a WAN such as the Internet without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Such portals may exist in different geographic regions, and may be created for differing customer bases such as one for Latin America, and one for the pacific rim, and so on. Instances of CINOS routine may be distributed widely over a network.","Although the example provided herein is of a WEB form, it will be apparent to one with skill in the art that a CTI counterpart may be created for the COST telephony network. Such a case may be a CINOS enhanced IVR at an SCP or customer access point in the COST network.","CINOS, as previously described, optimizes customer\/agent interaction in a manner which is economical and cost efficient to both the enterprise and the patronizing client. The customer interfacing window as taught herein with regards to  is innovative in that it is a fully customizable portal that facilities seamless integration between clients and enterprise agents according to enterprise rules. Further innovation is evident in that client data is fully and seamlessly integrated with CINOS intelligence and enterprise rules regarding routing of interactions and other constraints or limitations that are programmed into the system. In effect, logic from the front end, or customer side, to the back end or agent side is linked and accessible to all appropriate CINOS routines which include applicable CTI CINOS routines.

Repository  may utilize any form of digital storage technology known in the art such as Raid-Array, Optical Storage, and so on. The storage capacity of repository  will depend directly on it's implementation with regard to the size of the communication center and predicted amount of data that will be stored and kept by the system.","In this example, repository  is divided logically into two sections. One section, multimedia information system (MIS) , is responsible for housing all multimedia interactions defined as media that is not text-based such as audio, video, and graphics-based media. All multimedia interactions are stored in MIS  whether incoming, outgoing, or internal. A second section, herein referred to as text section  is responsible for all text-based interactions as well as text versions related to non-text files. Sections  and  of repository  are analogous to MIS  and DB  of FIG. .","Repository  is connected to a communication-center local area network (LAN) . Repository  is accessible via LAN  to authorized personnel within a communication center such as agents, knowledge workers, or the like, and may, in some instances, also be made available to clients communicating with the call center. A network router (RTN)  is shown connected to LAN  via network connection . In this example, network router  is the first point within a communication center wherein DNT media arrives. Network router  is exemplary of many types of routers that may be used to route data over LAN . An Internet-protocol-network-telephony (IPNT) switch  is connected to network router  via data link as is known in the art. IPNT switch  further routes or distributes live IPNT calls that do not require routing to a live agent. IPNT calls that are routed to live agents are sent over connection  to LAN  where they reach agent PC\/VDU's (not shown) or DNT-capable phones (not shown) as illustrated via directional arrows.","An object of the present invention is to record all multimedia interactions and store them in MIS . A further object of the present invention is to similarly record text versions of and text files related to all multimedia interactions and to store them in text-based section . For the purpose of the present invention, a text version of a non-text file is defined as a sufficient text rendition or description of a corresponding multimedia interaction. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an innovative mechanism wherein authorized persons may access any particular block of text and if desired, call up the actual media to which the text relates.","More detail regarding the order and manipulation of repository  is described further below.","Creating text-based versions of live multimedia interactions may, in some cases, be accomplished via an automated method. For example, a digital voice attendant  is provided and linked to IPNT switch . Digital voice attendant  may be of the form of a DNT-capable IVR or other digital voice-response mechanism as may be known in the art. Such automated attendants may interact with a voice caller instead of requiring a live agent. A speech to text converter  is provided and linked to voice attendant . As digital voice attendant  interacts with a caller, speech to text converter  uses voice recognition technology to convert the audio speech to text. Such text may then be stored automatically into text section  and related to the also-recorded audio data.","It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that as speech recognition technologies are further improved over their current state, which is adequate for many implementations, reliable text versions of audio transactions are not only possible but practical. Such speech to text conversions are used here only for the convenience of automation wherein no live attendant is needed to transcribe such audio data. The inventor is familiar with such converters as used in the CINOS system according to a preferred embodiment. Such converters provide convenience in the practice of the present invention but are not specifically required to achieve the objects of the present invention.","Manual transcription may also be used to convert audio\/video to text or code that may then be entered into text section . For example, a live attendant  is shown connected to LAN . Attendant , in this case, may be given the responsibility of transcribing audio files from speech to text and annotating video or graphics files for the purpose of creating text files related to the non-text data. One or more live attendants such as attendant  may be provided for this purpose. Some media arriving at a communication center such as the one represented via architecture  will already be text-based and therefore require no conversion or annotation. Short e-mails, Faxes, word documents, and so on are part of this media category.","An automated services system  is illustrated as having a direct connection to section  of the data repository. System  is provided for certain text-based interactions, as described above, wherein a complete text record of the interaction may be mirrored, or otherwise created and stored into text section . Such automated services may include but are not limited to automated e-mail and fax systems. For example, a fax may be sent and mirrored into section  or, perhaps recreated using an optical character recognition (OCR) technique and then entered. Physical text-documents such as legal papers and the like, may be automatically scanned into text section  before they are sent to clients. There are many possible automated techniques for entering text files into a database. Such methods described with regards to automated services  are a convenience in practicing the present invention but are not specifically required to achieve the objects of the present invention.","With respect to the dual capability (COST\/DNT) of architecture , a central telephony switch  is provided to be a first destination for COST calls arriving from, for example, a PSTN network. Switch  may be a PBX, ACD, or another known type of telephony switch. Internal COST wiring  connects telephony switch  to agent's individual telephones (not shown). Switch  is enhanced via a processor  running an instance of T-server and an instance of Stat-server, which are software enhancements known to the inventor and have been previously described. Such enhancements provide CTI applications, such as intelligent routing, but are not specifically required to practice the present invention. CINOS as previously described is adapted to be integrated with such software when present in a CINOS enhanced communication-center.","An intelligent peripheral in the form of a COST IVR  is provided for the purpose of interacting with callers seeking information and the like who do not require connection to a live agent. IVR technology may comprise voice response, touch tone interaction, or a combination of these technologies. IVR  is linked to processor  and also to automated services . An example of an IVR interaction may be the presentation to a caller of options for using an automated service such as those described above, or perhaps waiting for a live agent.","A CTI to DNT interface  is provided for the purpose of converting COST interactions to digital mode compatible with DNT so as to be adapted for digital storage and interaction according to CINOS functionality and enterprise business rules as described above. Interface  is not specifically required to practice the present invention so long as appropriate application programming interfaces (API's) are provided for equipment that interfaces with CINOS. Bi-directional arrows illustrated between interface  and IVR  represent the ability to route interactions in either direction. COST to DNT conversion may be accomplished in IVR  in addition to or in place of interface . The connection architecture presented herein is exemplary only.","A speech to text converter  is provided for converting audio from the CTI side to text for entering into text section  as was taught with regards to converter  on the DNT side. Actual recorded media interactions are illustrated entering MIS  after text versions are rendered and entered into section , however, this is not required. In some instances text versions of multimedia interactions may be rendered after the interaction is stored. There is no limitation regarding sequence. It is sufficient to say that converters  and  are capable of real-time conversion and entry.","Server  shown connected to LAN  is adapted to host a CINOS MGR.

A threaded dialog may be finite dialog (is closed at some point) or it may be ongoing. Typically, a thread, which connects or associates the pieces of dialog, contains all of the dialog in the order that it happened such as in chronological order. Threading may be implemented based on other criteria as may be appropriate for a particular situation or by particular rules.","As previously described with reference to the background section, prior art threading techniques are confined to text such as with an on-line message board or the like. The inventor knows of no system that supports full multimedia interaction. The innovative implementation taught below integrates the text-based thread with stored multimedia interactions such that one may interact with the thread and access various stored media associated with the thread.","Referring again to , a customer  is illustrated as having two threads. They are issue I and issue II. Customer  has an assigned number XX\u2014XX that identifies him or her with respect to the CINOS system. Issues I and II may comprise sales dialog, purchasing dialog, or any other type or purposed dialog as may be generic to the hosting enterprise. Customer  may well be a business contact, or even an internal agent practicing dialog with a supervisor or the like.","A series of icons , , , , , ,  and  represent the type of media stored for each text block (text not shown). For example, issue I comprises first an e-mail text followed by a fax text, WEB text, and V-phone text. In this case, a time stamp or other known method may be used to insure that each text block is in order. The icons are interactive pointers or links to the actual media interactions that they represent. That is, the first block of e-mail text is associated with an interactive icon, in this case icon . By clicking on icon a with a pointer device, the actual e-mail may be accessed and viewed. In an alternative aspect, not only the actual transaction may be presented to a user for review, but related files may also be listed or otherwise presented for selection and review.","A logical link  represents cross-referencing capability between sections  and . Dialog may be threaded according to a wide variety of business rules. For example, a thread or string may represent dialog about a customer, product, agent, group of agents, group of customers, and so on. An identifier is assigned to an entity and to all the communication events to or from that entity, or those in which the entity may have been involved such as a group discussion or chat. In this way all interactions may be organized and stored accordingly.","In one embodiment, keyboard commands could be used to cross-reference to actual media instead of icons. In another embodiment, text versions of actual media are fully viewable with the text itself appearing in interactive form whereupon a double click may call up the associated media and so on. There are many variations within the scope of the invention.","Although actual recorded media interactions are, in this embodiment, stored in MIS , there does not have to be two separate databases (one for text and one for actual media). All data may reside in one database and be sectioned in storage. For example, one click on the customer name may bring up text only, while a double click on the text brings up the associated media.","In MIS , recorded multimedia interactions are represented by icons , , , ,  and . For example element  represents all recorded Video phone interactions. Element  represents all e-mails. Element  represents all recorded COST interactions. Similar associations are made with respect to elements  and  which represent WEB interactions and Video mails respectively. WEB interactions  may include on-line orders, requests, information forms, signed certificates, and so on.","Element  represents additional stored multimedia files dedicated to, for example, promoting the enterprises products or services. Promotional files  may contain files of the form of any enterprise supported multimedia. These files may be tools that can be sent to clients upon request or perhaps periodically.","Referring again to section , element b located on the thread labeled issue I represents text from a fax. Because a fax is text-based and not a multimedia interaction, there is no corresponding media event associated with it. However, the fax is threaded into the dialog according to, in this case, chronological order. A short example of a proposed dialog concerning issue I follows.","Element  represents an e-mail sent by customer  to the enterprise requesting pricing information. An enterprise agent responds with a fax  to customer  containing the requested information. Customer  then places an on-line order  along with a request for confirmation via video phone . Issue I may be closed at this point. Issue II may represent a threaded dialog concerning company service with regards to the customer order of issue I, or perhaps an agent-to-manufacturer dialog regarding how the order was handled with respect to issue I.","In accordance with CINOS functionality as previously taught in descriptions above, data may be mined from repository  for the purpose of enhancing service to customer . Mined data may be used to affect routing of interactions, product promotions or advertisements that may be sent to customer .

For example, instead of threaded dialogs being inherent to a specific customer with the dialog being about the customers interactions, it may be specific to a particular agent with the dialog about the agents activities. Such differences in thread assignment may be incorporated into one rules-based repository.","Interactive Multimedia Viewers and Applications","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, CINOS users comprising such as customers, agents, and business associates are provided with innovative multimedia applications that are containers for dedicated multimedia viewers enabling a particular user to perform a dedicated function or functions including gaining access to and viewing media from selected areas of CINOS data storage.

These interactive applications are built from a parent application or container that may contain all of the interactive modules that may be desired to effect a specific application to be presented to a user having a need for such an application.","According to various embodiments of the present invention, which are described below, the multimedia applications may be adapted for such tasks as placing orders, previewing products, determining customer profitability, calculating sales volumes, reviewing agent performances, or any other enterprise-conceived objective. The abilities and constraints applied to these unique applications are limited only by the imagination, and tools available to an authorized programmer or worker, such as a knowledge worker, who creates the applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00164","num":"00164"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["225","239","225"]},"Among these functional modules are interactive media viewers (IMV's)  which are provided and adapted for viewing certain media supported by the enterprise hosting a communication center employing CINOS. Supported media types may include but are not limited to telephony (traditional or IP), interactive voice response (IVR), e-mails, WEB embedded interfaces or forms, faxes, chat programs, multiparty threaded discussions, etc. IMV's  are unique in the fact that they are dedicated viewers including an interactive layer that enables viewing of only pre-selected media as defined by enterprise rules. For example, CINOS users may be assigned an identification code or number which will also be tagged to all of their stored interactions as described elsewhere above with reference to FIG. . These codes may be used to associate individuals with limitations and constraints from viewing media that is not part of their own contact history (for example). Other limitations or constraints may also be applied to IMV's  as may be conceived and implemented by a programmer such as playing or viewing interactions of certain dates, playing or viewing interactions about certain subjects, and so on. An editable software layer inherent to each viewer enables a programmer to build such constraints into a particular viewer, and to add the edited viewer to an IMA","Application Program Interfaces (API's)  are provided to allow a user to send obtained data or calculated results to connected peripheral devices or software modules or applications as may be required for operations such as printing, faxing, sending over a network, etc. If it is desired by enterprise rules, for example that a customer be able to print certain text or graphic information obtained through IMA , then the appropriate interface may be provided.","Database Access Modules (DAM's)  are provided for allowing access to normally restricted databases that may be connected to CINOS architecture. Such databases will of course include multimedia information systems (MIS), customer information systems (CIS), which may also include contact and agent associated data, external databases such as may be hosted by the enterprise, and so on. Constraints may be applied to DAM's  pertaining to which and or what portions of certain databases may be accessed by an application.","Programming language modules  are provided and adapted to facilitate the type of platform\/system that an IMA such as IMA  will be created for. One IMA such as IMA  may be adapted to run on a variety of system types and platforms. System platform modules are provided as API's for intended supported system\/platform combinations. Mathematical function modules (MFM's) are provided and adapted to interact with CINOS databases for the purpose of performing pre-selected calculations such as cost averaging and so on.","In this particular embodiment, IMA  is a finished application ready to be distributed. IMA  contains default display modules (not shown) for the purpose of enabling computer screen display on a user's system as is known in the art. IMA  may be stored in a special applications server (not shown) connected to the CINOS network either at WAN level or at the level of the hosting communication center. The method of distribution for IMA's such as IMA  may be of the form of a WEB-based client presentation to a user such as in customer window  of , for example. IMA  may also be of the form of a browser plug-in accessible via a server such as may be the case with a special applications server as described above. In other instances, such applications may be made a part of an agent's desktop and so on. There are many and varied possibilities.","In this particular embodiment, which is exemplary only, IMA  is of the form of an interactive purchase guide for bulk paper products as illustrated via underlined title. IMA , in this example, is logically separated into two distinct operations or functions. These are operation  and operation . Operation  is a product preview interactive guide, while operation  is an order guide. The number of operations built in to an IMA such as IMA  will depend upon the intended purpose of the application according to enterprise rules.","For exemplary purposes, assume that IMA  which is, in this case, a purchase guide for bulk paper products, is to be presented to a corporate buyer who is new on the job. Because he is new, he may be uncomfortable with his own knowledge of how much or what kind of paper to buy. His predecessor may have a long purchase history with the enterprise. Therefore, he requests an IMA such as IMA  that will allow him to preview products, browse the past purchase history of his predecessor, and perform a calculation that averages, by month, the last years paper purchases made by his company.","According to enterprise rules, IMA  adheres most closely to the buyer's request. That is, It allows for preview of products (), and leads the buyer toward an order (). IMA  may, in some instances, be designed specifically for one buyer if it is determined that his level of business contribution warrants it. However, in most cases, IMA applications such as application  will be more generic with interchange between different users accomplished with some editing performed based upon the intended use of the application and user parameters.","A communication center may provide a number of standard IMA's with each IMA adapted to a different objective. A communication center may also provide custom-built MIAs for any specific purpose. A certain amount of editing ability renders one IMA usable in more than one situation.","Referring now to IMA , as previously described, operations  (product preview) and operation  (order guide) are available and related to purchasing bulk paper products. Operation  begins by presenting two different platform options from which a user may select. A platform A may be a Windows platform, and a platform B may be a UNIX platform. There may be more or fewer options regarding platforms. Similarly, applicable modules such as may be generic to a certain platform are installed with each platform. In this way, one application may be run on differing platforms.","An API, labeled as such, shown logically connected beneath platforms A and B is illustrative of an interface for linked modules depended on platform choice. A database module (DAM) is first logically connected to the API module previously described. The DAM controls which database or databases may be accessed by IMA . A window shown immediately beneath the DAM provides an edit interface wherein the author or programmer may insert additional constraints, such as allowing access to only certain database sections and so on.","A mathematical function module (MFM) labeled as such is shown beneath, and logically connected to the edit window. MFM is adapted to allow prescribed mathematical operations to be performed relative to database information such as cost averaging, grouping by product preference, and so on. Various modules as have been described herein may bring up additional displays on a user's computer if the module in question offers a choice of operation or returns readable results. Furthermore, standard preview modules (not shown) may be presented as object models and invoke standard viewers such as may be installed on the user's computer system.","An interactive media viewer block (IMV) shown logically connected to MFM, allows the user to view pre-selected media interactions that are persistently stored in a database such as MIS  of FIG. . The IMV block shown may represent a plurality of unique IMVs or a single IMV. In this case three IMVs are involved, and these are represented by the blocks labeled TXT (text), VID (video), and AU (audio). Each individual IMV has an edit layer wherein a programmer may apply limitations or constraints relative to viewing capability. In some cases the same limitations may be applied to all the IMVs of an application in one editing sequence, such as by doing one edit and copying that edit to other IMVs. Although there are three illustrated viewer modules that make up the IMV in this example, more or fewer viewer modules may be used depending upon the intended use of IMA  and enterprise rules.","Although not explicitly shown, each IMV is editable through a software layer. In this way, a user may be limited to viewing certain media interactions and transactions that are allowed via enterprise rules. For example, TXT viewer may only be able to view e-mails from the user and agent in a specific interaction thread, but not intermittent e-mails on the thread that may be from agent to agent or supervisor to agent and so on. Because each interactor with CINOS has an identification, and all interactions from or to them are so identified, these identifiers may be used in the edit layer of each viewer to constrain the user. In this way, a user may be granted access to a history database and view only his interactions without imposing on other users who share the system. Likewise, agents or supervisors charged with the task of reviewing the activities of certain other agents may use applications such as IMA , adapted for the stated purpose, and be constrained in terms of whose interactions (agent's) may be viewed, and so on. In this manner full use may be provided to specialized users without exposing otherwise sensitive information that is not pertinent to the user or the purpose of the IMA.","Operation  created to allow a user to place an order for products is, in this case, a logical close for the previous operation. A module labeled Media Options may present standard media choices that the enterprise accepts for placing an order such as IP phone, e-mail, and so on. A connected text module (TXT) allows the user to send a quick text order while on-line. A send button sends a completed order to the enterprise.","It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that an IMA such as IMA  may be programmed for virtually any enterprise objective without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, such as those already described. By utilizing pre-built modules instead of writing codes line-by-line, programmers may greatly increase the efficiency of application preparation and presentation to users. In many cases only slight editing is required to present a new application to a particular user. By using COM, and other known conventions such as Java, applications are quickly assembled or modified as has been taught herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00181","num":"00181"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["239","10"]},"In step , the programmer or application author opens his tool kit. Such a tool kit may be part of tool kit  of  on a CINOS desktop interface. In step , the author sets system and platform parameters. That is, he inserts the proper functional modules for use of the application on specific platforms and or system types. For example, the author may set up one application to run on more than one platform or system such as IBM and Macintosh. It should be noted here that if more than one type of system is supported in one application, then the associated modules will need to be included as well.","In step , the author selects a programming language module containing libraries of known programming languages and codes. As known in the art, there are different programming languages used for different platforms. The author, in addition to building with pre-assembled modules, or building blocks, may have to write certain functional code in the supported language. In a preferred embodiment, the author has access to these language libraries from within his tool kit.","In step , database access module(s) (DAMs) are selected and inserted. As previously described with reference to , these modules will determine which and what portions of databases may be accessed. In an alternative embodiment these restrictions may also be a part of the editable layer of IMVs. Step  covers mathematical functions relative to selected databases. Mathematical function modules (MFM's) allow a user to perform pre-defined operations. MFMs may or may not be needed in an IMA. This step may be omitted if no such functions are requested by a user or otherwise required in an application.","In step , interactive media viewers (IMV's) are created using viewer modules adapted to view certain media of the type that stored interactions comprise. An IMV is a module that may comprise one or more than one media viewer. Each of these viewer modules are editable (via software layer) and may function alone or as a component of a larger module (comprising more than one viewer).","In step , closing modules are inserted to complete the application. For example, order modules are one example of a closing modules. Modules adapted to return displayed results would be another example. Moreover, peripheral device API's may be inserted to allow results to be printed, faxed, sent over the network, etc. In this way, a supervisor reviewing the performance of a group of agents may report to other concerned parties such as managers, enterprise board members, or the like.","The example as illustrated herein is basic but is deemed adequate by the inventor for illustration of one typical IMA building sequence. The description and order of steps may vary considerably.","IMA's such as IMA  are transportable over a network and may be stored on a special applications server at network level, or within the communication center. In some embodiments, user's will be connected to the Internet when using IMA's allowing CINOS access. In other embodiments, agents may access CINOS resources while working off-line with respect to the Internet. In such cases, logging on to CINOS is still required.","It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that IMA  as taught herein is interactive and displayable on a PC\/VDU that is logged into CINOS through a WAN. However, this is not specifically required to practice the present invention, but rather preferred. Other embodiments may include presenting a CTI interface such as an IVR wherein a user may interact with the application via voice or touch tone response.","In still another embodiment, such applications may be presented via external media such as on a floppy disk(s) or CD-ROM wherein a user may, by inserting the disk or CD, obtain the ability of accessing the enterprise via WAN, gaining access to CINOS, and performing an objective with the IMA.","Stored-Media Interface Engine (Interaction Object Model)","An object of the present invention is to allow certain CINOS systems to utilize data, such as data about customers, contacts, business associates, products and agents, to accomplish objectives and to effect improvements in overall system performance. Such data must be utilized very quickly in order to aid in influencing such system objectives as efficient routing to clients based on client data, or as another example, generating an updated sales-volume report based on an entire customer base's latest transactional history. Certain CINOS automated systems will have to be able to make decisions in a time frame that would not be sufficient to allow physical accessing of actual media. Therefore, an innovative interface between stored multimedia data and various CINOS intelligent systems is provided and taught below.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stored-media interface engine is provided in the form of an interaction object model (IOM). This unique convention provides a system-accessible abstract of all stored interactions within a multimedia communication center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00194","num":"00194"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["263","253","253","263","255","257","259","261"]},"Repository  is analogous to mass repository  of FIG. . It is logically divided into two sections. One section is for threaded text labeled Text-Based Data, and one is for multimedia storage labeled MIS Database. All of the communication center's interactions and transactions in this example are persistently stored in repository .","Automated CINOS systems such as systems  through  are adapted to interact with data stored in repository  in order to perform their intended functions related to CINOS operation. For example, CIS  uses data in repository  for presenting information to agent's at the time of or ahead of a live interaction. AT SYS  has to access and process data for generating system audits. RT SYS  requires data for intelligent routing purposes. AS SYS  uses data to update and configure services such as faxes, e-mails, voice messaging, and the like.","IOM  is adapted to function as an interface between repository  (hard data) and the data interaction systems as described above. IOM  is an object model comprising objects as representations of stored files in repository , such as non-text files of recorded transactions. Each object making up the model is a representation of one such file. In a preferred embodiment, IOM is a COM-based model with which other CINOS COM-based applications may readily interact without language conversion interfaces. However, in other embodiments, API's may be provided where language differences are present.","IOM  has various capabilities in various embodiments which may include, among other functions, a search function  adapted to accept parameters as a guide to obtain requested information from IOM memory (element ). There is in this embodiment a data-mining function  adapted for mining hard data and converting mined data into suitable code for applying to memory objects (represented interactions). A display function  is adapted to enable data results to be displayed on suitable screen monitors which may be associated with various data interaction systems as previously described. An API function  provides appropriate interface for linking interaction-data systems such as systems - to IOM . An edit function provides editing ability to object parameters by system applications which may, in some instances be automated, or, in other instances, manned by administrators or knowledge workers. An object memory  is a single file containing all of the objects which represent all of the communication center's stored interactions.","IOM  is run in much the same way as a standard relational object model as is known in the art, except that it is confined to text data and capable of multi-tasking (performing multiple simultaneous and unrelated functions) with respect to multiple system access. Another marked difference from a standard object model is the data mining functionality . In a preferred embodiment, function  may be used to add additional data to IOM memory in real time.","IOM  uses metadata, meaning data about data, in it's abstract representation of hard data files stored in repository  similar to other data warehousing systems. Such metadata may be, in some embodiments, compressed in memory for economy in storage. In a case such as that described above, a compression and decompression function would be added to IOM . IOM  utilizes memory area  for storing metadata objects a-z as illustrated. Metadata objects a-z, as illustrated, each represent a single transaction or interaction file stored in repository . Hence, the number of actual objects stored in memory  will equal the number of interactions stored in repository , if every stored transaction is shadowed in the IOM.","IOM  is innovative in the fact that it is an object model interface used as an accessible abstract representation of hard data files. Therefore, data-interaction systems may typically utilize IOM  in performing their dedicated functions without accessing any hard data stored in repository . The inventor knows of no system wherein data systems may obtain stored information to aid their dedicated functions in the manner and with the apparatus described above.","Memory  is typically located in repository  as is the rest of IOM functionality as illustrated via directional arrows emanating from repository  and pointing to a separate IOM . Software adapted to communicate with IOM  (not shown) may reside in each of the data-interaction systems - as illustrated via directional arrows pointing to API function . The above described relationship is not specifically required to effect the goal of the present invention, but rather preferred in it's practice. IOM  may reside on a separate database that is linked to repository . Similarly, API function  may contain all of the necessary components for interface with all communication center data-interaction systems without requiring each system to host software. There are many differing architectural possibilities.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, IOM  is continually updated in real time as interactions may be stored or deleted in repository . Rules-based routines determine what type of data will be used in each meta-data object stored in memory . Typically, enterprise important information such as client ID, client parameters, transactional analysis (such as profitability rating), credit rating, and so forth, will accompany more interaction-specific data, such as media type, interaction date, participating party ID's and their parameters, and any parsed information specific to the interaction and known to be required by one or more of the automated services. Interaction-specific information may include interaction purpose or goal, interaction results such as purchase information, resolved issue information, and so on.","Memory objects, such as objects a-z representing interactions, are not only identified with regards to involved parties as previously described, but may also be identified and associated according to the common thread order of interaction as represented in repository , or more specifically, the text-based portion which is threaded dialog.","It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that an IOM such as IOM  may be utilized with databases other than repository  without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, IOM  may also be used as a system interface to product information databases, external knowledge databases, or virtually any other database such as may be connected to CINOS or a similar operating system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00206","num":"00206"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"253"},"In step , a request to access an IOM such as IOM  of  is received from a data-interaction system such as RT SYS  of FIG. . In step , the IOM is activated to receive commands related to a dedicated operation or pre-defined process. Activation in this sense is defined as activation to receive from or communicate with a specific requesting system.","In step  commands are sent to the IOM for the purpose of initiating IOM functions as may be desired. In step , the IOM performs the requested function or functions. In this case, the function or functions are adapted to provide information to be used in routing of a new interaction. A simple example of a routing-related function would be to return the information associated with the identified client's last 5 interactions in order to determine a best fit agent to accept the new interaction. If it is determined that the last 5 interactions are leading to a purchase, and the prominent agent involved in the last 5 interactions is identified, then the new interaction may be held for that agent in the hopes that statistically, he is more likely to obtain a new order from the client. However, if the last 5 interactions are stagnant or leading away from a purchase, than the interaction may be routed to a new agent, perhaps with more skill at motivating clients to buy, and so on.","In step , displayable results from performed functions are returned to requesting systems. In some instances, results will not be required to be human readable or to be displayable on a monitor. However in other instances, this may be required such as an instance wherein data about a client is forwarded to the receiving agent ahead of the clients interaction.","It will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan that the process steps described above may vary in number and description according to type of business, type of data-interaction system requesting information, enterprise rules, and type of data accessed. This basic example is meant to provide a broad scope of functionality.","It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that CINOS may be implemented in a single communication center, or in a plurality of communication centers linked via WAN without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art that rules may be created which govern access to CINOS without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, customers may be required to subscribe to CINOS, and may also be provided with a customer application enabling such access. In another embodiment, access may be given to the general public according to established security rules governing commerce, financial transactions, and other processes.","There are many existing and future implementation opportunities for an interaction operating system such as CINOS many of which have already been stated.
