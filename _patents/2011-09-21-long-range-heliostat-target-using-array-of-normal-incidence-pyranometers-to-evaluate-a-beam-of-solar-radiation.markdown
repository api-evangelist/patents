{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Solar power towers are utilized to receive concentrated solar radiation to produce high-temperature thermal energy to generate utility-scale electricity or perform solar chemistry. To generate high thermal energy, solar power towers are located in fields that include numerous heliostats that collect and concentrate solar energy onto a central collector (e.g., solar receiver). For instance, the central collector is oftentimes mounted on top of the solar power tower. A heliostat includes, for example, a plurality of mirrored facets on a common frame that has two axis drives, such that the heliostat can track the sun over the course of a day. Current solar power tower fields include hundreds to thousands of heliostats. Moreover, solar power tower fields can include heliostats located at varying distances from the solar power tower. For example, the farthest heliostats from the solar power tower in some solar power tower fields can be at least a mile away from the solar power tower.","To obtain substantially optimal concentrated solar flux on the central collector from a heliostat, it is desirable for the heliostat to track and aim accurately since a very small error in tracking can result in a reflected solar beam that misses the central collector. Moreover, when a heliostat is positioned at a large distance from the solar power tower, a beam reflected by the heliostat commonly diverges and resulting irradiance on the central collector may be a fraction of one sun. Due to the divergence and low irradiance of the beam at large distances from the heliostat, however, it may be difficult to evaluate the beam from the heliostat.","Traditional approaches for evaluating a beam reflected by a heliostat commonly use a photographic flux image technique. When employing such an approach, incident solar radiation from the sun can be reflected by a heliostat. The heliostat can reflect the beam onto a target, wall, or other type of surface. Further, a camera can capture an image of the beam reflected off of the target, wall, or other type of surface. Moreover, a sensor such as a flux gauge can be employed to scale pixel values from the reflected image captured by the camera. However, as the distance between the heliostat and the target, wall, or other type of surface increases, the irradiance from the beam received at the camera can decrease. Accordingly, as the irradiance decreases, it becomes more difficult to distinguish the beam reflected by the heliostat from ambient light in the reflected image captured by the camera, thereby detrimentally impacting an ability to evaluate the beam reflected by the heliostat.","Described herein are various technologies that pertain to evaluating a beam reflected by a heliostat. A portable target that includes a plurality of sensors is configured to capture the beam reflected by the heliostat. The heliostat and the portable target can be positioned such that the heliostat reflects a beam of solar radiation towards the portable target (e.g., the plurality of sensors of the portable target). The plurality of sensors can include substantially any number of sensors. According to an example, the sensors can be silicon-detector-based collimated pyranometers or silicon-detector-based pyrheliometers. Moreover, the sensors can be arranged in a plane that is approximately transverse to a propagation path of the beam. The sensors output measured values indicative of a characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat. For example, the sensors can output measured values indicative of irradiance of the beam from the heliostat. Moreover, a computing device can generate and output data corresponding to the beam reflected by the heliostat based on the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam received from the sensors in the array. By way of example, the data can include a peak irradiance of the beam, a total power of the beam, an average irradiance of the beam, an average power of the beam, an irradiance distribution of the beam, a centroid of the beam, and so forth.","In accordance with an example, the sensors mounted on the portable target can measure direct normal irradiances of the beam reflected by the heliostat. Thus, the portable target can enable characterizing a quality of a beam reflected by the heliostat at larger distances compared to conventional approaches that employ the photographic flux image technique. According to an example, the plurality of sensors affixed to the portable target can be configured to capture the beam reflected from the heliostat and output measured values indicative of a characteristic of the beam when the heliostat and the portable target are separated by at least one half of a mile. By way of another example, the plurality of sensors affixed to the portable target can be configured to capture the beam reflected from the heliostat and output measured values indicative of a characteristic of the beam when the heliostat and the portable target are separated by at least one mile.","By way of another example, the computing device can generate and output (e.g., display, retain in memory, transmit, etc.) a measured irradiance distribution of the beam reflected by the heliostat based upon the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam received from the sensors in the array. The computing device can further generate a theoretical irradiance distribution of an ideal beam as a function of a distance between the portable target and the heliostat and output the theoretical irradiance distribution of the ideal beam with the measured irradiance distribution of the beam from the heliostat. For instance, the measured irradiance distribution and the theoretical irradiance distribution can be rendered on a display monitor to a technician. Further, the measured irradiance distribution and the theoretical irradiance distribution can be compared, and information pertaining to performance of the heliostat can be outputted based at least in part upon the comparison.","Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached figures and description.","Various technologies pertaining to evaluating beams from heliostats, which can be utilized in connection with solar power towers, are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","With reference to , an exemplary system  that facilitates evaluating a beam from a heliostat is illustrated. The system  comprises a heliostat  that includes a plurality of mirrored facets. For example, in operation, the heliostat  comprises a frame that holds the plurality of mirrored facets, and the frame may be configured with two axis drives such that the heliostat  can track the movement of the sun  over the course of a day. The heliostat , in operation, is configured to reflect solar radiation received at the mirrored facets.","The system  further includes a portable target . The portable target  is positioned to face the heliostat . According to an illustration, the heliostat  can be configured to reflect a beam of the received solar radiation towards the portable target . The portable target  includes a plurality of sensors  configured to capture the beam reflected by the heliostat . By way of illustration, the plurality of sensors  can measure a characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat . An example of the characteristic of the beam that can be measured by the plurality of sensors  is an irradiance of the beam. An irradiance of the beam can also be referred to as a flux density of the beam. The plurality of sensors  can measure irradiance of the beam at an instant in time, as a function of time, or the like. The plurality of sensors  further output values indicative of the characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat . For instance, a sensor from the plurality of sensors  can measure the irradiance of a portion of the beam from the heliostat  incident upon the sensor. Further, the sensor can generate a signal that specifies the value of the measured irradiance of the portion of the beam. The signal, for example, can be a voltage, a current, or the like; however, it is to be appreciated that the signal is not limited to the foregoing examples.","The plurality of sensors  can be arranged on the portable target  in an array to capture a spatial profile of the characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat  at a particular plane that is approximately transverse to the beam propagation path. The plurality of sensors  in the array can be arranged in substantially any manner within the particular plane. For instance, the plurality of sensors  can be arranged to form a radial array, a cross-shaped array, an X-shaped array, an array with M columns and N rows (where M and N can be substantially any integers), and so forth. According to an example, the plurality of sensors  can output measured values indicative of irradiances of portions of the beam respectively incident there upon.","The plurality of sensors  can measure direct normal irradiance of the beam reflected by the heliostat . According to an example, the plurality of sensors  can include a plurality of silicon-detector-based collimated pyranometers. By way of another example, the plurality of sensors  can include a plurality of silicon-detector-based pyrheliometers. However, it is contemplated that the plurality of sensors  can include other types of sensors with fast response times (e.g., on the order of a tenth of a second or less, on the order of 10 \u03bcs, etc.).","The portable target  is moveable and can be positioned at substantially any arbitrary distance from the heliostat  to characterize the beam from the heliostat . For instance, the portable target  can be positioned at a location such that the portable target  and the heliostat  are separated by at least one half of a mile. By way of another illustration, the portable target  can be positioned at a location such that the portable target  and the heliostat  are separated by at least one mile. However, it is further contemplated that the portable target  and the heliostat  can be separated by less than one half of a mile. With the heliostat  and the portable target  separated by any of the foregoing distances, the plurality of sensors  affixed to the portable target  are configured to capture the beam reflected by the heliostat  and output the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat .","A computing device  is in communication with the plurality of sensors  and can receive the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat  from the plurality of sensors . For example, one or more of the sensors  can be in communication with the computing device  by way of a wired connection. According to another example, one or more of the sensors  can be configured with wireless communication functionality that causes the measured values captured by such sensors  to be transmitted by way of a wireless communications channel to the computing apparatus . In yet another exemplary embodiment, one or more of the sensors  and the computing device  can be integrated in a single computing device.","The computing device  is configured with computer-executable code that generates data corresponding to the beam reflected by the heliostat  based on the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam. Moreover, the computing device  can output the data corresponding to the beam reflected by the heliostat . In an example, the computing device  can receive the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam reflected by the heliostat  from the plurality of sensors . From the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam, the computing device  can determine data corresponding to the beam reflected from the heliostat  such as, for instance, a peak irradiance of the beam, a total power of the beam, an average irradiance of the beam, an average power of the beam, an irradiance distribution of the beam, a centroid of the beam, a combination thereof, or the like. By way of illustration, the data can be outputted by being rendered on a display monitor, retained in memory, transmitted to a disparate computing device, or the like.","The data generated by the computing device  can specify a quality of the beam from the heliostat . For instance, the data can be utilized to evaluate how well the heliostat  tracks on target, how well the beam shape holds together, how well the heliostat  withstands the wind, and so forth at various distances. According to an example, the computing device  can interpolate and characterize the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam (e.g., measured irradiance values) to produce an irradiance distribution. Moreover, a shape of the beam, an area of the beam, an offset of the beam, or the like can be determined from the irradiance distribution (e.g., by the computing device , visually by a technician if the irradiance distribution is rendered on a display monitor, etc.).","By way of illustration, the plurality of sensors  can produce measured values (e.g., Millivolt signals) indicative of irradiances of the beam respectively measured thereby. The measured values can be recorded by an on-board data acquisition system (e.g., included in the computing device , coupled to the computing device , etc.). The computing device  can convert the measured values to irradiances (e.g., fluxes, Watts per meter squared). The computing device  can further interpolate and characterize the irradiances to produce an irradiance distribution (e.g., flux map, measured irradiance distribution) of the beam. Thus, the entire beam from the heliostat  can be characterized using the measured values from the plurality of sensors , which are distributed in an array on the portable target . Moreover, as measured values indicative of the irradiances measured by the plurality of sensors  vary over time, the computing device  can generate time varying irradiance distributions (e.g., irradiance measured by the plurality of sensors  can change with time if the heliostat  is vibrating in the wind, etc.). Thus, the computing device  can generate data corresponding to the beam reflected by the heliostat  under different wind loading conditions, for instance. The computing device  can determine a peak irradiance of the beam, an average irradiance of the beam, and the like from the time varying irradiance distributions, for example. In accordance with another example, the computing device  can integrate the irradiance of the beam over the area of the beam to determine a total power of the beam. According to a further example, a peak power of the beam, average power of the beam, and the like can be generated by the computing device  from the time varying irradiance distributions. By way of yet another example, the computing device  can estimate a centroid of the beam from the distribution of irradiances from the plurality of sensors  or from the irradiance distribution. Further, the computing device  can evaluate tracking of the heliostat  from the time varying irradiance distributions (e.g., identify whether the heliostat  is drifting, overshooting, tilted, etc.). Since the portable target  can be moved, a larger range of motion of the heliostat  can be analyzed in a shorter period of time when evaluating the tracking of the heliostat  as compared to using a stationary target. It is also contemplated that any of the foregoing data can be generated by the computing device  from the irradiances produced by the computing device  converting the measured values rather than from the irradiance distributions.","As described above, the computing device  can generate a measured irradiance distribution based on the measured values indicative of the characteristic of the beam. Moreover, a theoretical model that predicts a theoretical irradiance distribution (e.g., DELSOL, ray-tracing, etc.) can, be incorporated into the computing device  to provide near-real-time analysis and evaluation of the quality of the beam reflected by the heliostat . According to an example, the computing device  can determine a theoretical irradiance distribution of an ideal beam as a function of specifications such as the distance between the heliostat  and the portable target , orientation of the heliostat  with respect to the portable target , the time of day, the geographic location (e.g., coordinates), and so forth. For instance, a distance between the heliostat  and the portable target  can be measured or known a priori. Further, the computing device  can perform a comparison between the measured irradiance distribution and the theoretical irradiance distribution of the ideal beam. The computing device  can output information pertaining to performance of the heliostat  based at least in part upon the comparison. For instance, the information pertaining to the performance of the heliostat  can be information utilized to adjust the heliostat , identify a cause of the error, quantize the error (e.g., a slope error of the heliostat  that would provide the measured irradiance distribution, etc.), and so forth.","In an exemplary embodiment, the computing device  may have a display monitor corresponding thereto, wherein the display monitor displays a visual representation of the measured irradiance distribution of the beam and the theoretical irradiance distribution of the ideal beam. According to another example, the display monitor can display the information pertaining to the performance of the heliostat instead of or along with the visual representation of the measured irradiance distribution of the beam and\/or the visual representation of the theoretical irradiance distribution of the ideal beam. By way of another example, the display monitor can display other data generated by the computing device . For instance, the display monitor can be utilized by a technician that is adjusting the heliostat ; thus, as the heliostat  is adjusted, the technician can be provided with updated visual feedback that can be utilized to adjust, correct, understand, etc. errors in the heliostat . It is contemplated that the computing device  can be a desktop computer employed proximate the heliostat  (e.g., in a factory setting). In another example, the computing device  can be a portable computing device, such as a laptop computer, portable telephone, or the like, and can be utilized by a technician in the field, factory setting, etc.","In another exemplary embodiment, the computing device  can be in communication with another computing device (not shown) that is utilized by a technician that is manually adjusting the heliostat . In such an example, the visual representations and\/or information pertaining to the performance of the heliostat  are transmitted from the computing device  to the other computing device utilized by the technician.","In still yet another exemplary embodiment, adjustment of the heliostat  can be automatically undertaken without a technician. In such an embodiment, the heliostat  can include one or more actuators (not shown) operative to adjust the heliostat . The heliostat  can be configured to receive the information pertaining to the performance of the heliostat  (e.g., adjustments to be made to the heliostat ) and automatically adjust the heliostat  via the actuator responsive to receipt of the information. For instance, the one or more actuators can be in communication with a microprocessor on the heliostat . Further, the microprocessor on the heliostat  can be in wireless communication with the computing device , and the information can be transmitted (e.g., wirelessly) to the microprocessor. The microprocessor can then send commands to an appropriate actuator to cause adjustment of the heliostat .","In contrast to conventional systems that employ a photographic flux image technique for evaluating a beam reflected by a heliostat by capturing an image of the beam reflected off of a target, wall, or other type of surface, the plurality of sensors  mounted on the portable target  in the system  can directly measure a characteristic of the beam from the heliostat . Thus, by directly measuring the characteristic of the beam, the system  can be more sensitive than such conventional systems that characterize the beam from the reflected image as a distance increases between the heliostat  and a location at which the beam is being characterized. Accordingly, the beam from the heliostat  can be characterized by the portable target  at greater distances compared to conventional approaches.","Moreover, since the portable target  is moveable, the portable target  can be placed in substantially any position relative to the heliostat  to be characterized. The moveable nature of the portable target  allows for the beam from the heliostat  to be characterized prior to operation of a power plant including the heliostat . Thus, a solar power tower need not be positioned proximate to the heliostat  when using the portable target  to evaluate the beam from the heliostat . By way of example, the portable target  can be utilized to characterize the beam from the heliostat  when evaluating a design of the heliostat , facets of the heliostat , or the like. According to another example, the portable target  can be employed to characterize the beam from the heliostat  during construction of a solar power tower field. However, it is further contemplated that the portable target  can be utilized to characterize the beam from the heliostat  after construction of a solar power tower field. For instance, when used to produce power, the heliostat  along with other heliostats in a solar power tower field can be oriented to reflect solar radiation towards a solar collector on a solar power tower (not shown). Moreover, the heliostat  can be reoriented (e.g., change the angle of) to reflect the solar radiation towards the portable target  when evaluating the beam from the heliostat  while the other heliostats in the solar power tower field can remain oriented to reflect solar radiation towards the solar collector on the solar power tower; thus, the other heliostats can continue to be utilized to produce power while the beam from the heliostat  is characterized. Thereafter, the heliostat  can again be reoriented to reflect the solar radiation towards the solar collector on the solar power tower. Accordingly, heliostats in the solar power tower field can be evaluated one at a time, where the heliostat (e.g., heliostat ) being analyzed in the field can be aligned to the portable target  which is off line from the solar collector to mitigate intermixing of beams from other heliostat(s) with the beam from the heliostat being analyzed.","Moreover, it is to be appreciated that a solar power tower field can include the heliostat  and\/or heliostats substantially similar to the heliostat . Generally, hundreds or thousands of heliostats can be positioned proximate to a solar power tower such that a significant amount of solar radiation is concentrated at the collector on the solar power tower. The solar radiation captured by the concentrator utilizes heat energy, for instance, to heat a liquid to transform the state of the liquid to a gas and drive a turbine. This in turn can be utilized to generate utility-grade electrical power.","Now turning to , illustrated is an exemplary block diagram of a sensor  that can be mounted on a portable target (e.g., the portable target  of ). The sensor  can be configured to capture a beam (or a portion thereof) reflected from a heliostat. Moreover, the sensor  can output a measured value indicative of a characteristic of the beam reflected from the heliostat. For example, the plurality of sensors  described above with respect to  can include a plurality of sensors substantially similar to the sensor .","The sensor  is a silicon-detector-based collimated pyranometer. The sensor  includes a pyranometer  with an attached collimator . The pyranometer  comprises a detector  that measures solar radiation flux density (e.g., irradiance). The detector  is a silicon photovoltaic detector. Similarly (although not shown), a silicon-detector-based pyrheliometer includes a silicon photovoltaic detector. In contrast, conventional pyranometers as well as conventional pyrheliometers typically include a thermopile sensor rather than a silicon photovoltaic detector. Moreover, although not depicted, a cosine-corrected acrylic diffuser can be affixed over the detector .","The pyranometer  is designed to measure hemispherical irradiance. The pyranometer  (e.g., without the collimator  attached thereto) can measure irradiance from a field of view of approximately 180 degrees. Further, the collimator  is a tube that includes internal baffles that narrows an acceptance angle allowed into the detector  of the pyranometer . Accordingly, a conical or narrow beam can be allowed into the detector  by the collimator  as opposed to hemispherical acceptance. Thus, with the collimator  attached thereto, the pyranometer  can measure irradiance of a beam from a focused source (e.g., the heliostat  of ).","As depicted in , solar radiation  with a wide range of angles of incidence from various sources can be received by the collimator . The collimator  narrows an acceptance angle of the solar radiation  towards the normal (e.g., substantially perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence), thereby allowing a narrow beam  of solar radiation to pass there through to the detector  of the pyranometer . Accordingly, the solar radiation of the narrow beam  incident upon the detector  of the pyranometer  can be from the focused source.","Moreover, the pyranometer  with the silicon photovoltaic detector (e.g., the detector ) can have a fast response time. By way of example, the response time of the pyranometer  with the silicon photovoltaic detector can have a response time on the order of a tenth of a second or less. According to another example, the response time of the pyranometer  can be on the order of 10 \u03bcs. However, other response times are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims. In contrast, other types of sensors can have slower response times. For example, a conventional pyranometer or a conventional pyrheliometer (e.g., with a thermopile sensor) can have a response time on the order of 1 s. According to an illustration, the fast response time of the pyranometer  allows for measuring variations in irradiance resulting from vibration of a heliostat in windy conditions. On the contrary, a sensor that has a slower response time may be unable to react quickly enough to capture such variations in irradiance due to vibration of the heliostat in windy conditions.","With reference to , illustrated is an exemplary array  of sensors operable to evaluate a quality of a beam from a heliostat. The array  includes a plurality of sensors (e.g., sensor , etc.) arranged in a radial manner. However, it is contemplated that substantially any other arrangement of the sensors is intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims. For instance, other exemplary arrangements include a cross-shaped array, an X-shaped array, an array with M columns and N rows, or the like. Moreover, although not shown, it is to be appreciated that the array  is mounted upon a portable target (e.g., the portable target  of ).","The sensors in the array  are arranged in a plane that is approximately transverse to a propagation path of a beam . For instance, the beam  can be reflected by a heliostat. The sensors in the array  can evaluate a profile of the beam . Thus, the sensors in the array  can each directly measure irradiance of a portion of the beam  respectively incident thereupon and output a respective value corresponding to the measured irradiance. The outputted values can thereafter be employed by a computing device (e.g., the computing device  of ) as described herein.","According to an example, the sensors in the array  can be calibrated by pointing the array  at the sun. For instance, the array  can be directed towards the sun when the sun is rising or setting; however, it is further contemplated that the array  can be angled towards the sun in any other manner. Further, the sensors in the array  can be calibrated to read the same direct normal irradiance (DNI) values. Moreover, it is contemplated that the sensors in the array  can be periodically recalibrated; yet, the claimed subject matter is not so limited.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-6","FIGS. 4-6","FIGS. 4-6","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","402","404","400","406","408","410","412","414","406","414","406","414","402","404","400","406","414","402","404","406","414"]},"Further, the portable target  includes three radial members: radial member , radial member , and radial member  (collectively referred to as radial members -). The radial members - are respectively attached to the five vertical members -. While the portable target  depicted in  includes three radial members -, it is contemplated that a portable target can include one or more radial members respectively attached to at least two of the vertical members -. By way of example, the radial members - can be strut channels (e.g., steel, aluminum, etc.). Yet, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the above-noted example.","The radial members - stabilize the vertical members - of the portable target . Thus, according to an illustration, if utilized in a windy environment (e.g., winds up to 35 mph), the radial members - can mitigate deflections in the portable target . In contrast, a conventional flat screen target used with the traditional photographic flux image technique is oftentimes susceptible to deflection due to winds.","By way of example, the portable target  can be mounted on a flatbed trailer (not shown). Following this example, the bottom member  can be included in a base  of the portable target . Moreover, the base  of the portable target  can be coupled to the flatbed trailer. Mounting the portable target  on the flatbed trailer allows the portable target  to be moved to measure a characteristic of a beam reflected by a heliostat (e.g., the heliostat  of ) at various distances between the heliostat and the portable target .","According to an example, the portable target  can be approximately 60 feet high by 40 feet wide (e.g., the vertical members - can be approximately 60 feet high, and the top member  and the bottom member  can be approximately 40 feet wide). Following this example, the portable target  can be mounted on a 40 foot flatbed trailer. However, it is to be appreciated that the portable target  can have substantially any other dimensions. Moreover, it is contemplated that the portable target  need not have a rectangular shape as illustrated in .","Further, it is to be appreciated that the portable target  need not be mounted on a flatbed trailer. According to an example, the portable target  can be attachable to a solar power tower, a radio tower, or the like. Following this example, the portable target  can be moved from a first tower to a second tower, repositioned on a tower, and so forth.","Further, an array of sensors (e.g., sensor , etc.) is attached to the portable target . As depicted, the sensors are mounted on the portable target  to form a radial array that is centered on the vertical member  and the radial member . The radial members - can serve as mounting locations for the sensors (or a subset of the sensors). According to the depicted example, a first subset of the sensors are mounted on the radial members -, and a second subset of the sensors are mounted on the vertical member . By way of another example (not shown), the set of sensors can be mounted on the radial members - (e.g., an X-shaped array can include sensors mounted on the radial member  and the radial member , etc.). Pursuant to a further example, a member (e.g., strut channel) substantially similar to the radial members - can be vertically positioned nearby or attached to the vertical member , or the vertical member  can be replaced by a member (e.g., strut channel) substantially similar to the radial members -, and the member substantially similar to the radial member - along with the radial members - can serve as mounting locations for the set of sensors.","Now turning to , illustrated is a perspective view of the exemplary portable target  of . The portable target  is depicted in  without showing the sensors mounted thereupon. As depicted, the portable target  can further include vertical stabilization members: vertical stabilization member , vertical stabilization member , vertical stabilization member , vertical stabilization member , and vertical stabilization member  (collectively referred to as vertical stabilization members -). Moreover, a first set of support members can be respectively attached to the vertical member  and the vertical stabilization member , a second set of support members can be respectively attached to the vertical member  and the vertical stabilization member , a third set of support members can be respectively attached to the vertical member  and the vertical stabilization member , a fourth set of support members can be respectively attached to the vertical member  and the vertical stabilization member , and a fifth set of support members can be respectively attached to the vertical member  and the vertical stabilization member .
