Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), and more particularly, to a method for exchanging information between two devices in real-time in UPnP.","2. Description of the Related Art","Generally, a home network is a private network based on Internet Protocol (IP), and connects any type of a Personal Computer (PC) used at home and various devices, such as intelligent products, wireless devices, and the like, to one network, and controls that network via a common virtual computing environment called middleware.","Middleware enables communication between various digital devices by connecting the digital devices by using a peer-to-peer method. Examples of middleware include Home AV Interoperability (HAVI), a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) control device, a Java Intelligent Network Infrastructure (JINI), a Home Wide Web (HWW), and so forth.","In a computing environment established through the UPnP middleware, each device is allocated an address according to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), or is allocated an address selected by the Automatic IP-specifying function (Auto IP), through which communication is performed.","The UPnP network is a home-network technology, which defines the UPnP device and the UPnP service, and is defined by the protocol between them. The UPnP network is constituted by a Controlled Device (CD), which is a home-network device connected to and controlled by the home network, and a Control Point (CP), which is a device for controlling such a CD. The CP controls the CD, and requests and receives events. The CD performs specified functions according to the request of the CP, and when the state of the CD is changed, the CD sends the event to the CP that has requested the event.","Smart grid technology, provides integration technology into an existing home network power net to allow a power provider and a consumer to exchange real-time information interactively. The smart grid is a next-generation functional grid, which optimizes energy efficiency because the power provider and the consumer interactively communicate with one another by using the existing grid.","Currently, as a leader of standard technologies of in-home smart grid, the Zigbee\u00ae Smart Energy Profile (SEP) 2.0 technology is used. The Zigbee\u00ae SEP 2.0 technology is a lightweight profile based on REpresentational State Transfer (REST), and operates on the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Zigbee\u00ae SEP 2.0 technology defines a data model, a REST-based Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a device type, a function set, and the like.","However, in the current UPnP network, a technique for interactively exchanging real-time information by using an existing grid as in the smart grid is not applied. Therefore, there is a need for a technique for exchanging information on a real-time basis by using an existing UPnP network grid.","The present invention includes a method for exchanging information between two or more devices on a real-time basis by using the Zigbee\u00ae SEP 2.0 technology of a smart grid in an existing UPnP network.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a method for exchanging information by using a Smart Grid (SG) is provided. The method includes transmitting, by an SG Control Point (CP), an SG capability request message to a first device and a second device; receiving SG capability response messages from the first device and the second device; determining whether function sets of a same type are included in the received SG capability response messages from the first device and the second device; matching the function sets of the same type to one another; and connecting the first device and the second device to one another.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a system for performing information exchange by using a Smart Grid (SG) is provided. The system includes a first device and a second device having SG service types; and an SG Control Point (CP) for transmitting an SG capability request message to the first device and the second device, receiving SG capability response messages from the first device and the second device, matching function sets of the same type to one another if the function sets of the same type are included in the received SG capability response messages from the first device and the second device, and connecting the first device and the second device to one another for the information exchange.","According to another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for performing information exchange by using a Smart Grid (SG) is provided. The apparatus includes a transmitter for transmitting an SG capability request message to a first device and a second device; a receiver for receiving SG capability response messages from the first device and the second device;","a controller for determining whether function sets of the same type are included in the received SG capability response messages from the first device and the second device, and matching the function sets of the same type to one another; and a connector for connecting the first device and the second device to one another.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Throughout the drawings, the same elements will be designated by the same reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , Representational State Transfer (REST)-based Zigbee\u00ae SEP 2.0  is reflected in an existing UPnP configuration, and a Smart Grid (SG) Diagnostic Control Program (DCP)  for controlling the Zigbee\u00ae SEP 2.0  is generated on a UPnP configuration basis. Thus, devices operating in UPnP include the Zigbee\u00ae SEP 2.0  and the SG DCP .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["21","23","25"]},"Referring to , the first device  and the second device  have their respective UPnP SG service modules  and , and the SG CP  performs a control operation between the first device  and the second device  to enable communication between them. The SG CP  first discovers the first device  and the second device  which have the SG service modules  and , respectively, and connects the first device  and the second device  to one another. When connecting them, the SG CP  analyzes types included in the first device  and the second device , and matches function sets included in the types to one another. The first device  and the second device , upon being connected to one another, serve as a client and a server to transmit and receive information to one another.
