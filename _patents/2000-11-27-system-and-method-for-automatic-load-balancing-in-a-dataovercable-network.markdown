title: System and method for automatic load balancing in a data-over-cable network
abstract: A method and system for load balancing in a network system such as a data-over-cable system. One method includes receiving a first message on a first network device such as a cable modem termination system (“CMTS”) from a second network device and marking the first message with an identifier of a network access device. The method further includes intercepting the first message on a third network device such as a provisioning/access manager prior to any first protocol server such a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server receives the first message. When the third network device intercepts the first message, the third network device determines capabilities of the second network device and applies a set of rules to load balance any requests between a plurality of channel pairs. Each charmel pair is associated with at least one capability of a network device and also has a load factor parameter and a threshold value defining a capacity of a channel pair. The third network device assigns the second network device to a predetermined channel pair based on the capabilities of the second network device, a load factor of the channel pair and a capacity of the channel pair.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to communications in computer networks. More particularly, it relates to a method and a system for automatic boot server load balancing in a data-over-cable network.","Cable television networks such as those provided by Comcast Cable Communications, Inc., of Philadelphia, Pa., Cox Communications of Atlanta Ga., Time-Wamer Cable, of Marietta Ga., Continental Cablevision, Inc., of Boston Mass., and others, provide cable television services to a large number of subscribers over a large geographical area. The cable television networks typically are interconnected by cables such as coaxial cables or a Hybrid Fiber\/Coaxial (\u201cHFC\u201d) cable system which have data rates of about 10 Mega-bits-per-second (\u201cMbps\u201d) to 30+ Mbps.","The Internet, a world-wide-network of interconnected computers, provides multi-media content including audio, video, graphics and text that requires a large bandwidth for downloading and viewing. Most Internet Service Providers (\u201cISPs\u201d) allow customers to connect to the Internet via a serial telephone line from a Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) at data rates including 14,400 bps, 28,800 bps, 33,600 bps, 56,000 bps and others that are much slower than the about 10 Mbps to 30+ Mbps available on a coaxial cable or HFC cable system on a cable television network.","With the explosive growth of the Internet, many customers have desired to use the larger bandwidth of a cable television network to connect to the Internet and other computer networks. Cable modems, such as those provided by 3Com Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., Motorola Corporation of Arlington Heights, Ill., Cisco Corporation of San Jose, Calif., Scientific-Atlanta, of Norcross, Ga. and others offer customers higher-speed connectivity to the Internet, an intranet, Local Area Networks (\u201cLANs\u201d) and other computer networks via cable television networks. These cable modems currently support a data connection to the Internet and other computer networks via a cable television network with a data rate of up to 30+ Mbps, which is a much larger data rate than can be supported by a modem used over a serial telephone line.","Many cable television networks provide bi-directional cable systems, in which data is sent \u201cdownstream\u201d, from a \u201cheadend\u201d to a customer, as well as \u201cupstream\u201d, from the customer back to the headend. The cable system headend is a central location in the cable television network and, further, is responsible for sending cable signals in the downstream direction and receiving cable signals in the upstream direction. An exemplary data-over-cable system with RF return typically includes customer premises equipment such a customer computer, a cable modem, a cable modem termination system, a cable television network, and a data network such as the Internet.","Some cable television networks provide only uni-directional cable systems, supporting only a \u201cdownstream\u201d data path, which provides a path for flow of data from a cable system headend to a customer. A return data path via a telephone network, such as a public switched telephone network provided by AT&T and others, (i.e., a \u201ctelephone return\u201d) is typically used for an \u201cupstream\u201d data path, which provides a path for flow of data from the customer back to the cable system headend. A cable television system with an upstream connection to a telephone network is typically called a \u201cdata-over-cable system with telephone return.\u201d","An exemplary data-over-cable system with a telephone return typically includes customer premise equipment (\u201cCPE\u201d) entities (such as a customer computer or a Voice over Internet. Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) device), a cable modem, a cable modem termination system, a cable television network, a public switched telephone network, a telephone remote access concentrator, and a data network (e.g., the Internet). The cable modem termination system and the telephone remote access concentrator combined are called a telephone return termination systems.","If the customer premises equipment entity comprises a telephone or a device capable of sending and receiving video or voice signals, the cable modem has to be capable of sending and receiving such signals. In such cases the cable modem typically comprises an internal media terminal adapter, which provides a network interface functionality that accepts analog voice inputs or video signal and generates IP packets using the Real Time Transport protocol, for instance.","In a bi-directional cable system, when the cable modem termination system receives data packets from the data network, the cable modem termination system transmits received data packets downstream via the cable television network to a cable modem attached to the customer premises equipment entity. The customer premises equipment entity sends response data packets to the cable modem, which sends the response data packets upstream via the cable network. The cable modem termination system sends the response data packets back to the appropriate host on the data network.","In the case of a telephone return system, when the cable modem termination system receives data packets from the data network, the cable modem termination system transmits the received data packets downstream via the cable television network to a cable modem attached to the customer promises equipment entity. The customer premises equipment entity sends response data packets to the cable modem, which sends response data packets upstream via the public switched telephone network to the telephone remote access concentrator. Next, the telephone remote access concentrator sends the response data packets back to the appropriate host on the data network.","When a cable modem used in the cable system with the telephone return is initialized, a connection is made to both the cable modem termination system via the cable network and to the telephone return termination system via the public switched telephone network. As the cable modem is initialized, the cable modem initializes one or more downstream channels via the cable network. Also upon initialization, the cable modem receives a configuration file (a boot file) from a configuration server via a trivial file-transfer protocol (\u201cTFTP\u201d) exchange.","The configuration file may include a plurality of configuration parameters encoded in a type-length-value format (\u201cTLV\u201d), for instance. The configuration file may comprise a plurality of Class-of-Service (\u201cCoS\u201d) and Quality-of-Service (\u201cQoS\u201d) parameters. The Class of Service parameters include, for example, maximum allowed rates, minimum reserved rate, maximum latency and a plurality of other parameters. The Quality of Service parameters include, for example, parameters defining delays expected to deliver data to a specific destination, the level of protection from unauthorized monitoring or modification of data, expected residual error probability, relative priority associated with data and a plurality of other parameters.","Upon receipt of the configuration file, a cable modem may register with a cable modem termination system. To do that, the cable modem may send to the cable modem termination system a registration request message comprising a copy of the configuration file including a plurality of QoS and CoS parameters.","Typically, thousands of cable modems are connected to each cable modem termination system, and also a plurality of customer premises equipment (\u201cCPE\u201d) entities such as computers, VoIP compliant devices or telephones are connected to each cable modem. However, there are several problems associated with providing access to subscription services for tens of thousands of cable modems and customer premises equipment entities. At an initialization state or re-initialization state of network equipment, many devices compete simultaneously for dynamically provisioned attributes from the serving network devices. These serving network machines include, for example, servers that provide IP addresses, service authentication, boot configuration files and other policy and management services. There are many standard and proprietary legacy systems in use in large IP networks such as data-over-cable networks, Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (\u201cDSLAM\u201d) service areas, remote access servers (\u201cRAS\u201d) or Wireless Internet, all of which rely on a few robust servers to handle the traffic. In such centralized systems, delays from many simultaneous requests can overload the servers as in catastrophic recovery instances or first time initialization process.","Some existing provisioning systems have redundant DHCP or TFTP servers that enable back-up (active-standby or active-active modes). These systems rely on all servers getting a request and duplicate responses from the request input. Thus, these systems do not reduce the tendency for a system overload unless the back-up servers are over designed as very expensive ultra-reliable and fast machines. However, even then, the amount of capability to handle catastrophic recovery with a minimal downtime to users is small.","There are other existing solutions that rely on a distribution of client application software that controls client processes requesting services from the networks. However, the problem with these solutions is the scalability and interoperability. Most commonly used user operating systems have embedded processes for making the service requests. Trying to replace or override these methods can easily create problems with other applications or problems with the operating system itself. It also creates version problems in that co-resident applications and user operating systems change radically over time.","The major disadvantage of the existing solutions is that the existing systems tend to block the initialization process and do not have enough time or knowledge base to execute significant traffic redirection policies in real time.","Thus, it is desirable to develop a standard, reliable and efficient way to provide load-balancing tools preferably integrated into the existing cable modem infrastructure. Further, it is desirable to develop a method and system for a dynamic redirection of client requests for distribution of the load among many servers while minimizing the subscriber down time.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a method and a system for load balancing are developed.","In one embodiment, a method for load balancing is developed. The method includes receiving a first message on a first network device from a second network device and marking the first message with an identifier of a network access device associated with the second network device. For example, the identifier includes a MAC address of the network access device. In an exemplary embodiment, the first network device intercepts the first message prior to any first protocol server receives the first message. In one embodiment, the first protocol server is a DHCP server.","Further, according to an exemplary embodiment, the third network device includes a set of rules for load balancing of requests between a plurality of channel pairs, where each channel pair has a predetermined resources that can be assigned to a network device having predetermined capabilities. In one embodiment, upon the interception of the first message, the third network device determines capabilities of the second network device. For example, the third network device determines capabilities of the second network device using parameters in the first message. Further, the third network device may query a database to determine whether any configuration information record exists in the database for the second network device. In one embodiment, the database includes a plurality of configuration information records for all registered network devices, and each record is defined using an identifier of a network access device associated with the network device in the record.","Once the third network device determines the capabilities of the second network device, the third network device applies the set of rules to determine an assignment of a predetermined channel pair to the second network device. In one embodiment, the third network device assigns the predetermined channel pair to the second network device based on the determined capabilities of the second network device, a load factor associated with the channel pair and a threshold value defining a capacity of the channel pair.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the channel pair assigned to the second network device is a component of a predetermined service area having a plurality of channel pairs compatible with the channel pair assigned to the second network device. Further, the service area includes a plurality of second protocol servers such as Trivial File Transfer Protocol servers, for example. In one embodiment, the third network device load balances any TFTP requests between the Trivial File Transfer Protocol servers in the service area.","In one embodiment, a data-over-cable system for load balancing of requests from network devices is developed. The exemplary system includes a first network device for marking a first message from a second network device with an identifier of a network access device and a third network device for load balancing of a request in a first message prior to any first protocol server receiving the first message. According to an exemplary embodiment, the first message is a DHCP message, and a first protocol server is a DHCP server. In one embodiment, once the third network device intercepts the first message, the third network device determines capabilities of the second network device, applies a set of load balancing policy rules to determine the assignment of the second network device to a predetermined channel pair. In one embodiment, the third network device determines the assignment of the channel pair to the second network device based on the capabilities of the second network device, a load factor associated with the channel pair and a threshold value defining a capacity of the channel pair.","In one embodiment, each load balancing policy rule includes at least one condition defining predetermined capabilities of a network device and maps to a predetermined group of channel pairs. Then, based on load factors and capacities of each channel pair, the third network device assigns the second network device to one of the channel pairs from the predetermined group.","These as well as other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Exemplary data-over-cable system",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"Alternatively, the data-over-cable system  may be a uni-directional cable system supporting only a downstream data path from a cable television network headend to a customer premises equipment entity, such as a personal computer. In the uni-directional cable system, a return path is typically established via a telephone network (\u201ctelephone return\u201d), which provides an \u201cupstream\u201d data path from the customer premises equipment back to the cable television network \u201cheadend\u201d. In a uni-directional cable system, a cable modem may comprise an integral telephone modem for connecting to a Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) such as a PSTN , and the integral telephone modem may be connected to the cable modem for exchanging data.","The data-over-cable system  includes a Cable Modem Termination System (\u201cCMTS\u201d)  connected to a cable television network , hereinafter a cable network .  illustrates one CMTS . However, the data-over-cable system  may include multiple CMTS . Further, according to an exemplary embodiment, the CMTS  and any other network entities that will be described in the following paragraphs may be duplicated in a serial or a parallel arrangement to provide a back-up in case of failure.","In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the CMTS  may be a Total Control hub by 3Com Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., with a cable modem termination unit. A Total Control hub is a chassis with multiple networking cards connected by a common bus. However, the CMTS  could also be another network server such as a network server by Cisco Systems of San Jose, Calif., for instance.","The cable network  may be a cable television network such as one provided by Comcast Cable Communications, Inc., of Philadelphia, Pa., Cox Communications of Atlanta, Ga., or Time-Warner Cable, of Marietta, Ga., for instance.","A cable modem (\u201cCM\u201d)  is connected to the cable network  with a downstream cable connection. The cable modem may be provided by 3Com Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., or Motorola Corporation of Arlington Heights, Ill., for instance.","In the exemplary embodiment, the data-over-cable system  operates according to a set of specifications, one of which is the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (\u201cDOCSIS\u201d), published by Cable Television Laboratories. The DOCSIS standards may be found on the World Wide Web at the Universal Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) \u201cwww.cablemodem.com.\u201d As known in the art, the DOCSIS specification defines interface requirements for cable modems involved in a high speed data distribution over cable television networks. Further, the data-over-cable system  may be Packet Cable specifications compliant. The Packet Cable standards may be found on the World Wide Web at the URL \u201cwww.packetcable.com.\u201d The Packet Cable specifications define mechanisms required for supporting voice and video transmission over cable systems. If the data-over-cable system  is Packet Cable specification compliant, the CM  may comprise an internal media terminal adapter, or a media terminal adapter may otherwise be provided in communications with the CM . The media terminal adapter may provide a network interface functionality for transmitting voice or video signals and for converting analog voice inputs or video signals to P packets using, for instance, the Real Time Transport protocol.","Furthermore, if the data-over-cable system  is Packet Cable Specification compliant, the data-over-cable system  may include a plurality of additional network devices such as a call management server and a gate controller, for instance. The call management server may enable the media terminal adapter to establish multimedia sessions including voice communications applications such as \u201cIP telephony\u201d or \u201cVoIP\u201d. The gate controller may be used to perform authorization and authentication checks for users attempting to connect to the CMTS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["16","12","16","12","16","18","16","18","20","18","16"]},"If the data-over-cable system  is a bi-directional data-over-cable system, the CM  may have an upstream and downstream connection to the CMTS  via a cable television connection, a wireless connection or a satellite connection, for instance.  illustrates an exemplary upstream and downstream connection to the CMTS  via the cable network . In such embodiment, the CMTS  may still also provide data from the PSTN  to the CM  or the CPE entity .","In a downstream direction of a bi-directional data-over-cable system, a cable system typically has a passband with a lower edge between 50 MHz and 54 MHz and an upper edge between 300 MHz to 864 MHz. However, the data-over-cable system  is not limited to such frequencies, and frequencies in data-over-cable system may be implementation dependent. In the upstream direction, the cable system may have an operating frequency passband range from 5 MHz to 30 MHz or 5 MHz to 40 MHz, for instance.","As mentioned above, the cable system  may be a unidirectional cable system. In a unidirectional cable system, the CM  is connected to the PSTN  or other such network, which provides an upstream telephone connection. The upstream telephone connection may be a standard telephone line connection such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (\u201cISDN\u201d) connection, an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (\u201cADSL\u201d) connection or a wireless connection, for instance.","In that arrangement, the PSTN  may be connected to a Telephone Remote Access Concentrator (\u201cTRAC\u201d) . In the data-over-cable system having an upstream telephone connection, the TRAC  may be a Total Control telephone hub by 3Com Corporation of Santa Clara, for instance. However, the TRAC  could also be a telephone hub manufactured by a different company, or could take still other forms.","The combination of the CMTS  and the TRAC  is called a \u201cTelephone Return Termnination System\u201d (\u201cTRTS\u201d) . The TRTS  is illustrated as a dashed box in FIG. . The CMTS  and the TRAC  may be at a \u201cheadend\u201d of the cable system . Alternatively, for instance, the TRAC  may be located in a different location and may have routing associations with the CMTS .

Further, the CMTS  may connect a plurality of access points to the data-over-cable system . Additionally, the plurality of access points may be connected to cable headend access points. Such configurations may be \u201cone-to-one\u201d, \u201cone-to-many\u201d, or \u201cmany-to-many\u201d, and may be interconnected to other Local Area Networks (\u201cLANs\u201d) or Wide Area Networks (\u201cWANs\u201d).","The data-over-cable system  may comprise a plurality of network interfaces. As shown in , the TRAC  is connected to a data network  (e.g. the Internet, an intranet, a LAN or a WAN, for instance) via a TRAC-Network System Interface  (\u201cTRAC-NSI\u201d).

The CMTS  and a duplicated CMTS \u2032 (not shown) may operate simultaneously, with one of them active and the other one in a \u201cstandby\u201d state. In such an arrangement, the two units may communicate using a \u201ckeep alive\u201d signal, for instance. Thus, if the primary CMTS  fails, the redundant CMTS \u2032 may immediately start operating, and, ideally, there is no loss of service.","In another exemplary embodiment providing a back-up system, redundant units may operate in a serial manner. In the serial arrangement, units may be cross-connected with a heart-beat controlled shunt on ports.

However, other operation frequencies may also be used, and the invention is not limited to these frequencies. For an upstream transmission the RF Interface  may have an operation frequency range of about 5 MHz to 50 MHz. Further, the RF Interface  may use a signal modulation method, such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (\u201cQAM\u201d). As known in the art, the QAM is used as means for encoding digital information over radio, wire, or fiber optic transmission links. The QAM is a combination of amplitude and phase modulation and is an extension of a multiphase phase-shift-keying. The QAM may have any number of discrete digital levels typically including 4, 16, 64 or 256 levels. In an exemplary embodiment, QAM-64 may be used in the RF Interface . However, other operating frequencies and modulation methods could also be used, such as a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (\u201cQPSK\u201d) modulation, for instance. Further, the RF Interface  can also be used in a cable system with a telephone return.","In a data-over-cable system with a telephone return employed for an upstream connection, the CM  may be connected to the PSTN  in the physical layer via a telephone interface . In an exemplary embodiment, the telephony interface may operate in accordance with one of the standards of the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication (\u201cITU-T\u201d) Standardization Sector.

The IP layer  corresponds to the OSI layer , which is the network layer, but, typically, is not defined as part of the OSI model. As known in the art, IP is a routing protocol designed to route traffic within a network or between networks. More information on the IP protocol may be found at the URL \u201cwww.ietf.org\u201d in RFC-791. The ICMP layer  is used for network management. The ICMP provides a plurality of functions, such as error reporting, reachability testing (e.g., \u201cpinging\u201d), congestion control, route-change notification and performance or subnet addressing, for instance. More information on ICMP may be found at the URL \u201cwww.ietf.org\u201d in RFC-792.","A transport layer  is above the network layer . The transport layer  comprises a User Datagram Protocol (\u201cUDP\u201d) layer , which approximately corresponds to the OSI layer , the transport layer. As known in the art, UDP provides a connectionless mode of communications with datagrams. More information on the UDP layer  may be found at the URL \u201cwww.ietf.org\u201d in RFC-768.

In such an embodiment, when the provisioning\/access manager  receives the first message, the provisioning\/access manager  calls one or more dll extensions.","Then, at step , the provisioning\/access manager  determines the identity of a network device associated with the first message. In one embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  may determine the identity of the network device by comparing the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field with a MAC network address in the \u201cchaddr\u201d field of the first message. If the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field is the same as the MAC network address in the \u201cchaddr\u201d, the the provisioning\/access manager  concludes that the query came from a cable modem. However, if the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field differs from the network hardware address in the \u201cchaddr\u201d field then, the the provisioning\/access manager  recognizes that the query came from a CPE. In the exemplary embodiment associated with the method , the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field is the same as the MAC network address in the \u201cchaddr\u201d field. Thus, the provisioning\/access manager  concludes that the first message is associated with the cable modem, and in the exemplary embodiment, the first message is associated with the CM . If the values in the fields would differ, the third network entity would conclude that the first network device was a CPE, and  illustrate such an embodiment.","At step , the provisioning\/access manager  queries a database such as the database  to determine if any pre-configured records exist in the database for the CM . According to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  queries the database  using the MAC network address retrieved from the \u201coptions\u201d field in the first message. According to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  may specify the type of the first network device in the query. Thus, herein, the provisioning\/access manager  specifies that the first network device is a cable modem.","If a system administrator has enabled the DHCP filtering options while setting up the configuration options parameters, at step  in , the provisioning\/access manager  determines whether a prefix of the MAC network address of the CM  is one of the allowed MAC network address prefixes stored in the database . If the prefix of the MAC network address is not found in the database , at step , the provisioning\/access manager  does not process the first message, and the method  terminates. If the prefix of the MAC network address is one of the allowed MAC address prefixes, at step , the provisioningaccess manager  determines whether the database  includes a configuration information record associated with the MAC network address of the CM . If the database  does not have a configuration information record for the CM , the provisioning\/access manager  determines whether the system administrator set up any default settings for unknown network devices. If such settings has been set up, the MAC network address of the CM  is entered to the database. Further, the provisioning\/access manager  determines a default service class and a default configuration file ID with a full path to that file on a network server such as a Trivial File Transfer Protocol server. Further, the provisioning\/access manager  determines a Provider ID of a network server such as a DHCP server that has been assigned to handle the assignment of default settings such as the assignment of default IP addresses to unregistered network devices. In the exemplary embodiment, the DHCP  handles the assignment of the default configuration settings. At step , the default settings are returned to the CM .","Alternatively, a system administrator can enable one of the configuration options such as the \u201cDefault DHCP Processing\u201d option or the \u201cDrop packet\u201d option for unregistered network devices. As described in Table 6, if the system administrator enables the \u201cDefault DHCP Processing\u201d option, a network server such as the DHCP server  performs stock services for all received requests but does not add the MAC network address associated with the requests to the database . Further, if the system administrator enables the \u201cDrop packet\u201d option, the requests from the unregistered network devices are simply dropped and are not processed in the data-over-cable system .","If the provisioning\/access manager  has determined at step  that the record for the CM  exists in the database , at step , the provisioning\/access manager  retrieves the record from the database . In one embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  determines an identifier of a configuration file and an identifier of a service provider such as an identifier of a DHCP server to which the first message should be forwarded. In one embodiment, as shown in Table 2, each configuration file's identifier maps to a configuration file path, and the provisioninglaccess manager  inserts that configuration file path to the first message.","At step , the provisioning\/access manager  determines whether the \u201cService Forwarding\u201d configuration options parameter has been enabled by the system administrator. If the \u201cService Forwarding\u201d option has been enabled and the configuration record associated with the CM  includes an identifier of a service provider to which the first network message should be forwarded, at step , the provisioning\/access manager  forwards the first message to the specified provider. Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment, the network server such as the DHCP server  does not attempt further processing of the request in the first message simply forwards the first message to the specified provider. As described in reference to Table 5, each identifier of a service provider maps to an IP address of the service provider. Thus, the provisioning\/access manager  uses an IP address of the service provider from the record to forward the first message, and the method  terminates. However, if the \u201cService Provisioning\u201d option is disabled, at step , the provisioning\/access manager  uses the pre-provisioned configuration file identifier and configuration file path to process the first message.","The method  has been described in reference to network devices shown in FIG. . However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to these network devices, and more, fewer and equivalent network devices could also be employed to carry out the described method. Further, unless specified to the contrary, the steps of the flow chart may be taken in sequence other than that described, and more or fewer steps could be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A and 14B","b":["250","18","16"]},"Referring to , at step , the CPE  sends a first message in a data-over-cable system such as the data-over-cable system  shown in FIG. . According to an exemplary embodiment, the first message is a DHCP message such as a DHCPDISCOVER message or a DHCPREQUEST message and, the structure of the first message is as shown in FIG. . Further, according to an exemplary embodiment, the first message includes either a request to discover an IP address for the CPE  or an actual request for an IP address.","At step , a CMTS such as the CMTS  determines whether a system administrator has enabled a parameter associated with the QoS policy provisioning method. According to an exemplary embodimnent, the CMTS  determines whether the \u201cagentinfooption\u201d has been set by the system administrator. If the system administrator has not enabled the \u201cagentinfooption\u201d parameter, at step , the method  terminates, and the request in the first message is processed according to a standard DHCP method. However, if the system administrator has enabled the \u201cagentifooption\u201d, the first message is processed according to the exemplary embodiment.","In one embodiment, a vendor option field is added to the CMTS  such that when the \u201cagentinfooption\u201d is enabled, an identifier of a network access device such as a MAC network address of a network access device such as the MAC network address of the CM  is added to any DHCP request. Thus, at step , the second network device modifies the first message by marking the first message with the identifier of the CM . In a preferred embodiment, the CMTS  maps a MAC network address of the CM  in the \u201coptions\u201d field  of the first message and forwards the message. Further, the CMTS  places in the first message an IP address of the relay agent (the \u201ccpegiaddr\u201d set in the CMTS).","At step , a third network entity such as the provisioning access manager  intercepts the first message. According to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning access manager  intercepts DHCP messages prior to any DHCP network server receives the messages. Thus, the provisioning access manager  intercepts the first message prior to a DHCP server such as the DHCP server  receives the first message. In one embodiment, the provisioning access manager  includes a plurality of dll extensions that execute a set of instructions upon intercepting of any DHCP message. In such an embodiment, when the provisioning access manager  receives the first message, the provisioning access manager  calls one or more dll extensions to execute a set of instructions such as instructions to query a database for a record associated with the identifier included in the first message.","At step , the provisioning access manager  determines the identity of a network device that sent the first message. In one embodiment, the provisioning access manager  determines the identity of the network device by comparing the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field of the first message with a MAC network address in the \u201cchaddr\u201d field of the first message. In the exemplary embodiment, the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field is different than the MAC network address in the \u201cchaddr\u201d and, thus, this implies that a CPE in communication with the CM  is behind the request.","At step , the provisioning access manager  queries the database  to retrieve a configuration record associated with the MAC network address in the \u201coptions\u201d field of the first message. According to an exemplary embodiment, since the request has been identified as originating from the CPE, the implied function of the provisioning access manager  is to redirect the first message to a special IP range or scope based upon which network access device the CPE is behind. Further, if the CPE requests the network services for the first time, the provisioning access manager  enters the MAC network address from the \u201cchaddr\u201d field into the database  and marks it as belonging to the CPE. In one embodiment, this event may be a trigger point for the provisioning\/access manager  to query the CMTS  for a relationship of the CPE with a unique network access device such as the CM  in the exemplary embodiment.","If the system administrator has enabled the DHCP filtering options while setting up the configuration options, at step  in , the provisioning access manager  determines whether a prefix of the MAC network address of the network access device is one of the allowed MAC network address prefixes stored in the database. If the prefix of the MAC network address is not found in the database, the provisioning access manager  does not process the request in the first message, and the method  terminates.","If the prefix of the MAC network address is one of the allowed prefixes, the provisioning access manager  determines whether the database  includes a configuration information record associated with the MAC network address of the network access device. If the database  does not include any records associated with the network access device, the method  terminates. If the configuration information record for the MAC network address specified in the \u201coptions\u201d field exists in the database, at step , the provisioning access manager  retrieves the configuration record from the database .","Based on the retrieved record, at step , the provisioning access manager  determines what class of service any network device behind the network access device should receive. After the class of service has been determined, the provisioning access manager  looks up the service class table, which is keyed by the incoming \u201cgiaddr\u201d and service classes. The exemplary set of parameters associated with the service class configuration was shown in Table 4.","At step , after the provisioning access manager  finds an attribute associated with the class of service for the CPE, the provisioning access manager  maps the incoming \u201cgiaddr\u201d to a new \u201cgiaddr\u201d (\u201cmapped giaddr\u201d) that specifies the scope of network addresses providing a desired class of service. The \u201cmapped giaddr\u201d allows the network server such as the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the CPE out of the server's subnet, and a new subnet associated with the \u201cmapped giaddr\u201d provides the desired class of service. Further, the \u201cmapped giaddr\u201d does not necessarily differ from the incoming \u201cgiaddr\u201d and, in some embodiments, the \u201cmapped giaddr\u201d is the same as incoming \u201cgiaddr\u201d. Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment, the subnets may be created with the context of service class or, alternatively, with the context of service provider or any other functionality or accounting based grouping.","At step , the provisioning access manager  determines whether the \u201cService Forwarding\u201d configuration option parameter has been enabled by the system administrator. If the \u201cService Forwarding\u201d configuration parameter has been enabled and, further, the configuration information record associated with the MAC network address of the network access device includes an identifier of the service provider to which the requests should be forwarded then, at step , the provisioning access manager  forwards the request to the specified service provider. In such an embodiment, the network server such as the DHCP server  does not attempt to further process the request in the first message sent from the first network device. However, if the \u201cService Provisioning\u201d configuration option is disabled, at step , the network server such as the DHCP server  processes the request in the first message.","The method  has been described in reference to network devices shown in FIG. .

Thus, the second network device receives a non-routable IP address and is given an intranet access.","Then, according to an exemplary embodiment, at step , a customer is automatically redirected to an Intranet web server such as the Intranet web server . At step , the customer is queried to enter a desired CoS, billing information and account information, and the customer signs-up for the service. For example, during the sign-up process, the customer is queried to enter a password or a userid that the customer wants to use. To verify whether the selected userid or the password is available, the Intranet web server  communicates with the OSS\/BSS .","At step  in , the Intranet web server  communicates with an application server such as the application server . In one embodiment, the server  provides sign-up information data of the second network device to the application server . To create any records for the second network device, the application server  determines what network access device is associated with the first network device. To do that, the application server  queries a first protocol server such as the DHCP server  for a MAC network address of the network access device, which in the exemplary embodiment is the MAC network address of the CM . After the MAC network address is obtained, at step , a new configuration record is created for the network access device associated with the MAC network address, and the configuration record is stored in the database . According to an exemplary embodiment, the new configuration record includes a plurality of parameters such as a configuration file name for the network access device with a path to the configuration file on a designated server, and a service class identifier for network devices attached to the network access device. Further, a record is created to identify what service class the customer should receive. It is possible that the customer signed up for a prepaid service plan, in which a MAC network address of a customer's network access device is marked as such.

In one embodiment, the rules from the \u201cRules Builder\u201d are executed prior to providing network services to network devices in an exemplary data-over-cable system. For example, a set of rules may be executed prior to a boot file assignment or an IP address assignment. In one embodiment, a system administrator may create a set of conditions associated with each rule via the GUI tool . Further, the system administrator provisions and manages the rule assignment and creation of a plurality of conditions associated with each rule via a dialog box such as the one shown in  illustrating the administration tools. In one embodiments the system administrator simply selects the graphical selection input \u201cRules Builder\u201d to invoke an interface for setting up rule definitions.  illustrates an exemplary dialog box that the system administrator uses for creating rules and adding or deleting conditions associated with each rule. In particular,  illustrates a \u201cLoad Balance \u201d rule with a set of conditions associated with the \u201cLoad Balance \u201d rule.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the \u201cRules Builder\u201d is used to define a number of predefined conditions, and when all conditions in a specific rule are valid, then, other parts of the system can take actions based on the predefined conditions. In one embodiment, a single rule comprises a plurality of conditions that all must be true for the rule to be a valid condition. In one embodiment, if a rule includes a valid condition, the rule maps to a profile identifier associated with the rule. Further, the profile identifier may be associated with a functional operation or a set of sub-profiles that map to a predetermined set of parameters.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  administers load balancing. In one embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  manages and stores in the database  a plurality of parameters associated with CMTSs in data-over-cable networks. The storing of these parameters allows the provisioning\/access manager  to malke better decisions concerning boot file assignment, forwarding of requests to network devices and CMTS load balancing. According to an exemplary embodiment, the parameters associated with the CMTSs include definitions of CMTS service areas, individual CMTS settings and cable pair settings.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a CMTS service area defines a set of compatible channel pairs that are arranged to service the same set of CMs on the network. According to an exemplary embodiment, the channel pairs are compatible when any CM that comes up on one of them could also come up on any of the channel pairs in a given service area. Further, a service area could be composed of many physical CMTSs, and many service areas could be located on the same CMTS. Further, the service areas are not restricted to a specific CMTS, and the service areas can overlap. For example, if a CMTS  has channel pairs 1, 2, 3, 4 and a CMTS  has channel pairs A, B, C, D then, any combination of channel pairs may establish a service area. For example, a service area  could include channel pairs , A and B, a service area  could include channel pairs C and D, and a service area  could include channel pairs ,  and B. However, it should be understood that service areas do not correlate with IP subnets since the IP subnets directly relate to a predetermined CMTS, and a service area could span multiple CMTSs. Thus, for example, if a CMTS  supports a class C subnet of 192.1.10.0 then, no other CMTS can handle direct CM traffic for the 192.1. 10.0 subnet.","A channel pair is unique for a service area and a CMTS and, therefore, the same value of the channel pair can be used in a different service area. Further, according to an exemplary embodiment, each CMTS is defined by its internal settings such as subnets that are supported on a CMTS, channel pairs associated with the CMTS or passwords, for example.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the \u201cRues Builder\u201d defines a set of rules that are applied to capabilities and settings of an incoming CM and, if a rule is true, the CM is assigned to a specified type of channel pair. Further, the \u201cRules Builder\u201d includes rules that are is set in such a manner so that some rules can take precedence over each other. In one embodiment, a more complicated rule is processed prior to a less complicated rule is processed. Once a rule is evaluated to being true then, a predetermined set of actions is triggered. However, if none of the rules are true, a default policy is triggered.","In one embodiment, load-balancing policies could be applied to move certain versions of CMs, or CMs with certain capabilities, to specific channel pairs or CMTSs. Since the channel pairs belong to CMTSs, it is possible to effectively load balance CMs between different CMTSs. In one embodiment, for example, a set of rules could be created to re-route all DOCSIS 1.1 CMs to a predetermined CMTS, a group of predetermined CMTSs or specific downstream channel pairs. Similarly, the same type of rule could be created for DOCSIS 1.0 modems. Further, a set of modem assignment rules could be created to assign CMs to downstream channels or CMTSs based on segregating types of CPEs to predetermined CMTSs that support them. For example, all telephony CMs could be pre-segregated to a predetermined group of CMTSs, and all host-based CMs could be pre-segregated to a different predetermined group of CMTSs. As mentioned in the proceeding paragraphs, the assignment could also be based on the channel pairs.","Table 18 illustrates a set of parameters that could be set up in a data-over-able system with a load balancing policy according to an exemplary embodiment.

Also, with such an exemplary setting, the provisioning\/access manager  would assign CMs to this channel pair half as often as for a channel pair with a \u201cLoad Factor\u201d of 100%. For example, 2 out of 3 requests could be directed to the channel pair with the 100% \u201cLoad Factor\u201d to allow for a smoother distribution of CM requests.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a set of global load balancing policy rules is created on the provisioning\/access manager .

In another embodiment, a set of policies could be created to allow only a predetermined number of requests from one type of CPE device to be forwarded to any given server address. Further, according to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  may monitor and manage traffic engineering based on a number of requests over time. For example, a set of rules could be created to allow no more that a predetermined number of requests to any given server address over a predetermined number of seconds.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  may execute the exemplary set of global load-balancing policy rules upon a receipt of any DHCP message from a network device such as the CM  or the CPE .

For example, the provisioning\/access manager  may determine whether the network device is DOCSIS 1.0 or DOCSIS 1.1 compliant network device based on information in a DHCP message sent from the network device. In an exemplary embodiment, every DHCP message includes an option code  that is a Vendor Class Identifier, and the option code  includes information that allows the third network device to differentiate between DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 1.0 requests.

Thus, the third network device uses the identifier in the first message to verify whether the first network device is a registered network device.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a load balancing policy can be disabled or enabled in the exemplary data-over-cable system. At step , the third network device determines whether the load balancing policy has been enabled and, further, whether any rules has been set up for the load balancing policy. If the load balancing policy is not enabled, at step , the third network device assigns default parameters for the first network device. In one embodiment, if the first network device is a registered network device, the third network device assigns a set of parameters defined in the configuration information record of the first network device. In an exemplary embodiment, each record in the database  is established using identifiers of network access devices. Thus, the third network device retrieves the configuration information record from the database  using the identifier from the first message. However, if the first network device is not a registered network device, the third network device may process the first message using default configuration parameters associated with unknown network devices.","If the load balancing has been enabled in the exemplary data-over-cable system, at step , the third network device determines capabilities of the network access device associated with the first network device using the information in the first message and any information from the configuration information record. In the exemplary embodiment, the first network device comprises the network access device and, thus, the third network device determines capabilities of the first network device. In one embodiment, the third network device uses the first message to determine the capabilities of the first network device. For example, the third network device may determine whether the first network device is a DOCSIS 1.1 or DOCSIS 1.0 compliant network device, or whether the second network is used in a Telco Return data-over-cable system. However, the exemplary embodiment is not limited to determining whether the first network device is the DOCSIS 1.1 or DOCSIS 1.0 compliant network device or whether it is used in the Telco Return system. For example, the third network device could also determine fewer, more, different or equivalent parameters associated with the capability of the second network device such as any fragmentation parameters.","Once the third network device determines the capabilities of the network access device (in the exemplary embodiment, the capability of the first network device), at step , the third network device applies a load balancing policy. In one embodiment, the third network device applies the load balancing policy based on the capabilities of the first network device, the type of the first network device and, further, based on a set of rules associated with the load balancing policy. In the exemplary embodiment, the database stores the set of rules associated with the load balancing policy as well as the availability and a current use of channel pairs. In addition, if the first network device is a registered network device, the third network device may also use any parameters stored in a configuration information record associated with the first network device to determine the capabilities of the first network device and load-balance the request according to the set of rules. For example, in one embodiment, the configuration information record of the first network device could include forwarding data with an instruction to forward any requests from the first network device to a predetermined server.","At step , the third network device determines whether any rule resolves to being a true condition. If none of the rules are true, at step , the third network device applies a default rule. In one embodiment, the default rule maps to a predetermined set of parameters associated with the default rule. If one of the rules is true, at step , the third network device determines the assignment of network resources and parameters based on the true rule and further based on load factors. In one embodiment, the third network device determines a channel pair that should be assigned to the first network device based on the true rule associated with the capabilities of the first network device and, further, based on available channel pairs and a load factor associated with each channel pair.","At step , the third network device assigns a set of parameters to the first network device based on the rule, and farther, the third network device records the assignment of parameters. In the exemplary embodiment, the third network device records the assignment of channel pairs to the first network device in order to efficiently load-balance any future requests.","In the exemplary method , the first network device is the CM , the second network device is the CMTS  and the third network device is the provisioning\/access manager . Further, the first message is a DHCP message and the first protocol server is a DHCP server. Also in the exemplary method , the marked identifier in the first message includes a MAC address of the CM . However, the exemplary method is not limited to these network devices, and different or equivalent network devices could also be used. Further, unless specified to the contrary, the steps of the flow chart may be taken in sequence other than that described, and more or fewer steps could be used.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  handles DHCP requests in accordance with a set of rules associated with the load balancing policy, according to an exemplary embodiment. Table 20 illustrates an exemplary set of requests from CMs, and an exemplary channel assignment based on capabilities of each CM. The channels in Table 20 correspond to a set of channels shown in Table 18 and a channel assignment is based on the set of global load balancing policy rules shown in Table 19.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0197","num":"0196"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 20"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"CM","CM Capabilities","Assigned Channel"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"CM 1","MTA Device","CP1"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 2","MTA Device","CP 3"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 3","MTA Device","CP 1"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 4","MTA Device","CP 2"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 5","V1.0 Telco Return","CP 4"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 6","V1.0 2WayCm","CP 5"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 7","V1.0 Fragmentation enabled","CP 3"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 8","V1.1, No Fragmentation","CP 6"]},{"entry":[{},"CM 9","V1.1 Telco Return,","CP 6"]},{"entry":[{},{},"No Fragmentation"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In the exemplary Table 20, the requests of MTA capable network devices are most likely to be assigned to the channel pair  since, as shown in Table 8, the load factor of the channel pair  is 100%. Further, because the channel pair  has the load factor of 75%, the provisioning\/access server  assigns the channel pair  prior to an assignment of any requests to the channel pair  since the channel pair  has the load factor of 50%. Further, since the load factor of the channel pair  is twice as high as the load factor of the channel pair , the channel pair  receives half as many CM assignments as the channel pair . Further, for example, since the CM  is defined as a V1.0 device and has the fragmentation enabled, the provisioning\/access manager  assigns the CM  to the CP  since the exemplary load balancing policy (Rule C) states that the CM V1.0 having the fragmentation enabled should be assigned to a channel pair defined as the \u201cFrag Supported\u201d. According to an exemplary embodiment, if a CM has capabilities that are not specified by the load balancing policy, and a CM is a CM version 1.1, then such a CM meets the conditions of the \u201cDefault\u201d rule defined in Table 19. Thus, the CM  and the CM  are assigned to the CP .","Further, according to an exemplary embodiment, the provisioning\/access manager  redistributes DHCP messages with TFTP requests between a plurality of TFTP servers. The redistribution of TFTP requests between a number of different TFTP servers is especially useful after the power outage when thousands of CMs may re-boot at the same time since a typical TFTP server is only capable to handle around a couple hundred requests per minute. In one embodiment, each CMTS service area has a list of TFTP servers associated with the CMTS service area, and the provisioning\/access manager  load-balances the TFTP server re-direction across available TFTP servers and, further, keeps the record of all TFTP server re-directions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0200","num":"0199"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"450"},"Referring to , at step , a first network device marks a first message from a second network device with an identifier of a network access device. In an exemplary embodiment, the second network device includes the network access device and, thus, the first network device marks the first message with an identifier of the second network device. At step , a third network device intercepts the first message prior to any first protocol server receives the first message.","At step , the third network device determines capabilities of the second network device using parameters in the first message. In one embodiment, the third network device determines whether the type of the second network device. For example, the third network device determines whether the second network device is DOCSIS 1.0 or DOCSIS 1.1 compliant network device. Further, the third network device may determine the type of a network, in which the second network device operates. For example, the second network device could operate in a data-over-cable system using a telephony return, or the second network device could operate in a two-way data-over-cable network, or any other non-cable network.","In addition to determining the capabilities of the second network device using the parameters in the first message, the third network device uses the identifier marked in the first message to determine whether the second network device is one of the registered network devices. In one embodiment, a database associated with the third network device stores identifiers of all registered network devices, and each identifier of a network device is associated with a configuration information record. Thus, if the second network device is a registered network device, the third network device determines any additional parameters associated with the capabilities of the second network device by retrieving from a database the configuration information record associated with the second network device.","At step , the third network device determines whether a forwarding function has been enabled. If forwarding has been enabled, at step , the third network device determines if any additional policies have been set. In one embodiment, the policies could include a set of rules, where each rule maps to a predetermined functional operation or a predetermined set of parameters. For example, a set of rules could be defined to assign a predetermined channel pair for the second network based on the capabilities of the second network device and based on load factors associated with each channel pair. If no additional policies have been set, at step  the third network device forwards the first message to a predetermined server, where the predetermined server is a first protocol server. In one embodiment, if the second network device is one of the registered network devices and, further, a configuration information record associated with the second network device includes an identifier of a predetermined first protocol server, the third network device may forward the first message to the predetermined first protocol server listed in the record.","If any additional policies have been set, at step , the third network device determines a predetermined profile associated with the second network device. In one embodiment, the third network device determines the predetermined profile of the second network device using the parameters associated with the capabilities of the second network device. For example, the predetermined profile parameter associated with the second network device could map to a predetermined service area having a plurality of second protocol servers.","According to an exemplary embodiment, each of the plurality of second protocol servers is capable to handle a predetermined number of requests, and the third network device keeps track of all requests being handled. In one embodiment, each service area could have a threshold parameter defining a maximum number of requests that could be handled by a group of second protocol servers associated with a specific service area In such an embodiment, at step , the third network device determines whether an overload has occurred in the service area associated with the second network device. In one embodiment, the third network device determines whether the overload has occurred in the service area using a predetermined threshold value defining a maximum number of request for the service area.","If the overload has not occurred in the service area associated with the second network device, at step , the third network device assigns the second network device to the pre-determined service area. Further, the second network device load-balances the request in the first message between the second protocol servers in the predetermined service are However, if the overload has occurred in the service area, at step , the third network device determines whether the request in the first message could be re-directed. In one embodiment, if the second network device is a registered network device, the third network device determines whether the configuration information record associated with the second network device specifies any alternative second protocol servers. Alternatively, the third network device could have a list of alternative second protocol servers compliant with each predefined service area. In such an embodiment, the third network device determines if at least one such an alternative second protocol server exists for the service area associated with the second network device. If either the configuration information record of the second network device or the third network device includes a record defining an alternative second protocol server for the second network device, at step , the third network device redirects the first message to the predetermined server in the record.","If the redirection is not possible, for example, the third network device determines whether any default service area have been defined for any requests that can not be handled in predetermined service areas. If such a default service area has been defined, and default second protocol servers in the default service area are not overload, at step , the third network device load balances the request between the default second protocol servers. In a second embodiment, if the redirection is not possible, the third network device drops the first message and notifies the second network device that the request could not be processed.","Further, at step , the third network device records that the overload has occurred in the predetermined service area associated with the second network device. If a default service area has been assigned to the second network device, the third network device records that the default service area has been assigned to handle processing of the first message. In one embodiment, once the overload problem in the predetermined service area associated with the second network device is overcome, the third network device may request the second network device to re-send the first message so that one of the second protocol servers in the service area of the second network device can process the request in the first message.","In the exemplary embodiment, the first network device is the CMTS , the second network device is the CM  and the third network device is the provisioning\/access manager . Further, the first protocol servers are DHCP servers, the first message is a DHCP message and the second protocol servers are TFTP servers. Further, the identifier of the second network device includes a MAC address of the second network device.
