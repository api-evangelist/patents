title: Rapid acquisition spreading codes for spread-spectrum communications
abstract: A method and system for rapidly acquiring a spreading code, used in a code division multiple access (CDMA) system. A first long code and a second long code, with each long code having a length of N chips, are generated. The first long code is different from the second long code. The first long code and the second long code are transmitted at a first phase angle and at a second phase angle, respectively, on a carrier signal, over a communications channel using radio waves. The first long code and the second long code may be transmitted at an in-phase (I) angle and at a quadrature-phase (Q) angle, respectively, on the carrier signal. From the communications channel, an I-phase acquisition circuit and a Q-phase acquisition circuit may acquire, in parallel, the first long code and the second long code from the I-phase angle and the Q-phase angle, respectively, of the carrier signal by searching, in parallel, N/2 chips, the first long code and the second long code.

No. 6,212,174 which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/669,775, filed Jun. 27, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,010; which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application 60\/000,775 filed Jun. 30, 1995.","The present invention generally pertains to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications, also known as spread-spectrum communications. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a system and method for providing a high capacity, CDMA communications system which provides for one or more simultaneous user bearer channels over a given radio frequency, allowing dynamic allocation of bearer channel rate while rejecting multipath interference.","Providing quality telecommunication services to user groups which are classified as remote, such as rural telephone systems and telephone systems in underdeveloped countries, has proved to be a challenge in recent years. These needs have been partially satisfied by wireless radio services, such as fixed or mobile frequency division multiplex (FDM), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiplex (TDM), time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, combination frequency and time division systems (FD\/TDMA), and other land mobile radio systems. Usually, these remote services are faced with more potential users than can be supported simultaneously by their frequency or spectral bandwidth capacity.","Recognizing these limitations, recent advances in wireless communications have used spread spectrum modulation techniques to provide simultaneous communication by multiple users. Spread spectrum modulation refers to modulating a information signal with a spreading code signal; the spreading code signal being generated by a code generator where the period Tc of the spreading code is substantially less than the period of the information data bit or symbol signal. The code may modulate the carrier frequency upon which the information has been sent, called frequency-hopped spreading, or may directly modulate the signal by multiplying the spreading code with the information data signal, called direct-sequence spreading (DS). Spread-spectrum modulation produces a signal with bandwidth substantially greater than that required to transmit the information signal.","Synchronous reception and despreading of the signal at the receiver recovers the original information. A synchronous demodulator in the receiver uses a reference signal to synchronize the despreading circuits to the input spread-spectrum modulated signal to recover the carrier and information signals. The reference signal can be a spreading code which is not modulated by an information signal. Such use of a synchronous spread-spectrum modulation and demodulation for wireless communication is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,056 entitled SYNCHRONOUS SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AND METHOD by Donald L. Schilling, which techniques are incorporated herein by reference.","Spread-spectrum modulation in wireless networks offers many advantages because multiple users may use the same frequency band with minimal interference to each user's receiver. Spread-spectrum modulation also reduces effects from other sources of interference. In addition, synchronous spread-spectrum modulation and demodulation techniques may be expanded by providing multiple message channels for a single user, each spread with a different spreading code, while still transmitting only a single reference signal to the user. Such use of multiple message channels modulated by a family of spreading codes synchronized to a pilot spreading code for wireless communication is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,951 entitled HIGH CAPACITY SPREAD-SPECTRUM CHANNEL by Donald L. Schilling, which is incorporated herein by reference.","One area in which spread-spectrum techniques are used is in the field of mobile cellular communications to provide personal communication services (PCS). Such systems desirably support large numbers of users, control Doppler shift and fade, and provide high speed digital data signals with low bit error rates. These systems employ a family of orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal spreading codes, with a pilot spreading code sequence synchronized to the family of codes. Each user is assigned one of the spreading codes as a spreading function. Related problems of such a system are: supporting a large number of users with the orthogonal codes, handling reduced power available to remote units, and handling multipath fading effects. Solutions to such problems include using phased-array antennas to generate multiple steerable beams, using very long orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal code sequences. These sequences may be reused by cyclic shifting of the code synchronized to a central reference, and diversity combining of multipath signals. Such problems associated with spread spectrum communications, and methods to increase capacity of a multiple access, spread-spectrum system are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307 entitled SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS by Gilhousen et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.","The problems associated with the prior art systems focus around reliable reception and synchronization of the receiver despreading circuits to the received signal. The presence of multipath fading introduces a particular problem with spread spectrum receivers in that a receiver must somehow track the multipath components to maintain code-phase lock of the receiver's despreading means with the input signal. Prior art receivers generally track only one or two of the multipath signals, but this method is not satisfactory because the combined group of low power multipath signal components may actually contain far more power than the one or two strongest multipath components. The prior art receivers track and combine the strongest components to maintain a predetermined Bit Error Rate (BER) of the receiver. Such a receiver is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390 entitled DIVERSITY RECEIVER IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM by Gilhousen et al. A receiver that combines all multipath components, however,is able to maintain the desired BER with a signal power that is lower than that of prior art systems because more signal power is available to the receiver. Consequently, there is a need for a spread spectrum communication system employing a receiver that tracks substantially all of the multipath signal components, so that substantially all multipath signals may be combined in the receiver, and hence the required transmit power of the signal for a given BER may be reduced.","Another problem associated with multiple access, spread-spectrum communication systems is the need to reduce the total transmitted power of users in the system, since users may have limited available power. An associated problem requiring power control in spread-spectrum systems is related to the inherent characteristic of spread-spectrum systems that one user's spread-spectrum signal is received by another user's receiver as noise with a certain power level. Consequently, users transmitting with high levels of signal power may interfere with other users' reception. Also, if a user moves relative to another user's geographic location, signal fading and distortion require that the users adjust their transmit power level to maintain a particular signal quality. At the same time, the system should keep the power that the base station receives from all users relatively constant. Finally, because it is possible for the spread-spectrum system to have more remote users than can be supported simultaneously, the power control system should also employ a capacity management method which rejects additional users when the maximum system power level is reached.","Prior spread-spectrum systems have employed a base station that measures a received signal and sends an adaptive power control (APC) signal to the remote users. Remote users include a transmitter with an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit which responds to the APC signal. In such systems the base station monitors the overall system power or the power received from each user, and sets the APC signal accordingly. Such a spread-spectrum power control system and method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,299,226 entitled ADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,840 entitled ADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM TRANSMITTER, both by Donald L. Schilling and incorporated herein by reference. This open loop system performance may be improved by including a measurement of the signal power received by the remote user from the base station, and transmitting an APC signal back to the base station to effectuate a closed loop power control method. Such closed loop power control is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,225 entitled HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE CLOSED LOOP AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL CIRCUIT to Charles E. Wheatley, III et al. and incorporated herein by reference.","These power control systems, however, exhibit several disadvantages. First, the base station must perform complex power control algorithms, increasing the amount of processing in the base station. Second, the system actually experiences several types of power variation: variation in the noise power caused by the variation in the number of users and variations in the received signal power of a particular bearer channel. These variations occur with different frequency, so simple power control algorithms can be optimized to compensate for only one of the two types of variation. Finally, these power algorithms tend to drive the overall system power to a relatively high level. Consequently, there is a need for a spread-spectrum power control method that rapidly responds to changes in bearer channel power levels, while simultaneously making adjustments to all users' transmit power in response to changes in the number of users. Also, there is a need for an improved spread-spectrum communication system employing a closed loop power control system which minimizes the system's overall power requirements while maintaining a sufficient BER at the individual remote receivers. In addition, such a system should control the initial transmit power level of a remote user and manage total system capacity.","Spread-spectrum communication systems desirably should support large numbers of users, each of which has at least one communication channel. In addition, such a system should provide multiple generic information channels to broadcast information to all users and to enable users to gain access to the system. Using prior art spread-spectrum systems this could only be accomplished by generating large numbers of spreading code sequences.","Further, spread-spectrum systems should use sequences that are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal to reduce the probability that a receiver locks to the wrong spreading code sequence or phase. The use of such orthogonal codes and the benefits arising therefrom are outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM, by Gilhousen et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,193,094 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING SUPER-ORTHOGONAL CONVOLUTIONAL CODES AND THE DECODING THEREOF, by Andrew J. Viterbi, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, generating such large families of code sequences with such properties is difficult. Also, generating large code families requires generating sequences which have a long period before repetition. Consequently, the time a receiver takes to achieve synchronization with such a long sequence is increased. Prior art spreading code generators often combine shorter sequences to make longer sequences, but such sequences may no longer be sufficiently orthogonal. Therefore, there is a need for an improved method for reliably generating large families of code sequences that exhibit nearly orthogonal characteristics and have a long period before repetition, but also include the benefit of a short code sequence that reduces the time to acquire and lock the receiver to the correct code phase. In addition, the code generation method should allow generation of codes with any period, since the spreading code period is often determined by parameters used such as data rate or frame size.","Another desirable characteristic of spreading code sequences is that the transition of the user data value occur at a transition of the code sequence values. Since data typically has a period which is divisible by 2, such a characteristic usually requires the code-sequence to be an even length of 2. However, code generators, as is well known in the art, generally use linear feedback shift registers which generate codes of length 2\u22121. Some generators include a method to augment the generated code sequence by inserting an additional code value, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,054 entitled POWER-OF-TWO LENGTH PSEUDONOISE SEQUENCE GENERATOR WITH FAST OFFSET ADJUSTMENT by Timothy Rueth et al and incorporated herein by reference. Consequently, the spread-spectrum communication system should also generate spreading code sequences of even length.","Finally, the spread-spectrum communication system should be able to handle many different types of data, such as FAX, voiceband data, and ISDN, in addition to traditional voice traffic. To increase the number of users supported, many systems employ encoding techniques such as ADPCM to achieve \u201ccompression\u201d of the digital telephone signal. FAX, ISDN and other data, however, require the channel to be a clear channel. Consequently, there is a need for a spread spectrum communication system that supports compression techniques that also dynamically modify the spread spectrum bearer channel between an encoded channel and a clear channel in response to the type of information contained in the user's signal.","The present invention is embodied in a multiple access, spread-spectrum communication system which processes a plurality of information signals received simultaneously over telecommunication lines for simultaneous transmission over a radio frequency (RF) channel as a code-division-multiplexed (CDM) signal. The system includes a radio carrier station (RCS) which receives a call request signal that corresponds to a telecommunication Line information signal, and a user identification signal that identifies a user to which the call request and information signal are addressed. The receiving apparatus is coupled to a plurality of code division multiple access (CDMA) modems, one of which provides a global pilot code signal and a plurality of message code signals, and each of the CDMA modems combines one of the plurality of information signals with its respective message code signal to provide a spread-spectrum processed signal. The plurality of message code signals of the plurality of CDMA modems are synchronized to the global pilot code signal. The system also includes assignment apparatus that is responsive to a channel assignment signal for coupling the respective information signals received on the telecommunication lines to indicated ones of the plurality of modems; The assignment apparatus is coupled to a time-slot exchange means. The system further includes a system channel controller coupled to a remote call-processor and to the time-slot exchange means. The system channel controller is responsive to the user identification signal, to provide the channel assignment signal. In the system, an RF transmitter is connected to all of the modems to combine the plurality of spread-spectrum processed message signals with the global pilot code signal to generate a CDM signal. The RF transmitter also modulates a carrier signal with the CDM signal and transmits the modulated carrier signal through an RF communication channel.","The transmitted CDM signal is received from the RF communication channel by a subscriber unit (SU) which processes and reconstructs the transmitted information signal assigned to the subscriber. The SU includes a receiving means for receiving and demodulating the CDM signal from the carrier. In addition, the SU comprises a subscriber unit controller and a CDMA modem which includes a processing means for acquiring the global pilot code and despreading the spread-spectrum processed signal to reconstruct the transmitted information signal.","The RCS and the SUs each contain CDMA modems for transmission and reception of telecommunication signals including information signals and connection control signals. The CDMA modem comprises a modem transmitter having: a code generator for providing an associated pilot code signal and for generating a plurality of message code signals; a spreading means for combining each of the information signals, with a respective one of the message code signals to generate spread-spectrum processed message signals; and a global pilot code generator which provides a global pilot code signal to which the message code signals are synchronized.","The CDMA modem also comprises a modem receiver having associated pilot code acquisition and tracking logic. The associated pilot code acquisition logic includes an associated pilot code generator; a group of associated pilot code correlators for correlating code-phase delayed versions of the associated pilot signal with a receive CDM signal for producing a despread associated pilot signal. The code phase of the associated pilot signal is changed responsive to an acquisition signal value until a detector indicates the presence of the despread associated pilot code signal by changing the acquisition signal value. The associated pilot code signal is synchronized to the global pilot signal. The associated pilot code tracking logic adjusts the associated pilot code signal in phase responsive to the acquisition signal so that the signal power level of the despread associated pilot code signal is maximized. Finally, the CDMA modem receiver includes a group of message signal acquisition circuits. Each message signal acquisition circuit includes a plurality of receive message signal correlators for correlating one of the local receive message code signals with the CDM signal to produce a respective despread receive message signal.","To generate large families of nearly mutually orthogonal codes used by the CDMA modems, the present invention includes a code sequence generator. The code sequences are assigned to a respective logical channel of the spread-spectrum communication system, which includes In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) transmission over RF communication channels. One set of sequences is used as pilot sequences which are code sequences transmitted without modulation by a data signal. The code sequence generator circuit includes a long code sequence generator including a linear feedback shift register, a memory which provides a short, even code sequence, and a plurality of cyclic shift, feedforward sections which provide other members of the code family which exhibit minimal correlation with the code sequence applied to the feedforward circuit. The code sequence generator further includes a group of code sequence combiners for combining each phase shifted version of the long code sequence with the short, even code sequence to produce a group, or family, of nearly mutually orthogonal codes.","Further, the present invention includes several methods for efficient utilization of the spread-spectrum channels. First, the system includes a bearer channel modification system which comprises a group of message channels between a first transceiver and second transceiver. Each of the group of message channels supports a different information signal transmission rate. The first transceiver monitors a received information signal to determine the type of information signal that is received, and produces a coding signal relating to the coding signal. If a certain type of information signal is present, the first transceiver switches transmission from a first message channel to a second message channel to support the different transmission rate. The coding signal is transmitted by the first transceiver to the second transceiver, and the second transceiver switches to the second message channel to receive the information signal at a different transmission rate.","Another method to increase efficient utilization of the bearer message channels is the method of idle-code suppression used by the present invention. The spread-spectrum transceiver receives a digital data information signal including a predetermined flag pattern corresponding to an idle period. The method includes the steps of: 1) delaying and monitoring the digital data signal; 2) detecting the predetermined flag pattern; 3) suspending transmission of the digital data signal when the flag pattern is detected; and 4) transmitting the data signal as a spread-spectrum signal when the flag pattern is not detected.","The present invention includes a system and method for closed loop automatic power control (APC) for the RCS and SUs of the spread-spectrum communication system. The SUs transmit spread-spectrum signals, the RCS acquires the spread-spectrum signals, and the RCS detects the received power level of the spread-spectrum signals plus any interfering signal including noise. The APC system includes the RCS and a plurality of SUs, wherein the RCS transmits a plurality of forward channel information signals to the SUs as a plurality of forward channel spread-spectrum signals having a respective forward transmit power level, and each SU transmits to the base station at least one reverse spread-spectrum signal having a respective reverse transmit power level and at least one reverse channel spread-spectrum signal which includes a reverse channel information signal.","The APC includes an automatic forward power control (AFPC) system, and an automatic reverse power control (ARPC) system. The AFPC system operates by measuring, at the SU, a forward signal-to-noise ratio of the respective forward channel information signal, generating a respective forward channel error signal corresponding to a forward error between the respective forward signal-to-noise ratio and a predetermined signal-to-noise value, and transmitting the respective forward channel error signal as part of a respective reverse channel information signal from the SU to the RCS. The RCS includes a plural number of AFPC receivers for receiving the reverse channel information signals and extracting the forward channel error signals from the respective reverse channel information signals. The RCU also adjusts the respective forward transmit power level of each one of the respective forward spread-spectrum signals responsive to the respective forward error signal.","The ARPC system operates by measuring, in the RCS, a reverse signal-to-noise ratio of each of the respective reverse channel information signals, generating a respective reverse channel error signal representing an error between the respective reverse channel signal-to-noise ratio and a respective pre-determined signal-to-noise value, and transmitting the respective reverse channel error signal as a part of a respective forward channel information signal to the SU. Each SU includes an ARPC receiver for receiving the forward channel information signal and extracting the respective reverse error signal from the forward channel information signal. The SU adjusts the reverse transmit power level of the respective reverse spread-spectrum signal responsive to the respective reverse error signal.","General System Description","The system of the present invention provides local-loop telephone service using radio links between one or more base stations and multiple remote subscriber units. In the exemplary embodiment, a radio link is described for a base station communicating with a fixed subscriber unit (FSU), but the system is equally applicable to systems including multiple base stations with radio links to both FSUs and Mobile Subscriber Units (MSUs). Consequently, the remote subscriber units are referred to herein as Subscriber Units (SUs).","Referring to , Base Station (BS)  provides call connection to a local exchange (LE)  or any other telephone network switching interface, such as a private branch exchange (PBX) and includes a Radio Carrier Station (RCS) . One or more RCSs , ,  connect to a Radio Distribution Unit (RDU)  through links , , , , , and RDU  interfaces with LE  by transmitting and receiving call set-up, control, and information signals through telco links , , . SUs ,  communicate with the RCS  through radio links , , , , . Alternatively, another embodiment of the invention includes several SUs and a \u201cmaster\u201d SU with functionality similar to the RCS. Such an embodiment may or may not have connection to a local telephone network.","The radio Links  to  operate within the frequency bands of the DCS1800 standard (1.71-1.785 Ghz and 1.805-1.880 GHz); the US-PCS standard (1.85-1.99 Ghz); and the CEPT standard (2.0-2.7 GHz). Although these bands are used in described embodiment, the invention is equally applicable to the entire UHF to SHF bands, including bands from 2.7 GHz to 5 GHz. The transmit and receive bandwidths are multiples of 3.5 MHz starting at 7 MHz, and multiples of 5 MHz starting at 10 MHz, respectively. The described system includes bandwidths of 7, 10, 10.5, 14 and 15 MHz. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the minimum guard band between the Uplink and Downlink is 20 MHz, and is desirably at least three times the signal bandwidth. The duplex separation is between 50 to 175 MHz, with the described invention using 50, 75, 80, 95, and 175 MHz. Other frequencies may also be used.","Although the described embodiment uses different spread-spectrum bandwidths centered around a carrier for the transmit and receive spread-spectrum channels, the present method is readily extended to systems using multiple spread-spectrum bandwidths for the transmit channels and multiple spread-spectrum bandwidths for the receive channels. Alternatively, because spread-spectrum communication systems have the inherent feature that one user's transmission appears as noise to another user's despreading receiver, an embodiment may employ the same spread-spectrum channel for both the transmit and receive path channels. In other words, Uplink and Downlink transmissions can occupy the same frequency band. Furthermore, the present method may be readily extended to multiple CDMA frequency bands, each conveying a respectively different set of messages, uplink, downlink or uplink and downlink.","The spread binary symbol information is transmitted over the radio links  to  using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation with Nyquist Pulse Shaping in the present embodiment, although other modulation techniques may be used, including, but not limited to, Offset QPSK (OQPSK) and Minimum Shift Keying (ASK). Gaussian Phase Shift Keying (GPSK) and M-ary Phase Shift Keying (MPSK)","The radio links  to  incorporate Broadband Code Division Multiple Access (B-CDMA\u2122) as the mode of transmission in both the Uplink and Downlink directions. CDMA (also known as Spread Spectrum) communication techniques used in multiple access systems are well-known, and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,056 entitled SYNCHRONOUS SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD by Donald T Schilling. The system described utilizes the Direct Sequence (DS) spreading technique. The CDMA modulator performs the spread-spectrum spreading code sequence generation, which can be a pseudonoise (PN) sequence; and complex DS modulation of the QPSK signals with spreading code sequences for the In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) channels. Pilot signals are generated and transmitted with the modulated signals, and pilot signals of the present embodiment are spreading codes not modulated by data. The pilot signals are used for synchronization, carrier phase recovery, and for estimating the impulse response of the radio channel. Each SU includes a single pilot generator and at least one CDMA modulator and demodulator, together known as a CDMA modem. Each RCS , ,  has a single pilot generator plus sufficient CDMA modulators and demodulators for all of the logical channels in use by all SUs.","The CDMA demodulator despreads the signal with appropriate processing to combat or exploit multipath propagation effects. Parameters concerning the received power level are used to generate the Automatic Power Control (APC) information which, in turn, is transmitted to the other end of the communication link. The APC information is used to control transmit power of the automatic forward power control (AFPC) and automatic reverse power control (ARPC) links. In addition, each RCS ,  and  can perform Maintenance Power Control (MPC), in a manner similar to APC, to adjust the initial transmit power of each SU , , ,  and . Demodulation is coherent where the pilot signal provides the phase reference.","The described radio links support multiple traffic channels with data rates of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 144 kb\/s. The physical channel to which a traffic channel is connected operates with a 64 k symbol\/sec rate. Other data rates may be supported, and Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding can be employed. For the described embodiment, FEC with coding rate of \u00bd and constraint length 7 is used. Other rates and constraint lengths can be used consistent with the code generation techniques employed.","Diversity combining at the radio antennas of RCS ,  and  is not necessary because CDMA has inherent frequency diversity due to the spread bandwidth. Receivers include Adaptive Matched Filters (AMFs) (not shown in ) which combine the multipath signals. In the present embodiment, the exemplary AMFs perform Maximal Ratio Combining.","Referring to , RCS  interfaces to RDU  through links , ,  with, for example, 1.544 Mb\/s DS1, 2.048 Mb\/s E1; or HDSL Formats to receive and send digital data signals. While these are typical telephone company standardized interfaces, the present invention is not limited to these digital data formats only. The exemplary RCS line interface (not shown in ) translates the line coding (such as HDB3, B8ZS, AMI) and extracts or produces framing information, performs Alarms and Facility signaling functions, as well as channel specific loop-back and parity check functions. The interfaces for this description provide 64 kb\/s PCM encoded or 32 kb\/s ADPCM encoded telephone traffic channels or ISDN channels to the RCS for processing. Other ADPCM encoding techniques can be used consistent with the sequence generation techniques.","The system of the present invention also supports bearer rate modification between the RCS  and each SU , , ,  and  communicating with RCS  in which a CDMA message channel supporting 64 kb\/s may be assigned to voiceband data or FAX when rates above 4.8 kb\/s are present. Such 64 kb\/s bearer channel is considered an unencoded channel. For ISDN, bearer rate modification may be done dynamically, based upon the D channel messages.","In , each SU , , ,  and  either includes or interfaces with a telephone unit , or interfaces with a local switch (PBX) . The input from the telephone unit may include voice, voiceband data and signaling. The SU translates the analog signals into digital sequences, and may also include a Data terminal  or an ISDN interface . The SU can differentiate voice input, voiceband data or FAX and digital data. The SU encodes voice data with techniques such as ADPCM at 32 kb\/s or lower rates, and detects voiceband data or FAX with rates above 4.8 kb\/s to modify the traffic channel (bearer rate modification) for unencoded transmission. Also, A-taw, u-law, or no companding of the signal may be performed before transmission. For digital data, data compression techniques, such as idle flag removal, may also be used to conserve capacity and minimize interference.","The transmit power levels of the radio interface between RCS  and SUs , , ,  and  are controlled using two different closed loop power control methods. The Automatic Forward Power Control (AFPC) method determines the Downlink transmit power level, and the Automatic Reverse Power Control (ARPC) method determines the Uplink transmit power level. The logical control channel by which SU  and RCS , for example, transfer power control information operates at least a 16 kHz update rate. Other embodiments may use a faster or slower update rate for example 64 kHz. These algorithms ensure that the transmit power of a user maintains an acceptable Bit-Error Rate (BER), maintains the system power at a minimum to conserve power, and maintains the power level of all SUs , , ,  and  received by RCS  at a nearly equal level.","In addition, the system uses an optional maintenance power control method during the inactive mode of a SU. When SU  is inactive or powered-down to conserve power, the unit occasionally activates to adjust its initial transmit power level setting in response to a maintenance power control signal from IRCS . The maintenance power signal is determined by the RCS  by measuring the received power level of SU  and present system power level and, from this, calculates the necessary initial transmit power. The method shortens the channel acquisition time of SU  to begin a communication The method also prevents the transmit power level of SU  from becoming too high and interfering with other channels during the initial transmission before the closed loop power control reduces the transmit power.","RCS  obtains synchronization of its clock from an interface line such as, but not limited to, E1, T1, or HDSL interfaces RCS  can also generate its own internal clock signal from an oscillator which may be regulated by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. RCS  generates a Global Pilot Code, a channel with a spreading code but no data modulation, which can be acquired by remote SUs  through . All transmission channels of the RCS are synchronized to the Pilot channel, and spreading code phases of code generators (not shown) used for Logical communication channels within RCS  are also synchronized to the Pilot channel's spreading code phase. Similarly, SUs  through  which receive the Global Pilot Code of RCS  synchronize the spreading and de-spreading code phases of the code generators (not shown) of the SUs to the Global Pilot Code.","RCS , SU , and RDU  may incorporate system redundancy of system elements and automatic switching between internal functional system elements upon a failure event to prevent toss or drop-out of a radio link, power supply, traffic channel, or group of traffic channels.","Logical Communication Channels","A \u2018channel\u2019 of the prior art is usually regarded as a communications path which is part of an interface and which can be distinguished from other paths of that interface without regard to its content. However, in the case of CDMA, separate communications paths are distinguished only by their content The term \u2018logical channel\u2019 is used to distinguish the separate data streams, which are logically equivalent to channels in the conventional sense. All logical channels and sub-channels of the present invention are mapped to a common 64 kilo-symbols per second (ksym\/s) QPSK stream. Some channels are synchronized to associated pilot codes which are generated from, and perform a similar function to the system Global Pilot Code (GPC). The system pilot signals are not, however, considered logical channels.","Several logical communication channels are used over the RF communication link between the RCS and SU. Each logical communication channel either has a fixed, pre-determined spreading code or a dynamically assigned spreading code. For both predetermined and assigned codes, the code phase is synchronized with the Pilot Code. Logical communication channels are divided into two groups: the Global Channel (GC) group includes channels which are either transmitted from the base station RCS to all remote SUs or from any SU to the RCS of the base station regardless of the SU's identity. The channels in the GC group may contain information of a given type for all users including those channels used by SUs to gain system access. Channels in the Assigned Channels (AC) group are those channels dedicated to communication between the RCS and a particular SU.","The Global Channels (GC) group provides for 1) Broadcast Control logical channels, which provide point to multipoint services for broadcasting messages to all SUs and paging messages to SUs; and 2) Access Control logical channels which provide point-to-point services on global channels for SUs to access the system and obtain assigned channels.","The RCS of the present invention has multiple Access Control logical channels, and one Broadcast Control group. An SU of the present invention has at least one Access Control channel and at least one Broadcast Control logical channel.","The Global logical channels controlled by the RCS are the Fast Broadcast Channel (FBCH) which broadcasts fast changing information concerning which services and which access channels are currently available, and the Slow Broadcast Channel (SBCH) which broadcasts slow changing system information and paging messages.

The spreading code is a sequence of symbols, called chips or chip values. The general methods of generating pseudorandom sequences using Galois Field mathematics is known to those skilled in the art; however, a unique set, or family, of code sequences has been derived for the present invention. First, the length of the linear feedback shift register to generate a code sequence is chosen, and the initial value of the register is called a \u201cseed\u201d. Second, the constraint is imposed that no code sequence generated by a code seed may be a cyclic shift of another code sequence generated by the same code seed. Finally, no code sequence generated from one seed may be a cyclic shift of a code sequence generated by another seed.","It has been determined that the spreading code length of chip values of the present invention is:\n\n128\u00d7233415=29877120\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThe spreading codes are generated by combining a linear sequence of period 233415 and a nonlinear sequence of period 128\n","The FBCH channel of the exemplary embodiment is an exception because it is not coded with the 128 length sequence, so the FBCH channel spreading code has period 233415.","The nonlinear sequence of length 128 is implemented as a fixed sequence loaded into a shift register with a feed-back connection. The fixed sequence can be generated by an m-sequence of length 127 padded with an extra logic 0, 1, or random value as is well known in the art.","The linear sequence of length L=233415 is generated using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) circuit with 36 stages. The feedback connections correspond to a irreducible polynomial h(n) of degree 36. The polynomial h(x) chosen for the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is\n\n()=+1\n\nor, in binary notation\n\n()=(1100001010110010110111101101100011101)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","A group of \u201cseed\u201d values for a LFSR representing the polynomial h(x) of equation (2) which generates code sequences that are nearly orthogonal with each other is determined. The first requirement of the seed values is that the seed values do not generate two code sequences which are simply cyclic shifts of each other.","The seeds are represented as elements of GF(2) which is the field of residue classes modulo h(x). This field has a primitive element \u03b4=x+x+1. The binary representation of \u03b4 is\n\n\u03b4=000000000000000000000000000000000111\u2003\u2003(3)\n","Every element of GF(2) can also be written as a power of \u03b4 reduced modulo h(x). Consequently, the seeds are represented as powers of \u03b4, the primitive element.","The solution for the order of an element does not require a search of all values; the order of an element divides the order of the field (GF(2)). When \u03b4 is any element of GF(2) with\n\n\u22611\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nfor some e, then e|2\u22121. Therefore, the order of any element in GF(2) divides 2\u22121.\n","Using these constraints, it has been determined that a numerical search generates a group of seed values, n, which are powers of \u03b4, the primitive element of h(x).","The present invention includes a method to increase the number of available seeds for use in a CDMA communication system by recognizing that certain cyclic shifts of the previously determined code sequences may be used simultaneously. The round trip delay for the cell sizes and bandwidths of the present invention are less than 3000 chips. In one embodiment of the present invention, sufficiently separated cyclic shifts of a sequence can be used within the same cell without causing ambiguity for a receiver attempting to determine the code sequence. This method enlarges the set of sequences available for use.","By implementing the tests previously described, a total of 3879 primary seeds were determined through numerical computation. These seeds are given mathematically as\n\n\u03b4modulo()\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nwhere 3879 values of n are listed in the Appendix A, with \u03b4=(00, . . . 00111) as before in (3).\n","When all primary seeds are known, all secondary seeds of the present invention are derived from the primary seeds by shifting them multiples of 4095 chips modulo h(x). Once a family of seed values is determined, these values are stored in memory and assigned to logical channels as necessary. Once assigned, the initial seed value is simply loaded into LFSR to produce the required spreading code sequence associated with the seed value.","Rapid Acquisition Feature of Long and Short codes.","Rapid acquisition of the correct code phase by a spread-spectrum receiver is improved by designing spreading codes which are faster to detect. The present embodiment of the invention includes a new method of generating code sequences that have rapid acquisition properties by using one or more of the following methods. First, a long code may be constructed from two or more short codes. The new implementation uses many code sequences, one or more of which are rapid acquisition sequences of length L that have average acquisition phase searches r=log 2L. Sequences with such properties are well known to those practiced in the art. The average number of acquisition test phases of the resulting long sequence is a multiple of r=log 2L rather than half of the number of phases of the long sequence.","Second, a method of transmitting complex valued spreading code sequences (In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) sequences) in a pilot spreading code signal may be used rather than transmitting real valued sequences. Two or more separate code sequences may be transmitted over the complex channels. If the sequences have different phases, an acquisition may be done by acquisition circuits in parallel over the different code sequences when the relative phase shift between the two or more code channels is known. For example, for two sequences, one can be sent on an In phase (I) channel and one on the Quadrature (Q) channel. To search the code sequences, the acquisition detection means searches the two channels, but begins the (Q) channel with an offset equal to one-half of the spreading code sequence length. With code sequence length of N, the acquisition means starts the search at N\/2 on the (Q) channel. The average number of tests to find acquisition is N\/2 for a single code search, but searching the (I) and phase delayed (Q) channel in parallel reduces the average number of tests to N\/4. The codes sent on each channel could be the same code, the same code with one channel's code phase delayed, or different code sequences.","Epoch and Sub-epoch Structures","The long complex spreading codes used for the exemplary system of the present invention have a number of chips after which the code repeats. The repetition period of the spreading sequence is called an epoch. To map the logical channels to CDMA spreading codes, the present invention uses an Epoch and Sub-epoch structure. The code period for the CDMA spreading code to modulate logical channels is 29877120 chips\/code period which is the same number of chips for all bandwidths. The code period is the epoch of the present invention, and Table 3 below defines the epoch duration for the supported chip rates. In addition, two sub-epochs are defined over the spreading code epoch and are 233415 chips and 128 chips long.","The 233415 chip subpoch is referred to as a long subpoch, and is used for synchronizing events on the RF communication interface such as encryption key switching and changing from global to assigned codes. The 128 chip short epoch is defined for use as an additional timing reference. The highest symbol rate used with a single CDMA code is 64 ksym\/s.

The FF chain of with additional delay elements is shown in ","The code-generators in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention are configured to generate either global codes, or assigned codes. Global codes are CDMA codes that can be received or transmitted by all users of the system. Assigned codes are CDMA codes that are allocated for a particular connection. When a set of sequences are generated from the same generator as described, only the seed of the 36 stage LFSR is specified to generate a family of sequences. Sequences for all the global codes, are generated using the same LFSR circuit. Therefore, once an SU has synchronized to the Global pilot signal from an RCS and knows the seed for the LFSR circuit for the Global Channel codes, it can generate not only the pilot sequence but also all other global codes used by the RCS.","The signal that is upconverted to RF is generated as follows. The output signals of the above shift register circuits are converted to an antipodal sequence (0 maps into +1, 1 maps into \u22121). The Logical channels are initially converted to QPSK signals, which are mapped as constellation points as is well known in the art. The In-phase and Quadrature channels of each QPSK signal form the real and imaginary parts of the complex data value. Similarly, two spreading codes are used to form complex spreading chip values. The complex data are spread by being multiplied by the complex spreading code. Similarly, the received complex data is correlated with the conjugate of the complex spreading code to recover despread data.","Short Codes","Short codes are used for the initial ramp-up process when an SU accesses an RCS. The period of the short codes is equal to the symbol duration and the start of each period is aligned with a symbol boundary. Both SU and RCS derive the real and imaginary parts of the short codes from the last eight feed-forward sections of the sequence generator producing the global codes for that cell.","The short codes that are in use in the exemplary embodiment of the invention are updated every 3 ms. Other update times that are consistent with the symbol rate may be used. Therefore, a changeover occurs every 3 ms starting from the epoch boundary. At a change-over, the next symbol length portion of the corresponding feed-forward output becomes the short code. When the SU needs to use a particular short code, it waits until the first 3 ms boundary of the next epoch and stores the next symbol length portion output from the corresponding FF section. This shall be used as the short code until the next change-over, which occurs 3 ms later.","The signals represented by these short codes are known as Short Access Channel pilots (SAXPTs).","Mapping of Logical Channels to Spreading Codes","The exact relationship between the spreading code sequences and the CDMA logical channels and pilot signals is documented in Table and Table Those signal names ending in \u2018-CH\u2019 correspond to logical channels.

Alternatively, it corresponds to a received pilot signal power level plus noise power level if the phases of the input pilot code and locally generated pilot code are the same.

If the SU has a relatively fixed position-with respect to the RCS of the base station, the uncertainty of received spreading code phase is reduced for subsequent attempts at re-acquisition by the SU or RCS. The time required for the base station to acquire the access signal of a SU that has gone \u201coff-hook\u201d contributes to the delay between the SU going off-hook and the receipt of a dial tone from the PSTN. For systems that require a short delay, such as 150 msec for dial tone after off-hook is detected, a method which reduces the acquisition and bearer channel establishment time is desirable. One embodiment of the present invention uses such a method of reducing re-acquisition by use of virtual locating. Additional details of this technique are described in U.S. Patent Application entitled \u201cVIRTUAL LOCATING OF A FIXED SUBSCRIBER UNIT TO REDUCE RE-ACQUISITION TIME\u201d filed on even date herewith and incorporated herein by reference.","The RCS acquires the SU CDMA signal by searching only those received code phases corresponding to the largest propagation delay of the particular system. In other words, the RCS assumes that all SUs are at a predetermined, fixed distance from the RCS. The first time the SU establishes a channel with the RCS, the normal search pattern is performed by the RCS to acquire the access channel. The normal method starts by searching the code phases corresponding to the longest possible delay, and gradually adjusts the search to the code phases with the shortest possible delay. However, after the initial acquisition, the SU can calculate the delay between the RCS and the SU by measuring the time difference between sending a short access message to the RCS and receiving an acknowledgment message, and using the received Global Pilot channel as a timing reference. The SU can also receive the delay value by having the RCS calculate the round trip delay difference from the code phase difference between the Global Pilot code generated at the RCS and the received assigned pilot sequence from the SU, and then sending the SU the value on a predetermined control channel. Once the round trip delay is known to the SU, the SU may adjust the code phase of the locally generated assigned pilot and spreading code sequences by adding the delay required to make the SU appear to the RCS to be at the predetermined fixed distance from the RCS. Although the method is explained for the largest delay, a delay corresponding to any predetermined location in the system can be used.","A second advantage of the method of reducing re-acquisition by virtual locating is that a conservation in SU power use can be achieved. Note that a SU that is \u201cpowered down\u201d or in a sleep mode needs to start the bearer channel acquisition process with a low transmit power level and ramp-up power until the RCS can receive its signal in order to minimize interference with other users. Since the subsequent re-acquisition time is shorter, and because the SU's location is relatively fixed in relation to the RCS, the SU can ramp-up transmit power more quickly because the SU will wait a shorter period of time before increasing transmit power. The SU waits a shorter period because it knows, within a small error range, when it should receive a response from the RCS if the RCS has acquired the SU signal.","The Spread Spectrum Communication System","The Radio Carrier Station (RCS)","The Radio Carrier Station (RCS) of the present invention acts as a central interface between the SU and the remote processing control network element, such as a Radio Distribution Unit (RDU). The interface to the RDU of the present embodiment follows the G.704 standard and an interface according to a modified version of DECT V5.1, but the present invention can support any interface that can exchange call control and traffic channels. The RCS receives information channels from the RDU including call control data, and traffic channel data such as, but not limited to, 32 kb\/s ADPCM, 64 kb\/s PCM, and ISDN, as well as system configuration and maintenance data. The RCS also terminates the CDMA radio interface bearer channels with SUs, which channels include both control data, and traffic channel data. In response to the call control data from either the RDU or a SU, the RCS allocates traffic channels to bearer channels on the RF communication link and establishes a communication connection between the SU and the telephone network through an RDU.","As shown in , the RCS receives call control and message information data into the MUXs ,  and  through interface lines ,  and . Although E1 format is shown, other similar telecommunication formats can be supported in the same manner as described below. The MUXs shown in  may be implemented using circuits similar to that shown in FIG. . The MUX shown in  includes system clock signal generator  consisting of phase locked oscillators (not shown) which generate clock signals for the Line PCM highway  (which is part of PCM Highway ), and high speed bus (HSB) ; and the MUX Controller  which synchronizes the system clock  to interface line . It is contemplated that the phase lock oscillators can provide timing signals for the RCS in the absence of synchronization to a line. The MUX Line Interface  separates the call control data from the message information data. Referring to , each MUX provides a connection to the Wireless Access Controller (WAC)  through the PCM highway . The MUX controller  also monitors the presence of different tones present in the information signal by means of tone detector .","Additionally, the MUX Controller  provides the ISDN D channel network signaling locally to the RDU. The MUX line interface , such as a FALC , includes an E1 interface  which consists of a transmit connection pair (not shown) and a receive connection pair (not shown) of the MUX connected to the RDU or Central Office (CO) ISDN Switch at the data rate of 2.048 Mbps. The transmit and receive connection pairs are connected to the E1 interface  which translates differential tri-level transmit\/receive encoded pairs into levels for use by the Framer . The line interface  uses internal phase-locked-loops (not shown) to produce E1-derived 2.048 MHz, and 4.096 MHz clocks as well as an 8 KHz frame-sync pulse. The line interface can operate in clock-master or clock-slave mode. While the exemplary embodiment is shown as using an E1 Interface, it is contemplated that other types of telephone lines which convey multiple calls may be used, for example, T1 lines or lines which interface to a Private Branch Exchange (PBX).","The line interface framer  frames the data streams by recognizing the framing patterns on channel-1 (time-slot 0) of the incoming line, and inserts and extracts service bits, generates\/checks line service quality information.","As long as a valid E1 signal appears at the E1 Interface , the FALC , recovers a 2.048 MHz PCM clock signal from the E1 Line. This clock, via System Clock , is used system wide as a PCM Highway Clock signal. If the E1 Line fails, the FALC  continues to deliver a PCM Clock derived from an oscillator signal o(t) connected to the sync input (not shown) of the FALC . This PCM Clock serves the RCS system until another MUX with an operational E1 line assumes responsibility for generating the system clock signals.","The framer  generates a Received Frame Sync Pulse, which in turn can be used to trigger the PCM Interface  to transfer data onto the line PCM Highway  and into the RCS System for use by other elements. Since all E1 lines are frame synchronized, all Line PCM Highways are also frame synchronized. From this 8 kHz PCM Sync pulse, the system clock signal generator  of the MUX uses a Phase Locked Loop (not shown) to synthesize the PN\u00d72 clock [e.g., 15.96 MHz)(W(t)]. The frequency of this clock signal is different for different transmission bandwidths, as described in Table 7.","The MUX includes a MUX Controller , such as a 25 MHz Quad Integrated Communications Controller, containing a microprocessor , program memory , and Time Division Multiplexer (TDM) . The TDM  is coupled to receive the signal provided by the Framer , and extracts information placed in time slots  and . The extracted information governs how the MUX controller  processes the Link Access Protocol\u2014D (LAPD) data link. The call control and bearer modification messages, such as those defined as V5.1 Network layer messages, are either passed to the WAC, or used locally by the MUX controller .","The RCS Line PCM Highway  is connected to and originates with the Framer  through PCM Interface , and comprises of a 2.048 MHz stream of data in both the transmit and receive direction. The RCS also contains a High Speed Bus (HSB)  which is the communication link between the MUX, WAC, to and MIUs. The HSB  supports a data rate of, for example, 100 Mbit\/sec. Each of the MUX, WAC, and MIU access the HSB using arbitration. The RCS of the present invention also can include several MUXs requiring one board to be a \u201cmaster\u201d and the rest \u201cslaves\u201d. Details on the implementation of the HSB may be found in a U.S. patent application entitled PARALLEL PACKETIZED INTERMODULE ARBITRATED HIGH SPEED CONTROL AND DATA BUS, filed on even date herewith, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Referring to , the Wireless Access Controller (WAC)  is the RCS system controller which manages call control functions and interconnection of data streams between the MUXs , , , Modem Interface Units (MIUs) , , . The WAC  also controls and monitors other RCS elements such as the VDC , RF , and Power Amplifiers . The WAC  as shown in , allocates bearer channels to the modems on each MIU , ,  and allocates the message data on line PCM Highway  from the MUXs , ,  to the modems on the MIUs , , . This allocation is made through the System PCM Highway  by means of a time slot interchange on the WAC .

The WAC  also generates messages and paging information responsive to call control signals from the MUXs , ,  received from a remote processor, such as an RDU; generates Broadcast Data which is transmitted to the MIU master modem ; and controls the generation by the MIU MM  of the Global system Pilot spreading code sequence. The WAC  also is connected to an external Network Manager (NM)  for craftperson or user access.","Referring to , the WAC includes a time-slot interchanger (TSI)  which transfers information from one time slot in a Line PCM Highway or System PCM Highway to another time slot in either the same or different Line PCM Highway or System PCM Highway. The TSI  is connected to the WAC controller  of  which controls the assignment or transfer of information from one time slot to another time slot and stores this information in memory . The exemplary embodiment of the invention has four PCM Highways , , ,  connected to the TSI. The WAC also is connected to the HSB , through which WAC communicates to a second WAC (not shown), to the MUXs and to the MIUs.","Referring to , the WAC  includes a WAC controller  employing, for example, a microprocessor , such as a Motorola MC 68040 and a communications processor , such as the Motorola MC68360 QUICC communications processor, and a clock oscillator  which receives a clock synch signal wo(t) from the system clock generator. The clock generator is located on a MUX (not shown) to provide timing to the WAC controller . The WAC controller  also includes memory  including Flash Prom  and SRAM memory . The Flash Prom  contains the program code for the WAC controller , and is reprogrammable for new software programs downloaded to from an external source.

The control signals are sent from the WAC  to enable or disable the RF Transmitters\/Receiver  or Power amplifier , and the status signals are sent from the RF Transmitters\/Receiver  or Power amplifier  to monitor the presence of a fault condition.","Referring to , the exemplary RCS contains at least one MIU , which is shown in FIG.  and now described in detail. The MIU of the exemplary embodiment includes six CDMA modems, but the invention is not limited to this number of modems. The MIU includes a System PCM Highway  connected to each of the CDMA Modems , , ,  through a PCM Interface , a Control Channel Bus  connected to MIU controller  and each of the CDMA Modems , , , , an MIU clock signal generator (CLK) , and a modem output combiner . The MIU provides the RCS with the following functions: the MIU controller receives CDMA Channel Assignment Instructions from the WAC and assigns a modem to a user information signal which is applied to the line interface of the MUX and a modem to receive the CDMA channel from the SU; it also combines the CDMA Transmit Modem Data for each of the MIU CDMA modems; multiplexes I and Q transmit message data from the CDMA modems for transmission to the VDC; receives Analog I and Q receive message data from the VDC; distributes the I and Q data to the CDMA modems; transmits and receives digital AGC Data; distributes the AGC data to the CDMA modems; and sends MIU Board Status and Maintenance Information to the WAC .","The MIU controller  of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention contains one communication microprocessor , such as the MC68360 \u201cQTICC\u201d Processor, and includes a memory  having a Flash Prom memory  and a SRAM memory .

The System Modem  includes a Broadcast spreader (not shown) and a Pilot Generator (not shown). The Broadcast Modem provides the broadcast information used by the exemplary system, and the broadcast message data is transferred from the MIU controller  to the System Modem . The System Modem also includes four additional modems (not shown) which are used to transmit the signals CT through CT and AX through AX.

There are four MUXs in an RCS, three of which (,  and ) are shown in FIG. . Two MUXs are located on each chassis. One of the two MUXs on each chassis is designated as the master, and one of the masters is designated as the system master. The MUX which is the system master derives a 2.048 Mhz PCM clock signal from the E1 interface using a phase locked loop (not shown). In turn, the system master MUX divides the 2.048 Mhz PCM clock signal in frequency by 16 to derive a 128 KHz reference clock signal. The 128 KHz reference clock signal is distributed from the MUX that is the system master to all the other MUXs. In turn, each MUX multiplies the 128 kHz reference clock signal in frequency to synthesize the system clock signal which has a frequency that is twice the frequency of the PN-clock signal. The MUX also divides the 128 KHz clock signal in frequency by 16 to generate the 8 KHz frame synch signal which is distributed to the MIUs. The system clock signal for the exemplary embodiment has a frequency of 11.648 Mhz for a 7 MHz bandwidth CDMA channel Each MUX also divides the system clock signal in frequency by 2 to obtain the PN-clock signal and further divides the PN-clock signal in frequency by 29 877 120 (the PN sequence length) to generate the PN-synch signal which indicates the epoch boundaries. The PN-synch signal from the system master MUX is also distributed to all MUXs to maintain phase alignment of the internally generated clock signals for each MUX. The PN-synch signal and the frame synch signal are aligned. The two MUXs that are designated as the master MUXs for each chasis then distribute both the system clock signal and the PN-clock signal to the MIUs and the VDC.","The PCM Highway Interface  connects the System PCM Highway  to each CDMA Modem , , , .

Each stage of the shift register is tapped and complex multiplied in the multipliers , , , ,  by individual (6-bit I and 6-bit Q) weight values to provide 11 tap-weighted products which are summed in adder , and limited to 7-bit I and 7-bit Q values.","The CDMA modem receive section  (shown in ) provides dependent channel despreaders , , , , , ,  (shown in ) for despreading the message channels. The described embodiment despreads 7 message channels, each despreader accepting a 1-bit I b 1-bit Q despreading code signal to perform a complex correlation of this code against a 8-bit I by 8-bit Q data input. The 7 despreaders correspond to the 7 channels: Traffic Channel  (TR\u2032), TR\u2032, TR\u2032, TR\u2032, AUX (a spare channel), Automatic Power Control (APC) and pilot (PLT).","The Pilot AVC  shown in  receives the I and Q Pilot Spreading code sequence values PCI and PCQ into shift register  responsive to the timing signal RXPNCLK, and includes 11 individual despreaders  through  each correlating the I and Q digital receive message signal data with a one chip delayed version of the same pilot code sequence. Signals OE, OE, . . . OE are used by the modem control  to enable the despreading operation. The output signals of the despreaders are combined in combiner  forming correlation signal DSPRDAT of the Pilot AVC , which is received by the ACQ & Track logic  (shown in FIG. ), and ultimately by modem controller  (shown in FIG. ). The ACQ & Track logic  uses the correlation signal value to determine if the local receiver is synchronized with its remote transmitter.","The Auxiliary AVC  also receives the I and Q digital receive message signal data and, in the described embodiment, includes four separate despreaders , , ,  as shown in FIG. . Each despreader receives and correlates the I and Q digital receive message data with delayed versions of the same despreading code sequence PARI and PARQ which are provided by code generator  input to and contained in shift register . The output signals of the despreaders , , ,  are combined in combiner  which provides noise correlation signal ARDSPRDAT. The auxiliary AVC spreading code sequence does not correspond to any transmit spreading code sequence of the system. Signals OE, OE, . . . OE are used by the modem control  to enable the despreading operation. The Auxiliary AVC  provides a noise correlation signal ARDSPRDAT from which quantile estimates are calculated by the Quantile estimator , and provides a noise level measurement to the ACQ & Track logic  (shown in ) and modem controller  (shown in FIG. ).","Each despread channel output signal corresponding to the received message channels TR\u2032, TR\u2032, TR\u2032, and TR\u2032 is input to a corresponding Viterbi decoder , , ,  shown in  which performs forward error correction on convolutionally encoded data. The Viterbi decoders of the exemplary embodiment have a constraint length of K=7 and a rate of R=\u00bd. The decoded despread message channel signals are transferred from the CDMA modem to the PCM Highway  through the MOI . The operation of the MOI is essentially the same as the operation of the MISR of the transmit section  (shown in ) except in reverse.","The CDMA modem receiver section  implements several different algorithms during different phases of the acquisition, tracking and despreading of the receive CDMA message signal.","When the received signal is momentarily lost (or severely degraded) the idle code insertion algorithm inserts idle codes in place of the lost or degraded receive message data to prevent the user from hearing loud noise bursts on a voice call. The idle codes are sent to the MOI  (shown in ) in place of the decoded message channel output signal from the Viterbi decoders , , , . The idle code used for each traffic channel is programmed by the Modem Controller  by writing the appropriate pattern IDLE to the MOI, which in the present embodiment is a 8 bit word for a 64 kb\/s stream, 4 bit word for a 32 kb\/s stream.","Modem Algorithms for Acquisition and Tracking of Received Pilot Signal","The acquisition and tracking algorithms are used by the receiver to determine the approximate code phase of a received signal, synchronize the local modem receiver despreaders to the incoming pilot signal, and track the phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence with the received pilot code sequence. Referring to , the algorithms are performed by the Modem controller , which provides clock adjust signals to code generator . These adjust signals cause the code generator for the despreaders to adjust locally generated code sequences in response to measured output values of the Pilot Rake  and Quantile values from quantile estimators B. Quantile values are noise statistics measured from the In-phase and Quadrature channels from the output values of the AUX Vector Correlator  (shown in FIG. ). Synchronization of the receiver to the received signal is separated into two phases; an initial acquisition phase and a tracking phase. The initial acquisition phase is accomplished by clocking the locally generated pilot spreading code sequence at a higher or lower rate than the received signal's spreading code rate, sliding the locally generated pilot spreading code sequence and performing sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) on the output of the Pilot Vector correlator . The tracking phase maintains the locally generated spreading code pilot sequence in synchronization with the incoming pilot signal. Details of the quantile estimators B may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/218,198 entitled \u201cADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein for its teachings on adaptive power control systems.","The SU cold acquisition algorithm is used by the SU CDMA modem when it is first powered up, and therefore has no knowledge of the correct pilot spreading code phase, or when an SU attempts to reacquire synchronization with the incoming pilot signal but has taken an excessive amount of time. The cold acquisition algorithm is divided into two sub-phases. The first subphase consists of a search over the length 233415 code used by the FBCH. Once this sub-code phase is acquired, the pilot's 233415\u00d7128 length code is known to within an ambiguity of 128 possible phases. The second subphase is a search of these remaining 128 possible phases. In order not to lose synch with the FBCH, in the second phase of the search, it is desirable to switch back and forth between tracking of the FBCH code and attempting acquisition of the pilot code.","The RCS acquisition of short access pilot (SAXPT) algorithm is used by an RCS CDMA modem to acquire the SAXPT pilot signal of an SU. Additional details of this technique are described in U.S. Patent Application entitled \u201cA METHOD OF CONTROLLING INITIAL POWER RAMP-UP IN CDMA SYSTEMS BY USING SHORT CODES\u201d filed on even date herewith and herein incorporated by reference. The algorithm is a fast search algorithm because the SAXPT is a short code sequence of length N, where N=chips\/symbol, and ranges from 45 to 195, depending on the system's bandwidth. The search cycles through all possible phases until acquisition is complete.","The RCS acquisition of the long access pilot (LAXPT) algorithm begins immediately after acquisition of SAXPT. The SU's code phase is known within a multiple of a symbol duration, so in the exemplary embodiment of the invention there may be 7 to 66 phases to search within the round trip delay from the RCS. This bound is a result of the SU pilot signal being synchronized to the RCS Global pilot signal.","The re-acquisition algorithm begins when loss of code-lock (LOL) occurs. A Z-search algorithm is used to speed the process on the assumption that the code phase has not drifted far from where it was the last time the system was locked. The RCS uses a maximum width of the Z-search windows bounded by the maximum round trip propagation delay.","The Pre-Track period immediately follows the acquisition or re-acquisition algorithms and immediately precedes the tracking algorithm. Pre-track is a fixed duration period during which the receive data provided by the modem is not considered valid. The Pre-Track period allows other modem algorithms, such as those used by the ISW PLL , ACQ & Tracking, AMF Weight GEN , to prepare and adapt to the current channel. The Pre-Track period is two parts. The first part is the delay while the code tracking loop pulls in. The second part is the delay while the AMF tap weight calculations are performed by the AMF Weight Gen  to produce settled weighting coefficients. Also in the second part of the Pre-Track period, the carrier tracking loop is allowed to pull in by the SW PLL , and the scalar quantile estimates are performed in the Quantile estimator A.","The Tracking Process is entered after the Pre-Track period ends. This process is actually a repetitive cycle and is the only process phase during which receive data provided by the modem may be considered valid. The following operations are performed during this phase: AMF Tap Weight Update, Carrier Tracking, Code Tracking, Vector Quantile Update, Scalar Quantile Update, Code Lock Check, Derotation and Symbol Summing, and Power Control (forward and reverse)","If LOL is detected, the modem receiver terminates the Track algorithm and automatically enters the reaquisition algorithm. In the SU, a LOL causes the transmitter to be shut down. In the RCS, LOL causes forward power control to be disabled with the transmit power held constant at the level immediately prior to loss of lock. It also causes the return power control information being transmitted to assume a 010101 . . . pattern, causing the SU to hold its transmit power constant. This can be performed using the signal lock check function which generates the reset signal to the acquisition and tracking circuit .","Two sets of quantile statistics are maintained, one by Quantile estimator B and the other by the scalar Quantile Estimator A. Both are used by the modem controller . The first set is the \u201cvector\u201d quantile information, so named because it is calculated from the vector of four complex values generated by the AUX AVC receiver . The second set is the scalar quantile information, which is calculated from the single complex value AUX signal that is output from the AUX Despreader . The two sets of information represent different sets of noise statistics used to maintain a pre-determined Probability of False Alarm (P) The vector quantile data is used by the acquisition and reaquisition algorithms implemented by the modem controller  to determine the presence of a received signal in noise, and the scalar quantile information is used by the code lock check algorithm.","For both the vector and scalar cases, quantile information consists of calculated values of lambda through lambda, which are boundary values used to estimate the probability distribution function (p.d.f) of the despread receive signal and determine whether the modem is locked to the PN code. The Aux_Power value used in the following C-subroutine is the magnitude squared of the AUX signal output of the scalar correlator array for the scalar quantiles, and the sum of the magnitudes squared for the vector case. In both cases the quantiles are then calculated using the following C-subroutine:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0253"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"for (n = 0; n < 3; n++) {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"lambda [n] += (lambda [n] <  Aux_Power) ?

The search algorithms use the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to determine whether the received and locally generated code sequences are in phase. The speed of acquisition is increased by parallelism resulting from having a multi-fingered receiver. For example, in the described embodiment of the invention the main Pilot Rake  has a total of 11 fingers representing a total phase period of 11 chip periods. For acquisition 8 separate sequential probability ratio tests (SPRTs) are implemented, with each SPRT observing a 4 chip window. Each window is offset from the previous window by one chip, and in a search sequence any given code phase is covered by 4 windows. If all 8 of the SPRT tests are rejected, then the set of windows is moved by 8 chips. If any of the SPRT's is accepted, then the code phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence is adjusted to attempt to center the accepted SPRT's phase within the Pilot AVC. It is likely that more than one SPRT reaches the acceptance threshold at the same time. A table lookup is used cover all 256 possible combinations of accept\/reject and the modem controller uses the information to estimate the correct center code phase within the Pilot Rake . Each SPRT is implemented as follows (all operations occur at 64 k symbol rate): Denote the fingers' output level values as I_Finger[n] and Q Finger[n], where n=0 . . . 10 (inclusive, 0 is earliest (most advanced) finger), then the power of each window is: \n\n\nTo implement the SPRT's the modem controller then performs for each of the windows the following calculations which are expressed as a pseudo-code subroutine:\n\n","The modem controller determines which bin delimited by the values of lambda[k] the Power level falls into which allows the modem controller to develop an approximate statistic.","For the present algorithm, the control voltage is formed as \u03b5=yBy, where y is a vector formed from the complex valued output values of the Pilot Vector correlator , and B is a matrix consisting of the constant values pre-determined to maximize the operating characteristics while minimizing the noise as described previously with reference to the Quadratic Detector.","To understand the operation of the Quadratic Detector, it is useful to consider the following. A spread spectrum (CDMA) signal, s(t) is passed through a multipath channel with an impulse response h(t). The baseband spread signal is described by equation (30). \n\n\nwhere Cis a complex spreading code symbol, p(t) is a predefined chip pulse and Tis the chip time spacing, where T=1\/Rand Ris the chip rate.\n","The received baseband signal is represented by equation (31) \n\n\nwhere q(t)=p(t)*h(t), \u03c4 is an unknown delay and n(t) is additive noise. The received signal is processed by a filter, h(t), so the waveform, x(t), to be processed is given by equation (32). \n\n\nwhere f(t)=q(t)*h(t) and z(t)=n(t)*h(t).\n","In the exemplary receiver, samples of the received signal are taken at the chip rate, that is to say, 1\/T. These samples, x(mT+\u03c4\u2032), are processed by an array of correlators that compute, during the rcorrelation period, the quantities given by equation (33) \n\n","These quantities are composed of a noise component wand a deterministic component Ygiven by equation (34).\n\n(+\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4)\u2003\u2003(34)\n\nIn the sequel, the time index r may be suppressed for ease of writing, although it is to be noted that the function f(t) changes slowly with time.\n","The samples are processed to adjust the sampling phase, \u03c4\u2032, in an optimum fashion for further processing by the receiver, such as matched filtering. This adjustment is described below. To simplify the representation of the process, it is helpful to describe it in terms of the function f(t+\u03c4), where the time-shift, \u03c4, is to be adjusted. It is noted that the function f(t+\u03c4) is measured in the presence of noise. Thus, it may be problematical to adjust the phase \u03c4\u2032 based on measurements of the signal f(t+\u03c4). To account for the noise, the function v(t): v(t)=f(t)+m(t) is introduced, where the term m(t) represents a noise process. The system processor may be derived based on considerations of the function v(t).","The process is noncoherent and therefore is based on the envelope power function |v(t+\u03c4)|. The functional e(\u03c4\u2032) given in equation (35) is helpful for describing the process. \n\n\nThe shift parameter is adjusted for e(\u03c4\u2032)=0, which occurs when the energy on the interval (\u2212\u221e,\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4] equals that on the interval [\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4, \u221e). The error characteristic is monotonic and therefore has a single zero crossing point. This is the desirable quality of the functional. A disadvantage of the functional is that it is ill-defined because the integrals are unbounded when noise is present. Nevertheless, the functional e(\u03c4\u2032) may be cast in the form given by equation (36). \n\n\nwhere the characteristic function w(t) is equal to sgn(t), the signum function.\n","To optimize the characteristic function w(t), it is helpful to define a figure of merit, F, as set forth in equation (37). \n\n\nThe numerator of F is the numerical slope of the mean error characteristic on the interval [\u2212T,T] surrounding the tracked value, \u03c4\u2032. The statistical mean is taken with respect to the noise as well as the random channel, h(t). It is desirable to specify a statistical characteristic of the channel in order to perform this statistical average. For example, the channel may be modeled as a Wide Sense Stationary Uncorretated Scattering (WSSUS) channel with impulse response h(t) and a white noise process U(t) that has an intensity function g(t) as shown in equation (38).\n\n()=()\u2003\u2003(38)\n","The variance of e(\u03c4) is computed as the mean square value of the fluctuation\n\n\u2032(\u03c4)=(\u03c4)\u2212<(\u03c4)>\u2003\u2003(39)\n\nwhere <e(\u03c4)> is the average of e(\u03c4) with respect to the noise.\n","Optimization of the figure of merit F with respect to the function w(t) may be carried out using well-known Variational methods of optimization.","Once the optimal w(t) is determined, the resulting processor may be approximated accurately by a quadratic sample processor which is derived as follows.","By the sampling theorem, the signal v(t), bandlimited to a bandwidth W may be expressed in terms of its samples as shown in equation (40).\n\n()=\u03a3()sin [()\u03c0]\u2003\u2003(40)\n\nsubstituting this expansion into equation (z+6) results in an infinite quadratic form in the samples v(k\/W+\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4). Making the assumption that the signal bandwidth equals the chip rate allows the use of a sampling scheme that is clocked by the chip clock signal to be used to obtain the samples. These samples, vare represented by equation (41).\n\n\u03bd=\u03bd(+\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4)\u2003\u2003(41)\n\nThis assumption leads to a simplification of the implementation. It is valid if the aliasing error is small.\n","In practice, the quadratic form that is derived is truncated. An example normalized B matrix is given below in Table 12. For this example, an exponential delay spread profile g(t)=exp(\u2212t\/\u03c4) is assumed with \u03c4 equal to one chip. An aperture parameter Tequal to one and one-half chips has also been assumed.

Referring to  the RF Txansmitter\/Receiver  is divided into three sections: the transmitter module , the receiver module , and the Frequency Synthesizer . Frequency Synthesizer  produces a transmit carrier frequency TFREQ and a receive carrier frequency RFREQ in response to a Frequency control signal FREQCTRL received from the WAC  on the serial link . In the transmitter module , the input analog I and Q data signals TXI and TXQ from the VDC are applied to the Quadrature modulator , which also receives a transmit carrier frequency signal TFREQ from the Frequency Synthesizer  to produce a quadrature modulated transmit carrier signal TX. The analog transmit carrier modulated signal, an upconverted RF signal, TX is then applied to the Transmit Power Amplifier  of the Power Amplifier . The amplified transmit carrier signal is then passed through the High Power Passive Components (HPPC)  to the Antenna , which transmits the upconverted RF signal to the communication channel as a CDMA RF signal. In one embodiment of the invention, the Transmit Power Amplifier  comprises eight amplifiers of approximately 60 watts peak-to-peak each.","The HPPC  comprises a lightning protector, an output filter, a 10 dB directional coupler, an isolator, and a high power termination attached to the isolator.","A receive CDMA RF signal is received at the antenna  from the RF channel and passed through the HPPC  to the Receive Power Amplifier . The receive power amplifier  includes, for example, a 30 watt power transistor driven by a 5 watt transistor. The RF receive module  has quadrature modulated receive carrier signal RX from the receive power amplifier. The receive module  includes a Quadrature demodulator  which takes the receive carrier modulated signal RX and the receive carrier frequency signal RFREQ from the Frequency Synthesizer , synchronously demodulates the carrier, and provides analog I and Q channels. These channels are filtered to produce the signals RXI and RXQ, which are transferred to the VDC .","The Subscriber Unit",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0285","num":"0292"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2301","2302","2303","2304","2305"]},"The SU further includes a Subscriber Line Interface , including the functionality of a control (CC) generator, a Data Interface , an ADPCM encoder , an ADPCM decoder , an SU controller , an SU clock signal generator , memory , and a CDMA modem , which is essentially the same as the CDMA modem  described above with reference to FIG. . It is noted that data interface , ADPCM Encoder  and ADPCM Decoder  are typically provided as a standard ADPCM Encoder\/Decoder chip.","The Forward Link CDMA RF Channel signal is applied to the RF demodulator  to produce the Forward link CDMA signal. The Forward Link CDMA signal is provided to the CDMA modem , which acquires synchronization with the Global pilot signal, produces global pilot synchronization signal to the Clock , to generate the system timing signals, and despreads the plurality of logical channels. The CDMA modem  also acquires the traffic messages RMESS and control messages RCTRL and provides the traffic message signals RMESS to the Data Interface  and receive control message signals RCTRL to the SU Controller .","The receive control message signals RCTRL include a subscriber identification signal, a coding signal, and bearer modification signals. The RCTRL may also include control and other telecommunication signaling information. The receive control message signal RCTRL is applied to the SU controller , which verifies that the call is for the SU from the Subscriber identification value derived from RCTRL. The SU controller  determines the type of user information contained in the traffic message signal from the coding signal and bearer rate modification signal. If the coding signal indicates the traffic message is ADPCM coded, the traffic message RVMESS is sent to the ADPCM decoder  by sending a select message to the Data Interface . The SU controller  outputs an ADPCM coding signal and bearer rate signal derived from the coding signal to the ADPCM decoder . The traffic message signal RVMESS is the input signal to the ADPCM decoder , where the traffic message signal is converted to a digital information signal RINF in response to the values of the input ADPCM coding signal.","If the SU controller  determines the type of user information contained in the traffic message signal from the coding signal is not ADPCM coded, then RDMESS passes through the ADPCM encoder transparently. The traffic message RDMESS is transferred from the Data Interface  directly to the Interface Controller (IC)  of the subscriber line interface .","The digital information signal RINF or RDMESS is applied to the subscriber line interface , including a interface controller (IC)  and Line Interface (LI) . For the exemplary embodiment the IC is an Extended PCM Interface Controller (EPIC) and the LI is a Subscriber Line Interface Circuit (SLIC) for POTS which corresponds to RINF type signals, and a ISDN Interface for ISDN which corresponds to RDMESS type signals. The EPIC and SLIC circuits are well known in the art. The subscriber line interface  converts the digital information signal RINF or RDMESS to the user defined format. The user defined format is provided to the IC  from the SU Controller . The LI  includes circuits for performing such functions as A-law or \u03bc-law conversion, generating dial tone and, and generating or interpreting signaling bits. The line interface also produces the user information signal to the SU User  as defined by the subscriber line interface, for example POTS voice, voiceband data or ISDN data service.","For a Reverse Link CDMA RF Channel, a user information signal is applied to the LI  of the subscriber line interface , which outputs a service type signal and an information type signal to the SU controller. The IC  of the subscriber Line interface  produces a digital information signal TINF which is the input signal to the ADPCM encoder  if the user information signal is to be ADPCM encoded, such as for POTS service. For data or other non-ADPCM encoded user information, the IC  passes the data message TDMESS directly to the Data Interface . The Call control module (CC), including in the subscriber line interface , derives call control information from the User information signal, and passes the call control information CCLINF to the SU controller . The ADPCM encoder  also receives coding signal and bearer modification signals from the SU controller  and converts the input digital information signal into the output message traffic signal TVMESS in response to the coding and bearer modification signals. The SU controller  also outputs the reverse control signal which includes the coding signal call control information, and bearer channel modification signal, to the CDMA modem. The output message signal TVMESS is applied to the Data Interface . The Data Interface  sends the user information to the CDMA modem  as transmit message signal TMESS. The CDMA modem  spreads the output message and reverse control channels TCTRL received from the SU controller , and produces the reverse link CDMA Signal. The Reverse Link CDMA signal is provided to the RF transmit section  and modulated by the RF modulator  to produce the output Reverse Link CDMA RF channel signal transmitted from antenna .","Call Connection and Establishment Procedure","The process of bearer channel establishment consists of two procedures: the call connection process for a call connection incoming from a remote call processing unit such as an RDU (Incoming Call Connection), and the call connection process for a call outgoing from the SU (Outgoing Call Connection). Before any bearer channel can be established between an RCS and a SU, the SU must register its presence in the network with the remote call processor such as the RDU. When the off-hook signal is detected by the SU, the SU not only begins to establish a bearer channel; but also initiates the procedure for an RCS to obtain a terrestrial link between the RCS and the remote processor. As incorporated herein by reference, the process of establishing the RCS and RDU connection is detailed in the DECT V5.1 standard.","For the Incoming Call Connection procedure shown in , first , the WAC  (shown in ) receives, via one of the MUXs ,  and , an incoming call request from a remote call processing unit. This request identifies the target SU and that a call connection to the SU is desired. The WAC periodically outputs the SBCH channel with paging indicators for each SU and periodically outputs the FBCH traffic lights for each access channel. In response to the incoming call request, the WAC, at step , first checks to see if the identified SU is already active with another call. If so, the WAC returns a busy signal for the SU to the remote processing unit through the MUX, otherwise the paging indicator for the channel is set.","Next, at step , the WAC checks the status of the RCS modems and, at step , determines whether there is an available modem for the call. If a modem is available, the traffic lights on the FBCH indicate that one or more AXCH channels are available. If no channel is available after a certain period of time, then the WAC returns a busy signal for the SU to the remote processing unit through the MUX. If an RCS modem is available and the SU is not active (in Sleep mode), the WAC sets the paging indicator for the identified SU on the SBCH to indicate an incoming call request. Meanwhile, the access channel modems continuously search for the Short Access Pilot signal (SAXPT) of the SU.","At step , an SU in Sleep mode periodically enters awake mode. In awake mode, the SU modem synchronizes to the Downlink Pilot signal, waits for the SU modem AMF filters and phase locked loop to settle, and reads the paging indicator in the slot assigned to it on the SBCH to determine if there is a call for the SU . If no paging indicator is set, the SU halts the SU modem and returns to sleep mode. If a paging indicator is set for an incoming call connection, the SU modem checks the service type and traffic lights on FBCH for an available AXCH.","Next, at step , the SU modem selects an available AXCH and starts a fast transmit power ramp-up on the corresponding SAXPT. For a period the SU modem continues fast power ramp-up on SAXPT and the access modems continue to search for the SAXPT.","At step , the RCS modem acquires the SAXPT of the SU and begins to search for the SU LAXPT. When the SAXPT is acquired, the modem informs the WAC controller, and the WAC controller sets the traffic lights corresponding to the modem to \u201cred\u201d to indicate the modem is now busy. The traffic lights are periodically output while continuing to attempt acquisition of the LAXPT.","The SU modem monitors, at step , the FBCH AXCH traffic light. When the AXCH traffic light is set to red, the SU assumes the RCS modem has acquired the SAXPT and begins transmitting LAXPT. The SU modem continues to ramp-up power of the LAXPT at a slower rate until Sync-Ind messages are received on the corresponding CTCH. If the SU is mistaken because the traffic light was actually set in response to another SU acquiring the AXCH, the SU modem times out because no Sync-Ind messages are received. The SU randomly waits a period of time, picks a new AXCH channel, and steps  and  are repeated-until the SU modem receives Sync-Ind messages. Details of the power ramp up method used in the exemplary embodiment of this invention may be found in the U.S. patent application entitled METHOD OF CONTROLLING INITIAL POWER RAMP-UP IN CDMA SYSTEMS BY USING SHORT CODES filed on even date herewith, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Next, at step , the RCS modem acquires the LAXPT of the SU and begins sending Sync-Ind messages on the corresponding CTCH. The modem waits 10 msec for the Pilot and AUX Vector correlator filters and Phase locked loop to settle, but continues to send Synch-Ind messages on the CTCH. The modem then begins looking for a request message for access to a bearer channel (MAC_ACC_REQ), from the SU modem.","The SU modem, at step , receives the Sync-Ind message and freezes the LAXPT transmit power level. The SU modem then begins sending repeated request messages for access to a bearer traffic channel (MAC_ACC_REQ) at fixed power levels, and listens for a request confirmation message (MAC_BEARER_CFM) from the RCS modem.","Next, at step , the RCS modem receives a MAC_ACC_REQ message; the modem then starts measuring the AXCH power level, and starts the APC channel. The RCS modem then sends the MAC_BEARER_CFM message to the SU and begins listening for the acknowledgment MAC_BEARER_CFM_ACK of the MAC_BEARER_CFM message.","At step , the SU modem receives the MAC_BEARER_CFM message and begins obeying the APC power control messages. The SU stops sending the MAC_ACC_REQ message and sends the RCS modem the MAC_BEARER_CFM_ACK message. The SU begins sending the null data on the AXCH. The SU waits 10 msec for the uplink transmit power level to settle.","The RCS modem, at step , receives the MAC_BEARER_CFM_ACK message and stops sending the MAC_BEARER_CFM messages. APC power measurements continue.","Next, at step , both the SU and the RCS modems have synchronized the sub-epochs, obey APC messages, measure receive power levels, and compute and send APC messages. The SU waits 10 msec for downlink power level to settle.","Finally, at step , Bearer channel is established and initialized between the SU and RCS modems. The WAC receives the bearer establishment signal from the RCS modem, re-allocates the AXCH channel and sets the corresponding traffic light to green.","For the Outgoing Call Connection shown in , the SU is placed in active mode by the off-hook signal at the user interface at step .","Next, at step , the RCS indicates available AXCH channels by setting the respective traffic lights.","At step , the SU synchronizes to the Downlink Pilot, waits for the SU modem Vector correlator filters and phase lock loop to settle, and the SU checks service type and traffic lights for an available AXCH.","Steps  through  are identical to the procedure steps  through  for the Incoming Call Connection procedure of , and so are not explained in detail.","In the previous procedures for Incoming Call Connection and Outgoing Call Connection, the power Ramping-Up process consists of the following events. The SU starts from very low transmit power and increases its power level while transmitting the short code SAXPT; once the RCS modem detects the short code it turns off the traffic light. Upon detecting the changed traffic light, the SU continues ramping-up at a slower rate this time sending the LAXPT. Once the RCS modem acquires the LAXPT and sends a message on CTCH to indicate this, the SU keeps its transmit (TX) power constant and sends the MAC-Access-Request message. This message is answered with a MAC_BEARBER_CFM message on the CTCH. Once the SU receives the MAC_BEAER_CFM message it switches to the traffic channel (TRCH) which is the dial tone for POTS.","When the SU captures a specific user channel AXCH, the RCS assigns a code seed for the SU through the CTCH. The code seed is used by the spreadingcode generator in the SU modem to produce the assigned code for the reverse pilot of the subscriber, and the spreading codes for associated channels for traffic, call control, and signaling. The SU reverse pilot spreading code sequence is synchronized in phase to the RCS system Global Pilot spreading code sequence, and the traffic, call control, and signaling spreading codes are synchronized in phase to the SU reverse pilot spreading code sequence.","If the Subscriber unit is successful in capturing a specific user channel, the RCS establishes a terrestrial Link with the remote processing unit to correspond to the specific user channel. For the DECT V5.1 standard, once the complete link from the RDU to the LE is established using the V5.1 ESTABLISHMENT message, a corresponding V5.1 ESTABLISHMENT ACK message is returned from the LE to the RDU, and the Subscriber Unit is sent a CONNECT message indicating that the transmission link is complete.","Support of Special Service Types","The system of the present invention includes a bearer channel modification feature which allows the transmission rate of the user information to be switched from a lower rate to a maximum of 64 kb\/s. The Bearer Channel Modification (BCM) method is used to change a 32 kb\/s ADPCM channel to a 64 kb\/s PCM channel to support high speed data and fax communications through the spread-spectrum communication system of the present invention. Additional details of this technique are described in U.S. Patent Application entitled \u201cCDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WHICH SELECTIVELY SUPPRESSES DATA TRANSMISSIONING DURING ESTABLISHED OF A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL\u201d filed on even date herewith and incorporated herein by reference.","First, a bearer channel on the RF interface is established between the RCS and SU, and a corresponding link exists between the RCS terrestrial interface and the remote processing unit, such as an RDU. The digital transmission rate of the Link between the RCS and remote processing unit normally corresponds to a data encoded rate, which may be, for example, ADPCM at 32 kb\/s. The WAC controller of the RCS monitors the encoded digital data information of the link received by the Line Interface of the MUX. If the WAC controller detects the presence of the 2100 Hz tone in the digital data, the WAC instructs the SU through the assigned logical control channel and causes a second, 64 kb\/s duplex link to be established between the RCS modem and the SU. In addition, the WAC controller instructs the remote processing unit to establish a second 64 kb\/s duplex link between the remote processing unit and the RCS. Consequently, for a brief period, the remote processing unit and the SU exchange the same data over both the 32 kb\/s and the 64 kb\/s links through the RCS. Once the second link is established, the remote processing unit causes the WAC controller to switch transmission only to the 64 kb\/s link, and the WAC controller instructs the RCS modem and the SU to terminate and tear down the 32 kb\/s link. Concurrently, the 32 kb\/s terrestrial link is also terminated and torn down.","Another embodiment of the BCM method incorporates a negotiation between the external remote processing unit, such as the RDU, and the RCS to allow for redundant channels on the terrestrial interface, while only using one bearer channel on the RF interface. The method described is a synchronous switchover from the 32 kb\/s link to the 64 kb\/s link over the air link which takes advantage of the fact that the spreading code sequence timing is synchronized between the RCS modem and SU. When the WAC controller detects the presence of the 2100 Hz tone in the digital data, the WAC controller instructs the remote processing unit to establish a second 64 kb\/s duplex link between the remote processing unit and the RCS. The remote processing unit then sends 32 kb\/s encoded data and 64 kb\/s data concurrently to the RCS. Once the remote processing unit has established the 64 kb\/s link, the RCS is informed and the 32 kb\/s link is terminated and torn down. The RCS also informs the SU that the 32 kb\/s link is being torn down and to switch processing to receive unencoded 64 kb\/s data on the channel. The SU and RCS exchange control messages over the bearer control channel of the assigned channel group to identify and determine the particular subpoch of the bearer channel spreading code sequence within which the RCS will begin transmitting 64 kbit\/sec data to the SU. Once the subpoch is identified, the switch occurs synchronously at the identified subpoch boundary. This synchronous switchover method is more economical of bandwidth since the system does not need to maintain capacity for a 64 kb\/s link in order to support a switchover.","The previously described embodiments of the BCM feature, the RCS will tear down the 32 kb\/s link first, but one skilled in the art would know that the RCS could tear down the 32 kb\/s link after the bearer channel has switched to the 64 kb\/s Link.","As another special service type, the system of the present invention includes a method for conserving capacity over the RF interface for ISDN types of traffic. This conservation occurs while a known idle bit pattern is transmitted in the ISDN D-channel when no data information is being transmitted. The CDMA system of the present invention includes a method to prevent transmission of redundant information carried on the D-channel of ISDN networks for signals transmitted through a wireless communication link. The advantage of such method is that it reduces the amount of information transmitted and consequently the transmit power and channel capacity used by that information. The method is described as it is used in the RCS. In the first step, the controller, such as the WAC of the RCS or the SU controller of the SU, monitors the output D-channel from the subscriber line interface for a predetermined channel idle pattern. A delay is included between the output of the line interface and the CDMA modem. Once the idle pattern is detected, the controller inhibits the transmission of the spread message channel through a message included in the control signal to the CDMA modem. The controller continues to monitor the output D-channel of the line interface until the presence of data information is detected. When data information is detected, the spread message channel is activated. Because the message channel is synchronized to the associated pilot which is not inhibited, the corresponding CDMA modem of the other end of the communication link does not have to reacquire synchronization to the message channel.","Drop Out Recovery","The RCS and SU each monitor the CDMA bearer channel signal to evaluate the quality of the CDMA bearer channel connection. Link quality is evaluated using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) employing adaptive quantile estimation. The SPRT process uses measurements of the received signal power; and if the SPRT process detects that the local spreading code generator has lost synchronization with the received signal spreading code or if it detects the absence or low level of a received signal, the SPRT declares loss of lock (LOL).","When the LOL condition is declared, the receiver modem of each RCS and SU begins a Z-search of the input signal with the local spreading code generator. Z-search is well known in the art of CDMA spreading code acquisition and detection and is described in by to Robert E. Ziemer and Roger L. Peterson, at pages 492-94 which is incorporated herein by reference. The Z-search algorithm of the present invention tests groups of eight spreading code phases ahead and behind the last known phase in larger and larger spreading code phase increments.","During the LOL condition detected by the RCS, the RCS continues to transmit to the SU on the Assigned Channels, and continues to transmit power control signals to the SU to maintain SU transmit power level. The method of transmitting power control signals is described below. Successful reaquisition desirably takes place within a specified period of time. If reaquisition is successful, the call connection continues, otherwise the RCS tears down the call connection by deactivating and deallocating the RCS modem assigned by the WAC, and transmits a call termination signal to a remote call processor, such as the RDU, as described previously.","When the LOL condition is detected by the SU, the SU stops transmission to the RCS on the Assigned Channels which forces the RCS into a LOL condition, and starts the reaquisition algorithm. If reaquisition is successful, the call connection continues, and if not successful, the RCS tears down the call connection by deactivating and deallocating the SU modem as described previously.","Power Control","General","The power control feature of the present invention is used to minimize the amount of transmit power used by an RCS and the SUs of the system, and the power control subfeature that updates transmit power during bearer channel connection is defined as automatic power control (APC). APC data is transferred from the RCS to an SU on the forward APC channel and from an SU to the RCS on the reverse APC channel. When there is no active data link between the two, the maintenance power control (MPC) subfeature updates the SU transmit power.","Transmit power levels of forward and reverse assigned channels and reverse global channels are controlled by the APC algorithm to maintain sufficient signal power to interference noise power ratio (SIR) on those channels, and to stabilize and minimize system output power. The present invention uses a closed loop power control mechanism in which a receiver decides that the transmitter should incrementally raise or lower its transmit power. This decision is conveyed back to the respective transmitter via the power control signal on the APC channel. The receiver makes the decision to increase or decrease the transmitter's power based on two error signals. One error signal is an indication of the difference between the measured and desired despread signal powers, and the other error signal is an indication of the average received total power.","As used in the described embodiment of the invention, the term near-end power control is used to refer to adjusting the transmitter's output power in accordance with the APC signal received on the APC channel from the other end. This means the reverse power control for the SU and forward power control for the RCS; and the term far-end APC is used to refer to forward power control for the SU and reverse power control for the RCS (adjusting the opposite end's transmit power).","In order to conserve power, the SU modem terminates transmission and powers-down while waiting for a call, defined as the sleep phase. Sleep phase is terminated by an awaken signal from the SU controller. The SU modem acquisition circuit automatically enters the reaquisition phase, and begins the process of acquiring the downlink pilot, as described previously.","Closed Loop Power Control Algorithms","The near-end power control consists of two steps: first, the initial transmit power is set; and second, the transmit power is continually adjusted according to information received from the far-end using APC.","For the SU, initial transmit power is set to a minimum value and then ramped up, for example, at a rate of 1 dB\/ms until either a ramp-up timer expires (not shown) or the RCS changes the corresponding traffic light value on the FBCH to \u201cred\u201d indicating that the RCS has locked to the SU's short pilot SAXPT. Expiration of the timer causes the SAXPT transmission to be shut down, unless the traffic light value is set to red first, in which case the SU continues to ramp-up transmit power but at a much lower rate than before the \u201cred\u201d signal was detected.","For the RCS, initial transmit power is set at a fixed value, corresponding to the minimum value necessary for reliable operation as determined experimentally for the service type and the current number of system users. Global channels, such as Global Pilot or, FBCH, are always transmitted at the fixed initial power, whereas traffic channels are switched to APC.","The APC bits are transmitted as one bit up or down signals on the APC channel. In the described embodiment, the 64 kb\/s APC data stream is not encoded or interleaved.","Far-end power control consists of the near-end transmitting power control information for the far-end to use in adjusting its transmit power.","The APC algorithm causes the RCS or the SU to transmit +1 if the following inequality holds, otherwise \u22121.\n\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b1>0\u2003\u2003(45)\n\nHere, the error signal eis calculated as\n\n\u2212(1)\u2003\u2003(46)\n\nwhere Pis the despread signal plus noise power, Pis the despread noise power, and SNRis the desired despread signal to noise ratio for the particular service type; and\n\n\u2003\u2003(47)\n\nwhere Pr is a measure of the received power and Po is the automatic gain control (AGC) circuit set point. The weights \u03b1and \u03b1in equation (33) are chosen for each service type and APC update rate.\n\nMaintenance Power Control\n","During the sleep phase of the SU, the interference noise power of the CDMA RF channel may change. The present invention includes a maintenance power control feature (MPC) which periodically adjusts the SU's initial transmit power with respect to the interference noise power of the CDMA channel. The MPC is the process whereby the transmit power level of an SU is maintained within close proximity of the minimum level for the RCS to detect the SU's signal. The MPC process compensates for low frequency changes in the required SU transmit power.","The maintenance control feature uses two global channels: one is called the status channel (STCH) on reverse link, and the other is called the check-up channel (CUCH) on forward link. The signals transmitted on these channels carry no data and they are generated the same way the short codes used in initial power ramp-up are generated. The STCH and CUCH codes are generated from a \u201creserved\u201d branch of the global code generator.","The MPC process is as follows. At random intervals, the SU sends a symbol length spreading code periodically for 3 ms on the status channel (STCH). If the RCS detects the sequence, it replies by sending a symbol length code sequence within the next 3 ms on the check-up channel (CUCH). When the SU detects the response from the RCS, it reduces its transmit power by a particular step size. If the SU does not see any response from the RCS within that 3 ms period, it increases its transmit power by the step size. Using this method, the RCS response is transmitted at a power level that is enough to maintain a 0.99 detection probability at all SU's.","The rate of change of traffic load and the number of active users is related to the total interference noise power of the CDMA channel. The update rate and step size of the maintenance power update signal for the present invention is determined by using queuing theory methods well known in the art of communication theory, such as outlined in \u201c\u201d (Plenum-New York) edited by McDonald and incorporated herein by reference. By modeling the call origination process as an exponential random variable with mean 6.0 mins, numerical computation shows the maintenance power level of a SU should be updated once every 10 seconds or less to be able to follow the changes in interference level using 0.5 dB step size. Modeling the call origination process as a Poisson random variable with exponential interarival times, arrival rate of 2\u00d710per second per user, service rate of 1\/360 per second, and the total subscriber population is 600 in the RCS service area also yields by numerical computation that an update rate of once every 10 seconds is sufficient when 0.5 dB step size is used.","Maintenance power adjustment is performed periodically by the SU which changes from sleep phase to awake phase and performs the MPC process. Consequently, the process for the MPC feature is shown in FIG.  and is as follows: First, at step , signals are exchanged between the SU and the RCS maintaining a transmit power level that is close to the required level for detection: the SU periodically sends a symbol length spreading code in the STCH, and the RCS periodically sends a symbol length spreading code in the CUCH as response.","Next, at step , if the SU receives a response within 3 ms after the STCH message it sent, it decreases its transmit power by a particular step size at step ; but if the SU does not receive a response within 3 ms after the STCH message, it increases its transmit power by the same step size at step .","The SU waits, at step , for a period of time before sending another STCH message, this time period is determined by a random process which averages 10 seconds.","Thus, the transmit power of the STCH messages from the SU is adjusted based on the RCS response periodically, and the transmit power of the CUCH messages from the RCS is fixed.","Mapping of Power Control Signal to Logical Channels For APC","Power control signals are mapped to specified Logical Channels for controlling transmit power levels of forward and reverse assigned channels. Reverse global channels are also controlled by the APC algorithm to maintain sufficient signal power to interference noise power ratio (SIR) on those reverse channels, and to stabilize and minimize system output power. The present invention uses a closed loop power control method in which a receiver periodically decides to incrementally raise or lower the output power of the transmitter at the other end. The method also conveys that decision back to the respective transmitter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0341","num":"0348"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 13"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"APC Signal Channel Assignments"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Link",{},{}]},{"entry":["Channels and","Call\/Connection","Power Control Method"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Signals","Status","Initial Value","Continuous"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Reverse link","Being Established","as determined by","APC bits in"]},{"entry":["AXCH",{},"power ramping","forward APC"]},{"entry":["AXPT",{},{},"channel"]},{"entry":["Reverse link","In-Progress","level established","APC bits in"]},{"entry":["APC, OW,",{},"during call set-up","forward APC"]},{"entry":["TRCH,",{},{},"channel"]},{"entry":"pilot signal"},{"entry":["Forward Link","In-Progress","fixed value","APC bits in"]},{"entry":["APC, OW,",{},{},"reverse"]},{"entry":["TRCH",{},{},"APC channel"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Forward and reverse links are independently controlled.

Table 13 summarizes the specific power control methods for the controlled channels.","The required SIRS of the assigned channels TRCH, APC and OW and reverse assigned pilot signal for any particular SU are fixed in proportion to each other and these channels are subject to nearly identical fading, therfore, they are power controlled together.","Adaptive Forward Power Control","The AFPC process attempts to maintain the minimum required SIR on the forward channels during a call connection. The AFPC recursive process, shown in , consists of the steps of having an SU form the two error signals eand ein step  where\n\n\u2212(1)\u2003\u2003(36)\n\n\u2003\u2003(37)\n\nand Pis the despread signal plus noise power, Pis the despread noise power, SNRis the required signal to noise ratio for the service type, Pis a measure of the total received power, and Pis the AGC set point.

Despreader output power corresponding to the required SIR for each channel and service type is predetermined. While a call\/connection is in progress, several user CDMA logical channels are concurrently active; each of these channels transfers a symbol every symbol period. The SIR of the symbol from the nominally highest SIR channel is measured, compared to a threshold and used to determine the APC step up\/down decision each symbol period. Table 14 indicates the symbol (and threshold) used for the APC computation by service and call type.","APC Parameters","APC information is always conveyed as a single bit of information, and the APC Data Rate is equivalent to the APC Update Rate. The APC update rate is 64 kb\/s. This rate is high enough to accommodate expected Rayleigh and Doppler fades, and allow for a relatively high (\u02dc0.2) Bit Error Rate (BER) in the Uplink and Downlink APC channels, which minimizes capacity devoted to the APC.","The power step up\/down indicated by an APC bit is nominally between 0.1 and 0.01 dB. The dynamic range for power control is 70 dB on the reverse link and 12 dB on the forward link for the exemplary embodiment of the present system.","An Alternative Embodiment of Multiplexing of APC Information","The dedicated APC and OW logical channels described previously can also be multiplexed together in one logical channel. The APC information is transmitted at 64 kb\/s. continuously whereas the OW information occurs in data bursts. The alternative multiplexed logical channel includes the unencoded, non-interleaved 64 kb\/s. APC information on, for example, the In-phase channel and the OW information on the Quadrature channel of the QPSK signal.","Closed Loop Power Control Implementation","The closed loop power control during a call connection responds to two different variations in overall system power. First, the system responds to local behavior such as changes in power level of an SU, and second, the system responds to changes in the power level of the entire group of active users in the system.","The Power Control system of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . As shown, the circuitry used to adjust the transmitted power is similar for the RCS (shown as the RCS power control module ) and SU (shown as the SU power control module ). Beginning with the RCS power control module , the reverse link RF channel signal is received at the RF antenna and demodulated to produce the reverse CDMA signal RMCH. The signal RMCH is applied to the variable gain amplifier (VGA)  which produces an input signal to the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) Circuit . The AGC  produces a variable gain amplifier control signal into the VGA. This signal maintains the level of the output signal of VGA at a near constant value. The output signal of VGA is despread by the despread-demultiplexer (demux) , which produces a despread user message signal MS and a forward APC bit. The forward APC bit is applied to the integrator  to produce the Forward APC control signal. The Forward APC control signal controls the Forward Link VGA and maintains the Forward Link RF channel signal at a minimum desired level for communication.","The signal power of the despread user message signal MS of the RCS power module  is measured by the power measurement circuit  to produce a signal power indication. The output of the VGA is also despread by the AUX despreader which despreads the signal by using an uncorrelated spreading code, and hence obtains a despread noise signal. The power measurement of this signal is multiplied by 1 plus the desired signal to noise ratio (SNR) to form the threshold signal S. The difference between the despread signal power and the threshold value S is produced by the subtracter . This difference is the error signal ES, which is an error signal relating to the particular SU transmit power level. Similarly, the control signal for the VGA is applied to the rate scaling circuit  to reduce the rate of the control signal for VGA. The output signal of scaling circuit  is a scaled system power level signal SP. The Threshold Compute logic  calculates the System Signal Threshold value SST from the RCS user channel power data signal RCSUSR. The complement of the Scaled system power level signal, SP, and the System Signal Power Threshold value SST are applied to the adder  which produces second error signal ES. This error signal is related to the system transmit power level of all active SUs. The input Error signals ES and ES are combined in the combiner  produce a combined error signal input to the delta modulator (DM) , and the output signal of the DM is the reverse APC bit stream signal, having bits of value +1 or \u22121, which for the present invention is transmitted as a 64 kb\/sec signal.","The Reverse APC bit is applied to the spreading circuit , and the output signal of the spreading circuit  is the spread-spectrum forward APC message signal. Forward OW and Traffic signals are also provided to spreading circuits , , producing forward traffic message signals , , . . . N. The power level of the forward APC signal, the forward OW, and traffic message signals are adjusted by the respective amplifiers ,  and  to produce the power level adjusted forward APC, OW, and TRCH channels signals. These signals are combined by the adder  and applied to the VAG, which produces forward link RF channel signal.","The forward link RF channel signal including the spread forward APC signal is received by the RF antenna of the SU, and demodulated to produce the forward CDMA signal FMCH. This signal is provided to the variable gain amplifier (VGA) . The output signal of VGA is applied to the Automatic Gain Control Circuit (AGC)  which produces a variable gain amplifier control signal to VGA. This signal maintains the level of the output signal of VGA at a near constant level. The output signal of VAG is despread by the despread demux , which produces a despread user message signal SUMS and a reverse APC bit. The reverse APC bit is applied to the integrator  which produces the Reverse APC control signal. This reverse APC control signal is provided to the Reverse APC VGA to maintain the Reverse link RF channel signal at a minimum power level.","The despread user message signal SUMS is also applied to the power measurement circuit  producing a power measurement signal, which is added to the complement of threshold value S in the adder  to produce error signal ES. The signal ES is an error signal relating to the RCS transmit power level for the particular SU. To obtain threshold S, the despread noise power indication from the AUX despreader is multiplied by 1 plus the desired signal to noise ratio SNR. The AUX despreader despreads the input data using an uncorrelated spreading code, hence its output is an indication of the despread noise power.","Similarly, the control signal for the VGA is applied to the rate scaling circuit to reduce the rate of the control signal for VGA in order to produce a scaled received power level RP (see FIG. ). The threshold compute circuit computes the received signal threshold RST from the SU measured power signal SUUSR. The complement of the scaled received power level RP and the received signal threshold RST are applied to the adder which produces error signal ES. This error is related to the RCS transmit power to all other SUs. The input error signals ES and ES are combined in the combiner and input to the delta modulator DM. The output signal of DM is the forward APC bit stream signal, with bits having value of value +1 or \u22121. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, this signal is transmitted as a 64 kb\/sec signal.","The Forward APC bit stream signal is applied to the spreading circuit , to produce the output reverse spread-spectrum APC signal. Reverse OW and Traffic signals are also input to spreading circuits , , producing reverse OW and traffic message signals , , . . . N, and the reverse pilot is generated by the reverse pilot generator . The power level of the reverse APC message signal, reverse OW message signal, reverse pilot, and the reverse traffic message signals are adjusted by amplifiers , , ,  to produce the signals which are combined by the adder  and input to the reverse APC VGA. It is this VGA which produces the reverse link RF channel signal.","During the call connection and bearer channel establishment process, the closed loop power control of the present invention is modified, and is shown in FIG. . As shown, the circuits used to adjust the transmitted power are different for the RCS, shown as the Initial RCS power control module ; and for the SU, shown as the Initial SU power control module . Beginning with the Initial RCS power control module , the reverse link RF channel signal is received at the RF antenna and demodulated producing the reverse CDMA signal IRMCH which is received by the first variable gain amplifier (VGA) . The output signal of VGA is detected by the Automatic Gain Control Circuit (AGC)  which provides a variable gain amplifier control signal to VGA to maintain the level of the output signal of VAG at a near constant value. The output signal of VGA is despread by the despread demultiplexer , which produces a despread user message signal IMS. The Forward APC control signal, ISET, is set to a fixed value, and is applied to the Forward Link Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)  to set the Forward Link RF channel signal at a predetermined level.","The signal power of the despread user message signal IMS of the Initial RCS power module  is measured by the power measure circuit , and the output power measurement is subtracted from a threshold value S in the subtracter  to produce error signal ES, which is an error signal relating to the transmit power level of a particular SU. The threshold S is calculated by multiplying the despread power measurement obtained from the AUX despreader by 1 plus the desired signal to noise ratio SNR. The AUX despreader despreads the signal using an uncorrelated spreading code, hence its output signal is an indication of despread noise power. Similarly, the VGA control signal is applied to the rate scaling circuit  to reduce the rate of the VGA control signal in order to produce a scaled system power level signal SP. The threshold computation logic  determines an Initial System Signal Threshold value (ISST) computed from the user channel power data signal (IRCSUSR). The complement of the Scaled system power level signal SP and the ISST are provided to the adder  which produces a second error signal ES, which is an error signal relating to the system transmit power level of all active SUs. The value of ISST is the desired transmit power for a system having the particular configuration. The input Error signals ES and ES are combined in the combiner  produce a combined error signal input to the delta modulator (DM) . DM produces the initial reverse APC bit stream signal, having bits of value +1 or \u22121, which in the exemplary embodiment is transmitted as a 64 kb\/s signal.","The Reverse APC bit stream signal is applied to the spreading circuit , to produce the initial spread-spectrum forward APC signal. The CTCH information is spread by the spreader  to form the spread CTCH message signal. The spread APC and CTCH signals are scaled by the amplifiers  and , and combined by the combiner . The combined signal is applied to VAG, which produces the forward link RF channel signal.","The forward link RF channel signal including the spread forward APC signal is received by the RF antenna of the SU and demodulated to produce the initial forward CDMA signal (IFMCH) which is applied to the variable gain amplifier (VGA) . The output signal of VGA is detected by the Automatic Gain Control Circuit (AGC)  which produces a variable gain amplifier control signal for the VGA. This signal maintains the output power level of the VGA at a near constant value. The output signal of VAG is despread by the despread demultiplexer , which produces an initial reverse APC bit that is dependent on the output level of VGA. The reverse APC bit is processed by the integrator  to produce the Reverse APC control signal. The Reverse APC control signal is provided to the Reverse APC VGA to maintain Reverse Link RF channel signal at a defined power level.","The global channel AXCH signal is spread by the spreading circuits  to provide the spread AXCH channel signal. The reverse pilot generator  provides a reverse pilot signal, and the signal power of AXCH and the reverse pilot signal are adjusted by the respective amplifiers  and . The spread AXCH channel signal and the reverse pilot signal are summed by the adder  to produce reverse link CDMA signal. The reverse link CDMA signal is received by the reverse APC VGA, which produces the reverse link RF channel signal output to the RF transmitter.","System Capacity Management","The system capacity management algorithm of the present invention optimizes the maximum user capacity for an RCS area, called a cell. When the SU comes within a certain value of maximum transmit power, the SU sends an alarm message to the RCS. The RCS sets the traffic lights which control access to the system, to \u201cred\u201d which, as previously described, is a flag that inhibits access by the SU's. This condition remains in effect until the call to the alarming SU terminates, or until the transmit power of the alarming SU, measured at the SU, is a value less than the maximum transmit power. When multiple SUs send alarm messages, the condition remains in effect until either all calls from planning SUs terminate, or until the transmit power of the alarming SU, measured at the SU, is less than the maximum transmit power. An alternative embodiment monitors the bit error rate measurements from the FEC decoder, and holds the RCS traffic lights at \u201cred\u201d until the bit error rate is less than a predetermined value.","The blocking strategy of the present invention includes a method which uses the power control information transmitted from the RCS to an SU, and the received power measurements at the RCS. The RCS measures its transmit power level, detects that a maximum value is reached, and determines when to block new users. An SU preparing to enter the system blocks itself if the SU reaches the maximum transmit power before successful completion of a bearer channel assignment.","Each additional user in the system has the effect of increasing the noise level for all other users, which decreases the signal to noise ratio (SNR) that each user experiences. The power control algorithm maintains a desired SNR for each user. Therefore, in the absence of any other limitations, addition of a new user into the system has only a transient effect and the desired SNR is regained.","The transmit power measurement at the RCS is done by measuring either the root mean square (rms) value of the baseband combined signal or by measuring the transmit power of the RF signal and feeding it back to digital control circuits. The transmit power measurement may also be made by the SUs to determine if the unit has reached its maximum transmit power. The SU transmit power level is determined by measuring the control signal of the RF amplifier, and scaling the value based on the service type, such as POTS, FAX, or ISDN.","The information that an SU has reached the maximum power is transmitted to the RCS by the SU in a message on the Assigned Channels. The RCS also determines the condition by measuring reverse APC changes because, if the RCS sends APC messages to the SU to increase SU transmit power, and the SU transmit power measured at the RCS is not increased, the SU has reached the maximum transmit power.","The RCS does not use traffic lights to block new users who have finished ramping-up using the short codes. These users are blocked by denying them the dial tone and letting them time out. The RCS sends all 1's (go down commands) on the APC Channel to make the SU lower its transmit power. The RCS also sends either no CTCH message or a message with an invalid address which would force the FSU to abandon the access procedure and start over. The SU, however, does not start the acquisition process immediately because the traffic Lights are red.","When the RCS reaches its transmit power limit, it enforces blocking in the same manner as when an SU reaches its transmit power limit. The RCS turns off all the traffic lights on the FBCH, starts sending all 1 APC bits (go down commands) to those users who have completed their short code ramp-up but have not yet been given a dial tone, and either sends no CTCH message to these users or sends messages with invalid addresses to force them to abandon the access process.","The self blocking process of the SU is as follows. When the SU starts transmitting the AXCH, the APC starts its power control operation using the AXCH and the SU transmit power increases. While the transmit power is increasing under the control of the APC, it is monitored by the SU controller. If the transmit power limit is reached, the SU abandons the access procedure and starts over.","System Synchronization","The RCS is synchronized either to the PSTN Network Clock signal through one of the Line interfaces, as shown in , or to the RCS system clock oscillator, which free-runs to provide a master timing signal for the system. The Global Pilot Channel, and therefore all Logical channels within the CDMA channel, are synchronized to the system clock signal of the RCS. The Global Pilot (GLPT) is transmitted by the RCS and defines the timing at the RCS transmitter.","The SU receiver is synchronized to the GLPT, and so behaves as a slave to the Network Clock oscillator. However, the SU timing is retarded by the propagation delay. In the present embodiment of the invention, the SU modem extracts a 64 KHz and 8 KHz clock signal from the CDMA RF Receive channel, and a PLL oscillator circuit creates 2 MHz and 4 MHz clock signals","The SU transmitter and hence the LAXPT or ASPT are slaved to the timing of the SU receiver.","The RCS receiver is synchronized to the LAXPT or the ASPT transmitted by the SU, however, its timing may be retarded by the propagation delay. Hence, the timing of the RCS receiver is that of the RCS transmitter retarded by twice the propagation delay.","Furthermore, the system can be synchronized via a reference received from a Global Positioning System receiver (GPS). In a system of this type, a GPS receiver in each RCS provides a reference clock signal to all submodules of the RCS. Because each RCS receives the same time reference from the GPS, all of the system clock signals in all of the RCSs are synchronized.","Although the invention has been described in terms of multiple exemplary embodiments, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced with modifications to the embodiments that are within the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEVANT ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY
