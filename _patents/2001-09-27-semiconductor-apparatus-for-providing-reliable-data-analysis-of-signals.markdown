Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a semiconductor apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a semiconductor apparatus for reliable analysis of signals.","2. Description of the Related Art","A semiconductor apparatus often carries out data analysis or comparison of signals. In particular, a semiconductor apparatus for testing a semiconductor circuit compares a circuit response signal from the semiconductor circuit with an expected response signal expected to be sent from the semiconductor circuit.","A data analyzer is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-A-Heisei, 6-201801). The conventional data analyzer includes exclusive-OR gates - and an OR gate , as shown in FIG. . First inputs of the exclusive-OR gates - are coupled to receive a circuit response signal (CIRCUIT RESPONSE (X)), respectively. CIRCUIT RESPONSE (X) is the signal outputted by the semiconductor circuit to be tested. Second inputs of the exclusive-OR gates  to  are coupled to receive an expected response signal (EXPECTED RESPONSE (X)), respectively. EXPECTED RESPONSE (X) is the signal expected to be outputted by the semiconductor circuit. Each of the exclusive-OR gates  to , if CIRCUIT RESPONSE (X) and EXPECTED RESPONSE (X) coincide with each other, outputs \u201c0\u201d, and if they do not coincide, outputs \u201c1\u201d. Respective outputs of the exclusive-OR gates  to  are connected to respective inputs of the OR gate . An output of the OR gate  is connected to a terminal . On the basis of a signal appearing in the terminal , it is judged whether or not CIRCUIT RESPONSE (X) and EXPECTED RESPONSE (X) coincide with each other.","However, the conventional data analyzer can not distinguish a case when the data analyzer has a failure from a case when the tested semiconductor circuit has a failure. For example, let us suppose that the exclusive-OR gate  has a failure and the output of the exclusive-OR gate  is fixed to a logic \u201c0\u201d. In this case, it can not be judged from the signal outputted by the exclusive-OR gate  whether the exclusive-OR gate  outputs the logic \u201c0\u201d since signal CIRSUIT RESPONSE () and EXPECTED RESPONSE () coincide with each other, or the exclusive-OR gate  outputs the logic \u201c0\u201d since the exclusive-OR gate  has a failure and the output of the exclusive-OR gate  is fixed to the logic \u201c0\u201d.","Other techniques for testing circuits are disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (Jp-A-Heisei 10-187554, Jp-A 2000 76894). However, none of the disclosed techniques deals with the above-mentioned problem.","Still another technique for self-testing of a circuit is disclosed in Japanese Patent Gazette (Jp-B-Heisei 7-31610). However, the disclosed circuit do not achieve a reliable self-test if the testing circuit has a failure and thereby the output of the testing circuit is fixed to a value.","It is desired to eliminate the possibility that compared signals are recognized to be identical because of a failure of a comparing circuit.","Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a comparing circuit in which it is possible to eliminate the possibility that comparison signals are recognized to be identical because of a failure of the comparing circuit.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a comparing circuit, a failure of which is easily detected.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a comparing circuit for reducing a time required to test the semiconductor apparatus when the comparing circuit is used to test a semiconductor apparatus.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a comparing circuit that enable to simultaneously prove that a plurality of the signals coincide with each other and that the comparing circuit itself has no failure.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a data analyzer for judging whether or not a signal is at a predetermined state, a failure of which is easily detected.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a data analyzer that enables to simultaneously prove that a signal(s) is at some state and that the data analyzer itself has no failure.","In order to achieve an aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor apparatus is composed of a signal providing circuit and a data analyzer. The signal providing circuit provides an input signal set including at least one input signal. The data analyzer outputs a digital result signal in synchronization with a clock signal. The data analyzer inverts the digital result signal at a timing indicated by the clock signal while the input signal set is in a predetermined state, and does not invert the digital result signal while the input signal set is not in the predetermined state.","In the case when the input signal set includes first and second digital signals, the predetermined state may be a coincident state in which the first and second digital signal coincide with each other.","The data analyzer preferably includes a logic circuit outputting a flip-flop input signal in response to the input signal set, and a flip-flop latching the flip-flop input signal to store a storage datum, and outputting the digital result signal in response to the storage datum. In this case, the logic circuit preferably outputs the flip-flop input signal so as to appear an inverse of the storage datum while the input signal set is in a predetermined state, and outputs the flip-flop input signal so as to indicate the storage datum while the input signal set is not in a predetermined state.","In the case when the at least one input signal is digital, the logic circuit preferably is composed of an inverter which receives the storage datum and outputs an inverted signal indicative of an inverse of the storage datum, and an exclusive OR gate outputting the flip-flop input signal so as to indicate an exclusive OR of the at least on input signal and the inverted signal.","In order to achieve another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor apparatus is composed of a set of n comparators responsive to 2n input signals for outputting n digital result signals, and an OR gate outputting a total result signal indicative of an OR of the n digital result signals. An i-th comparator (i being an natural number not more than n) of the n comparator is responsive to a (2i\u22121)-th input signal and a 2i-th input signal of the 2n input signals for outputting an i-th digital result signal of the n digital result signals in synchronization with a clock signal.

The address generator provides a tested memory with an address. The test pattern generator provides the test memory with a test pattern to have an access to the address, and generates an expected pattern expected to be outputted from the tested memory. The comparator compares an output pattern from the tested memory with the expected pattern to output a digital result signal in synchronization with a clock signal. The comparator inverts the digital result signal at a timing indicated by the clock signal while the output pattern coincides with the expected pattern, and does not invert the digital result signal while the output pattern does not coincide with the expected pattern.","The tested memory and the semiconductor apparatus are preferably embedded in a single semiconductor chip.","In order to achieve still another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor apparatus is composed of a plurality of test circuits and an OR gate. Each of the test circuits includes an address generator which provides a tested memory with an address, a test pattern generator which provides the test memory with a test pattern to have an access to the address, and generates an expected pattern expected to be outputted from the tested memory, and a comparator which compares an output pattern from the tested memory with the expected pattern to output a digital result signal in synchronization with a clock signal.

The AND gate outputs a total result signal indicative of an AND of the digital result signal.","In order to achieve still another aspect of the present invention, a method of operating a semiconductor apparatus is composed of:","providing an input signal set including at least one input signal;","outputting a digital result signal in response to the input signal set in synchronization with a clock signal; wherein the digital result signal is inverted at a timing indicated by the clock signal while the input signal set is in a predetermined state, and is not inverted while the input signal set is not in the predetermined state.","In order to achieve still another aspect of the present invention, a method of testing a circuit is composed of:","inputting an output pattern from the circuit to a semiconductor apparatus;","inputting an expected pattern to the semiconductor apparatus, the expected pattern being expected to be outputted from the circuit;","inputting a clock signal to the semiconductor apparatus;","outputting a digital result signal by the semiconductor apparatus in response to the output pattern and the expected pattern in synchronization with the clock signal, wherein the digital result signal is inverted at a timing indicated by the clock signal while the output pattern coincides with the expected pattern, and is not inverted while the output pattern does not coincide with the expected pattern.","A semiconductor apparatus of an embodiment according to the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.","The semiconductor apparatus in the first embodiment is a comparator constituted by semiconductor circuits. The comparator is used in a circuit for testing the semiconductor circuit, more preferably used for a BIST (Build In Self Test) circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","10","10"]},"While the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE coincide with each other, the comparator  inverts the result signal RESULT for each rise of a clock signal CLK. On the other hand, while the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE do not coincide with each other, that is, the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE disagree with each other, the comparator  does not invert the result signal RESULT even after the rise of the clock signal CLK, and keeps the result signal RESULT unchanged.","The comparator  will be described below in detail.","The comparator  includes the logic circuit  and a flip-flop . The logic circuit  includes an inverter  and an exclusive OR (XOR) gate . An input of the inverter  is connected to an output Q of the flip-flop . An output of the inverter  is connected to a first input of the XOR gate . The output pattern DOUT is inputted to a second input of the XOR gate . The expected pattern DATAE is inputted to a third input of the XOR gate . The XOR gate  outputs a signal DIN to an input D of the flip-flop .","The flip-flop  is triggered by rising edges of the clock signal CLK to latch the signal DIN. A \u201cHigh\u201d level (a power supply potential) of the signal DIN corresponds to a data \u201c1\u201d, and the \u201cLow\u201d level (a ground potential) of the signal DIN corresponds to a data \u201c0\u201d. The flip-flop  stores the digital data of \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d corresponding to the latched signal DIN.","The flip-flop  further includes a reset terminal RESTET. If a signal Reset of the \u201cHigh\u201d level is inputted to the reset terminal RESTET, the flip-flop  is reset to store the data \u201c0\u201d.","The flip-flop  outputs a signal QOUT indicative of the data stored in the flip-flop  from an output Q. The flip-flop  sets the signal QOUT at the \u201cHigh\u201d level when storing the data \u201c1\u201d, and sets the signal QOUT at the \u201cLow\u201d level when storing the data \u201c0\u201d. The output Q of the flip-flop  is connected to an output terminal .","The result signal RESULT is outputted from the output terminal . The result signal RESULT coincides with the signal QOUT outputted by the flip-flop .","The operation of the comparator  will be described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","1","2","2"]},"On the other hand, the logic circuit  outputs the signal QOUT identical to the signal DIN while the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE do not coincide with each other. The data stored in the flip-flop  is not inverted, and is kept unchanged while the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE disagree with each other. The result signal RESULT, which is identical to the signal QOUT outputted by the flip-flop , is kept unchanged.","Inversions of the result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK imply that the expected pattern DATAE and the output pattern DOUT coincide with each other.","On the other hand, if the result signal RESULT is not inverted for every rise of the clock signal CLK, it implies that the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE disagree with each other or that the comparator  has any failure. Another inspection on the basis the result signal RESULT may be needed to distinguish disagreement of the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE from the failure of the comparator .","The operation of the comparator  substantially eliminates the possibility of erroneously judging that the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE coincide with each other as the result of the failure in the comparator . The operation of inverting the result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK by the comparator  is substantially impossible when the comparator  has a failure. As for the simple semiconductor circuit such as a flip-flop, an inverter, and a basic logic gate, a signal line through which the semiconductor circuit outputs a signal is fixed to the \u201cHigh\u201d level (power supply potential), the \u201cLow\u201d level (ground level) or the high impedance state, the high impedance state implying the signal line is electrically isolated from the power supply potential and the ground level. Therefore, if the comparator  has a failure, the result signal RESULT is fixed to the \u201cHigh\u201d level, the \u201cLow\u201d level, or the high impedance state. This implies the possibility that the comparator  has a failure is substantially 0 when the comparator  carries out the operation for inverting the result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK.","As is described, the comparator  in the embodiment carries out the operation for inverting and outputting the result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK. The inversions of result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK proves that the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE coincide with each other, and also that the comparator  has no failure.","An example of the operation of the comparator  is described with reference to a timing chart shown in FIG. .","Period t<t:","A signal of the \u201cHigh\u201d level is inputted to the RESTET terminal of the flip-flop , and the flip-flop  is reset. The flip-flop  stores the data \u201c0\u201d, and the result signal RESULT becomes at the \u201cLow\u201d level.","Period t0\u2266t<t:","At the time t, the provision of the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE is started. While t\u2266t<t, the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE are both at the \u201cHigh\u201d level. In the period from the time tto the time t, the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE coincide with each other. The signal DIN inputted to the flip-flop  becomes the inverse of the signal QOUT outputted from the flip-flop . Thus, the flip-flop  inverts the signal QOUT for each rise of the clock signal CLK. The \u201cHigh\u201d level and the \u201cLow\u201d level alternately appear in the result signal RESULT, due to the inversions for each rise of the clock signal CLK.","Period t\u2266t<t:","At the time t, the output pattern DOUT is pulled down to the \u201cLow\u201d level. Then, at a time t, the clock signal CLK is pulled up to the \u201cHigh\u201d level. At the time t, the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE disagree with each other. Thus, at the time t, the signal QOUT outputted from the flip-flop  is identical to signal DIN inputted to the flip-flop . At the time t, the flip-flop  does not invert the signal QOUT, and the signal QOUT is kept unchanged even if the clock signal CLK is pulled up. The result signal RESULT is also kept unchanged. The fact that the result signal RESULT is not inverted even after the rise of the clock signal CLK suggests the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE do not coincide with each other.","After that, at a time t, the output pattern DOUT is pulled up to the \u201cHigh\u201d level. In a period from the time tto the time t, the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE coincide with each other. In the period from the time tto the time t, the result signal RESULT is also inverted for each rise of the clock signal CLK.","Period t\u2267t:","In the period t\u2267t, the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE coincide with each other. The flip-flop  outputs the signal QOUT while inverting the signal QOUT for each rise of the clock signal CLK. The result signal RESULT is also inverted for each rise of the clock signal CLK.","The result signal RESULT having the abovementioned waveform proves that the tested semiconductor circuit has a failure, while the comparator  implements a normal operation.","At first, in the period t\u2266t<t, the \u201cHigh\u201d level and the \u201cLow\u201d level alternately appears in the result signal RESULT, and the signal QOUT is inverted for each rise of the clock signal CLK. This proves that the normal operation of the comparator  is achieved. As mentioned above, the signal lines of the comparator  is fixed to the \u201cHigh\u201d level, the \u201cLow\u201d level or the high impedance state when the comparator  has a failure. When having a failure, the comparator  is substantially impossible to carry out the operation for inverting the result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK.","For example, let us suppose an output of the XOR gate  is fixed to the \u201cHigh\u201d level. In this case, the flip-flop  always latches the signal DIN of the \u201cHigh\u201d level. The flip-flop  continues to output the \u201cHigh\u201d level for the signal QOUT. The result signal RESULT is also fixed to the \u201cHigh\u201d level. Similarly, when the output of the flip-flop  or the inverter  is fixed to a certain state, this results in that the result signal RESULT is fixed to a constant state.","Moreover, there is the period in which the result signal RESULT is not inverted even after the rise of the clock signal CLK during the period t\u2266t<t. This proves the tested semiconductor circuit has a failure. The normal operation of the comparator  is determined from the result signal RESULT outputted in the period t\u2266t<t, and therefore the non-inverting result signal RESULT proves the existence of the failure in the tested semiconductor circuit.","The test result indicated by the result signal RESULT can be classified into the following three cases.","If the result signal RESULT is inverted for every rise of the clock signal CLK, it proves that the output pattern DOUT and the expected pattern DATAE perfectly coincide with each other so that both the semiconductor circuit targeted for the test and the comparator  are normally operated.","On the other hand, as shown in , if the result signal RESULT is inverted for each rise of the clock signal CLK in a certain period and not inverted even after the rise of the clock signal CLK in another period, it proves that the tested semiconductor circuit has a failure while although the comparator  is normal. If the comparator  has a failure, it can not be considered that the operation for inverting the result signal RESULT for each rise of the clock signal CLK is carried out even in the transient manner.","Also, if the result signal RESULT is not inverted at all even after the rise of the clock signal CLK, it is not possible to judge which of the tested semiconductor circuit and the comparator  has any failures. In order to determine which of the tested semiconductor circuit and the comparator  has any failures, it is necessary to judge by inspecting each of them. In the embodiment, it is only this case that requires the separate inspection with regard to the tested semiconductor circuit and the comparator , in order to determine which of the tested semiconductor circuit and the comparator  has any failures. If it is not necessary to determine which of the tested semiconductor circuit and the comparator  has any failures, it is not necessary to singly inspect the comparator .","In this way, differently from the conventional comparison analysis circuit shown in , the possibility that the signal indicative of the normal operation of the tested semiconductor circuit appears in the result signal RESULT while the tested semiconductor circuit has the failure is substantially perfectly removed in this embodiment. If the signal indicative of the normal operation of the tested semiconductor circuit appears in the result signal RESULT, it is not necessary to again inspect the comparator  and then confirm the normal operation of the comparator . In this way, the comparator  in this embodiment can test the comparator  itself while testing the semiconductor. The usage of the comparator  in the embodiment enables the semiconductor circuit to be effectively inspected. The comparator  in the embodiment having such feature is especially suitable for the usage in a BIST (Built In Self Test) circuit requiring a high reliability.","When comparator  in the embodiment is used to inspect a plurality of semiconductor circuits, the comparator  in this embodiment is provided to each of the plurality of semiconductor circuits. If the plurality of comparators  are provided, it is possible to integrate the result signals outputted by the comparators  into a single signal, and effectively inspect the plurality of semiconductor circuits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["10","20","20","21","20","20","21","22","22","20","20","21","22","22"],"i":["a","b ","a","b ","a ","b","a","b","a ","b "]},"The BIST circuit tests the DRAM , and outputs a result signal RESULT_A indicative of the test result.

The detailed explanation of the BIST circuit is not done.","In succession, the process for inspecting the DRAM and the SRAM by using the BIST circuits , shown in  is described.","At first, an operation test of the BIST circuit is carried out (Step S).

After that, the data of the memory cell selected in accordance with the address signal ADD_A is read, and the read data is outputted to the comparator as an output pattern DOUT_A. Moreover, an expected pattern DATAE_A is generated and outputted to the comparator . The comparator compares the output pattern DOUTA with the expected pattern DATAE_A, and a result signal RESULT_A is generated.
