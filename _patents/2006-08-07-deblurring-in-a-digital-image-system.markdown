processing and in particular discloses A Camera System Having Motion Deblurring Means.","Further the present invention relates to the field of digital image cameras and in particular discloses a camera system having motion blur compensating means.","Motion blur in the taking of images is a common significant problem. The motion blur normally occurs as a result of movement of the camera while taking the picture or otherwise as a result of movement of objects within an image.","As a result of motion blur, it is often the case that the image taken is non optimal.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a camera system having the ability to overcome the effects of motion blur.","In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a camera system for outputting deblurred images, said system comprising;\n\n","Preferably, the camera system is connected to a printer means for immediate output of said deblurred image and is a portable handheld unit. The velocity detection means can comprise an accelerometer such as a micro-electro mechanical (MEMS) device.","As described in Australian Provisional Patent Application No. PO7991, the camera system incorporates an Artcard linear sensor  which converts the Artcard data image to electrical signals, which are communicated to the ACP. The linear image sensor is illustrated in , which is a reproduction of  of Australian Provisional Patent Application No. PO7991. The linear image sensor can be fabricated using either CCD or APS CMOS technology. The active length of the linear image sensor is 50 mm, equal to the width of the data array on the Artcard. To satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, the resolution of the linear image sensor must be at least twice the highest spatial frequency of the Artcard optical image reaching the linear image sensor. In practice, data detection is easier if the linear image sensor resolution is substantially above this. A resolution of 4800 dpi (189 dpmm) is chosen, giving a total of 9,450 pixels. This resolution requires a pixel sensor pitch of 5.3 [mu]m. This can readily be achieved by using four staggered rows of 20 [mu]m pixel sensors.","The linear image sensor is mounted in a special package which includes an LED to illuminate the Artcard via a light-pipe.","The Artcard reader light-pipe can be a molded light-pipe which has several functions:","1. It diffuses the light from the LED over the width of the card using total internal reflection facets.","2. It focuses the light onto a 16 [mu]m wide strip of the Artcard using an integrated cylindrical lens.","3. It focuses light reflected from the Artcard onto the linear image sensor pixels using a molded array of microlenses.","The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in Australian Provisional Patent Application No. PO7991 filed 15 Jul., 1997 entitled \u201cImage Processing Method and Apparatus (ART01)\u201d, in addition to Australian Provisional Patent Application entitled \u201cImage Processing Method and Apparatus (ART01a)\u201d filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant, the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference.","The aforementioned patent specifications disclose a camera system, hereinafter known as an \u201cArtcam\u201d type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an internal Artcam portable camera unit. Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as \u201cArtcards\u201d. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.","In the preferred embodiment, the Artcam device is modified so as to include a two dimensional motion sensor. The motion sensor can comprise a small micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) device or other suitable device able to detect motion in two axes. The motion sensor can be mounted on the camera device and its output monitored by the Artcam central processor device which is disclosed in the afore-mentioned patent specifications.","Turning now to , there is illustrated a schematic of the preferred arrangement of the preferred embodiment. The accelerometer  outputs to the Artcard processor  which also receives the blurred sensed image from the CCD device. The Artcard processor  utilises the accelerometer readings so as to determine a likely angular velocity of the camera when the picture was taken.  This velocity factor is then utilised by a suitably programmed Artcard processor  to apply a deblurring function to the blurred sensed image  thereby outputting a deblurred output image . The programming of the Artcard processor  so as to perform the deblurring can utilise standard algorithms known to those skilled in the art of computer programming and digital image restoration. For example, reference is made to the \u201cSelected Papers on Digital Image Restoration\u201d, M. Ibrahim Sezan, Editor, SPIE Milestone series, volume 74, and in particular the reprinted paper at pages 167-175 thereof. Further, simplified techniques are shown in the \u201cImage Processing Handbook\u201d, second edition, by John C. Russ, published by CRC Press at pages 336-341 thereof.","It would be therefore obvious to the person skilled in the art that many different techniques for motion blur removal can be utilised in the preferred embodiment. Additionally, other forms of motion sensors may be provided. Once the input image has been deblurred, the image is then able to be printed out by the Artcam device in accordance with the techniques as discussed in the afore-mentioned patent specification.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric inkjet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the inkjet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table under the heading \u201cCross References to Related Applications\u201d.","The inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems.","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the printhead is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the printhead is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the inkjet type. The smallest printhead designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The printheads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the printhead by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The printhead is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Inkjets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual inkjet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of inkjet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of inkjet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable inkjet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain inkjet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which match the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","Other inkjet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into inkjet printheads with characteristics superior to any currently available inkjet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, print technology may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"406pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Actuator",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Mechanism","Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Thermal","An electrothermal","Large force generated","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","heater heats the ink to","Simple construction","Ink carrier limited to","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"above boiling point,","No moving parts","water","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring","Fast operation","Low efficiency","Xerox heater-in-pit"]},{"entry":[{},"significant heat to the","Small chip area required","High temperatures","1990 Hawkins et al"]},{"entry":[{},"aqueous ink.
