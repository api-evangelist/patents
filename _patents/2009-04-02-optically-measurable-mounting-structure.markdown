{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made under U.S. Government Contract N00024-03-C-6111 awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The application is in the field of mounting structures, and more particularly to an optically measurable mounting structure.","Any object in three-dimensional space can be defined by six independent coordinates (also referred to as six degrees of freedom), i.e., three translational coordinates (x, y, z) and three rotational coordinates (roll, pitch, yaw). An object can be mounted to another object with a semi-kinematic mount, which allows an object to be located according the six degrees of freedom. A semi-kinematic mount includes finite areas of contact or mounting pads between the objects.","Errors or defects in the flatness of the mounting pads and the coplanarity of the mounting pads relative to one another may cause deviations in the final position of the mounted object or may distort the shape of the mounted object. For example, flatness or coplanarity errors in the mounting areas may cause the mounted element to be tilted or otherwise misaligned when it is mounted to the housing. Furthermore, the mounted element may be secured with a mechanical fastener or restraint, and loads or torque from the mechanical fastener or restraint may affect the final position and optical figure of the mounted element.","Improvements over such semi-kinematic mounts would generally be desirable.","Prior art mounting elements, such as the element  depicted in , typically include three separate mounting pads , , . The surface of the mounting pads , ,  and the position of the pads , ,  relative to one another typically must be measured mechanically, which generally limits the tolerances to which the mounts can be manufactured. For example, mechanically measurable tolerances may limit the ability of a manufacturer to accurately and precisely measure the axial position and planarity of the pads relative to one another. Furthermore, attempts to increase tolerances beyond those that can be mechanically measured may lead to high mounting distortions and errors.","To overcome at least some of the drawbacks of other mounts, a mount with an optically measurable mounting surface is described below. The mounting surface of each element in the mount includes a plurality of mounting pads linked by a connecting surface. The mounting pads and connecting surface have a smooth surface. For example, the surface may have an optical finish that can be analyzed with an optical inspection system, such as an interferometer. The connecting surface and mounting pads may be a highly reflective or mirror-like surface. The axial position and coplanarity of the mounting pads relative to one another can therefore be measured very accurately, and the tolerances to which the mounts can be manufactured can be tightened over mechanically measurable tolerances.","According to an aspect of the invention, an optical mount includes an optical element that includes an optical element mount that includes plural optical element mounting pads and an optical element connecting surface that links the optical element mounting pads together, a housing that includes a housing mount that includes plural housing mounting pads and a housing connecting surface that links the mounting pads together, wherein the optical element mount is in contact with the housing mount and the contact between the optical element mount and the housing mount only occurs at the mounting pads.","According to another aspect of the invention, a mount includes a mounting element that includes a plurality of mounting element mounting pads connected by a mounting element connecting surface, wherein the mounting element connecting surface and the plurality of mounting element mounting pads form a substantially continuous surface, and a housing element that includes a plurality of housing element mounting pads connected by a housing element connecting surface, wherein the housing connecting element surface and the plurality of housing element mounting pads form a substantially continuous surface, wherein the mounting element mounting pads are in contact with the housing element mounting pads, and the mounting element connecting surface is spaced from the housing element connecting surface.","According to another aspect of the invention, a semi-kinematic mount includes a housing having a substantially planar housing mount that includes a number of housing mounting pads and an optical element having a substantially planar mounting surface that includes a number of optical element mounting pads, wherein the housing mounting pads and the optical element mounting pads are in contact with one another when the optical element is mounted to the housing.","The foregoing and other features of the invention are hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims, the following description and the annexed drawings setting forth in detail several illustrative embodiments of the invention, such being indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed.","The mounts described herein include a plurality of mounting pads connected or linked to one another by a connecting surface. The mounting pads and connecting surface form a continuous surface from which the planarity and the axial position of the mounting pads relative to one another can be measured optically. Accordingly, the mount can be manufactured to tighter tolerances than mounts that are limited by mechanically measured tolerances.","Referring initially to , an exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of the mount  is shown. The mount  includes a first element  and a second element . For clarity, the following description primarily refers to the first element  as an optical element and the second element  as a housing or housing element. It should be appreciated that these terms are not intended to be limiting, and that the first element  and the second element  are representative of any two objects that can be mounted together. For example, the concepts described herein may be applied to any reflective or catadioptric opto-mechanical system where one mirror is mounted to another mirror. The concepts also are applicable to optical and non-optical systems and accordingly may be used to mount any two objects together. For example the concepts described herein may be used for astronomical telescopes, telephoto camera lenses, spotting scopes, monolithography projection optics, microscope objectives, or molded plastics, etc.","With additional reference to , the optical element  is shown in more detail. The optical element  has an optical element mount  that includes plural optical mounting pads  that are linked or connected together with a connecting surface . The mounting pads  and the connecting surface  form a continuous (or monolithic) surface, as indicated by the hatched portion of . The surface of the optical element mount  is substantially planar or smooth such that the surface of the optical element mount  can be characterized or inspected by an optical inspection system, such as an interferometer.","In the embodiment of , the optical element connecting surface  is an annular surface or annulus. The optical element mounting pads  are axisymmetrically spaced around the annulus and extend radially outward from the annulus. The optical element  also may include a hole  through which light may pass or be reflected. A mirror, lens, or other object may be integrated with or mounted on the optical element as described in more detail below.","The housing element  is shown in more detail in . The housing element  has a housing mount  that includes a plurality of housing mounting pads  and a connecting surface  that links or connects the housing mounting pads  together. Similar to the optical mount , the mounting pads  and the connecting surface  on the housing  form a continuous (or monolithic) surface, as indicated by the hatched portion of . The surface of the housing mount  also is substantially planar such that the surface of the housing mount  can be optically inspected.","As shown in , the housing connecting surface  is an annular surface, such as an annulus, and the housing mounting pads  are axisymmetrically spaced around the connecting surface . The housing mounting pads  extend radially inward from the housing connecting surface .","The optical element mounting pads  and the housing element mounting pads  are spaced the same distance from one another such that the mounting pads ,  on each element ,  are aligned with one another when the optical element  is mounted to the housing . In the embodiment of , the optical element  and the housing  each include three mounting pads, however, it will be appreciated that one or both of the optical element  and the housing  may include more than three mounting pads. For example, if high dynamic stresses are expected, it may be desirable to include four or more planar mounting pads, which must be substantially planar with one another to avoid imparting large mounting distortions into the optics. Thus, when contact stresses between the mounting pads become unacceptable for the application due to the environment in which the mount is used, it may be necessary to increase the contact area between mounting pads of the optical element and housing, by either adding additional mounting pads or by increasing the area of the three pads in order to distribute the loads over a larger area and reduce the stress.","In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting pads ,  are axisymmetrically spaced from one another about each of the annuli, e.g., a mounting pad is located every 120 degrees. Although the mounting pads are illustrated as being axisymmetric, it will be appreciated that the mounting pads on the housing may be spaced in any non-linear configuration, including a non-axisymmetric orientation. For example, the mount pads may be non-symmetric, for example, located at 100\u00b0, 110\u00b0, and 150\u00b0, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["20","22","24","22","24","50","28","42","50","22","24"]},"As shown in , the optical element connecting surface  is spaced or separated from the housing connecting surface  to avoid a ring contact or ring engagement between the optical element  and the housing . In the embodiment of , the connecting surface  of the optical element mount  is radially inward of the connecting surface  of the housing mount .","It will be appreciated that the configuration of the mounting pads and the connecting surfaces may be varied or changed from the illustrated embodiment. For example, the optical element mounting pads  may extend radially inward from the connecting surface  on the optical element , and the housing mounting pads  may extend radially outward from the connecting surface  on the housing . The areas  of contact between the optical element  and the housing , however, would be the same, e.g., the optical element mount  and the housing mount  would only be in contact with one another at the mounting pads , .","As mentioned above, the surfaces of the mounts ,  are smooth surfaces, which may be optically smooth surfaces, highly reflective surfaces or mirror-like surfaces, etc., which are sufficiently smooth to be measured or inspected with an optical inspection system. For example, the surfaces of the mounts ,  can be polished or finished with single point diamond turning (SDPT). It will be appreciated that other types of finishing may be used, such as fly-cut, lapped, etc. to form a surface with sufficient reflectivity and surface error\/slope to be measurable with an interferometer. Such finishes are commonly referred to as \u201coptical finishes\u201d as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art.","As will be appreciated, the entire surface of the mounts ,  can be fully characterized with an interferometer to allow for tighter controls and tolerances for the fabrication of the mounting surfaces. Furthermore, many or all of the surface errors can be identified by optical inspection and the surfaces can be further polished, ground, lapped or otherwise modified to meet the desired tolerance. It also will be appreciated that optical measurements are significantly faster than mechanical measurements. Additionally, optical measurements are made without contacting the mounting surfaces, and therefore softer materials, such as aluminum, are not scratched or damaged as they may be by mechanical measurement systems.","It will be appreciated that although the surfaces of the mounts ,  are optically measurable, the surfaces still may be inspected or measured by mechanical measurement systems, for example, by a coordinate measuring machine (CMM), air bearing, or other mechanical systems. Mechanical measurement systems, however, are generally less accurate than optical or interferometric measurement systems. Thus, if the manufacturing tolerances meet or exceed those tolerances that can be accurately measured with a mechanical system, an optical system may be used.","Some characteristics of mounting systems that have separate mounting pads, for example, the separate mounting pads , ,  of the element  of , cannot be inspected accurately with an optical inspection system. For example, while individual pads may be measured for tip\/tilt, the relative axial position (i.e., piston or coplanarity) between the pads cannot be measured optically using an interferometer due to the separation or discontinuity between the mounting pads , , . As will be appreciated, an interferometer measures the height of one point on a surface relative to the height of an adjacent point on the surface rather than the absolute height of each point on the surface. Thus, while the interferometer may be used to accurately characterize the surface of each individual pad, the characterized surface cannot be related accurately to a non-connected surface.","As described above, the connecting surfaces ,  between the mounting pads are continuous surfaces that link the mounting pads ,  of each respective mount , . Thus, the mounting pads ,  on each mount ,  are parts of a single, continuous surface. The connecting surfaces , , therefore, facilitate the optical inspection of the mounting pads ,  by providing a frame of reference between the respective mounting pads ,  so that the planarity of the mounting pads ,  relative to one another can be determined precisely and accurately.","By determining the coplanarity of the mounting pads ,  with a high degree of accuracy and precision, the resulting position of the mounted optical element  can be determined, e.g., it can be determined whether the optical element  will be tilted or misaligned when mounted on the housing . The mounting pads ,  on the respective elements ,  can then be machined or otherwise modified to adjust the relative heights of the mounting pads ,  to make them coplanar with one another and\/or to achieve the desired position of the optical element  relative to the housing .","The optically measurable tolerances of the mounting pads can be increased over the prior art. For example, the mounting pads may be manufactured with a 50% tighter coplanarity tolerance than a traditional three-pad mount (). For example, if a traditional three-pad mount has a mechanically measureable coplanarity tolerance of 0.000050 inches, the mount having mounting pads connected with a continuous connecting surface may have a tolerance of 0.000025 inches. As will be appreciated, these tolerances are only exemplary in nature. It will be appreciated that different interferometers may have tighter or looser tolerances than those described in the exemplary embodiments herein.","Another embodiment of an optical element  and housing  is illustrated in . Similar to the optical element  of , the optical element  has a mount  that includes plural optical element mounting pads  that are linked or connected together with an optical element connecting surface . The optical element mounting pads  and the optical element connecting surface  form a continuous surface that links the optical element mounting pads  to one another. In the embodiment of , the connecting surface  is an open-end shape that is generally in the shape of a \u201cC.\u201d As will be appreciated, other shaped connecting surfaces may be used to connect the mounting pads  with a continuous surface. As described above, the surface of the optical mount  is sufficiently smooth so that it can be optically inspected.","Similarly, the housing  includes a housing mount  that includes plural housing element mounting pads  connected or linked together with a housing element connecting surface . The housing connecting surface  also is an open-end shape that is generally in the shape of a \u201cC.\u201d The housing mounting pads  and the housing connecting surface  form a continuous surface that can be optically inspected with an interferometer.","As described above, when mounted to one another, the mounting pads ,  of each element ,  are only in contact with one another at the mounting pads , . The connecting surfaces ,  are spaced from one another. In the embodiment of , the optical element connecting surface  is radially inward of the housing connecting surface . As will be appreciated the optical element  and the housing  may be aligned such that the open-end portions of the connecting surfaces , are aligned or such that the open-end portions are offset from one another.","Another embodiment of an optical element  and the housing element  are shown in . In this embodiment, the optical element  has an optical element mounting surface , which includes several optical element mounting pads  and an open-end optical element connecting surface . As described above, the optical element mount  is a smooth, continuous surface. Similarly, the housing element includes a housing element mount , which includes several housing element mounting pads  connected together with an open housing element connecting surface .","As shown in , the optical element  and housing element  are mounted together such that only the mounting pads ,  are in contact with one another. The optical element mounting pads  and the housing element mounting pads  are in contact with one another at contact areas , while the optical element connecting surface  and the housing element connecting surface  are spaced from one another.","It will be appreciated that the connecting surfaces between the mounting pads may have a shape other than those shapes described above. For example, the connecting surfaces may be oval, triangular, rectangular, polygonal or a combination of different shapes. The mounting pads may extend from the connecting surface in any desired configuration such that the connection between the elements is limited to the areas of contact between the mounting pads. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that more than three mounting pads may be included on one or both of the optical element and housing element.","An exploded view of an embodiment  of two optical elements ,  mounted to a housing  is shown in .","The first optical element  includes a first optical element mount  that has three mounting pads  connected or linked by a first optical element connecting surface . As described above, the first optical element mounting pads  and the first optical element connecting surface  form a continuous and substantially planar surface for mounting the first optical element  to the housing . The first optical element mount  is located generally on the periphery of the first optical element  rather than in around a center portion of the optical element  shown in  and described above.","The second optical element  is substantially similar to the optical element  described above with respect to . The second optical element  includes a second optical element mount  that includes three second optical element mounting pads  that are linked together by a second optical element connecting surface .","The housing  is shown in more detail in . The housing  includes a first housing mount  and a second housing mount . The first housing mount  includes a set of three first housing mount mounting pads  connected by a connecting surface . The second housing mount  includes a set of three second housing mount mounting pads  connected by a connecting surface . The first housing mount  and the second housing mount  each have a continuous and substantially planar surface that is optically measurable, as described above.","The first optical element  is mounted to the housing  at the mounting pads ,  of each respective mount , . Similarly, the second optical element  is mounted to the housing  at the mounting pads ,  of each respective mount , . As described above, the connecting surfaces the mounts between the optical elements ,  and the housing  are radially separated from one another such that only the mounting pads of the respective mounts are in contact.","Referring to , an exploded view of the embodiment of  is shown from a different perspective. As shown in , the first optical element  may include a concave optical element, such as a concave mirror or lens. Similarly, the second optical element  may be a mirror, lens or other optical element. As shown in , the first optical element  may include another mounting surface  for mounting the optical element  to another element in the system.","The mounts on the optical elements , and the housing  also may include holes through which a mechanical restraint or fastener may be inserted to secure the optical elements , to the housing . The first optical element  includes a hole  through each mounting pad  on the first optical element mount . Similarly, the second optical element  includes a hole  through each mounting pad  in the second optical element mount . The housing  includes holes  through the mounting pads  in the first housing mount  and holes  through the mounting pads  in the second housing mount .","When the first optical element  is mounted to the housing , the holes  in the first optical element mount  align with the holes  in the first housing mount . Similarly, the holes  in the second optical element mount  align with the holes  in the second housing mount . At least some of the holes may be threaded, and a mechanical fastener or restraint, such as a screw or bolt, can be inserted through the holes to secure the optical elements ,  to the housing  in any desired position. It will be appreciated that although illustrated as holes, the elements may be connected in any conventional means, for example, by bonding them together, clamping them together, etc., as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art.","As described above, the connecting surface of each element , ,  form a continuous surface with the mounting pads of each mount. The continuous surface is optically measurable and therefore, the mounts can be manufactured with tighter tolerances than mounts that are limited to mechanically measurable tolerances.","Referring to , an exploded view of an embodiment of a mount  between a primary mirror  and a secondary mirror  is shown.","The primary mirror  is shown in more detail in . The primary mirror may be the same as element , as described above with respect to . The primary mirror  includes a primary mirror mount . The primary mirror mount  has a set of three axisymmetric primary mirror mounting pads  that are linked by a connecting surface . Each primary mirror mounting pad  includes a hole , which may be threaded and which may be used to mount the primary mirror  to the secondary mirror support . As described above, the primary mirror mounting pads  and the connecting surface  form a continuous and substantially planar surface that is optically measurable.","Referring to , the secondary mirror support  includes a support mount  with a set of three axisymmetric mounting pads  linked by a connecting surface . The mounting pads  and connecting surface  form a continuous and substantially planar surface that is optically measurable. Each mounting pad  includes a hole  through which a bolt or other restraint may be inserted to mount the secondary mirror support  to the primary mirror mount .","With additional reference to , a side view of the mount of  is shown. The primary mirror  and the secondary mirror  are mounted at the primary mirror mount  and the secondary mirror mount  such that only the mounting pads ,  of the respective mounts ,  are in contact with one another and the connecting surfaces ,  are spaced from one another. Thus, as shown at  in , the primary mirror mounting pads  are in contact with the support mounting pads . There is a space, indicated generally by space , between primary mirror connecting surface  and the support connecting surface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIGS. 11 and 12"],"b":["226","226","202","226","204","202","204","226","228","202","228","226"]},"A mount according to the aspects described herein allows for the manufacture of mounts that can be manufactured at tighter tolerances than mechanically measured mounts.
