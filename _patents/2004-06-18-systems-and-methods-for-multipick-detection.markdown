{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods for detecting multiple sheets of media that are picked up and fed by a media feed mechanism.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional media feed mechanisms, such as those found in image reproduction devices, for example, printers, copiers, and facsimile machines, typically are used for transporting sheets of media such as, for example, paper, card stock, envelopes, transparencies, labels, or any other media (hereinafter \u201csheets\u201d). These types of media feed mechanisms pick up one sheet from a media cassette or other media storage device and feed that sheet to an image reproduction portion of the image reproduction device and then to a media output portion of the media reproduction device.","Occasionally, the media feed system will pick up multiple sheets at substantially the same time (hereinafter a \u201cmulti-pick\u201d), rather than the desired single sheet, and transport the multiple picked up sheets to the image reproduction portion. One sheet of the multiple sheets is usually ahead of the other sheet(s) by, for example, a few to many millimeters. The trailing picked up sheet(s) can cause damage to the image reproduction device and particularly the image reproduction portion if it wraps around, for example, a print drum or fuser roller and\/or contacts a print head.","Conventional image reproduction devices attempted to prevent multi-picks by using stripper blades or fingers. Typically, stripper blades are used to strip the (normally single) sheet of media off of, for example, an imaging drum, and\/or fuser roller at the exit side of the nip. If a multi-pick occurs, and the trailing picked up sheet is on the side of the stripper blade, then the stripper blade may remain down long enough to strip only the lead sheet, allowing the trailing sheet to wrap around the drum or roller underneath the stripper blade. Alternatively, when a stripper blade or finger remains in contact with a sheet long enough to prevent a multi-pick, i.e. to strip the lead sheet and trailing picked up sheet, the stripper blade or finger is likely to become contaminated with ink. The ink which has contaminated the stripper blade or finger can thus be re-deposited on a subsequent sheet and thereby degrade print quality.","In light of the above described problems, methods have been proposed in which a dedicated detection device usable to detect a plurality of sheets within a media feed mechanism, such as a reflective optical sensor, is included as part of the media feed mechanism and\/or image reproduction device in order to optically detect a multi-pick and interrupt the media feed mechanism before the multi-picked sheets can cause damage. However, the inclusion of a separate dedicated multi-pick detection device would substantially increase the production and maintenance costs of the media feed mechanisms and\/or image reproduction devices. Furthermore, optical detection devices, such as reflective optical sensors, are substantially incapable of detecting transparent media, such as transparencies for use with overhead projectors or document overlays.","Therefore, various exemplary embodiments of this invention detect a multi-pick without having to utilize a scraper or finger in a manner that will likely degrade image quality. Furthermore, various exemplary embodiments of the invention detect a multi-pick without the use of devices or systems dedicated solely to the detection of multi-picks that would render the resulting media feed mechanism and\/or image reproduction device cost prohibitive with respect to production and\/or maintenance.","Various exemplary embodiments of the invention thus monitor various kinetic properties of existing hardware within a media feed mechanism, on the assumption that a multi-pick will affect the physical motion of one or more portions of the existing hardware within the media feed mechanism. The term \u201ckinetic\u201d as used herein is defined as \u201cof, relating to, or produced by motion.\u201d Various kinetic properties may include, for example, torque, acceleration, speed, displacement, distance, and\/or the force or energy required to produce the torque, acceleration, speed, displacement, and\/or distance.","Accordingly, various exemplary embodiments of this invention provide a method for detecting a multi-pick in a nip of a media feed mechanism, including determining a limit of a property of a media feed mechanism that is related to the kinetic properties of one or more rollers that form a nip; monitoring the property of the media feed mechanism; determining a maximum value of the monitored property; comparing the maximum value to the limit; and determining, if the maximum value exceeds the limit, that a multi-pick has occurred.","Various exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a system for detecting a multi-pick including a data sampling circuit, routine, or application that accesses a data stream containing values representing kinetic properties of one or more rollers that form a nip and outputs sampled values that are sampled from the data stream at a predetermined sampling rate, and a data analyzing circuit, routine, or application that accesses the sampled values, analyzes the sampled values, and predicts whether a multi-pick has occurred.","For a general understanding of an image reproduction device, such as, for example, an electrophotographic printer, a solid ink printer, an ink-jet printer, a facsimile machine, or a copying machine, in which the features of this invention may be incorporated, reference is made to .  shows a schematic of the various key components of an exemplary image reproduction device.  show various features of the image reproduction device in more detail. Although the various exemplary embodiments of this invention for detecting a multi-pick are particularly well adapted for use in such a machine, it should be appreciated that the following exemplary embodiments are merely illustrative. Rather, aspects of various exemplary embodiments of this invention may be achieved in any media feed mechanism and\/or image reproduction device containing at least one nip region for transporting media that may be subject to a multi-pick formed by a plurality of rollers or by at least one roller and a surface.","As shown in , the image reproduction device  includes a controller , an ink loader , a print head , an image drum , an image drum motor (not shown), a transfer roller , a transfer roller loading mechanism , a media preheater , a deskew nip , a pick roller , a media exit nip , a main media tray , a media output tray , a multi-purpose media tray , a pick roller , and a pad . According to the exemplary image reproduction device  shown in , a sheet stored in the main media tray  is picked by the pick roller , transported via an entrance path , deskewed by the deskew nip , and preheated by the media preheater . Then, the sheet enters the transfer nip  (see ) formed by the transfer roller  and the image drum  where marking material is transferred onto the media by the image drum . Next, the sheet is transported via an exit path , through the media exit nip  into the media output tray .","If an image is to be marked on both sides of the sheet, the sheet does not entirely exit the media exit nip , but is pulled back by the media exit nip  and transported via the duplex media path  to re-enter the deskew nip  such that the non-marked surface of the sheet will face the image drum .","When sheets of media within the main media tray  are used, a pick roller  picks up a sheet by \u201crolling\u201d it off the top of a stack of sheets in the main media tray . The stack of sheets are pressed against the pick roller , by a spring or pad (not shown) within the main media tray  or some other device. The pick roller  is then rotated while in contact with the top sheet. The frictional force between the pick roller  and the top sheet causes the top sheet to be drawn off of the stack of sheets and transported by the rotation of the pick roller .","A sheet may also enter the deskew nip  from the multi-purpose media tray , shown in . Typically, a sheet or sheets are placed in the multi-purpose tray . The sheet or sheets are pressed against a pick roller , by a pad , spring, or similar device. The pick roller  picks up a sheet by \u201crolling\u201d it off the top of the multi-purpose media tray  or off the top of the stack of sheets in the multi-purpose media tray . The pick roller  is then rotated while in contact with the top sheet. The frictional force between the pick roller  and the top sheet causes the top sheet to be drawn off of the stack of sheets, or the tray , and transported along the entrance path  to the deskew nip  by the rotation of the pick roller .","As discussed above, in a conventional image reproduction device it is conceivable that a plurality of sheets will be picked up by the pick roller ,  and be transported via the entrance path  to the deskew nip . A multi-pick is usually the result of an attractive force, such as friction or static electricity, causing a second sheet directly below the top sheet in the media tray ,  to be forcibly coupled to the top sheet. When the top sheet is drawn off of the stack of sheets, the attractive force between the top sheet and the second sheet causes the second sheet to be drawn off of the stack of media as well. By virtue of the, for example, slippage between the top sheet and the second sheet due to the relative strength of the frictional or static connection between the top sheet and the second sheet, the leading edge of the second sheet is typically a distance behind the leading edge of the top picked sheet along the media entrance path . It should be appreciated that additional sheets may be picked up as well due to an attractive force between the additional picked up sheets and a sheet directly above each additional picked up sheet.","As a result of the multi-pick, the picked up sheets travel through the deskew nip  (only the first sheet being deskewed because its leading edge is ahead of the remaining sheets) and enter the transfer nip . When the sheets were picked up from the main media tray , the picked up top sheet, is on the drum  side of the other sheets by virtue of the curve in the entrance path . When the sheets were picked up from the multi-purpose media tray , the picked up top sheet, is on the transfer roller  side of the other sheets.","In either case, the picked up top sheet enters the transfer nip  first, and continues along the exit path  towards the output tray. Usually, one or more of the remaining sheets, by virtue of trailing the picked sheet, are not properly directed towards the exit path , and get stuck within the media feed mechanism causing what is commonly referred to as a \u201cjam.\u201d","When the plurality of sheets were multi-picked from the multi-purpose tray, this type of jam can be particularly problematic since the trailing sheet(s) can adhere to, or otherwise follow the image drum  and wrap around the image drum . The one or more sheets that wrap around the image drum  can contact the print head  causing damage to the print head .","Accordingly, various exemplary embodiments of this invention detect a multi-pick and interrupt the transportation of media shortly after the multi-picked sheets enter the transfer nip . Therefore, the transportation of the multi-picked sheets is interrupted before a jam occurs and\/or the print head  or any other part of the image reproduction device  can be damaged.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["140","270"]},"In this exemplary embodiment, the torque required to drive the drum  is determined by feedback provided by the drum motor (not shown). This is because, according to this exemplary embodiment, the drum , that forms part of the transfer nip  is driven by a servomotor. Typically, media feed mechanisms utilize servomotors in the vicinity of the drum . Servomotors allow a controller, for example, controller , to maintain a substantially constant velocity of a sheet through the portion of the media feed mechanism driven by the servomotor. If a substantially constant velocity is not maintained near the drum , image defects may result.","The drum servomotor is controlled by a feedback loop. The servomotor provides data (feedback) to the controller  that is related to the actual motion of the motor. Based on this feedback, the controller is able to make corrections to the servomotor to, for example, maintain a substantially constant velocity of the drum. The feedback data provided by the servomotor is typically expressed as, or converted to an increase or decrease relative to a target value. The data may include for example a rotational position of the servomotor, a velocity of the servomotor, a current required to drive the servomotor, or any other kinetic property of the servomotor (each useable to calculate torque). The data provided by the digital feedback loop thus provides a controller of the servomotor, for example, controller , with data that may be used to determine the torque required to drive the drum .","When a second sheet, due to a multi-pick, enters the transfer nip , that second sheet increases the torque required to drive the drum  because the transfer roller  and\/or drum  must now pass two sheets through the transfer nip. The additional thickness of the second sheet that must pass through the transfer nip  causes the transfer nip  to open (causes the transfer roller  to move away from the drum ) by a distance roughly equal to the thickness of the second sheet. Opening the transfer nip  against the spring force trying to keep it closed requires energy, which comes from additional torque. Depending on the type of digital feedback loop controlling the drum servo motor, data representing the increased torque is fed back to the controller , or data that may be used to calculate the increased torque (for example, displacement, following error, velocity, and\/or electrical current used) is fed back to the controller .","As shown in , operation of the method begins in step S. Then in step S, a sampling delay distance is set. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the sampling delay distance is a distance that a sheet will travel through the transfer nip  (i.e., a certain rotational distance of the drum ) before following error sampling begins. The sampling delay distance skips over or ignores any spikes in the following error that might occur as the motion of the drum  and transfer roller  starts. For instance, a spike in the following error may be caused by the transfer roller  and\/or media becoming temporarily deformed when the transfer roller loading mechanism  is loaded, or by an initial seam at the leading edge of an envelope or label.","In various exemplary embodiments, the sampling delay distance is set at around 10 mm. However, in various other exemplary embodiments the sampling delay distance may be increased or decreased as necessary to more accurately predict a multi-pick depending on for example, the type of media, the size of the media, whether the media has seams, and\/or the location of seams on the media.","It should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments, a stripper blade or finger  (see ) may be kept down until the sampling delay distance passes in order to strip any multi-picks that might otherwise enter the nip while the sampling delay distance passes. However, the sampling delay distance is typically short enough that no marking material will contaminate the stripper blade or finger.","Then, in step S, a threshold value is set. According to this embodiment, the threshold value is a maximum allowable increase over a baseline amount of a data value related to torque provided by the feedback loop. As discussed below, if the threshold value is exceeded, it is determined that a multi-pick has occurred. According to various exemplary embodiments, the threshold value is related to the expected marking material thickness to be deposited on the sheet. For instance, when it is necessary for an image reproduction device to lay down thicker marking material layers, such as marking on a transparency, a larger threshold value would be set than when it is necessary to lay down thinner marking material layers. This is because the thicker marking material layers will require a larger torque on the drum  to allow the transfer roller  and\/or drum  to pass the marked portions of the sheet through the transfer nip . A higher threshold value will decrease the likelihood that an increase in torque that is the result of marking material thickness will be considered a multi-pick, while a lower threshold value will decrease the likelihood that a multi-pick will be ignored as an increase in torque caused by the marking material.","Therefore, in various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the threshold value, may be adjusted according to predicted marking material thickness based on, for example, media type and\/or marking settings. Alternatively, according to various other exemplary embodiments, the actual marking material thickness may be determined by, for example, an optical sensor, or marking material output sensor, or preferably by examining the image data (pixels per unit area) as (or before or after) the image is deposited on the drum , since this method requires substantially no additional components or cost.","In step S, a sample buffer array is allocated long enough to hold samples of the data related to torque provided by the feedback loop of the drum servomotor for a predetermined distance of a sheet that will be transported through the transfer nip . In various exemplary embodiments, the array size is calculated based on this predetermined distance, the speed with which the sheet will travel through the transfer nip , and a sample rate according to the following relationship:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"A","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["D","R"],"mo":"\u00d7"},"mi":"S"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In step S, a determination is made whether the motion of the drum  has started. If the drum  has started, operation continues to step S. If the drum  has not started, operation returns to step S (i.e., the drum  is monitored for startup). In step S, the sampling delay distance worth of drum  rotation is allowed to pass. Operation continues to step S.","In step S, the data provided by the feedback loop is read and stored in the buffer array. As discussed above, in various other exemplary embodiments, any other kinetic property of the transfer roller , the drum , the nip , and\/or the drum servomotor that is effected by a multi-pick may be read and stored in the buffer array. For instance, in various other exemplary embodiments, the drum motor current may be provided by the feedback loop or otherwise monitored and stored in the buffer array. Because the increase in torque necessary to pass a multi-pick through the transfer nip  must be supplied by the motor, the motor will draw additional current in order to supply the increased torque. Additionally, a displacement of the transfer roller  with respect to the drum  may be monitored. As additional picked up sheets pass through the nip, the transfer roller  will be displaced away form the drum .","Next, in step S, a determination is made whether the buffer is full. If the buffer is full, according to various exemplary embodiments, there is ample data stored in the buffer to begin to determine whether a multi-pick has occurred and operation continues to step S. If the buffer is not full, operation returns to step S.","In step S, a determination is made whether the end of the sheet is approaching the transfer nip. In order to determine whether the end of the sheet is approaching the transfer nip , various exemplary embodiments of the invention include a media sensor (not shown) that is placed a predetermined distance upstream of the transfer nip and that detects the presence of media. When the trailing edge of a sheet passes the media sensor, the sensor will no longer detect the sheet, thereby indicating that the trailing edge of the sheet is approaching the transfer nip .","When the trailing edge of a sheet is approaching the transfer nip  a substantial portion of the media has already passed through the transfer nip . Accordingly, it is very unlikely that a multi-pick will occur. However, many false multi-pick detections may occur near the trailing edge of a sheet. For instance, many envelopes have a seam near the end of the envelope that will cause an increase in servo following error. In various exemplary embodiments, the media sensor may be placed, for example, at or near the deskew nip , since, in many media feed mechanisms, the deskew nip  is typically just downstream of the transfer nip . However, any other pre-existing media sensor upstream of the transfer nip, but closer to the nip than the length of the shortest media, will suffice.","Accordingly, in order to prevent a false detection of a multi-pick, in step S, if the trailing edge of the sheet is approaching the transfer nip , operation of the method jumps to step S where operation of the method ends. It should be appreciated that the method represented by the flowchart shown in  is only for one sheet. Therefore, the entire method is restarted for each sheet in a multi-sheet job. Because a multi-sheet job may contain different settings and different media types, this allows for each sheet to be treated differently. Based on, for example, the different settings and media types, each sheet might have, for example, a different sampling delay distance, a different threshold value, and\/or a different sample buffer array size.","However, it should be appreciated that, in various other exemplary embodiments, the method may be applied to an entire multi-sheet job, wherein the various steps shown in  are looped through until the multi-sheet job is complete.","In step S, if the trailing edge of the sheet is not approaching the transfer nip , operation continues to step S. As discussed above, the data provided by the feedback loop is typically provided as a relative increase or decrease compared to an expected value of the kinetic property represented by the data. Therefore, in step S, the minimum, maximum, median, relative minimum, and relative maximum of the data values related to torque stored in the sample buffer array are calculated. According to various exemplary embodiments, these values are used to predict whether a multi-pick has occurred. The relative minimum is calculated according to the following relationship:\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nand the relative maximum is calculated according to the following relationship:\n\n\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere Ris the relative minimum, {tilde over (x)} is the median, xis the minimum, Ris the relative maximum, and xis the maximum.\n","Various exemplary embodiments of the invention use the relative minimum and the relative maximum because the median data value is considered to be related to the baseline amount of torque necessary to rotate the drum and the transfer roller. The torque required to pass any second sheet of media through the transfer nip  (i.e., during a multi-pick) is in addition to this baseline amount.","In various other exemplary embodiments, the mean of the data values may be substituted for the median. However, the size of a single large spike in the data values can skew the mean away from an accurate estimate of the baseline torque. The median is not substantially effected by the size of the spike in the same manner. Also, in various other exemplary embodiments, the actual maximum and minimum values may be used. In such embodiments, the feedback data would have to be expressed as a total value since the maximum and minimum will be a total values rather than relative to an estimated baseline.","Next, in step S, a determination is made whether the relative minimum is larger than the threshold value. The relative minimum may be larger than the threshold value when, for example, the drum  and\/or transfer roller  travels down or \u201cfalls off\u201d the trailing edge of an inked area. It is conceivable, immediately following this \u201cfalling off,\u201d that the drum  and\/or transfer roller  may bounce back causing a ring in the feedback data. If the relative minimum is larger than the threshold value, operation continues to step S. If the relative minimum is not larger than the threshold value, operation jumps to step S.","In step S, the threshold value is reset equal to the relative minimum in order to account for the ring in the feedback data that may result from the ink thickness. This prevents any feedback ring from being considered a multi-pick. It should be appreciated that, in various other exemplary embodiments, in order to simplify the method, steps S and steps S may be omitted. As a result, according to such embodiments, it is only necessary to calculate the relative maximum, as opposed to both the relative maximum and relative minimum.","In step S, a determination is made whether the relative maximum is larger than the threshold value. If the relative maximum is larger than the threshold value, it is assumed that a multi-pick has occurred and operation jumps to step S. As discussed above, the threshold value reflects the expected amount of additional torque that might be required due to, for example, ink thickness or feedback ring. If the relative maximum value is larger than the threshold value than the additional torque is assumed to be the result of a multi-pick. In step S, a notification of a multi-pick is made and operation of the method terminates.","However, in step S, if the relative maximum is not greater than the threshold value, it is assumed that there has not been a multi-pick and operation continues to step S. In step S, the oldest feedback data entry is removed from the buffer array to make room for a next feedback data entry and a period of time substantially equal to the sample rate is allowed to pass (the actual time may vary depending on the execution times of the various method steps). As should be appreciated, data provided by the feedback loop can again be sampled, because the buffer array is no longer full. Operation returns to step S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","510","520","530","540","550","560"]},"The input\/output interface  is connected to a data source  over one or more links .

For example, where appropriate the controller, the data sampling circuit, routine, or application , and\/or the data analyzing circuit, routine, or application  may be combined into a single circuit, routine, or application or divided into multiple circuits, routines, or applications.","According to the above-described exemplary embodiments, it is possible to detect a multi-pick within a nip, without the need for additional devices dedicated solely to the detection of multi-picks. Because servomotors already provide a data stream related to one or more kinetic properties of the roller that the servomotor controls, a controller can compare the kinetic properties of the roller to a preset limit to determine whether or not a multi-pick has occurred, without utilizing any devices dedicated solely to detecting multi-picks. Such embodiments also prevent a stripper blade from remaining down such that the blade becomes contaminated with ink that might be re-deposited on subsequent sheets of media.","While this invention has been described in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments outlined above, various alternatives, modifications, variations, and\/or improvements may be possible. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention, as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
