{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/991,709 filed Dec. 1, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","I. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the fields of molecular biology and medicine. More specifically, the invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment of diseases or conditions that are affected by microRNA (miRNA) miR-124 expression or lack thereof, and genes and cellular pathways directly and indirectly modulated by such.","II. Background","In 2001, several groups used a cloning method to isolate and identify a large group of \u201cmicroRNAs\u201d (miRNAs) from , and humans (Lau et al., 2001; Lee and Ambros, 2001; Lagos-Quintana et al., 2003). Several hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in plants and animals\u2014including humans\u2014which do not appear to have endogenous siRNAs. Thus, while similar to siRNAs, miRNAs are distinct.","miRNAs thus far observed have been approximately 21-22 nucleotides in length, and they arise from longer precursors, which are transcribed from non-protein-encoding genes (Carrington and Ambros, 2003). The precursors form structures that fold back on themselves in self-complementary regions; they are then processed by the nuclease Dicer (in animals) or DCL1 (in plants) to generate the short double-stranded miRNA. One of the miRNA strands is incorporated into a complex of proteins and miRNA called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The miRNA guides the RISC complex to a target mRNA, which is then cleaved or translationally silenced, depending on the degree of sequence complementarity of the miRNA to its target mRNA. Currently, it is believed that perfect or nearly perfect complementarity leads to mRNA degradation, as is most commonly observed in plants. In contrast, imperfect base pairing, as is primarily found in animals, leads to translational silencing. However, recent data suggest additional complexity (Bagga et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2005), and mechanisms of gene silencing by miRNAs remain under intense study (Chendrimada et al., 2007; Kiriakidou et al., 2007).","Recent studies have shown that changes in the expression levels of numerous miRNAs are associated with various cancers (reviewed in (Calin and Croce, 2006; Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006; Wiemer, 2007). miRNAs have also been implicated in regulating cell growth and cell and tissue differentiation\u2014cellular processes that are associated with the development of cancer.","The inventors previously demonstrated that hsa-miR-124 is involved with the regulation of numerous cell activities that represent intervention points for cancer therapy and for therapy of other diseases and disorders (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/141,707 filed May 31, 2005 and Ser. No. 11\/273,640 filed Nov. 14, 2005, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, cell proliferation, cell division, and cell survival are frequently altered in human cancers. Transfection of human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) with synthetic hsa-miR-124 reduced viable cell numbers. In addition, the inventors showed that miR-124 significantly increased the capacity of two therapeutic compounds (TRAIL, an apoptosis pathway activator in cancer cells, and etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that activates the apoptosis pathway in cancer cells and normal cells) to induce cell death in A549 or HeLa cells. Overexpression of synthetic miR-124 in various cell lines decreased cell proliferation. In those studies, the inventors observed reduced proliferation of human breast cancer cells, (BT549), normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF12A), human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), human prostate carcinoma cells (22RV1), human basal cell carcinoma cells (TE 354.T), normal human skin cells (TE 353.Sk), and human lung carcinoma cells (A549, CRL-5826, HTB-57). Overexpression of miR-124 in HeLa cells significantly reduced the number of cells in the G2\/M phase of the cell cycle when compared to cells transfected with a negative control miRNA. Also, others have recently observed that epigenetic silencing of miR-124a in cancers cells modulates activity the oncogene, CDK6 and the tumor suppressor gene, Rb (Lujambio et al., 2007).","Bioinformatics analyses suggest that any given miRNA may bind to and alter the expression of up to several hundred different genes. In addition, a single gene may be regulated by several miRNAs. Thus, each miRNA may regulate a complex interaction among genes, gene pathways, and gene networks. Mis-regulation or alteration of these regulatory pathways and networks involving miRNAs are likely to contribute to the development of disorders and diseases such as cancer. Although bioinformatics tools are helpful in predicting miRNA binding targets, all have limitations. Because of the imperfect complementarity with their target binding sites, it is difficult to accurately predict the mRNA targets of miRNAs with bioinformatics tools alone. Furthermore, the complicated interactive regulatory networks among miRNAs and target genes make it difficult to accurately predict which genes will actually be mis-regulated in response to a given miRNA.","Correcting gene expression errors by manipulating miRNA expression or by repairing miRNA mis-regulation represent promising methods to repair genetic disorders and cure diseases like cancer. A current, disabling limitation of this approach is that, as mentioned above, the details of the regulatory pathways and gene networks that are affected by any given miRNA, have been largely unknown. This represents a significant limitation for treatment of cancers in which a specific miRNA may play a role. A need exists to identify the genes, genetic pathways, and genetic networks that are regulated by or that may regulate expression of miRNAs.","The present invention provides additional compositions and methods by identifying genes that are direct targets for miR-124 regulation or that are indirect or downstream targets of regulation following the miR-124-mediated modification of another gene(s) expression. Furthermore, the invention describes gene, disease, and\/or physiologic pathways and networks that are influenced by miR-124 and its family members. In certain aspects, compositions of the invention are administered to a subject having, suspected of having, or at risk of developing a metabolic, an immunologic, an infectious, a cardiovascular, a digestive, an endocrine, an ocular, a genitourinary, a blood, a musculoskeletal, a nervous system, a congenital, a respiratory, a skin, or a cancerous disease or condition.","In particular aspects, a subject or patient may be selected for treatment based on expression and\/or aberrant expression of one or more miRNA or mRNA. In a further aspect, a subject or patient may be selected for treatment based on aberrations in one or more biologic or physiologic pathway(s), including aberrant expression of one or more gene associated with a pathway, or the aberrant expression of one or more protein encoded by one or more gene associated with a pathway. In still a further aspect, a subject or patient may be selected based on aberrations in miRNA expression, or biologic and\/or physiologic pathway(s). A subject may be assessed for sensitivity, resistance, and\/or efficacy of a therapy or treatment regime based on the evaluation and\/or analysis of miRNA or mRNA expression or lack thereof. A subject may be evaluated for amenability to certain therapy prior to, during, or after administration of one or therapy to a subject or patient. Typically, evaluation or assessment may be done by analysis of miRNA and\/or mRNA, as well as combination of other assessment methods that include but are not limited to histology, immunohistochemistry, blood work, etc.","In some embodiments, an infectious disease or condition includes a bacterial, viral, parasite, or fungal infection. Many of these genes and pathways are associated with various cancers and other diseases. Cancerous conditions include, but are not limited to astrocytoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, angiosarcoma, breast carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, bladder carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, cervical carcinoma, carcinoma of the head and neck, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma, glioma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, gastric carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, lung carcinoma, lipoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue B-cell lymphoma, medulloblastoma, mantle cell lymphoma, myxofibrosarcoma, meningioma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, oropharyngeal carcinoma, osteosarcoma, pancreatic carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, retinoblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, schwannoma, small cell lung cancer, salivary gland tumor, thyroid carcinoma, testicular tumor, urothelial carcinoma, Wilm's tumor, wherein the modulation of one or more gene is sufficient for a therapeutic response. Typically a cancerous condition is an aberrant hyperproliferative condition associated with the uncontrolled growth or inability to undergo cell death, including apoptosis.","In still a further aspect, a nervous system condition can include a disease or injury to a neuronal cell or a nerve that includes, but is not limited to brain tumors; neuronal degeneration; mental retardation; Cerebral degeneration (Leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease), Cerebral lipidoses (Tay-Sachs disease), Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, obstructive Hydrocephalus, Reye's syndrome, Parkinson's disease); extrapyramidal disease and abnormal movement disorders (Olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome, Essential tremor\/familial tremor, Myoclonus (Lafora's disease or Unverricht disease), Huntington's chorea, torsion dystonia, Blepharospasm, Restless legs, Serotonin syndrome); Spinocerebellar disease (Friedreich's ataxia (Spinocerebellar ataxia), Hereditary spastic paraplegia, Primary cerebellar degeneration, cerebellar ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia [Louis-Bar syndrome], Corticostriatal-spinal degeneration); Anterior horn cell disease (Motor neuron disease (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive muscular atrophy, Progressive bulbar palsy, Pseudobulbar palsy, Primary lateral sclerosis); Syringomyelia and syringobulbia; Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (Reflex sympathetic dystrophy); or multiple sclerosis. Nerve injuries include three main types of nerve fiber injury axonotmesis, neurapraxia and neurotmesis.","Axonotmesis involves loss of the relative continuity of the axon and its covering of myelin, but preservation of the connective tissue framework of the nerve (the encapsulating tissue, the epineurium and perineurium, are preserved). Because axonal continuity is lost, wallerian degeneration occurs. Typically, recovery occurs only through regeneration of the axons, a process requiring time. Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or contusion than neurapraxia.","Neurapraxia is an interruption in conduction of the impulse down the nerve fiber, and recovery takes place without wallerian degeneration. This is the mildest form of nerve injury. This is probably a biochemical lesion caused by a concussion or other shock-like injuries to the fiber. In the case of the role nerve, neurapraxia is brought about by compression or relatively mind, blunt blows, including some low-velocity missile injuries close to the nerve.","Neurotmesis is the most severe lesion. It occurs on severe contusion, stretch, laceration, or Local Anesthetic Toxicity. Not only the axon, but the encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The last (extreme) degree of neurotmesis is transsection, but most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather than internal disruption of the architecture of the nerve sufficient to involve perineurium and endoneuruim as well as axons and their covering. There is typically a complete loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. For neurotmesis, the Sunderland System is typically used for classification.","The present invention provides methods and compositions for identifying genes that are direct targets for miR-124 regulation or that are downstream targets of regulation following the miR-124-mediated modification of upstream gene expression. Furthermore, the invention describes gene pathways and networks that are influenced by miR-124 expression in biological samples. Many of these genes and pathways are associated with various cancers and other diseases. The altered expression or function of miR-124 in cells would lead to changes in the expression of these genes and contribute to the development of disease or other conditions. Introducing miR-124 (for diseases where the miRNA is down-regulated) or a miR-124 inhibitor (for diseases where the miRNA is up-regulated) into disease cells or tissues or subjects would result in a therapeutic response. The identities of key genes that are regulated directly or indirectly by miR-124 and the disease with which they are associated are provided herein.","In certain aspects a cell may be an epithelial, an endothelial, a mesothelial, a glial, a stromal, or a mucosal cell. The cell can be, but is not limited to a brain, a neuronal, a blood, an endometrial, a meninges, an esophageal, a lung, a cardiovascular, a liver, a lymphoid, a breast, a bone, a connective tissue, a fat, a retinal, a thyroid, a glandular, an adrenal, a pancreatic, a stomach, an intestinal, a kidney, a bladder, a colon, a prostate, a uterine, an ovarian, a cervical, a testicular, a splenic, a skin, a smooth muscle, a cardiac muscle, or a striated muscle cell. A cell, tissue, or subject may be a cancer cell, a cancerous tissue, harbor cancerous tissue, or be a subject or patient diagnosed or at risk of developing a disease or condition. In still a further aspect cancer includes, but is not limited to astrocytoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, angiosarcoma, breast carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, bladder carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, cervical carcinoma, carcinoma of the head and neck, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma, glioma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, gastric carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, lung carcinoma, lipoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue B-cell lymphoma, medulloblastoma, mantle cell lymphoma, myxofibrosarcoma, meningioma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, oropharyngeal carcinoma, osteosarcoma, pancreatic carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, retinoblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, schwannoma, small cell lung cancer, salivary gland tumor, thyroid carcinoma, testicular tumor, urothelial carcinoma, or Wilm's tumor.","In certain aspects, the cell, tissue, or target may not be defective in miRNA expression yet may still respond therapeutically to expression or over expression of a miRNA. miR-124 could be used as a therapeutic target for any of these diseases. In certain embodiments miR-124 or its compliment can be used to modulate the activity of miR-124 in a subject, organ, tissue, or cell.","A cell, tissue, or subject may be a cancer cell, a cancerous tissue, harbor cancerous tissue, or be a subject or patient diagnosed or at risk of developing a disease or condition.

Therapeutic methods","Embodiments of the invention concern nucleic acids that perform the activities of or inhibit endogenous miRNAs when introduced into cells. In certain aspects, nucleic acids are synthetic or non-synthetic miRNA. Sequence-specific miRNA inhibitors can be used to inhibit sequentially or in combination the activities of one or more endogenous miRNAs in cells, as well those genes and associated pathways modulated by the endogenous miRNA.","The present invention concerns, in some embodiments, short nucleic acid molecules that function as miRNAs or as inhibitors of miRNA in a cell.

The nucleic acid molecules are typically synthetic. The term \u201csynthetic\u201d refers to nucleic acid molecule that is isolated and not produced naturally in a cell. In certain aspects the sequence (the entire sequence) and\/or chemical structure deviates from a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule, such as an endogenous precursor miRNA or miRNA molecule or complement thereof. While in some embodiments, nucleic acids of the invention do not have an entire sequence that is identical or complementary to a sequence of a naturally-occurring nucleic acid, such molecules may encompass all or part of a naturally-occurring sequence or a complement thereof. It is contemplated, however, that a synthetic nucleic acid administered to a cell may subsequently be modified or altered in the cell such that its structure or sequence is the same as non-synthetic or naturally occurring nucleic acid, such as a mature miRNA sequence. For example, a synthetic nucleic acid may have a sequence that differs from the sequence of a precursor miRNA, but that sequence may be altered once in a cell to be the same as an endogenous, processed miRNA or an inhibitor thereof. The term \u201cisolated\u201d means that the nucleic acid molecules of the invention are initially separated from different (in terms of sequence or structure) and unwanted nucleic acid molecules such that a population of isolated nucleic acids is at least about 90% homogenous, and may be at least about 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% homogenous with respect to other polynucleotide molecules. In many embodiments of the invention, a nucleic acid is isolated by virtue of it having been synthesized in vitro separate from endogenous nucleic acids in a cell. It will be understood, however, that isolated nucleic acids may be subsequently mixed or pooled together. In certain aspects, synthetic miRNA of the invention are RNA or RNA analogs. miRNA inhibitors may be DNA or RNA, or analogs thereof. miRNA and miRNA inhibitors of the invention are collectively referred to as \u201csynthetic nucleic acids.\u201d","In some embodiments, there is a miRNA or a synthetic miRNA having a length of between 17 and 130 residues.

In certain embodiments, these synthetic miRNA are also isolated, as defined above. The term \u201cmiRNA region\u201d refers to a region on the synthetic miRNA that is at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% identical, including all integers there between, to the entire sequence of a mature, naturally occurring miRNA sequence or a complement thereof. In certain embodiments, the miRNA region is or is at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% identical to the sequence of a naturally-occurring miRNA or complement thereof.","The term \u201ccomplementary region\u201d or \u201ccomplement\u201d refers to a region of a nucleic acid or mimetic that is or is at least 60% complementary to the mature, naturally occurring miRNA sequence. The complementary region is or is at least 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% complementary, or any range derivable therein. With single polynucleotide sequences, there may be a hairpin loop structure as a result of chemical bonding between the miRNA region and the complementary region. In other embodiments, the complementary region is on a different nucleic acid molecule than the miRNA region, in which case the complementary region is on the complementary strand and the miRNA region is on the active strand.","In other embodiments of the invention, there are synthetic nucleic acids that are miRNA inhibitors. A miRNA inhibitor is between about 17 to 25 nucleotides in length and comprises a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence that is at least 90% complementary to the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence of a mature miRNA. In certain embodiments, a miRNA inhibitor molecule is 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides in length, or any range derivable therein. Moreover, an miRNA inhibitor may have a sequence (from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032) that is or is at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% complementary, or any range derivable therein, to the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence of a mature miRNA, particularly a mature, naturally occurring miRNA. One of skill in the art could use a portion of the miRNA sequence that is complementary to the sequence of a mature miRNA as the sequence for a miRNA inhibitor. Moreover, that portion of the nucleic acid sequence can be altered so that it is still comprises the appropriate percentage of complementarity to the sequence of a mature miRNA.","In some embodiments, of the invention, a synthetic miRNA or inhibitor contains one or more design element(s). These design elements include, but are not limited to: (i) a replacement group for the phosphate or hydroxyl of the nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus of the complementary region; (ii) one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 1 to 6 residues of the complementary region; or, (iii) noncomplementarity between one or more nucleotides in the last 1 to 5 residues at the 3\u2032 end of the complementary region and the corresponding nucleotides of the miRNA region. A variety of design modifications are known in the art, see below.","In certain embodiments, a synthetic miRNA has a nucleotide at its 5\u2032 end of the complementary region in which the phosphate and\/or hydroxyl group has been replaced with another chemical group (referred to as the \u201creplacement design\u201d). In some cases, the phosphate group is replaced, while in others, the hydroxyl group has been replaced. In particular embodiments, the replacement group is biotin, an amine group, a lower alkylamine group, an aminohexyl phosphate group, an acetyl group, 2\u2032O-Me (2\u2032oxygen-methyl), DMTO (4,4\u2032-dimethoxytrityl with oxygen), fluorescein, a thiol, or acridine, though other replacement groups are well known to those of skill in the art and can be used as well. This design element can also be used with a miRNA inhibitor.","Additional embodiments concern a synthetic miRNA having one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 1 to 6 residues of the complementary region (referred to as the \u201csugar replacement design\u201d). In certain cases, there is one or more sugar modifications in the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more residues of the complementary region, or any range derivable therein. In additional cases, there are one or more sugar modifications in the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more residues of the complementary region, or any range derivable therein, have a sugar modification. It will be understood that the terms \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201clast\u201d are with respect to the order of residues from the 5\u2032 end to the 3\u2032 end of the region. In particular embodiments, the sugar modification is a 2\u2032O-Me modification, a 2\u2032F modification, a 2\u2032H modification, a 2\u2032amino modification, a 4\u2032thioribose modification or a phosphorothioate modification on the carboxy group linked to the carbon at position 6\u2032. In further embodiments, there are one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 2 to 4 residues of the complementary region or the first or last 4 to 6 residues of the complementary region. This design element can also be used with a miRNA inhibitor. Thus, a miRNA inhibitor can have this design element and\/or a replacement group on the nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus, as discussed above.","In other embodiments of the invention, there is a synthetic miRNA or inhibitor in which one or more nucleotides in the last 1 to 5 residues at the 3\u2032 end of the complementary region are not complementary to the corresponding nucleotides of the miRNA region (\u201cnoncomplementarity\u201d) (referred to as the \u201cnoncomplementarity design\u201d). The noncomplementarity may be in the last 1, 2, 3, 4, and\/or 5 residues of the complementary miRNA. In certain embodiments, there is noncomplementarity with at least 2 nucleotides in the complementary region.","It is contemplated that synthetic miRNA of the invention have one or more of the replacement, sugar modification, or noncomplementarity designs. In certain cases, synthetic RNA molecules have two of them, while in others these molecules have all three designs in place.","The miRNA region and the complementary region may be on the same or separate polynucleotides. In cases in which they are contained on or in the same polynucleotide, the miRNA molecule will be considered a single polynucleotide. In embodiments in which the different regions are on separate polynucleotides, the synthetic miRNA will be considered to be comprised of two polynucleotides.","When the RNA molecule is a single polynucleotide, there can be a linker region between the miRNA region and the complementary region. In some embodiments, the single polynucleotide is capable of forming a hairpin loop structure as a result of bonding between the miRNA region and the complementary region. The linker constitutes the hairpin loop. It is contemplated that in some embodiments, the linker region is, is at least, or is at most 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 residues in length, or any range derivable therein. In certain embodiments, the linker is between 3 and 30 residues (inclusive) in length.","In addition to having a miRNA or inhibitor region and a complementary region, there may be flanking sequences as well at either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the region. In some embodiments, there is or is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 nucleotides or more, or any range derivable therein, flanking one or both sides of these regions.","Methods of the invention include reducing or eliminating activity of one or more miRNAs in a cell comprising introducing into a cell a miRNA inhibitor (which may be described generally herein as an miRNA, so that a description of miRNA, where appropriate, also will refer to a miRNA inhibitor); or supplying or enhancing the activity of one or more miRNAs in a cell. The present invention also concerns inducing certain cellular characteristics by providing to a cell a particular nucleic acid, such as a specific synthetic miRNA molecule or a synthetic miRNA inhibitor molecule. However, in methods of the invention, the miRNA molecule or miRNA inhibitor need not be synthetic. They may have a sequence that is identical to a naturally occurring miRNA or they may not have any design modifications. In certain embodiments, the miRNA molecule and\/or the miRNA inhibitor are synthetic, as discussed above.","The particular nucleic acid molecule provided to the cell is understood to correspond to a particular miRNA in the cell, and thus, the miRNA in the cell is referred to as the \u201ccorresponding miRNA.\u201d In situations in which a named miRNA molecule is introduced into a cell, the corresponding miRNA will be understood to be the induced or inhibited miRNA function. It is contemplated, however, that the miRNA molecule introduced into a cell is not a mature miRNA but is capable of becoming or functioning as a mature miRNA under the appropriate physiological conditions. In cases in which a particular corresponding miRNA is being inhibited by a miRNA inhibitor, the particular miRNA will be referred to as the \u201ctargeted miRNA.\u201d It is contemplated that multiple corresponding miRNAs may be involved. In particular embodiments, more than one miRNA molecule is introduced into a cell. Moreover, in other embodiments, more than one miRNA inhibitor is introduced into a cell. Furthermore, a combination of miRNA molecule(s) and miRNA inhibitor(s) may be introduced into a cell. The inventors contemplate that a combination of miRNA may act at one or more points in cellular pathways of cells with aberrant phenotypes and that such combination may have increased efficacy on the target cell while not adversely effecting normal cells. Thus, a combination of miRNA may have a minimal adverse effect on a subject or patient while supplying a sufficient therapeutic effect, such as amelioration of a condition, growth inhibition of a cell, death of a targeted cell, alteration of cell phenotype or physiology, slowing of cellular growth, sensitization to a second therapy, sensitization to a particular therapy, and the like.","Methods include identifying a cell or patient in need of inducing those cellular characteristics. Also, it will be understood that an amount of a synthetic nucleic acid that is provided to a cell or organism is an \u201ceffective amount,\u201d which refers to an amount needed (or a sufficient amount) to achieve a desired goal, such as inducing a particular cellular characteristic(s).","In certain embodiments of the methods include providing or introducing to a cell a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a mature miRNA in the cell in an amount effective to achieve a desired physiological result.","Moreover, methods can involve providing synthetic or nonsynthetic miRNA molecules. It is contemplated that in these embodiments, that methods may or may not be limited to providing only one or more synthetic miRNA molecules or only one or more nonsynthetic miRNA molecules. Thus, in certain embodiments, methods may involve providing both synthetic and nonsynthetic miRNA molecules. In this situation, a cell or cells are most likely provided a synthetic miRNA molecule corresponding to a particular miRNA and a nonsynthetic miRNA molecule corresponding to a different miRNA. Furthermore, any method articulated using a list of miRNAs using Markush group language may be articulated without the Markush group language and a disjunctive article (i.e., or) instead, and vice versa.","In some embodiments, there is a method for reducing or inhibiting cell proliferation in a cell comprising introducing into or providing to the cell an effective amount of (i) an miRNA inhibitor molecule or (ii) a synthetic or nonsynthetic miRNA molecule that corresponds to a miRNA sequence. In certain embodiments the methods involves introducing into the cell an effective amount of (i) a miRNA inhibitor molecule having a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence that is at least 90% complementary to the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 sequence of one or more mature miRNA.","Certain embodiments of the invention include methods of treating a pathologic condition, in particular cancer, e.g., lung or liver cancer. In one aspect, the method comprises contacting a target cell with one or more nucleic acid, synthetic miRNA, or miRNA comprising at least one nucleic acid segment having all or a portion of a miRNA sequence. The segment may be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30 or more nucleotides or nucleotide analog, including all integers there between. An aspect of the invention includes the modulation of gene expression, miRNA expression or function or mRNA expression or function within a target cell, such as a cancer cell.","Typically, an endogenous gene, miRNA or mRNA is modulated in the cell. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence comprises at least one segment that is at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% identical in nucleic acid sequence to one or more miRNA or gene sequence. Modulation of the expression or processing of an endogenous gene, miRNA, or mRNA can be through modulation of the processing of a mRNA, such processing including transcription, transportation and\/or translation with in a cell. Modulation may also be effected by the inhibition or enhancement of miRNA activity with a cell, tissue, or organ. Such processing may affect the expression of an encoded product or the stability of the mRNA. In still other embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence can comprise a modified nucleic acid sequence. In certain aspects, one or more miRNA sequence may include or comprise a modified nucleobase or nucleic acid sequence.","It will be understood in methods of the invention that a cell or other biological matter such as an organism (including patients) can be provided a miRNA or miRNA molecule corresponding to a particular miRNA by administering to the cell or organism a nucleic acid molecule that functions as the corresponding miRNA once inside the cell. The form of the molecule provided to the cell may not be the form that acts a miRNA once inside the cell. Thus, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, a synthetic miRNA or a nonsynthetic miRNA is provided such that it becomes processed into a mature and active miRNA once it has access to the cell's miRNA processing machinery. In certain embodiments, it is specifically contemplated that the miRNA molecule provided is not a mature miRNA molecule but a nucleic acid molecule that can be processed into the mature miRNA once it is accessible to miRNA processing machinery. The term \u201cnonsynthetic\u201d in the context of miRNA means that the miRNA is not \u201csynthetic,\u201d as defined herein. Furthermore, it is contemplated that in embodiments of the invention that concern the use of synthetic miRNAs, the use of corresponding nonsynthetic miRNAs is also considered an aspect of the invention, and vice versa. It will be understand that the term \u201cproviding\u201d an agent is used to include \u201cadministering\u201d the agent to a patient.","In certain embodiments, methods also include targeting a miRNA to modulate in a cell or organism. The term \u201ctargeting a miRNA to modulate\u201d means a nucleic acid of the invention will be employed so as to modulate the selected miRNA. In some embodiments the modulation is achieved with a synthetic or non-synthetic miRNA that corresponds to the targeted miRNA, which effectively provides the targeted miRNA to the cell or organism (positive modulation). In other embodiments, the modulation is achieved with a miRNA inhibitor, which effectively inhibits the targeted miRNA in the cell or organism (negative modulation).","In some embodiments, the miRNA targeted to be modulated is a miRNA that affects a disease, condition, or pathway. In certain embodiments, the miRNA is targeted because a treatment can be provided by negative modulation of the targeted miRNA. In other embodiments, the miRNA is targeted because a treatment can be provided by positive modulation of the targeted miRNA or its targets.","In certain methods of the invention, there is a further step of administering the selected miRNA modulator to a cell, tissue, organ, or organism (collectively \u201cbiological matter\u201d) in need of treatment related to modulation of the targeted miRNA or in need of the physiological or biological results discussed herein (such as with respect to a particular cellular pathway or result like decrease in cell viability). Consequently, in some methods of the invention there is a step of identifying a patient in need of treatment that can be provided by the miRNA modulator(s). It is contemplated that an effective amount of a miRNA modulator can be administered in some embodiments. In particular embodiments, there is a therapeutic benefit conferred on the biological matter, where a \u201ctherapeutic benefit\u201d refers to an improvement in the one or more conditions or symptoms associated with a disease or condition or an improvement in the prognosis, duration, or status with respect to the disease. It is contemplated that a therapeutic benefit includes, but is not limited to, a decrease in pain, a decrease in morbidity, a decrease in a symptom. For example, with respect to cancer, it is contemplated that a therapeutic benefit can be inhibition of tumor growth, prevention of metastasis, reduction in number of metastases, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of cell death in cancer cells, inhibition of angiogenesis near cancer cells, induction of apoptosis of cancer cells, reduction in pain, reduction in risk of recurrence, induction of chemo- or radiosensitivity in cancer cells, prolongation of life, and\/or delay of death directly or indirectly related to cancer.","Furthermore, it is contemplated that the miRNA compositions may be provided as part of a therapy to a patient, in conjunction with traditional therapies or preventative agents. Moreover, it is contemplated that any method discussed in the context of therapy may be applied as preventatively, particularly in a patient identified to be potentially in need of the therapy or at risk of the condition or disease for which a therapy is needed.","In addition, methods of the invention concern employing one or more nucleic acids corresponding to a miRNA and a therapeutic drug. The nucleic acid can enhance the effect or efficacy of the drug, reduce any side effects or toxicity, modify its bioavailability, and\/or decrease the dosage or frequency needed. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic drug is a cancer therapeutic. Consequently, in some embodiments, there is a method of treating cancer in a patient comprising administering to the patient the cancer therapeutic and an effective amount of at least one miRNA molecule that improves the efficacy of the cancer therapeutic or protects non-cancer cells. Cancer therapies also include a variety of combination therapies with both chemical and radiation based treatments. Combination chemotherapies include but are not limited to, for example, 5-fluorouracil, alemtuzumab, amrubicin, bevacizumab, bleomycin, bortezomib, busulfan, camptothecin, capecitabine, cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, cetuximab, chlorambucil, cisplatin (CDDP), cyclophosphamide, camptothecin, COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib), cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dactinomycin, dasatinib, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, docetaxel, doxorubicin (adriamycin), EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib and cetuximab), erlotinib, estrogen receptor binding agents, etoposide (VP16), everolimus, farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitors, gefitinib, gemcitabine, gemtuzumab, ibritumomab, ifosfamide, imatinib mesylate, larotaxel, lapatinib, lonafarnib, mechlorethamine, melphalan, methotrexate, mitomycin, navelbine, nitrosurea, nocodazole, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, plicomycin, procarbazine, raloxifene, rituximab, sirolimus, sorafenib, sunitinib, tamoxifen, taxol, taxotere, temsirolimus, tipifarnib, tositumomab, transplatinum, trastuzumab, vinblastin, vincristin, or vinorelbine or any analog or derivative variant of the foregoing.","Generally, inhibitors of miRNAs can be given to decrease the activity of an endogenous miRNA. Similarly, nucleic acid molecules corresponding to the mature miRNA can be given to achieve the opposite effect as compared to when inhibitors of the miRNA are given. For example, inhibitors of miRNA molecules that increase cell proliferation can be provided to cells to increase proliferation or decrease cell proliferation. The present invention contemplates these embodiments in the context of the different physiological effects observed with the different miRNA molecules and miRNA inhibitors disclosed herein. These include, but are not limited to, the following physiological effects: increase and decreasing cell proliferation, increasing or decreasing apoptosis, increasing transformation, increasing or decreasing cell viability, activating or inhibiting a kinase (e.g., Erk), activating\/inducing or inhibiting hTert, inhibit stimulation of growth promoting pathway (e.g., Stat 3 signaling), reduce or increase viable cell number, and increase or decrease number of cells at a particular phase of the cell cycle. Methods of the invention are generally contemplated to include providing or introducing one or more different nucleic acid molecules corresponding to one or more different miRNA molecules. It is contemplated that the following, at least the following, or at most the following number of different nucleic acid or miRNA molecules may be provided or introduced: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, or any range derivable therein. This also applies to the number of different miRNA molecules that can be provided or introduced into a cell.","II. Pharmaceutical Formulations and Delivery","Methods of the present invention include the delivery of an effective amount of a miRNA or an expression construct encoding the same. An \u201ceffective amount\u201d of the pharmaceutical composition, generally, is defined as that amount sufficient to detectably and repeatedly to achieve the stated desired result, for example, to ameliorate, reduce, minimize or limit the extent of the disease or its symptoms. Other more rigorous definitions may apply, including elimination, eradication or cure of disease.","A. Administration","In certain embodiments, it is desired to kill cells, inhibit cell growth, inhibit metastasis, decrease tumor or tissue size, and\/or reverse or reduce the malignant or disease phenotype of cells. The routes of administration will vary, naturally, with the location and nature of the lesion or site to be targeted, and include, e.g., intradermal, subcutaneous, regional, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, systemic, and oral administration and formulation. Direct injection, intratumoral injection, or injection into tumor vasculature is specifically contemplated for discrete, solid, accessible tumors, or other accessible target areas. Local, regional, or systemic administration also may be appropriate. For tumors of >4 cm, the volume to be administered will be about 4-10 ml (preferably 10 ml), while for tumors of <4 cm, a volume of about 1-3 ml will be used (preferably 3 ml).","Multiple injections delivered as a single dose comprise about 0.1 to about 0.5 ml volumes. Compositions of the invention may be administered in multiple injections to a tumor or a targeted site. In certain aspects, injections may be spaced at approximately 1 cm intervals.","In the case of surgical intervention, the present invention may be used preoperatively, to render an inoperable tumor subject to resection. Alternatively, the present invention may be used at the time of surgery, and\/or thereafter, to treat residual or metastatic disease. For example, a resected tumor bed may be injected or perfused with a formulation comprising a miRNA or combinations thereof. Administration may be continued post-resection, for example, by leaving a catheter implanted at the site of the surgery. Periodic post-surgical treatment also is envisioned. Continuous perfusion of an expression construct or a viral construct also is contemplated.","Continuous administration also may be applied where appropriate, for example, where a tumor or other undesired affected area is excised and the tumor bed or targeted site is treated to eliminate residual, microscopic disease. Delivery via syringe or catherization is contemplated. Such continuous perfusion may take place for a period from about 1-2 hours, to about 2-6 hours, to about 6-12 hours, to about 12-24 hours, to about 1-2 days, to about 1-2 wk or longer following the initiation of treatment. Generally, the dose of the therapeutic composition via continuous perfusion will be equivalent to that given by a single or multiple injections, adjusted over a period of time during which the perfusion occurs.","Treatment regimens may vary as well and often depend on tumor type, tumor location, immune condition, target site, disease progression, and health and age of the patient. Certain tumor types will require more aggressive treatment. The clinician will be best suited to make such decisions based on the known efficacy and toxicity (if any) of the therapeutic formulations.","In certain embodiments, the tumor or affected area being treated may not, at least initially, be resectable. Treatments with compositions of the invention may increase the resectability of the tumor due to shrinkage at the margins or by elimination of certain particularly invasive portions. Following treatments, resection may be possible. Additional treatments subsequent to resection may serve to eliminate microscopic residual disease at the tumor or targeted site.","Treatments may include various \u201cunit doses.\u201d A unit dose is defined as containing a predetermined quantity of a therapeutic composition(s). The quantity to be administered, and the particular route and formulation, are within the skill of those in the clinical arts. A unit dose need not be administered as a single injection but may comprise continuous infusion over a set period of time. With respect to a viral component of the present invention, a unit dose may conveniently be described in terms of \u03bcg or mg of miRNA or miRNA mimetic. Alternatively, the amount specified may be the amount administered as the average daily, average weekly, or average monthly dose.","miRNA can be administered to the patient in a dose or doses of about or of at least about 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 950, 960, 970, 980, 990, 1000 \u03bcg or mg, or more, or any range derivable therein.

In other embodiments, the amount specified is any number discussed above but expressed as mg\/m(with respect to tumor size or patient surface area).","B. Injectable Compositions and Formulations","In some embodiments, the method for the delivery of a miRNA or an expression construct encoding such or combinations thereof is via systemic administration. However, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may also be administered parenterally, subcutaneously, directly, intratracheally, intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly, or even intraperitoneally as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,543,158; 5,641,515 and 5,399,363 (each specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","Injection of nucleic acids may be delivered by syringe or any other method used for injection of a solution, as long as the nucleic acid and any associated components can pass through the particular gauge of needle required for injection. A syringe system has also been described for use in gene therapy that permits multiple injections of predetermined quantities of a solution precisely at any depth (U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,225).","Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, mixtures thereof, and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,468, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and\/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","In certain formulations, a water-based formulation is employed while in others, it may be lipid-based. In particular embodiments of the invention, a composition comprising a tumor suppressor protein or a nucleic acid encoding the same is in a water-based formulation. In other embodiments, the formulation is lipid based.","For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intratumoral, intralesional, and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media which can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.","As used herein, a \u201ccarrier\u201d includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human.","The nucleic acid(s) are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, including, e.g., the aggressiveness of the disease or cancer, the size of any tumor(s) or lesions, the previous or other courses of treatment. Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgment of the practitioner. Suitable regimes for initial administration and subsequent administration are also variable, but are typified by an initial administration followed by other administrations. Such administration may be systemic, as a single dose, continuous over a period of time spanning 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 minutes, and\/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or more hours, and\/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, days or more. Moreover, administration may be through a time release or sustained release mechanism, implemented by formulation and\/or mode of administration.","C. Combination Treatments","In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present invention involve a miRNA, or expression construct encoding such. These miRNA composition can be used in combination with a second therapy to enhance the effect of the miRNA therapy, or increase the therapeutic effect of another therapy being employed. These compositions would be provided in a combined amount effective to achieve the desired effect, such as the killing of a cancer cell and\/or the inhibition of cellular hyperproliferation. This process may involve contacting the cells with the miRNA or second therapy at the same or different time. This may be achieved by contacting the cell with one or more compositions or pharmacological formulation that includes or more of the agents, or by contacting the cell with two or more distinct compositions or formulations, wherein one composition provides (1) miRNA; and\/or (2) a second therapy. A second composition or method may be administered that includes a chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical therapy, immunotherapy or gene therapy.","It is contemplated that one may provide a patient with the miRNA therapy and the second therapy within about 12-24 h of each other and, more preferably, within about 6-12 h of each other. In some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly, however, where several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations.","In certain embodiments, a course of treatment will last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90 days or more.

Within a single day (24-hour period), the patient may be given one or multiple administrations of the agent(s). Moreover, after a course of treatment, it is contemplated that there is a period of time at which no treatment is administered. This time period may last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days, and\/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 weeks, and\/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 months or more, depending on the condition of the patient, such as their prognosis, strength, health, etc.","Various combinations may be employed, for example miRNA therapy is \u201cA\u201d and a second therapy is \u201cB\u201d:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0162","num":"0161"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A\/B\/A B\/A\/B B\/B\/A A\/A\/B A\/B\/B B\/A\/A A\/B\/B\/B",{}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"B\/A\/B\/B B\/B\/B\/A B\/B\/A\/B A\/A\/B\/B A\/B\/A\/B A\/B\/B\/A"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"B\/B\/A\/A B\/A\/B\/A B\/A\/A\/B A\/A\/A\/B B\/A\/A\/A A\/B\/A\/A"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"A\/A\/B\/A"}]}}}}},"Administration of any compound or therapy of the present invention to a patient will follow general protocols for the administration of such compounds, taking into account the toxicity, if any, of the vector or any protein or other agent. Therefore, in some embodiments there is a step of monitoring toxicity that is attributable to combination therapy. It is expected that the treatment cycles would be repeated as necessary. It also is contemplated that various standard therapies, as well as surgical intervention, may be applied in combination with the described therapy.","In specific aspects, it is contemplated that a second therapy, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, surgical therapy or other gene therapy, is employed in combination with the miRNA therapy, as described herein.","1. Chemotherapy","A wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in accordance with the present invention. The term \u201cchemotherapy\u201d refers to the use of drugs to treat cancer. A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is used to connote a compound or composition that is administered in the treatment of cancer. These agents or drugs are categorized by their mode of activity within a cell, for example, whether and at what stage they affect the cell cycle. Alternatively, an agent may be characterized based on its ability to directly cross-link DNA, to intercalate into DNA, or to induce chromosomal and mitotic aberrations by affecting nucleic acid synthesis. Most chemotherapeutic agents fall into the following categories: alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics, mitotic inhibitors, and nitrosoureas.","a. Alkylating Agents","Alkylating agents are drugs that directly interact with genomic DNA to prevent the cancer cell from proliferating. This category of chemotherapeutic drugs represents agents that affect all phases of the cell cycle, that is, they are not phase-specific. Alkylating agents can be implemented to treat chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and particular cancers of the breast, lung, and ovary. They include: busulfan, chlorambucil, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide (cytoxan), dacarbazine, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine (mustargen), and melphalan. Troglitazaone can be used to treat cancer in combination with any one or more of these alkylating agents.","b. Antimetabolites","Antimetabolites disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis. Unlike alkylating agents, they specifically influence the cell cycle during S phase. They have been used to combat chronic leukemias in addition to tumors of breast, ovary and the gastrointestinal tract. Antimetabolites include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cytarabine (Ara-C), fludarabine, gemcitabine, and methotrexate.","5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has the chemical name of 5-fluoro-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. Its mechanism of action is thought to be by blocking the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. Thus, 5-FU interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and proliferation, it is thought that the effect of 5-FU is to create a thymidine deficiency leading to cell death. Thus, the effect of 5-FU is found in cells that rapidly divide, a characteristic of metastatic cancers.","c. Antitumor Antibiotics","Antitumor antibiotics have both antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. These drugs also interfere with DNA by chemically inhibiting enzymes and mitosis or altering cellular membranes. These agents are not phase specific so they work in all phases of the cell cycle. Thus, they are widely used for a variety of cancers. Examples of antitumor antibiotics include bleomycin, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and idarubicin, some of which are discussed in more detail below. Widely used in clinical setting for the treatment of neoplasms, these compounds are administered through bolus injections intravenously at doses ranging from 25-75 mg\/mat 21 day intervals for adriamycin, to 35-100 mg\/mfor etoposide intravenously or orally.","d. Mitotic Inhibitors","Mitotic inhibitors include plant alkaloids and other natural agents that can inhibit either protein synthesis required for cell division or mitosis. They operate during a specific phase during the cell cycle. Mitotic inhibitors comprise docetaxel, etoposide (VP16), paclitaxel, taxol, taxotere, vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine.","e. Nitrosureas","Nitrosureas, like alkylating agents, inhibit DNA repair proteins. They are used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, multiple myeloma, malignant melanoma, in addition to brain tumors. Examples include carmustine and lomustine.","2. Radiotherapy","Radiotherapy, also called radiation therapy, is the treatment of cancer and other diseases with ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy that injures or destroys cells in the area being treated by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, the latter are able to repair themselves and function properly. Radiotherapy may be used to treat localized solid tumors, such as cancers of the skin, tongue, larynx, brain, breast, or cervix. It can also be used to treat leukemia and lymphoma (cancers of the blood-forming cells and lymphatic system, respectively).","Radiation therapy used according to the present invention may include, but is not limited to, the use of \u03b3-rays, X-rays, and\/or the directed delivery of radioisotopes to tumor cells. Other forms of DNA damaging factors are also contemplated such as microwaves, proton beam irradiation (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,760,395 and 4,870,287) and UV-irradiation. It is most likely that all of these factors effect a broad range of damage on DNA, on the precursors of DNA, on the replication and repair of DNA, and on the assembly and maintenance of chromosomes. Dosage ranges for X-rays range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens for prolonged periods of time (3 to 4 wk), to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens. Dosage ranges for radioisotopes vary widely, and depend on the half-life of the isotope, the strength and type of radiation emitted, and the uptake by the neoplastic cells. Radiotherapy may comprise the use of radiolabeled antibodies to deliver doses of radiation directly to the cancer site (radioimmunotherapy). Once injected into the body, the antibodies actively seek out the cancer cells, which are destroyed by the cell-killing (cytotoxic) action of the radiation. This approach can minimize the risk of radiation damage to healthy cells.","Stereotactic radio-surgery (gamma knife) for brain and other tumors does not use a knife, but very precisely targeted beams of gamma radiotherapy from hundreds of different angles. Only one session of radiotherapy, taking about four to five hours, is needed. For this treatment a specially made metal frame is attached to the head. Then, several scans and x-rays are carried out to find the precise area where the treatment is needed. During the radiotherapy for brain tumors, the patient lies with their head in a large helmet, which has hundreds of holes in it to allow the radiotherapy beams through. Related approaches permit positioning for the treatment of tumors in other areas of the body.","3. Immunotherapy","In the context of cancer treatment, immunotherapeutics, generally, rely on the use of immune effector cells and molecules to target and destroy cancer cells. Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u2122) is such an example. The immune effector may be, for example, an antibody specific for some marker on the surface of a tumor cell. The antibody alone may serve as an effector of therapy or it may recruit other cells to actually affect cell killing. The antibody also may be conjugated to a drug or toxin (chemotherapeutic, radionuclide, ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, etc.) and serve merely as a targeting agent. Alternatively, the effector may be a lymphocyte carrying a surface molecule that interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a tumor cell target. Various effector cells include cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The combination of therapeutic modalities, i.e., direct cytotoxic activity and inhibition or reduction of ErbB2 would provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of ErbB2 overexpressing cancers.","In one aspect of immunotherapy, the tumor or disease cell must bear some marker that is amenable to targeting, i.e., is not present on the majority of other cells. Many tumor markers exist and any of these may be suitable for targeting in the context of the present invention. Common tumor markers include carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate specific antigen, urinary tumor associated antigen, fetal antigen, tyrosinase (p97), gp68, TAG-72, HMFG, Sialyl Lewis Antigen, MucA, MucB, PLAP, estrogen receptor, laminin receptor, erb B and p155. An alternative aspect of immunotherapy is to combine anticancer effects with immune stimulatory effects. Immune stimulating molecules also exist including: cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, GM-CSF, gamma-IFN, chemokines such as MIP-1, MCP-1, IL-8 and growth factors such as FLT3 ligand. Combining immune stimulating molecules, either as proteins or using gene delivery in combination with a tumor suppressor such as MDA-7 has been shown to enhance anti-tumor effects (Ju et al., 2000). Moreover, antibodies against any of these compounds can be used to target the anti-cancer agents discussed herein.","Examples of immunotherapies currently under investigation or in use are immune adjuvants e.g., , dinitrochlorobenzene and aromatic compounds (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,801,005 and 5,739,169; Hui and Hashimoto, 1998; Christodoulides et al., 1998), cytokine therapy e.g., interferons \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3; IL-1, GM-CSF and TNF (Bukowski et al., 1998; Davidson et al., 1998; Hellstrand et al., 1998) gene therapy e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-2, p53 (Qin et al., 1998; Austin-Ward and Villaseca, 1998; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,880 and 5,846,945) and monoclonal antibodies e.g., anti-ganglioside GM2, anti-HER-2, anti-p185; Pietras et al., 1998; Hanibuchi et al., 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,311). Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a chimeric (mouse-human) monoclonal antibody that blocks the HER2-neu receptor. It possesses anti-tumor activity and has been approved for use in the treatment of malignant tumors (Dillman, 1999). A non-limiting list of several known anti-cancer immunotherapeutic agents and their targets includes (Generic Name\/Target) Cetuximab\/EGFR, Panitumuma\/EGFR, Trastuzumab\/erbB2 receptor, Bevacizumab\/VEGF, Alemtuzumab\/CD52, Gemtuzumab ozogamicin\/CD33, Rituximab\/CD20, Tositumomab\/CD20, Matuzumab\/EGFR, Ibritumomab tiuxetan\/CD20, Tositumomab\/CD20, HuPAM4\/MUC1, MORAb-009\/Mesothelin, G250\/carbonic anhydrase IX, mAb 8H9\/8H9 antigen, M195\/CD33, Ipilimumab\/CTLA4, HuLuc63\/CS1, Alemtuzumab\/CD53, Epratuzumab\/CD22, BC8\/CD45, HuJ591\/Prostate specific membrane antigen, hA20\/CD20, Lexatumumab\/TRAIL receptor-2, Pertuzumab\/HER-2 receptor, Mik-beta-1\/IL-2R, RAV12\/RAAG12, SGN-30\/CD30, AME-133v\/CD20, HeFi-1\/CD30, BMS-663513\/CD137, Volociximab\/anti-\u03b15\u03b21 integrin, GC1008\/TGF\u03b2, HCD122\/CD40, Siplizumab\/CD2, MORAb-003\/Folate receptor alpha, CNTO 328\/IL-6, MDX-060\/CD30, Ofatumumab\/CD20, and SGN-33\/CD33. It is contemplated that one or more of these therapies may be employed with the miRNA therapies described herein.","A number of different approaches for passive immunotherapy of cancer exist. They may be broadly categorized into the following: injection of antibodies alone; injection of antibodies coupled to toxins or chemotherapeutic agents; injection of antibodies coupled to radioactive isotopes; injection of anti-idiotype antibodies; and finally, purging of tumor cells in bone marrow.","4. Gene Therapy","In yet another embodiment, a combination treatment involves gene therapy in which a therapeutic polynucleotide is administered before, after, or at the same time as one or more therapeutic miRNA. Delivery of a therapeutic polypeptide or encoding nucleic acid in conjunction with a miRNA may have a combined therapeutic effect on target tissues. A variety of proteins are encompassed within the invention, some of which are described below. Various genes that may be targeted for gene therapy of some form in combination with the present invention include, but are not limited to inducers of cellular proliferation, inhibitors of cellular proliferation, regulators of programmed cell death, cytokines and other therapeutic nucleic acids or nucleic acid that encode therapeutic proteins.","The tumor suppressor oncogenes function to inhibit excessive cellular proliferation. The inactivation of these genes destroys their inhibitory activity, resulting in unregulated proliferation. The tumor suppressors (e.g., therapeutic polypeptides) p53, FHIT, p16 and C-CAM can be employed.","In addition to p53, another inhibitor of cellular proliferation is p16. The major transitions of the eukaryotic cell cycle are triggered by cyclin-dependent kinases, or CDK's. One CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), regulates progression through the G1. The activity of this enzyme may be to phosphorylate Rb at late G1. The activity of CDK4 is controlled by an activating subunit, D-type cyclin, and by an inhibitory subunit, the p16INK4 has been biochemically characterized as a protein that specifically binds to and inhibits CDK4, and thus may regulate Rb phosphorylation (Serrano et al., 1993; Serrano et al., 1995). Since the p16INK4 protein is a CDK4 inhibitor (Serrano, 1993), deletion of this gene may increase the activity of CDK4, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of the Rb protein. p16 also is known to regulate the function of CDK6.","p16INK4 belongs to a newly described class of CDK-inhibitory proteins that also includes p16B, p19, p21WAF1, and p27KIP1. The p16INK4 gene maps to 9p21, a chromosome region frequently deleted in many tumor types. Homozygous deletions and mutations of the p16INK4 gene are frequent in human tumor cell lines. This evidence suggests that the p16INK4 gene is a tumor suppressor gene. This interpretation has been challenged, however, by the observation that the frequency of the p16INK4 gene alterations is much lower in primary uncultured tumors than in cultured cell lines (Caldas et al., 1994; Cheng et al., 1994; Hussussian et al., 1994; Kamb et al., 1994; Mori et al., 1994; Okamoto et al., 1994; Nobori et al., 1995; Orlow et al., 1994; Arap et al., 1995). Restoration of wild-type p16INK4 function by transfection with a plasmid expression vector reduced colony formation by some human cancer cell lines (Okamoto, 1994; Arap, 1995).","Other genes that may be employed according to the present invention include Rb, APC, DCC, NF-1, NF-2, WT-1, MEN-I, MEN-II, zac1, p73, VHL, MMAC1\/PTEN, DBCCR-1, FCC, rsk-3, p27, p27\/p16 fusions, p21\/p27 fusions, anti-thrombotic genes (e.g., COX-1, TFPI), PGS, Dp, E2F, ras, myc, neu, raf, erb, fms, trk, ret, gsp, hst, abl, E1A, p300, genes involved in angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF, FGF, thrombospondin, BAI-1, GDAIF, or their receptors) and MCC.","5. Surgery","Approximately 60% of persons with cancer will undergo surgery of some type, which includes preventative, diagnostic or staging, curative and palliative surgery. Curative surgery is a cancer treatment that may be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as the treatment of the present invention, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy and\/or alternative therapies.","Curative surgery includes resection in which all or part of cancerous tissue is physically removed, excised, and\/or destroyed. Tumor resection refers to physical removal of at least part of a tumor. In addition to tumor resection, treatment by surgery includes laser surgery, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and microscopically controlled surgery (Mohs' surgery). It is further contemplated that the present invention may be used in conjunction with removal of superficial cancers, precancers, or incidental amounts of normal tissue.","Upon excision of part of all of cancerous cells, tissue, or tumor, a cavity may be formed in the body. Treatment may be accomplished by perfusion, direct injection or local application of the area with an additional anti-cancer therapy. Such treatment may be repeated, for example, every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days, or every 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks or every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months. These treatments may be of varying dosages as well.","6. Other Agents","It is contemplated that other agents may be used in combination with the present invention to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment. These additional agents include immunomodulatory agents, agents that affect the upregulation of cell surface receptors and GAP junctions, cytostatic and differentiation agents, inhibitors of cell adhesion, agents that increase the sensitivity of the hyperproliferative cells to apoptotic inducers, or other biological agents. Immunomodulatory agents include tumor necrosis factor; interferon alpha, beta, and gamma; IL-2 and other cytokines; F42K and other cytokine analogs; or MIP-1, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, RANTES, and other chemokines. It is further contemplated that the upregulation of cell surface receptors or their ligands such as Fas\/Fas ligand, DR4 or DR5\/TRAIL (Apo-2 ligand) would potentiate the apoptotic inducing abilities of the present invention by establishment of an autocrine or paracrine effect on hyperproliferative cells. Increases intercellular signaling by elevating the number of GAP junctions would increase the anti-hyperproliferative effects on the neighboring hyperproliferative cell population. In other embodiments, cytostatic or differentiation agents can be used in combination with the present invention to improve the anti-hyperproliferative efficacy of the treatments. Inhibitors of cell adhesion are contemplated to improve the efficacy of the present invention. Examples of cell adhesion inhibitors are focal adhesion kinase (FAKs) inhibitors and Lovastatin. It is further contemplated that other agents that increase the sensitivity of a hyperproliferative cell to apoptosis, such as the antibody c225, could be used in combination with the present invention to improve the treatment efficacy.","Apo2 ligand (Apo2L, also called TRAIL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family. TRAIL activates rapid apoptosis in many types of cancer cells, yet is not toxic to normal cells. TRAIL mRNA occurs in a wide variety of tissues. Most normal cells appear to be resistant to TRAIL's cytotoxic action, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that can protect against apoptosis induction by TRAIL. The first receptor described for TRAIL, called death receptor 4 (DR4), contains a cytoplasmic \u201cdeath domain\u201d; DR4 transmits the apoptosis signal carried by TRAIL. Additional receptors have been identified that bind to TRAIL. One receptor, called DR5, contains a cytoplasmic death domain and signals apoptosis much like DR4. The DR4 and DR5 mRNAs are expressed in many normal tissues and tumor cell lines. Recently, decoy receptors such as DcR1 and DcR2 have been identified that prevent TRAIL from inducing apoptosis through DR4 and DR5. These decoy receptors thus represent a novel mechanism for regulating sensitivity to a pro-apoptotic cytokine directly at the cell's surface. The preferential expression of these inhibitory receptors in normal tissues suggests that TRAIL may be useful as an anticancer agent that induces apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal cells. (Marsters et al., 1999).","There have been many advances in the therapy of cancer following the introduction of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. However, one of the consequences of chemotherapy is the development\/acquisition of drug-resistant phenotypes and the development of multiple drug resistance. The development of drug resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of such tumors and therefore, there is an obvious need for alternative approaches such as gene therapy.","Another form of therapy for use in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biological therapy includes hyperthermia, which is a procedure in which a patient's tissue is exposed to high temperatures (up to 106\u00b0 F.). External or internal heating devices may be involved in the application of local, regional, or whole-body hyperthermia. Local hyperthermia involves the application of heat to a small area, such as a tumor. Heat may be generated externally with high-frequency waves targeting a tumor from a device outside the body. Internal heat may involve a sterile probe, including thin, heated wires or hollow tubes filled with warm water, implanted microwave antennae, or radiofrequency electrodes.","A patient's organ or a limb is heated for regional therapy, which is accomplished using devices that produce high energy, such as magnets. Alternatively, some of the patient's blood may be removed and heated before being perfused into an area that will be internally heated. Whole-body heating may also be implemented in cases where cancer has spread throughout the body. Warm-water blankets, hot wax, inductive coils, and thermal chambers may be used for this purpose.","Hormonal therapy may also be used in conjunction with the present invention or in combination with any other cancer therapy previously described. The use of hormones may be employed in the treatment of certain cancers such as breast, prostate, ovarian, or cervical cancer to lower the level or block the effects of certain hormones such as testosterone or estrogen. This treatment is often used in combination with at least one other cancer therapy as a treatment option or to reduce the risk of metastases.","This application incorporates U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/349,727 filed on Feb. 8, 2006 claiming priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/650,807 filed Feb. 8, 2005 herein by references in its entirety.","III. miRNA Molecules","MicroRNA molecules (\u201cmiRNAs\u201d) are generally 21 to 22 nucleotides in length, though lengths of 19 and up to 23 nucleotides have been reported. The miRNAs are each processed from a longer precursor RNA molecule (\u201cprecursor miRNA\u201d). Precursor miRNAs are transcribed from non-protein-encoding genes. The precursor miRNAs have two regions of complementarity that enables them to form a stem-loop- or fold-back-like structure, which is cleaved in animals by a ribonuclease III-like nuclease enzyme called Dicer. The processed miRNA is typically a portion of the stem.","The processed miRNA (also referred to as \u201cmature miRNA\u201d) becomes part of a large complex to down-regulate a particular target gene or its gene product. Examples of animal miRNAs include those that imperfectly basepair with the target, which halts translation (Olsen et al., 1999; Seggerson et al., 2002). siRNA molecules also are processed by Dicer, but from a long, double-stranded RNA molecule. siRNAs are not naturally found in animal cells, but they can direct the sequence-specific cleavage of an mRNA target through a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Denli et al., 2003).","A. Array Preparation","Certain embodiments of the present invention concerns the preparation and use of mRNA or nucleic acid arrays, miRNA or nucleic acid arrays, and\/or miRNA or nucleic acid probe arrays, which are macroarrays or microarrays of nucleic acid molecules (probes) that are fully or nearly complementary (over the length of the prove) or identical (over the length of the prove) to a plurality of nucleic acid, mRNA or miRNA molecules, precursor miRNA molecules, or nucleic acids derived from the various genes and gene pathways modulated by miR-124 miRNAs and that are positioned on a support or support material in a spatially separated organization. Macroarrays are typically sheets of nitrocellulose or nylon upon which probes have been spotted. Microarrays position the nucleic acid probes more densely such that up to 10,000 nucleic acid molecules can be fit into a region typically 1 to 4 square centimeters. Microarrays can be fabricated by spotting nucleic acid molecules, e.g., genes, oligonucleotides, etc., onto substrates or fabricating oligonucleotide sequences in situ on a substrate. Spotted or fabricated nucleic acid molecules can be applied in a high density matrix pattern of up to about 30 non-identical nucleic acid molecules per square centimeter or higher, e.g. up to about 100 or even 1000 per square centimeter. Microarrays typically use coated glass as the solid support, in contrast to the nitrocellulose-based material of filter arrays. By having an ordered array of marker RNA and\/or miRNA-complementing nucleic acid samples, the position of each sample can be tracked and linked to the original sample.","A variety of different array devices in which a plurality of distinct nucleic acid probes are stably associated with the surface of a solid support are known to those of skill in the art. Useful substrates for arrays include nylon, glass, metal, plastic, latex, and silicon. Such arrays may vary in a number of different ways, including average probe length, sequence or types of probes, nature of bond between the probe and the array surface, e.g. covalent or non-covalent, and the like. The labeling and screening methods of the present invention and the arrays are not limited in its utility with respect to any parameter except that the probes detect miRNA, or genes or nucleic acid representative of genes; consequently, methods and compositions may be used with a variety of different types of nucleic acid arrays.","Representative methods and apparatus for preparing a microarray have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,143,854; 5,202,231; 5,242,974; 5,288,644; 5,324,633; 5,384,261; 5,405,783; 5,412,087; 5,424,186; 5,429,807; 5,432,049; 5,436,327; 5,445,934; 5,468,613; 5,470,710; 5,472,672; 5,492,806; 5,525,464; 5,503,980; 5,510,270; 5,525,464; 5,527,681; 5,529,756; 5,532,128; 5,545,531; 5,547,839; 5,554,501; 5,556,752; 5,561,071; 5,571,639; 5,580,726; 5,580,732; 5,593,839; 5,599,695; 5,599,672; 5,610,287; 5,624,711; 5,631,134; 5,639,603; 5,654,413; 5,658,734; 5,661,028; 5,665,547; 5,667,972; 5,695,940; 5,700,637; 5,744,305; 5,800,992; 5,807,522; 5,830,645; 5,837,196; 5,871,928; 5,847,219; 5,876,932; 5,919,626; 6,004,755; 6,087,102; 6,368,799; 6,383,749; 6,617,112; 6,638,717; 6,720,138, as well as WO 93\/17126; WO 95\/11995; WO 95\/21265; WO 95\/21944; WO 95\/35505; WO 96\/31622; WO 97\/10365; WO 97\/27317; WO 99\/35505; WO 09923256; WO 09936760; WO0138580; WO 0168255; WO 03020898; WO 03040410; WO 03053586; WO 03087297; WO 03091426; WO03100012; WO 04020085; WO 04027093; EP 373 203; EP 785 280; EP 799 897 and UK 8 803 000; the disclosures of which are all herein incorporated by reference.","It is contemplated that the arrays can be high density arrays, such that they contain 2, 20, 25, 50, 80, 100 or more different probes. It is contemplated that they may contain 1000, 16,000, 65,000, 250,000 or 1,000,000 or more different probes. The probes can be directed to mRNA and\/or miRNA targets in one or more different organisms or cell types. The oligonucleotide probes range from 5 to 50, 5 to 45, 10 to 40, 9 to 34, or 15 to 40 nucleotides in length in some embodiments. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide probes are 5, 10, 15, to 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 nucleotides in length including all integers and ranges there between.","The location and sequence of each different probe sequence in the array are generally known. Moreover, the large number of different probes can occupy a relatively small area providing a high density array having a probe density of generally greater than about 60, 100, 600, 1000, 5,000, 10,000, 40,000, 100,000, or 400,000 different oligonucleotide probes per cm. The surface area of the array can be about or less than about 1, 1.6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 cm.","Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art could readily analyze data generated using an array. Such protocols are disclosed above, and include information found in WO 9743450; WO 03023058; WO 03022421; WO 03029485; WO 03067217; WO 03066906; WO 03076928; WO 03093810; WO 03100448A1, all of which are specifically incorporated by reference.","B. Sample Preparation","It is contemplated that the RNA and\/or miRNA of a wide variety of samples can be analyzed using the arrays, index of probes, or array technology of the invention. While endogenous miRNA is contemplated for use with compositions and methods of the invention, recombinant miRNA\u2014including nucleic acids that are complementary or identical to endogenous miRNA or precursor miRNA\u2014can also be handled and analyzed as described herein. Samples may be biological samples, in which case, they can be from biopsy, fine needle aspirates, exfoliates, blood, tissue, organs, semen, saliva, tears, other bodily fluid, hair follicles, skin, or any sample containing or constituting biological cells, particularly cancer or hyperproliferative cells. In certain embodiments, samples may be, but are not limited to, biopsy, or cells purified or enriched to some extent from a biopsy or other bodily fluids or tissues. Alternatively, the sample may not be a biological sample, but be a chemical mixture, such as a cell-free reaction mixture (which may contain one or more biological enzymes).","C. Hybridization","After an array or a set of probes is prepared and\/or the nucleic acid in the sample or probe is labeled, the population of target nucleic acids is contacted with the array or probes under hybridization conditions, where such conditions can be adjusted, as desired, to provide for an optimum level of specificity in view of the particular assay being performed. Suitable hybridization conditions are well known to those of skill in the art and reviewed in Sambrook et al. (2001) and WO 95\/21944. Of particular interest in many embodiments is the use of stringent conditions during hybridization. Stringent conditions are known to those of skill in the art.","It is specifically contemplated that a single array or set of probes may be contacted with multiple samples. The samples may be labeled with different labels to distinguish the samples. For example, a single array can be contacted with a tumor tissue sample labeled with Cy3, and normal tissue sample labeled with Cy5. Differences between the samples for particular miRNAs corresponding to probes on the array can be readily ascertained and quantified.","The small surface area of the array permits uniform hybridization conditions, such as temperature regulation and salt content. Moreover, because of the small area occupied by the high density arrays, hybridization may be carried out in extremely small fluid volumes (e.g., about 250 \u03bcl or less, including volumes of about or less than about 5, 10, 25, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 \u03bcl, or any range derivable therein). In small volumes, hybridization may proceed very rapidly.","D. Differential Expression Analyses","Arrays of the invention can be used to detect differences between two samples. Specifically contemplated applications include identifying and\/or quantifying differences between miRNA or gene expression from a sample that is normal and from a sample that is not normal, between a disease or condition and a cell not exhibiting such a disease or condition, or between two differently treated samples. Also, miRNA or gene expression may be compared between a sample believed to be susceptible to a particular disease or condition and one believed to be not susceptible or resistant to that disease or condition. A sample that is not normal is one exhibiting phenotypic or genotypic trait(s) of a disease or condition, or one believed to be not normal with respect to that disease or condition. It may be compared to a cell that is normal with respect to that disease or condition. Phenotypic traits include symptoms of, or susceptibility to, a disease or condition of which a component is or may or may not be genetic, or caused by a hyperproliferative or neoplastic cell or cells.","An array comprises a solid support with nucleic acid probes attached to the support. Arrays typically comprise a plurality of different nucleic acid probes that are coupled to a surface of a substrate in different, known locations. These arrays, also described as \u201cmicroarrays\u201d or colloquially \u201cchips\u201d have been generally described in the art, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,143,854, 5,445,934, 5,744,305, 5,677,195, 6,040,193, 5,424,186 and Fodor et al., (1991), each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Techniques for the synthesis of these arrays using mechanical synthesis methods are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Although a planar array surface is used in certain aspects, the array may be fabricated on a surface of virtually any shape or even a multiplicity of surfaces. Arrays may be nucleic acids on beads, gels, polymeric surfaces, fibers such as fiber optics, glass or any other appropriate substrate, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,358, 5,789,162, 5,708,153, 6,040,193 and 5,800,992, which are hereby incorporated in their entirety for all purposes. Arrays may be packaged in such a manner as to allow for diagnostics or other manipulation of an all inclusive device, see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,856,174 and 5,922,591 incorporated in their entirety by reference for all purposes. See also U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/545,207, filed Apr. 7, 2000 for additional information concerning arrays, their manufacture, and their characteristics, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","Particularly, arrays can be used to evaluate samples with respect to pathological condition such as cancer and related conditions. It is specifically contemplated that the invention can be used to evaluate differences between stages or sub-classifications of disease, such as between benign, cancerous, and metastatic tissues or tumors.","Phenotypic traits to be assessed include characteristics such as longevity, morbidity, expected survival, susceptibility or receptivity to particular drugs or therapeutic treatments (drug efficacy), and risk of drug toxicity. Samples that differ in these phenotypic traits may also be evaluated using the compositions and methods described.","In certain embodiments, miRNA and\/or expression profiles may be generated to evaluate and correlate those profiles with pharmacokinetics or therapies. For example, these profiles may be created and evaluated for patient tumor and blood samples prior to the patient's being treated or during treatment to determine if there are miRNA or genes whose expression correlates with the outcome of the patient's treatment. Identification of differential miRNAs or genes can lead to a diagnostic assay for evaluation of tumor and\/or blood samples to determine what drug regimen the patient should be provided. In addition, it can be used to identify or select patients suitable for a particular clinical trial. If an expression profile is determined to be correlated with drug efficacy or drug toxicity, that profile is relevant to whether that patient is an appropriate patient for receiving a drug, for receiving a combination of drugs, or for a particular dosage of the drug.","In addition to the above prognostic assay, samples from patients with a variety of diseases can be evaluated to determine if different diseases can be identified based on miRNA and\/or related gene expression levels. A diagnostic assay can be created based on the profiles that doctors can use to identify individuals with a disease or who are at risk to develop a disease. Alternatively, treatments can be designed based on miRNA profiling. Examples of such methods and compositions are described in the U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled \u201cMethods and Compositions Involving miRNA and miRNA Inhibitor Molecules\u201d filed on May 23, 2005 in the names of David Brown, Lance Ford, Angie Cheng and Rich Jarvis, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","E. Other Assays","In addition to the use of arrays and microarrays, it is contemplated that a number of different assays could be employed to analyze miRNAs or related genes, their activities, and their effects. Such assays include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid amplification, polymerase chain reaction, quantitative PCR, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Northern hybridization, hybridization protection assay (HPA) (GenProbe), branched DNA (bDNA) assay (Chiron), rolling circle amplification (RCA), single molecule hybridization detection (US Genomics), Invader assay (ThirdWave Technologies), and\/or Bridge Litigation Assay (Genaco).","IV. Nucleic Acids","The present invention concerns nucleic acids, modified or mimetic nucleic acids, miRNAs, mRNAs, genes, and representative fragments thereof that can be labeled, used in array analysis, or employed in diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic applications, particularly those related to pathological conditions such as cancer. The molecules may have been endogenously produced by a cell, or been synthesized or produced chemically or recombinantly. They may be isolated and\/or purified. Each of the miRNAs described herein and includes the corresponding SEQ ID NO and accession numbers for these miRNA sequences. The name of a miRNA is often abbreviated and referred to without a \u201chsa-\u201d prefix and will be understood as such, depending on the context. Unless otherwise indicated, miRNAs referred to in the application are human sequences identified as miR-X or let-X, where X is a number and\/or letter.","In certain aspects, a miRNA probe designated by a suffix \u201c5P\u201d or \u201c3P\u201d can be used. \u201c5P\u201d indicates that the mature miRNA derives from the 5\u2032 end of the precursor and a corresponding \u201c3P\u201d indicates that it derives from the 3\u2032 end of the precursor, as described on the world wide web at sanger.ac.uk. Moreover, in some embodiments, a miRNA probe is used that does not correspond to a known human miRNA. It is contemplated that these non-human miRNA probes may be used in embodiments of the invention or that there may exist a human miRNA that is homologous to the non-human miRNA. In other embodiments, any mammalian cell, biological sample, or preparation thereof may be employed.","In some embodiments of the invention, methods and compositions involving miRNA may concern miRNA, markers (mRNAs), and\/or other nucleic acids.

Such lengths cover the lengths of processed miRNA, miRNA probes, precursor miRNA, miRNA containing vectors, mRNA, mRNA probes, control nucleic acids, and other probes and primers.","In many embodiments, miRNA are 19-24 nucleotides in length, while miRNA probes are 19-35 nucleotides in length, depending on the length of the processed miRNA and any flanking regions added. miRNA precursors are generally between 62 and 110 nucleotides in humans.","Nucleic acids of the invention may have regions of identity or complementarity to another nucleic acid. It is contemplated that the region of complementarity or identity can be at least 5 contiguous residues, though it is specifically contemplated that the region is, is at least, or is at most 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 441, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 950, 960, 970, 980, 990, or 1000 contiguous nucleotides. It is further understood that the length of complementarity within a precursor miRNA or other nucleic acid or between a miRNA probe and a miRNA or a miRNA gene are such lengths. Moreover, the complementarity may be expressed as a percentage, meaning that the complementarity between a probe and its target is 90% or greater over the length of the probe. In some embodiments, complementarity is or is at least 90%, 95% or 100%. In particular, such lengths may be applied to any nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence identified in any of SEQ ID NOs described herein, accession number, or any other sequence disclosed herein. Typically, the commonly used name of the miRNA is given (with its identifying source in the prefix, for example, \u201chsa\u201d for human sequences) and the processed miRNA sequence. Unless otherwise indicated, a miRNA without a prefix will be understood to refer to a human miRNA. Moreover, a lowercase letter in a miRNA name may or may not be lowercase; for example, hsa-mir-130b can also be referred to as miR-130B. The term \u201cmiRNA probe\u201d refers to a nucleic acid probe that can identify a particular miRNA or structurally related miRNAs.","It is understood that some nucleic acids are derived from genomic sequences or a gene. In this respect, the term \u201cgene\u201d is used for simplicity to refer to the genomic sequence encoding the precursor nucleic acid or miRNA for a given miRNA or gene. However, embodiments of the invention may involve genomic sequences of a miRNA that are involved in its expression, such as a promoter or other regulatory sequences.","The term \u201crecombinant\u201d may be used and this generally refers to a molecule that has been manipulated in vitro or that is a replicated or expressed product of such a molecule.","The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d is well known in the art. A \u201cnucleic acid\u201d as used herein will generally refer to a molecule (one or more strands) of DNA, RNA or a derivative or analog thereof, comprising a nucleobase. A nucleobase includes, for example, a naturally occurring purine or pyrimidine base found in DNA (e.g., an adenine \u201cA,\u201d a guanine \u201cG,\u201d a thymine \u201cT\u201d or a cytosine \u201cC\u201d) or RNA (e.g., an A, a G, an uracil \u201cU\u201d or a C). The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d encompasses the terms \u201coligonucleotide\u201d and \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d each as a subgenus of the term \u201cnucleic acid.\u201d","The term \u201cmiRNA\u201d generally refers to a single-stranded molecule, but in specific embodiments, molecules implemented in the invention will also encompass a region or an additional strand that is partially (between 10 and 50% complementary across length of strand), substantially (greater than 50% but less than 100% complementary across length of strand) or fully complementary to another region of the same single-stranded molecule or to another nucleic acid. Thus, nucleic acids of the invention may encompass a molecule that comprises one or more complementary or self-complementary strand(s) or \u201ccomplement(s)\u201d of a particular sequence. For example, precursor miRNA may have a self-complementary region, which is up to 100% complementary. miRNA probes or nucleic acids of the invention can include, can be or can be at least 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% complementary to their target.","It is understood that a \u201csynthetic nucleic acid\u201d of the invention means that the nucleic acid does not have all or part of a chemical structure or sequence of a naturally occurring nucleic acid. Consequently, it will be understood that the term \u201csynthetic miRNA\u201d refers to a \u201csynthetic nucleic acid\u201d that functions in a cell or under physiological conditions as a naturally occurring miRNA.","While embodiments of the invention may involve synthetic miRNAs or synthetic nucleic acids, in some embodiments of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule(s) need not be \u201csynthetic.\u201d In certain embodiments, a non-synthetic nucleic acid or miRNA employed in methods and compositions of the invention may have the entire sequence and structure of a naturally occurring mRNA or miRNA precursor or the mature mRNA or miRNA. For example, non-synthetic miRNAs used in methods and compositions of the invention may not have one or more modified nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. In these embodiments, the non-synthetic miRNA may or may not be recombinantly produced. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid in methods and\/or compositions of the invention is specifically a synthetic miRNA and not a non-synthetic miRNA (that is, not a miRNA that qualifies as \u201csynthetic\u201d); though in other embodiments, the invention specifically involves a non-synthetic miRNA and not a synthetic miRNA. Any embodiments discussed with respect to the use of synthetic miRNAs can be applied with respect to non-synthetic miRNAs, and vice versa.","It will be understood that the term \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d refers to something found in an organism without any intervention by a person; it could refer to a naturally-occurring wildtype or mutant molecule. In some embodiments a synthetic miRNA molecule does not have the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA molecule. In other embodiments, a synthetic miRNA molecule may have the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA molecule, but the chemical structure of the molecule, particularly in the part unrelated specifically to the precise sequence (non-sequence chemical structure) differs from chemical structure of the naturally occurring miRNA molecule with that sequence. In some cases, the synthetic miRNA has both a sequence and non-sequence chemical structure that are not found in a naturally-occurring miRNA. Moreover, the sequence of the synthetic molecules will identify which miRNA is effectively being provided or inhibited; the endogenous miRNA will be referred to as the \u201ccorresponding miRNA.\u201d Corresponding miRNA sequences that can be used in the context of the invention include, but are not limited to, all or a portion of those sequences in the SEQ IDs provided herein, as well as any other miRNA sequence, miRNA precursor sequence, or any sequence complementary thereof. In some embodiments, the sequence is or is derived from or contains all or part of a sequence identified herein to target a particular miRNA (or set of miRNAs) that can be used with that sequence. Any 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260 or any number or range of sequences there between may be selected to the exclusion of all non-selected sequences.","As used herein, \u201chybridization\u201d, \u201chybridizes\u201d or \u201ccapable of hybridizing\u201d is understood to mean the forming of a double or triple stranded molecule or a molecule with partial double or triple stranded nature. The term \u201canneal\u201d as used herein is synonymous with \u201chybridize.\u201d The term \u201chybridization\u201d, \u201chybridize(s)\u201d or \u201ccapable of hybridizing\u201d encompasses the terms \u201cstringent condition(s)\u201d or \u201chigh stringency\u201d and the terms \u201clow stringency\u201d or \u201clow stringency condition(s).\u201d","As used herein \u201cstringent condition(s)\u201d or \u201chigh stringency\u201d are those conditions that allow hybridization between or within one or more nucleic acid strand(s) containing complementary sequence(s), but preclude hybridization of random sequences. Stringent conditions tolerate little, if any, mismatch between a nucleic acid and a target strand. Such conditions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are preferred for applications requiring high selectivity. Non-limiting applications include isolating a nucleic acid, such as a gene or a nucleic acid segment thereof, or detecting at least one specific mRNA transcript or a nucleic acid segment thereof, and the like.","Stringent conditions may comprise low salt and\/or high temperature conditions, such as provided by about 0.02 M to about 0.5 M NaCl at temperatures of about 42\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. It is understood that the temperature and ionic strength of a desired stringency are determined in part by the length of the particular nucleic acid(s), the length and nucleobase content of the target sequence(s), the charge composition of the nucleic acid(s), and to the presence or concentration of formamide, tetramethylammonium chloride or other solvent(s) in a hybridization mixture.","It is also understood that these ranges, compositions and conditions for hybridization are mentioned by way of non-limiting examples only, and that the desired stringency for a particular hybridization reaction is often determined empirically by comparison to one or more positive or negative controls. Depending on the application envisioned it is preferred to employ varying conditions of hybridization to achieve varying degrees of selectivity of a nucleic acid towards a target sequence. In a non-limiting example, identification or isolation of a related target nucleic acid that does not hybridize to a nucleic acid under stringent conditions may be achieved by hybridization at low temperature and\/or high ionic strength. Such conditions are termed \u201clow stringency\u201d or \u201clow stringency conditions,\u201d and non-limiting examples of low stringency include hybridization performed at about 0.15 M to about 0.9 M NaCl at a temperature range of about 20\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. Of course, it is within the skill of one in the art to further modify the low or high stringency conditions to suite a particular application.","A. Nucleobase, Nucleoside, Nucleotide, and Modified Nucleotides","As used herein a \u201cnucleobase\u201d refers to a heterocyclic base, such as for example a naturally occurring nucleobase (i.e., an A, T, G, C or U) found in at least one naturally occurring nucleic acid (i.e., DNA and RNA), and naturally or non-naturally occurring derivative(s) and analogs of such a nucleobase. A nucleobase generally can form one or more hydrogen bonds (\u201canneal\u201d or \u201chybridize\u201d) with at least one naturally occurring nucleobase in a manner that may substitute for naturally occurring nucleobase pairing (e.g., the hydrogen bonding between A and T, Gand C, and Aand U).","\u201cPurine\u201d and\/or \u201cpyrimidine\u201d nucleobase(s) encompass naturally occurring purine and\/or pyrimidine nucleobases and also derivative(s) and analog(s) thereof, including but not limited to, those a purine or pyrimidine substituted by one or more of an alkyl, carboxyalkyl, amino, hydroxyl, halogen (i.e., fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo), thiol or alkylthiol moiety. Preferred alkyl (e.g., alkyl, carboxyalkyl, etc.) moieties comprise of from about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, to about 6 carbon atoms. Other non-limiting examples of a purine or pyrimidine include a deazapurine, a 2,6-diaminopurine, a 5-fluorouracil, a xanthine, a hypoxanthine, a 8-bromoguanine, a 8-chloroguanine, a bromothymine, a 8-aminoguanine, a 8-hydroxyguanine, a 8-methylguanine, a 8-thioguanine, an azaguanine, a 2-aminopurine, a 5-ethylcytosine, a 5-methylcyosine, a 5-bromouracil, a 5-ethyluracil, a 5-iodouracil, a 5-chlorouracil, a 5-propyluracil, a thiouracil, a 2-methyladenine, a methylthioadenine, a N,N-dimethyladenine, an azaadenines, a 8-bromoadenine, a 8-hydroxyadenine, a 6-hydroxyaminopurine, a 6-thiopurine, a 4-(6-aminohexyl\/cytosine), and the like. Other examples are well known to those of skill in the art.","As used herein, a \u201cnucleoside\u201d refers to an individual chemical unit comprising a nucleobase covalently attached to a nucleobase linker moiety. A non-limiting example of a \u201cnucleobase linker moiety\u201d is a sugar comprising 5-carbon atoms (i.e., a \u201c5-carbon sugar\u201d), including but not limited to a deoxyribose, a ribose, an arabinose, or a derivative or an analog of a 5-carbon sugar. Non-limiting examples of a derivative or an analog of a 5-carbon sugar include a 2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyribose or a carbocyclic sugar where a carbon is substituted for an oxygen atom in the sugar ring. Different types of covalent attachment(s) of a nucleobase to a nucleobase linker moiety are known in the art (Kornberg and Baker, 1992).","As used herein, a \u201cnucleotide\u201d refers to a nucleoside further comprising a \u201cbackbone moiety\u201d. A backbone moiety generally covalently attaches a nucleotide to another molecule comprising a nucleotide, or to another nucleotide to form a nucleic acid. The \u201cbackbone moiety\u201d in naturally occurring nucleotides typically comprises a phosphorus moiety, which is covalently attached to a 5-carbon sugar. The attachment of the backbone moiety typically occurs at either the 3\u2032- or 5\u2032-position of the 5-carbon sugar. However, other types of attachments are known in the art, particularly when a nucleotide comprises derivatives or analogs of a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar or phosphorus moiety.","A nucleic acid may comprise, or be composed entirely of, a derivative or analog of a nucleobase, a nucleobase linker moiety and\/or backbone moiety that may be present in a naturally occurring nucleic acid. RNA with nucleic acid analogs may also be labeled according to methods of the invention. As used herein a \u201cderivative\u201d refers to a chemically modified or altered form of a naturally occurring molecule, while the terms \u201cmimic\u201d or \u201canalog\u201d refer to a molecule that may or may not structurally resemble a naturally occurring molecule or moiety, but possesses similar functions. As used herein, a \u201cmoiety\u201d generally refers to a smaller chemical or molecular component of a larger chemical or molecular structure. Nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs or derivatives are well known in the art, and have been described (see for example, Scheit, 1980, incorporated herein by reference).","Additional non-limiting examples of nucleosides, nucleotides or nucleic acids include","those in: U.S. Pat.

Such nucleotides include those that can be labeled with a dye, including a fluorescent dye, or with a molecule such as biotin. Labeled nucleotides are readily available; they can be acquired commercially or they can be synthesized by reactions known to those of skill in the art.","Modified nucleotides for use in the invention are not naturally occurring nucleotides, but instead, refer to prepared nucleotides that have a reactive moiety on them. Specific reactive functionalities of interest include: amino, sulfhydryl, sulfoxyl, aminosulfhydryl, azido, epoxide, isothiocyanate, isocyanate, anhydride, monochlorotriazine, dichlorotriazine, mono- or dihalogen substituted pyridine, mono- or disubstituted diazine, maleimide, epoxide, aziridine, sulfonyl halide, acid halide, alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkylsulfonate, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, imido ester, hydrazine, azidonitrophenyl, azide, 3-(2-pyridyl dithio)-propionamide, glyoxal, aldehyde, iodoacetyl, cyanomethyl ester, p-nitrophenyl ester, o-nitrophenyl ester, hydroxypyridine ester, carbonyl imidazole, and the other such chemical groups. In some embodiments, the reactive functionality may be bonded directly to a nucleotide, or it may be bonded to the nucleotide through a linking group. The functional moiety and any linker cannot substantially impair the ability of the nucleotide to be added to the miRNA or to be labeled. Representative linking groups include carbon containing linking groups, typically ranging from about 2 to 18, usually from about 2 to 8 carbon atoms, where the carbon containing linking groups may or may not include one or more heteroatoms, e.g. S, O, N etc., and may or may not include one or more sites of unsaturation. Of particular interest in many embodiments is alkyl linking groups, typically lower alkyl linking groups of 1 to 16, usually 1 to 4 carbon atoms, where the linking groups may include one or more sites of unsaturation. The functionalized nucleotides (or primers) used in the above methods of functionalized target generation may be fabricated using known protocols or purchased from commercial vendors, e.g., Sigma, Roche, Ambion, Biosearch Technologies and NEN. Functional groups may be prepared according to ways known to those of skill in the art, including the representative information found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,404,289; 4,405,711; 4,337,063 and 5,268,486, and U.K. Patent 1,529,202, which are all incorporated by reference.","Amine-modified nucleotides are used in several embodiments of the invention. The amine-modified nucleotide is a nucleotide that has a reactive amine group for attachment of the label. It is contemplated that any ribonucleotide (G, A, U, or C) or deoxyribonucleotide (G, A, T, or C) can be modified for labeling. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following modified ribo- and deoxyribo-nucleotides: 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP; 8-[(4-amino)butyl]-amino-ATP and 8-[(6-amino)butyl]-amino-ATP; N6-(4-amino)butyl-ATP, N6-(6-amino)butyl-ATP, N4-[2,2-oxy-bis-(ethylamine)]-CTP; N6-(6-Amino)hexyl-ATP; 8-[(6-Amino)hexyl]-amino-ATP; 5-propargylamino-CTP, 5-propargylamino-UTP; 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP; 8-[(4-amino)butyl]-amino-dATP and 8-[(6-amino)butyl]-amino-dATP; N6-(4-amino)butyl-dATP, N6-(6-amino)butyl-dATP, N4-[2,2-oxy-bis-(ethylamine)]-dCTP; N6-(6-Amino)hexyl-dATP; 8-[(6-Amino)hexyl]-amino-dATP; 5-propargylamino-dCTP, and 5-propargylamino-dUTP. Such nucleotides can be prepared according to methods known to those of skill in the art. Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art could prepare other nucleotide entities with the same amine-modification, such as a 5-(3-aminoallyl)-CTP, GTP, ATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, or dUTP in place of a 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP.","B. Preparation of Nucleic Acids","A nucleic acid may be made by any technique known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as for example, chemical synthesis, enzymatic production, or biological production. It is specifically contemplated that miRNA probes of the invention are chemically synthesized.","In some embodiments of the invention, miRNAs are recovered or isolated from a biological sample. The miRNA may be recombinant or it may be natural or endogenous to the cell (produced from the cell's genome). It is contemplated that a biological sample may be treated in a way so as to enhance the recovery of small RNA molecules such as miRNA. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/667,126 describes such methods and it is specifically incorporated by reference herein. Generally, methods involve lysing cells with a solution having guanidinium and a detergent.","Alternatively, nucleic acid synthesis is performed according to standard methods. See, for example, Itakura and Riggs (1980) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,704,362, 5,221,619, and 5,583,013, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

These include the use of vectors (viral and non-viral), plasmids, cosmids, and other vehicles for delivering a nucleic acid to a cell, which may be the target cell (e.g., a cancer cell) or simply a host cell (to produce large quantities of the desired RNA molecule). Alternatively, such vehicles can be used in the context of a cell free system so long as the reagents for generating the RNA molecule are present. Such methods include those described in Sambrook, 2003, Sambrook, 2001 and Sambrook, 1989, which are hereby incorporated by reference.","C. Isolation of Nucleic Acids","Nucleic acids may be isolated using techniques well known to those of skill in the art, though in particular embodiments, methods for isolating small nucleic acid molecules, and\/or isolating RNA molecules can be employed. Chromatography is a process often used to separate or isolate nucleic acids from protein or from other nucleic acids. Such methods can involve electrophoresis with a gel matrix, filter columns, alcohol precipitation, and\/or other chromatography. If miRNA from cells is to be used or evaluated, methods generally involve lysing the cells with a chaotropic (e.g., guanidinium isothiocyanate) and\/or detergent (e.g., N-lauroyl sarcosine) prior to implementing processes for isolating particular populations of RNA.","In particular methods for separating miRNA from other nucleic acids, a gel matrix is prepared using polyacrylamide, though agarose can also be used. The gels may be graded by concentration or they may be uniform. Plates or tubing can be used to hold the gel matrix for electrophoresis. Usually one-dimensional electrophoresis is employed for the separation of nucleic acids. Plates are used to prepare a slab gel, while the tubing (glass or rubber, typically) can be used to prepare a tube gel. The phrase \u201ctube electrophoresis\u201d refers to the use of a tube or tubing, instead of plates, to form the gel. Materials for implementing tube electrophoresis can be readily prepared by a person of skill in the art or purchased, such as from C.B.S. Scientific Co., Inc. or Scie-Plas.","Methods may involve the use of organic solvents and\/or alcohol to isolate nucleic acids, particularly miRNA used in methods and compositions of the invention. Some embodiments are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/667,126, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, this disclosure provides methods for efficiently isolating small RNA molecules from cells comprising: adding an alcohol solution to a cell lysate and applying the alcohol\/lysate mixture to a solid support before eluting the RNA molecules from the solid support. In some embodiments, the amount of alcohol added to a cell lysate achieves an alcohol concentration of about 55% to 60%. While different alcohols can be employed, ethanol works well. A solid support may be any structure, and it includes beads, filters, and columns, which may include a mineral or polymer support with electronegative groups. A glass fiber filter or column has worked particularly well for such isolation procedures.","In specific embodiments, miRNA isolation processes include: a) lysing cells in the sample with a lysing solution comprising guanidinium, wherein a lysate with a concentration of at least about 1 M guanidinium is produced; b) extracting miRNA molecules from the lysate with an extraction solution comprising phenol; c) adding to the lysate an alcohol solution for forming a lysate\/alcohol mixture, wherein the concentration of alcohol in the mixture is between about 35% to about 70%; d) applying the lysate\/alcohol mixture to a solid support; e) eluting the miRNA molecules from the solid support with an ionic solution; and, f) capturing the miRNA molecules. Typically the sample is dried and resuspended in a liquid and volume appropriate for subsequent manipulation.","V. Labels and Labeling Techniques","In some embodiments, the present invention concerns miRNA that are labeled. It is contemplated that miRNA may first be isolated and\/or purified prior to labeling. This may achieve a reaction that more efficiently labels the miRNA, as opposed to other RNA in a sample in which the miRNA is not isolated or purified prior to labeling. In many embodiments of the invention, the label is non-radioactive. Generally, nucleic acids may be labeled by adding labeled nucleotides (one-step process) or adding nucleotides and labeling the added nucleotides (two-step process).","A. Labeling Techniques","In some embodiments, nucleic acids are labeled by catalytically adding to the nucleic acid an already labeled nucleotide or nucleotides. One or more labeled nucleotides can be added to miRNA molecules. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,723,509, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In other embodiments, an unlabeled nucleotide or nucleotides is catalytically added to a miRNA, and the unlabeled nucleotide is modified with a chemical moiety that enables it to be subsequently labeled. In embodiments of the invention, the chemical moiety is a reactive amine such that the nucleotide is an amine-modified nucleotide. Examples of amine-modified nucleotides are well known to those of skill in the art, many being commercially available such as from Ambion, Sigma, Jena Bioscience, and TriLink.","In contrast to labeling of cDNA during its synthesis, the issue for labeling miRNA is how to label the already existing molecule. The present invention concerns the use of an enzyme capable of using a di- or tri-phosphate ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide as a substrate for its addition to a miRNA. Moreover, in specific embodiments, it involves using a modified di- or tri-phosphate ribonucleotide, which is added to the 3\u2032 end of a miRNA. Enzymes capable of adding such nucleotides include, but are not limited to, poly (A) polymerase, terminal transferase, and polynucleotide phosphorylase. In specific embodiments of the invention, a ligase is contemplated as not being the enzyme used to add the label, and instead, a non-ligase enzyme is employed. Terminal transferase catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to the 3\u2032 terminus of a nucleic acid. Polynucleotide phosphorylase can polymerize nucleotide diphosphates without the need for a primer.","B. Labels","Labels on miRNA or miRNA probes may be colorimetric (includes visible and UV spectrum, including fluorescent), luminescent, enzymatic, or positron emitting (including radioactive). The label may be detected directly or indirectly. Radioactive labels include I, P, P, and S. Examples of enzymatic labels include alkaline phosphatase, luciferase, horseradish peroxidase, and \u03b2-galactosidase. Labels can also be proteins with luminescent properties, e.g., green fluorescent protein and phycoerythrin.","The colorimetric and fluorescent labels contemplated for use as conjugates include, but are not limited to, Alexa Fluor dyes, BODIPY dyes, such as BODIPY FL; Cascade Blue; Cascade Yellow; coumarin and its derivatives, such as 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, aminocoumarin and hydroxycoumarin; cyanine dyes, such as Cy3 and Cy5; eosins and erythrosins; fluorescein and its derivatives, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate; macrocyclic chelates of lanthanide ions, such as Quantum Dye\u2122; Marina Blue; Oregon Green; rhodamine dyes, such as rhodamine red, tetramethylrhodamine and rhodamine 6G; Texas Red; fluorescent energy transfer dyes, such as thiazole orange-ethidium heterodimer; and, TOTAB.","Specific examples of dyes include, but are not limited to, those identified above and the following: Alexa Fluor 350, Alexa Fluor 405, Alexa Fluor 430, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 500, Alexa Fluor 514, Alexa Fluor 532, Alexa Fluor 546, Alexa Fluor 555, Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 610, Alexa Fluor 633, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 660, Alexa Fluor 680, Alexa Fluor 700, and, Alexa Fluor 750; amine-reactive BODIPY dyes, such as BODIPY 493\/503, BODIPY 530\/550, BODIPY 558\/568, BODIPY 564\/570, BODIPY 576\/589, BODIPY 581\/591, BODIPY 630\/650, BODIPY 650\/655, BODIPY FL, BODIPY R6G, BODIPY TMR, and, BODIPY-TR; Cy3, Cy5,6-FAM, Fluorescein Isothiocyanate, HEX, 6-JOE, Oregon Green 488, Oregon Green 500, Oregon Green 514, Pacific Blue, REG, Rhodamine Green, Rhodamine Red, Renographin, ROX, SYPRO, TAMRA, 2\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032,7\u2032-Tetrabromosulfonefluorescein, and TET.","Specific examples of fluorescently labeled ribonucleotides are available from Molecular Probes, and these include, Alexa Fluor 488-5-UTP, Fluorescein-12-UTP, BODIPY FL-14-UTP, BODIPY TMR-14-UTP, Tetramethylrhodamine-6-UTP, Alexa Fluor 546-14-UTP, Texas Red-5-UTP, and BODIPY TR-14-UTP. Other fluorescent ribonucleotides are available from Amersham Biosciences, such as Cy3-UTP and Cy5-UTP.","Examples of fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleotides include Dinitrophenyl (DNP)-11-dUTP, Cascade Blue-7-dUTP, Alexa Fluor 488-5-dUTP, Fluorescein-12-dUTP, Oregon Green 488-5-dUTP, BODIPY FL-14-dUTP, Rhodamine Green-5-dUTP, Alexa Fluor 532-5-dUTP, BODIPY TMR-14-dUTP, Tetramethylrhodamine-6-dUTP, Alexa Fluor 546-14-dUTP, Alexa Fluor 568-5-dUTP, Texas Red-12-dUTP, Texas Red-5-dUTP, BODIPY TR-14-dUTP, Alexa Fluor 594-5-dUTP, BODIPY 630\/650-14-dUTP, BODIPY 650\/665-14-dUTP; Alexa Fluor 488-7-OBEA-dCTP, Alexa Fluor 546-16-OBEA-dCTP, Alexa Fluor 594-7-OBEA-dCTP, Alexa Fluor 647-12-OBEA-dCTP.","It is contemplated that nucleic acids may be labeled with two different labels. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) may be employed in methods of the invention (e.g., Klostermeier et al., 2002; Emptage, 2001; Didenko, 2001, each incorporated by reference).","Alternatively, the label may not be detectable per se, but indirectly detectable or allowing for the isolation or separation of the targeted nucleic acid. For example, the label could be biotin, digoxigenin, polyvalent cations, chelator groups and the other ligands, include ligands for an antibody.","C. Visualization Techniques","A number of techniques for visualizing or detecting labeled nucleic acids are readily available. Such techniques include, microscopy, arrays, Fluorometry, Light cyclers or other real time PCR machines, FACS analysis, scintillation counters, Phosphoimagers, Geiger counters, MRI, CAT, antibody-based detection methods (Westerns, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry), histochemical techniques, HPLC (Griffey et al., 1997), spectroscopy, capillary gel electrophoresis (Cummins et al., 1996), spectroscopy; mass spectroscopy; radiological techniques; and mass balance techniques.","When two or more differentially colored labels are employed, fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques may be employed to characterize association of one or more nucleic acid. Furthermore, a person of ordinary skill in the art is well aware of ways of visualizing, identifying, and characterizing labeled nucleic acids, and accordingly, such protocols may be used as part of the invention. Examples of tools that may be used also include fluorescent microscopy, a BioAnalyzer, a plate reader, Storm (Molecular Dynamics), Array Scanner, FACS (fluorescent activated cell sorter), or any instrument that has the ability to excite and detect a fluorescent molecule.","VI.

In a non-limiting example, reagents for isolating miRNA, labeling miRNA, and\/or evaluating a miRNA population using an array, nucleic acid amplification, and\/or hybridization can be included in a kit, as well reagents for preparation of samples from blood samples. The kit may further include reagents for creating or synthesizing miRNA probes. The kits will thus comprise, in suitable container means, an enzyme for labeling the miRNA by incorporating labeled nucleotide or unlabeled nucleotides that are subsequently labeled. In certain aspects, the kit can include amplification reagents. In other aspects, the kit may include various supports, such as glass, nylon, polymeric beads, and the like, and\/or reagents for coupling any probes and\/or target nucleic acids. It may also include one or more buffers, such as reaction buffer, labeling buffer, washing buffer, or a hybridization buffer, compounds for preparing the miRNA probes, and components for isolating miRNA. Other kits of the invention may include components for making a nucleic acid array comprising miRNA, and thus, may include, for example, a solid support.","Kits for implementing methods of the invention described herein are specifically contemplated.

Any nucleic acid discussed above may be implemented as part of a kit.","The components of the kits may be packaged either in aqueous media or in lyophilized form. The container means of the kits will generally include at least one vial, test tube, flask, bottle, syringe or other container means, into which a component may be placed, and preferably, suitably aliquotted. Where there is more than one component in the kit (labeling reagent and label may be packaged together), the kit also will generally contain a second, third or other additional container into which the additional components may be separately placed. However, various combinations of components may be comprised in a vial. The kits of the present invention also will typically include a means for containing the nucleic acids, and any other reagent containers in close confinement for commercial sale. Such containers may include injection or blow molded plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained.","When the components of the kit are provided in one and\/or more liquid solutions, the liquid solution is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being particularly preferred.","However, the components of the kit may be provided as dried powder(s).

However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","miRNAs are believed to regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNA transcripts and (1) initiating transcript degradation or (2) altering protein translation from the transcript. Translational regulation leading to an up or down change in protein expression may lead to changes in activity and expression of downstream gene products and genes that are in turn regulated by those proteins. These numerous regulatory effects may be revealed as changes in the global mRNA expression profile. Microarray gene expression analyses were performed to identify genes that are mis-regulated by hsa-miR-124a expression.","Synthetic Pre-miR\u2122-hsa-miR-124a (Ambion; Austin, Tex., USA) or two negative control (NC) miRNAs (Pre-miR\u2122 microRNA Precursor Molecule-Negative Control #1, Ambion, cat. no. AM17110 and Pre-miR\u2122 microRNA Precursor Molecule-Negative Control #2, Ambion, cat. no. AM17111) were reverse transfected into quadruplicate samples of A549 cells for each of three time points. Cells were transfected using siPORT\u2122 NeoFX\u2122 (Ambion, cat. no. AM4511) according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the following parameters: 200,000 cells per well in a 6 well plate, 5.0 \u03bcl of NeoFX, 30 nM final concentration of miRNA in 2.5 ml. Cells were harvested at 4 h, 24 h, and 72 h post transfection. Total RNA was extracted using RNAqueous\u00ae-4PCR (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol.","mRNA array analyses were performed by Asuragen Services (Asuragen, Inc.; Austin, Tex., USA), according to the company's standard operating procedures. Using the MessageAmp\u2122 II-96 aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, cat. no. 1819) 2 \u03bcg of total RNA were used for target preparation and labeling with biotin. cRNA yields were quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, Calif., USA) capillary electrophoresis protocol. Labeled target was hybridized to Affymetrix mRNA arrays (Human HG-U133A 2.0 arrays; Affymetrix, Inc.; Santa Clara, Calif., USA) using the manufacturer's recommendations and the following parameters. Hybridizations were carried out at 45\u00b0 C. for 16 hr in an Affymetrix Model 640 hybridization oven. Arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 Fluidics station, running the wash script Midi_euk2v3450. The arrays were scanned on a Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. Summaries of the image signal data, group mean values, p-values with significance flags, log ratios and gene annotations for every gene on the array were generated using the Affymetrix Statistical Algorithm MAS 5.0 (GCOS v1.3). Data were reported in a file (cabinet) containing the Affymetrix data and result files and in files (.cel) containing the primary image and processed cell intensities of the arrays. Data were normalized for the effect observed by the average of two negative control microRNA sequences and then were averaged together for presentation.

Among secretory proteins are fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), insulin growth factor binding protein 1 and 3 (IGFBP1, IGFBP3), transforming growth factor \u03b2-2 (TGFB2) and the inflammatory chemokine interleukin 8. FGF-2 is a secretory protein with potent mitogenic and angiogenic activity that transmits the signal into cells via transmembrane receptors (FGFRs) composed of 2-3 extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Chandler et al., 1999). FGF-2 mRNAs levels are increased in renal, oral and non-small lung cancer cells (Chandler et al., 1999). Similarly, IL-8 is frequently upregulated in various cancers and correlates with tumor vascularization, metastasis and poor prognosis (Rosenkilde and Schwartz, 2004; Sparmann and Bar-Sagi, 2004). TGFB2 is the corresponding ligand to TGF-\u03b2 receptors (TGFBR), a class of receptors that may function as tumor suppressors (Massague et al., 2000).","Membrane-associated proteins regulated by hsa-miR-124a are platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like (PDGFRL; also referred to as PDGF receptor beta-like tumor suppressor, PRLTS) and the Ras association domain family protein 2 (RASSF2). RASSF2 is a tumor suppressor candidate that is frequently downregulated in lung tumor cell lines (Vos et al., 2003). RASSF2 interacts with K-Ras and promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. PDGFRL also functions as a tumor suppressor that shows loss of function in a broad variety of cancers either by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or missense and frame-shift mutation (Fujiwara et al., 1995; Komiya et al., 1997). Since treatment of cancer cells with hsa-miR-124a leads to reduced expression levels of FGF2, IL8 and IGFBPs, and to increased expression levels of TGFB2, RASSF2 and PDGFRL, hsa-miR-124a is likely to induce a therapeutic response in cancer patients that show aberrant expression or function of these growth-stimulatory or inhibitory proteins.","Intracellular signaling molecules regulated by hsa-miR-124a include IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha, CHUK), c-Src (SRC), the catalytic subunit of class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases p110\u03b1 (PIK3CA) and phospholipase C beta-1 (PLCB1). PLC beta-1 catalyzes the generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate (PIP2), regulating proliferative signals and checkpoints of the cell cycle (Lo Vasco et al., 2004). IKKalpha is a positive regulator of the intracellular signaling cascade and functions to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) (Karin et al., 2002). NFkappaB is constitutively activated in several cancer types and promotes anti-apoptotic and survival pathways. The proto-oncoprotein c-Src is the human homolog of avian v-Src that has been isolated as the tumorigenic component of Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) (Rous, 1911; Stehelin et al., 1976; Yeatman, 2004). c-Src is a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase that is activated in response to intracellular signaling or indirectly to extracellular stimuli by binding to activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2, PDGFR and FGFR. Src is a crucial molecule in a complex network of interacting proteins, regulating cell adhesion, motility, invasion and proliferation. c-Src is frequently overexpressed or hyperactivated in numerous cancer types (Yeatman, 2004). The gene product of PIK3CA activates the Akt signaling pathway in response to most upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 1997). PIK3CA frequently acquires a gain of function in the vast majority of human cancers, either by amplification or overexpression, such as in ovarian and cervical cancers, or by activating somatic mutations (Bader and Vogt, 2004; Bader et al., 2005). PIK3CA has become a novel drug target in the pharmaceutical industry and is also a predicted target of hsa-miR-124a (Table 3). Based on our data, hsa-miR-124a negatively regulates these proteins and therefore is likely to function as a tumor-suppressor miRNA.","Another class of genes and their corresponding proteins that are regulated by hsa-miR-124a, functions in the progression of the cell cycle. Some of these proteins are critical in the transition through G1 and S phases, such as cyclins A2 and E2 (CCNA2, CCNE2), cyclin dependent kinases 2, 4 and 6 (CDK2, CDK4, CDK6) and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6). Others are required for progressing through the G2\/M spindle checkpoint and proper segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis to maintain chromosomal stability. These include aurora kinases A and B (AURKA, a.k.a. STK6; AURKB, a.k.a. STK12), breast cancer 1 and 2 (BRCA1; BRCA2), budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (BUB1), budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 beta (BUB1B), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, a.k.a. CDC2), cyclins B1 and B2 (CCNB1, CCNB2), and cell division cycle 20 and 23 (CDC20, CDC23, a.k.a. anaphase promoting complex subunit 8). Most of these transcripts are regulated in a manner that suggests that hsa-miR-124a blocks cell cycle progression. All of these targets also have an evident role in carcinogenesis.","For instance, the tumor suppressor proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2, as well as the growth-promoting aurora kinases A and B show deregulated expression in a various solid tumors, e.g. carcinomas of the breast, ovary, thyroid gland, lung, prostate and colorectum (Wooster and Weber, 2003; Keen and Taylor, 2004; Turner et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005; Chieffi et al., 2006; Ulisse et al., 2006). Aurora kinases are preferred drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry. PLK1 (also referred to as serine-threonine protein kinase 13; STPK13) is a protein kinase that regulates mitotic spindle function to maintain chromosomal stability (Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006). PLK1 expression is tightly regulated during the cell cycle and peaks in M phase. PLK1 is inherently oncogenic and directly inhibits the tumor suppressor function of p53 (Ando et al., 2004). Overexpression of PLK1 induces a polynucleated phenotype and cellular transformation of NIH3T3 cells (Mundt et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997). Likewise, PLK1 shows increased expression levels in most solid tumors, including carcinomas of the breast, colon, lung, stomach and prostate (Table 5). PLK1 overexpression is associated with disease progression and, when depleted, induces apoptosis in cancer cells (Liu and Erikson, 2003; Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006). Currently, PLK1 is being tested as a target of various small molecule inhibitors for future therapeutic intervention (Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006).","CDC6 is regulated in response to mitogenic signals through transcriptional control mechanisms involving E2F proteins and is required for initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells. CDC6 is overexpressed in various human cancers and has inherent oncogenic potential (Karakaidos et al., 2004; Semple and Duncker, 2004; Murphy et al., 2005; Gonzalez et al., 2006). Cyclins are co-factors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2001). The expression of cyclins is tightly controlled during the cell cycle to govern the activity of individual CDKs. Cyclin A2 and cyclin E2 associate with CDK2 during S phase; cyclin D1 is the predominant co-factor of CDK4\/6 in G1 phase. Most cyclins are promoters of cell growth, and several, such as cyclin A2, B1, or E2, are frequently expressed at high levels in various tumor types (Payton and Coats, 2002; Payton et al., 2002; Qian et al., 2002; Egloff et al., 2006). CDK4 and CDK6 form active complexes with D-type cyclins, including D1, D2 and D3. The primary function of CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 is to inactivate members of the retinoblastoma protein family. CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 are overexpressed in numerous cancers and are currently being explored as a potential cancer drug targets (Costello et al., 1997; Cipriano and Chen, 1998; Marone et al., 1998; Yamamoto et al., 1998; Lam et al., 2000; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2001; Hayette et al., 2003; Mendrzyk et al., 2005).","CDK1 (CDC2) is a catalytic subunit of a protein kinase complex, called the M-phase promoting factor that induces entry into mitosis and is universal among eukaryotes. Activation of CDK1 requires binding to B cyclins and dephosphorylation by CDC25. Similar to other CDKs, CDK1 is expressed at increased levels in various cancers (Table 5). The CDC25 protein phosphatase family plays a critical role in activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) via dephosphorylation of conserved threonine 15 and tyrosine 15 inhibitory phosphorylation sites. While CDC25C is primarily responsible for activating CDK1 to overcome G2\/M checkpoint and allow mitotic entry, the primary substrate of CDC25A is CDK2 and CDK6 which, when active, allows progression through the G1\/S and intra-S checkpoints (Kristjansdottir and Rudolph, 2004). CDC25A is frequently amplified and overexpressed in human cancers, including cancers of the breast, lung, rectum and brain (Kristjansdottir and Rudolph, 2004).","Other molecules regulated by hsa-miR-124a that indirectly control cell cycle progression are SKP2, MDM2 and AKAP12. AKAP12, also referred to as gravin or SSeCKS (Src suppressed C kinase substrate), functions as a kinase scaffold protein that tethers the enzyme-substrate interaction (Nauert et al., 1997). Expression of AKAP12 interferes with oncogenic cell transformation induced by the Src or Jun oncoproteins in vitro and is lost or reduced in numerous cancers, such as leukemia and carcinomas of the rectum, lung and stomach (Lin and Gelman, 1997; Cohen et al., 2001; Xia et al., 2001; Wikman et al., 2002; Boultwood et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2004; Mori et al., 2006). An apparent anti-oncogenic activity of AKAP12 in prostate and gastric cancers marks this protein as a putative tumor suppressor (Xia et al., 2001; Choi et al., 2004). Skp2 is a component of the multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that ear-marks proteins for proteasomal degradation. A well characterized target is the CDK inhibitor p27 which offers an explanation for the cell cycle promoting activity of Skp2 (Carrano et al., 1999). Skp2 is inherently oncogenic and shows elevated levels in various cancer types (Gstaiger et al., 2001; Kamata et al., 2005; Saigusa et al., 2005; Einama et al., 2006).","Hsa-miR-124a also governs the expression of FAS, Bim (BCL2L11) and MCL1, all of which are functionally linked to the apoptotic pathway. Bim and MCL 1 are members of the BCL-2 (B cell lymphoma 2) gene family. MCL1 gives rise to two alternatively spliced gene products with opposing functions (Bae et al., 2000). The predominant species is MCL1-L that has anti-apoptotic activity. High levels of MCL1 are correlated with poor prognosis of patients with ovarian carcinoma and is indicative for leukemic relapse (Kaufmann et al., 1998; Shigemasa et al., 2002). RNA interference against MCL1 induces a therapeutic response in gastric and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Schulze-Bergkamen et al., 2006; Zangemeister-Wittke and Huwiler, 2006).","In contrast to MCL1, Bim induces apoptosis by binding to and antagonizing anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Interactions have been observed with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, Bfl-1 and BHRF-1 (Hsu et al., 1998; O'Connor et al., 1998). Loss of Bim promotes oncogenesis, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for Bim (Egle et al., 2004). In agreement with this observation is the fact that Bim is frequently lost or expressed at reduced levels in many cancers (Gomez-Bougie et al., 2004; Austin and Cook, 2005; Li et al., 2005; Tagawa et al., 2005). FAS, also known as CD95 or APO-1, is a transmembrane cell surface receptor that functions in the transduction of apoptotic signals in response to its ligand FasL (Houston and O'Connell, 2004). Reduced FAS expression is a common mechanism of cells to decrease the sensitivity to FasL-mediated cell death. Similarly, many different cancer types show lost or decreased Fas expression levels (Table 5). In colorectal carcinoma, FAS expression is progressively reduced in the transformation of normal epithelium to benign neoplasm, adenocarcinomas and metastases (Moller et al., 1994). Thus, despite expression of FasL, tumor cells may escape the FasL induced apoptotic signal. Transient transfection of hsa-miR-124a increases expression of FAS and Bim and decreases MCL1 transcripts and therefore may antagonize the anti-apoptotic phenotype of cancer cells.","Transcription factors regulated by hsa-miR-124a include the mammalian homolog of the v-Ets oncoprotein (ETS1), the forkhead box\/winged-helix transcription factors FOXO1 (FOXO1A) and FOXM1, as well as the v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog-like proteins A-MYB (MYBL1) and MYB-L2 (MYBL2). The transcription factor Ets-1 (ETS1) is the mammalian homolog of the v-Ets oncoprotein originally isolated from the transforming erythroblastosis virus E26 (Leprince et al., 1983). Similar to viral Ets, the endogenous proto-oncoprotein Ets-1 has oncogenic potential and transforms murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture (Dittmer, 2003). Ets-1 stimulates angiogenesis by regulating VEGF expression levels. Ets-1 plays a role in making tumors more invasive and is indicative for poor prognosis (Dittmer, 2003). Ets-1 is upregulated in a vast variety of solid tumors and malignancies of the hematopoietic system (Dittmer, 2003). The ETS1 gene is also frequently subject to chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and may be critical in the development of the disease (Sacchi et al., 1986; Goyns et al., 1987).","FoxM1 controls the expression of cell cycle genes, such as cyclins B and D (Wang et al., 2001). FoxM1 is expressed at high levels in human glioblastomas and shows tumorigenic activity in various model systems (Kalin et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006). Mice deficient in FoxM1 fail to develop chemically induced hepatocellular carcinomas (Kalinichenko et al., 2004). In contrast to Ets-1 and FoxM1, FOXO1, also known as FKHR, belongs to a class of lineage-restricted tumor suppressor proteins with redundant functions, including FOXO3a and FOXO4 (Vogt et al., 2005; Paik et al., 2007). FOXO proteins are pro-apoptotic by transcribing the FasL gene and induce cell cycle arrest by upregulating the CDK inhibitor p27kip1 (Carter and Brunet, 2007). FOXO1 also induces the expression of the CDK inhibitor p21cip1 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, and reduces expression of the cyclins D1 and D2 (Bader et al., 2005). In alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the FOXO1 gene frequently undergoes chromosomal rearrangements which fuses C-terminal sequences of FOXO1 to N-terminal sequences of PAX3 or PAX7, resulting in a hybrid protein with altered DNA-binding specificity (Vogt et al., 2005). A recombinant FOXO1 protein carries a transcriptional repressor domain, instead of the FOXO1-specific activator domain, is oncogenic in cell culture (Aoki et al., 2004). Since transfection of hsa-miR-124a leads to elevated mRNA levels of FOXO1 and reduced levels of FOXM1 and ETS1, hsa-miR-124a may induce a therapeutic response in cancer cells by regulating these targets.","Based on the function of most targets and how they are regulated by hsa-miR-124a, hsa-miR-124a appears to function as a tumor suppressor miRNA. However, hsa-miR-124a also regulates cancer-associated genes in a fashion indicating that this miRNA might promote tumorigenesis and that inhibition of hsa-miR-124a might be able to intercept with tumor development when appropriate. Among these targets are the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteins Rb (RB1) and p107 (RBL1), MDM2, B Raf (BRAF), platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD), protein kinase C-alpha (PRKCA) and transforming growth factor-beta receptors 2 and 3 (TGFBR2, TGFBR3). TGFBR-2 and TGFBR-3 are putative tumor suppressors. TGFBR-2 forms a functional complex with TGFBR-1 and is the primary receptor for TGF-\u03b2 (Massague et al., 2000). A central role of TGF-\u03b2 is inhibition of cellular growth of numerous cell types, such as epithelial, endothelial, hematopoietic neural and mesenchymal cells. Many mammary and colorectal carcinomas with microsatellite instability harbor inactivating mutations of TGFBR-2, and therefore escape the growth-inhibitory function of TGF-\u03b2 (Markowitz et al., 1995; Lucke et al., 2001). TGFBR-3, also referred to as beta-glycan, binds all three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms with high affinity. TGFBR-3 associates with TGFBR-2 to signal to downstream effector molecules (Blobe et al., 2001). Similar to TGFBR-2, TGFBR-3 is frequently downregulated in multiple cancer types (Table 5) (Hishikawa et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2005).","PRKCA belongs to a family of serine-threonine kinases that are activated in response to signaling induced by receptor tyrosine kinases. Functional studies have suggested that PKCs play a role in carcinogenesis and maintenance of the malignant phenotype (Koivunen et al., 2006). PRKCA is overexpressed in endometrial, prostate and high grade urinary bladder carcinomas (Koivunen et al., 2006). PRKCA activity is linked to increased motility and invasion of cancer cells, a phenotype that can be reversed by PRKCA inhibition (Koivunen et al., 2004). PDGFs are structurally related to the v-sis oncogene of simian sarcoma virus, and compelling evidence has demonstrated the transforming activity of PDGF-D in NIH3T3 cells (Li et al., 2003). PDGF-D is expressed in many tumors and tumor cell lines, including glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing family tumor cell lines and several other tumor cell lines (Li et al., 2003). PDGFD-induced tumors displayed signs of increased vascularization with elevated levels of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), suggesting that PDGFD is angiogenic. Therefore, PDGFD is currently investigated as a potential drug target in the intervention of cancer signaling (Pietras et al., 2003).","Human MDM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor (Momand et al., 1998; Bartel et al., 2002). MDM2 directly binds to p53, facilitates nuclear export and marks p53 for proteasomal degradation. MDM2 is amplified or overexpressed in approximately one third of human malignancies, including sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. To date, MDM2 amplification has been observed in at least 19 tumor types with varying frequencies (Momand et al., 1998; Bartel et al., 2002). In accord, overexpression of MDM2 leads to oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 and Rat2 cells (Fakharzadeh et al., 1991). The pocket proteins RB1 and RBL1, also known as p107, interact with the E2F family of transcription factors and block cell cycle progression and DNA replication (Sherr and McCormick, 2002). Accordingly, a large subset of cancers show deregulated expression of RB1 or RBL1 (Takimoto et al., 1998; Claudio et al., 2002; Sherr and McCormick, 2002; Wu et al., 2002; Ito et al., 2003; Dyer and Bremner, 2005).","B-Raf (BRAF) belongs to a family of Raf serine-threonine kinases that are homologous to the viral oncoproteins isolated from transforming murine or avian viruses (Coll et al., 1983; Jansen et al., 1983; Rapp et al., 1983). Raf proteins are activated by the RAS GTPase and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). B-Raf is frequently hyperactivated by somatic mutation in a broad variety of cancers (Tuveson et al., 2003; Beeram et al., 2005). Raf kinases and B-Raf in particular have long been preferred drug targets; sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer) represents an example of an FDA-approved inhibitory small molecule that specifically targets this inherently oncogenic protein (Beeram et al., 2005).","In summary, hsa-miR-124a governs the activity of proteins that are critical regulators of cell proliferation and tumor development. These targets are frequently deregulated in human cancers. Based on this review of the genes and related pathways that are regulated by miR-124a, introduction of hsa-miR-124a or inhibitory anti-hsa-miR-124a into a variety of cancer cell types would likely result in a therapeutic response.","A review of genes that are differentially expressed in response to introduction of hsa-miR-124a (Table 1) revealed that hsa-miR-124a controls many genes that function in the regulation of the cell cycle. Although some of these genes have not yet been directly linked to human disease, they are essential in the proper progression of the cell cycle in normal cells. A summary of these gene products and their role during the cell cycle is provided in  and Table 6. Comprehensive information about the cell cycle and these molecules has been reviewed in Kops et al., 2005; Bell and Dutta, 2002; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2001; Kastan and Lim, 2000; Sherr and Roberts, 1999 and references therein and can also be found in the OMIM Entrez and Gene Entrez sections of the NCBI website at the world wide web address ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/sites\/entrez. Considering the function of these proteins and how they are regulated by hsa-miR-124a, hsa-miR-124a appears to block cell cycle progression during all major phases: G1, S, G2 and M phase (, Table 1, Table 6). Therefore, hsa-miR-124a-based therapies are contemplated as being particularly useful in the treatment of neoplastic and other hyperproliferative disorders. In addition, it is contemplated that hsa-miR-124a inhibitors can be for clinical applications that are directed toward tissue regeneration, such as skin regeneration or the generation of tissue grafts. Since hsa-miR-124a is highly expressed in neuronal cells and plays an important role in the development of the central nervous system, hsa-miR-124a or hsa-miR-124a inhibitors it is contemplated that it can be useful in the regeneration of neuron cells to treat brain disorders that include but are not limited to brain tumors, neuronal degeneration, mental retardation, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease (Kapsimali et al., 2007; Makeyev et al., 2007; Visvanathan et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007; Lukiw, 2007; Mishima et al., 2007; Smirnova et al., 2005).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0328","num":"0327"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"336pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of information about miR-124a-controlled genes shown in FIG. 1. n\/a not"},{"entry":"applicable because not directly involved in the cell cycle."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Cycle of",{}]},{"entry":["Icon","Gene Title","Name","Action","Protein Function"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["APC","n\/a","anaphase-promoting","M phase,","multiprotein complex including CDC16,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"complex","spindle","CDC23, CDC27;

No. 11\/141,707 filed May 31, 2005 and Ser. No. 11\/273,640 filed Nov. 14, 2005). For example, overexpression of hsa-miR-124a decreases the proliferation and\/or viability of certain normal or cancerous cell lines.","The development of effective therapeutic regimes requires evidence that demonstrates efficacy and utility of the therapeutic in various cancer models and multiple cancer cell lines that represent the same disease. The inventors assessed the therapeutic effect of hsa-miR-124a for lung cancer by using 12 individual lung cancer cell lines. To measure cellular proliferation of lung cancer cells, the following non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were used: cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma (A549, H1299, H522, H838, Calu-3, HCC827, HCC2935), cells derived from lung squamous cell carcinoma (H520, H226), cells derived from lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma (H596), cells derived from lung bronchioalveolar carcinoma (H1650), and cells derived from lung large cell carcinoma (H460). Synthetic hsa-miR-124a (Pre-miR\u2122-hsa-miR-124a, Ambion cat. no. AM17100) or negative control (NC) miRNA (Pre-miR\u2122 microRNA Precursor Molecule-Negative Control #2; Ambion cat. no. AM17111) was delivered via lipid-based transfection into A549, H1299, H522, H838, Calu-3, HCC827, HCC2935, H520, H596, H1650, and H460 cells and via electroporation into H226 cells.","Lipid-based reverse transfections were carried out in triplicate according to a published protocol and the following parameters: 5,000-12,000 cells per 96 well, 0.1-0.2 \u03bcl Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (cat. no. 11668-019, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., USA) in 20 \u03bcl OptiMEM (Invitrogen), 30 nM final concentration of miRNA in 100 \u03bcl (Ovcharenko et al., 2005). Electroporation of H226 cells was carried out using the BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 instrument (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA) with the following settings: 5\u00d710cells with 5 \u03bcg miRNA in 200 \u03bcl OptiMEM (1.6 \u03bcM miRNA), square wave pulse at 250 V for 5 ms. Electroporated H226 cells were seeded at 7,000 cells per 96-well in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl. All cells except for Calu-3 cells were harvested 72 hours post transfection or electroporation for assessment of cellular proliferation. Calu-3 cells were harvested 10 days post transfection.","Proliferation assays were performed using Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. As a control for inhibition of cellular proliferation, siRNA against the motor protein kinesin 11, also known as Eg5, was used. Eg5 is essential for cellular survival of most eukaryotic cells and a lack thereof leads to reduced cell proliferation and cell death (Weil et al., 2002). siEg5 was used in lipid-based transfection following the same experimental parameters that apply to miRNA. The inventors also used a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide, at final concentrations of 10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM as an internal standard for the potency of miRNAs. Etoposide is an FDA-approved DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor in the treatment of lung cancer. IC50 values for various lung cancer cells have been reported to range between <1-25 \u03bcM for SCLC and NSCLC cells (Ohsaki et al., 1992; Tsai et al., 1993). Percent (%) proliferation values from the Alamar Blue assay were normalized to values from cells treated with negative control miRNA.

of hsa-miR-124a over an extended period of time, the inventors conducted growth curve experiments in the presence of miRNA for up to 31 days in H226 lung cancer cells. Since in vitro transfections of naked interfering RNAs, such as synthetic miRNA, are transient by nature and compromised by the dilution of the oligo during ongoing cell divisions, miRNA was administered at multiple time points (Bartlett et al., 2006; Bartlett et al., 2007). To accommodate miRNA delivery into a large quantity of cells, hsa-miR-124a or negative control miRNA were delivered by the electroporation method. Briefly, 1\u00d710H226 cells were electroporated in triplicate with 1.6 \u03bcM hsa-miR-124a or negative control using the BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 instrument (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA), seeded, and propagated in regular growth medium. When the control cells reached confluence (days 6, 17 and 25), cells were harvested, counted, and electroporated again with the respective miRNAs. To ensure similar treatment of both conditions as well as to accommodate exponential growth, the cell numbers used for the second and third electroporation were titrated down to the lowest count. The population doubling was calculated from these electroporation events using the formula PD=ln(Nf\/N0)\/ln 2 and adjusting for the fact that approximately 72% of newly seeded cells adhere to the plate. Cell counts were extrapolated and plotted on a linear scale (). Arrows represent electroporation days. Standard deviations are included in the graphs.","Repeated administration of hsa-miR-124a robustly inhibited proliferation of human lung cancer cells (). In contrast, cells treated with negative control miRNA showed normal exponential growth. hsa-miR-124a treatment resulted in 96.3% inhibition of H226 cell growth on day 31 (3.7% remaining cells) relative to the proliferation of control cells (100%).","The data suggest that hsa-miR-124a provides a useful therapeutic tool in the treatment of human lung cancer cells.","miRNAs function in multiple pathways controlling multiple cellular processes. Cancer cells frequently show aberrations in several different pathways, which determine their oncogenic properties. Therefore, administration of multiple miRNAs to cancer patients may result in a superior therapeutic benefit over administration of a single miRNA. The inventors assessed the efficacy of pair-wise miRNA combinations, administering hsa-miR-124a concurrently with either hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-147, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c or hsa-let-7g (Pre-miR\u2122 miRNA, Ambion cat. no. AM17100). H460 lung cancer cells were transiently reverse-transfected in triplicates with each miRNA at a final concentration of 300 pM, resulting in 600 pM of oligonucleotide. For negative controls, 600 pM of Pre-miR\u2122 microRNA Precursor Molecule-Negative Control #2 (Ambion cat. no. AM17111) were used. To correlate the effect of various combinations with the effect of the sole miRNA, each miRNA at 300 pM was also combined with 300 pM negative control miRNA. Reverse transfection was performed using the following parameters: 7,000 cells per well of a 96 well plate, 0.15 \u03bcl Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen) in 20 \u03bcl OptiMEM (Invitrogen), 100 \u03bcl total transfection volume. As an internal control for the potency of miRNA, etoposide was added at 10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM to mock-transfected cells 24 hours after transfection for the following 48 hours. Cells were harvested 72 hours after transfection and subjected to Alamar Blue assays (Invitrogen). Percent proliferation values from the Alamar Blue assay were normalized to those obtained from cells treated with 600 \u03bcM negative control miRNA. Data are expressed as % proliferation relative to negative control miRNA-treated cells.","Transfection of 300 pM hsa-miR-124a reduces proliferation of H460 cells by 30.57% (Table 9; ). Additive activity of pair-wise combinations (e.g. hsa-miR-124a plus hsa-let-7g) is defined as an activity that is greater than the sole activity of each miRNA (e.g., the activity of hsa-miR-124a plus hsa-let-7g is greater than that observed for hsa-miR-124a plus NC and the activity of hsa-miR-124a plus hsa-let-7g is greater than that observed for hsa-let-7g plus NC). Synergistic activity of pair-wise combinations is defined as an activity that is greater than the sum of the sole activity of each miRNA (e.g., the activity of hsa-miR-124a plus hsa-let-7g is greater than that observed for the sum of the activity of hsa-miR-124a plus NC and the activity of hsa-let-7g plus NC). The data indicate that hsa-miR-124a combined with hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-147, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c, or hsa-let-7g results in synergistic activity (Table 9, ). Therefore, it is contemplated that administering combinations of hsa-miR-124a with other miRNAs to cancer patients can induce a superior therapeutic response in the treatment of lung cancer.

Hsa-miR-124a was delivered into A549 and H460 lung cancer cells via electroporation using the Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 (BioRad) with the following settings: 15\u00d710cells with 5 \u03bcg miRNA in 200 \u03bcl OptiMEM, square wave pulse at 150 V for 10 ms. Electroporated cells (5\u00d710) were mixed with BD Matrigel\u2122, (BD Biosciences; San Jose, Calif., USA; cat. no. 356237) in a 1:1 ratio and injected subcutaneously into the flank of NOD\/SCID mice (Jackson Laboratories; Bar Harbor, Me., USA). As a negative control, A549 and H460 cells were electroporated with negative control (NC) miRNA (Pre-miR\u2122 microRNA Precursor Molecule-Negative Control #2; Ambion cat. no. AM17111) as described above. To assess the anti-oncogenic activity of hsa-miR-124a, a group of 4 animals was injected with A459 cells and a group of 6 animals was injected with H460 cells. NC miRNA-treated cells were injected into the opposite flank of the same animal to control for animal-to-animal variability. Once tumors reached a measurable size (A549: 9 days post injection; H460: 5 days post injection), the length and width of tumors were determined every day for up to 8 days. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula, Volume=length\u00d7width\u00d7width\/2, in which the length is greater than the width. For animals carrying A549 xenografts, tumor volumes derived from NC-treated cells and hsa-miR-124a-treated cells were averaged and plotted over time (). The p value, indicating statistical significance, is shown for values obtained on day 16 (p=0.0036). For animals carrying H460 xenografts, tumor volumes of individual mice are shown ().","Administration of hsa-miR-124a into the A549 and H460 lung cancer xenografts inhibited tumor growth in vivo ( and ). Cancer cells that received negative control miRNA developed tumors more rapidly than cells treated with hsa-miR-124a. Administration of hsa-miR-124a into A549 delayed and suppressed the onset of tumor growth.","Delivery of hsa-miR-124a into human lung cancer cells prior to implantation into the animal inhibited the formation of lung tumor xenografts. These results demonstrate the anti-oncogenic activity of hsa-miR-124a and suggest that hsa-miR-124a provides a powerful therapeutic tool to treat established lung tumors. To explore this possibility, 3\u00d710human H460 non-small lung cancer cells were mixed with BD Matrigel\u2122, (BD Biosciences; San Jose, Calif., USA; cat. no. 356237) in a 1:1 ratio and subcutaneously injected into the lower back of each of 23 NOD\/SCID mice (Jackson Laboratories; Bar Harbor, Me., USA). Once animals developed palpable tumors (day 11 post xenograft implantation), each animal in a group of six animals received intratumoral injections of 6.25 \u03bcg hsa-miR-124a (Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colo.) formulated with the lipid-based siPORT\u2122 amine delivery agent (Ambion, Austin, Tex.; cat. no.

Each animal in a control group of six animals received intratumoral injections of 6.25 \u03bcg negative control miRNA (NC; Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colo.), following the same injection schedule that was used for hsa-miR-124a. Given an average mouse weight of 20 g, this dose equals 0.3125 mg\/kg. In addition, a group of six H460 tumor-bearing mice received intratumoral injections of the siPORT\u2122 amine delivery formulation lacking any oligonucleotide, and a group of five animals received intratumoral injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Caliper measurements were taken every 1-2 days, and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula, Volume=length\u00d7width\u00d7width\/2, in which the length is greater than the width.","As shown in , three doses of hsa-miR-124a robustly inhibited growth of established H460 lung tumors (white squares). On day 19, the average volume of tumors treated with hsa-miR-124a was 122 mm. In contrast, tumors treated with negative control miRNA (black diamonds) grew at a steady pace and yielded tumors with an average size of 421 mmon day 19. Negative control tumors developed as quickly as tumors treated with either PBS or the siPORT amine only control, indicating that the therapeutic activity of hsa-miR-124a is specific.","The data indicate that hsa-miR-124a represents a particularly useful candidate in the treatment of patients with lung cancer. The therapeutic activity of hsa-miR-124a is highlighted by the fact that hsa-miR-124a inhibits tumor growth of tumors that had developed prior to treatment.","In addition, the data demonstrate the therapeutic utility of hsa-miR-124a in a lipid-based formulation.","The inventors assessed the therapeutic effect of hsa-miR-124a for prostate cancer by using four individual human prostate cancer cell lines. To measure cellular proliferation of prostate cancer cells, the following prostate cancer cell lines were used: PPC-1, derived from a bone metastasis; Dul45, derived from a brain metastasis; RWPE2, derived from prostate cells immortalized by human papillomavirus 18 and transformed by the K-RAS oncogene; and LNCaP, derived from a lymph node metastasis (Bello et al., 1997; Pretlow et al., 1993; Stone et al., 1978; Brothman et al., 1991; Horoszewicz et al., 1980). PPC-1 and Dul45 cells lack expression of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and are independent of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. In contrast, RWPE2 and LNCaP cells test positive for PSA and AR.

Eg5 is essential for cellular survival of most eukaryotic cells and a lack thereof leads to reduced cell proliferation and cell death (Weil et al. 2002). siEg5 was used in lipid-based transfection following the same experimental parameters that apply to miRNA. Fluorescent light units (FLU) were measured after 3 hours, normalized to the control, and plotted as percent change in proliferation.

Since hsa-miR-124a induces a therapeutic response in all prostate cancer cells tested, it is contemplated that hsa-miR-124a can provide therapeutic benefit to a broad range of patients with prostate cancer and other malignancies.","To evaluate the therapeutic activity of hsa-miR124a over an extended period of time, we conducted growth curve experiments in the presence of miRNA for up to 21 days. Since in vitro transfections of naked interfering RNAs, such as synthetic miRNA, are transient by nature and compromised by the dilution of the oligo during ongoing cell divisions, we administered miRNA at multiple time points (Bartlett et al., 2006; Bartlett et al., 2007). To accommodate miRNA delivery into a large quantity of cells, we employed the electroporation method to deliver hsa-miR-124a or negative control miRNA into PPC-1, PC3, and Du145 human prostate cancer cells. Briefly, 1\u00d710PPC-1 or PC3 cells, and 0.5\u00d710Du145 cells were electroporated with 1.6 \u03bcM hsa-miR-124a or negative control using the BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 instrument (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA), seeded, and propagated in regular growth medium. Experiments with PC3 and Du145 cells were carried out in triplicates. When the control cells reached confluence (days 4 and 11 for PPC-1; days 7 and 14 for PC3 and Du145), cells were harvested, counted, and electroporated again with the respective miRNAs. To ensure similar treatment of both conditions as well as to accommodate exponential growth, the cell numbers used for the second and third electroporation were titrated down to the lowest count. The population doubling was calculated from these electroporation events using the formula PD=ln(Nf\/N0)\/ln 2, and cell counts were extrapolated and plotted on a linear scale (). Arrows represent electroporation days. Standard deviations are shown in the graphs.","Repeated administration of hsa-miR-124a robustly inhibited proliferation of human prostate cancer cells (). In contrast, cells treated with negative control miRNA showed normal exponential growth. hsa-miR-124a treatment resulted in complete inhibition (99.9%) of PPC-1 cell growth by day 18; hsa-miR-124a treatment also resulted in 76.4% inhibition of PC3 cell growth on day 21 (23.6% remaining cells), and 86.2% inhibition of Du145 cell growth on day 20 (13.8% remaining cells) relative to the proliferation of control cells (100%).","The data suggest that hsa-miR-124a provides a useful therapeutic tool in the treatment of human prostate cancer cells.","The in vitro studies demonstrate the therapeutic activity of hsa-miR-124a in cultured human prostate cancer cells. Therefore, hsa-miR-124a is likely to interfere with prostate tumor growth in the animal. To explore this possibility, the therapeutic potential of synthetic hsa-miR-124a miRNA was evaluated in the animal using the PC3 human prostate cancer xenograft.

Caliper measurements were taken daily, and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula, Volume=length\u00d7width\u00d7width\/2, in which the length is greater than the width. Repeated dosing with hsa-miR-124a blocked tumor growth of the human PC3 prostate cancer xenograft (). On day 42, the average size of tumors treated with hsa-miR-124a was 37.1% less than that of tumors treated with negative control miRNA.","The data suggest that hsa-miR-124a provides a useful therapeutic tool in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.
