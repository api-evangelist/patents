No. 7,592,445 which is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/124,619, filed May 5, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,335,648. The contents of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","This invention relates to non-nucleotide compounds and methods of making and using such compounds in the prevention or treatment of diseases or conditions associated with platelet aggregation, including thrombosis, stroke and myocardial infarction in humans and other mammals, and for inhibition of platelet aggregation in blood and blood-related products.","Hemostasis is the spontaneous process of arresting bleeding from damaged blood vessels. Upon injury, precapillary vessels contract within seconds, and thrombocytes, or blood platelets, bind to the exposed subendothelial matrix of an injured vessel by a process called platelet adhesion. Platelets also stick to each other in a phenomenon known as platelet aggregation to form stable platelet aggregates that quickly help stop or slow blood outflow from injured vessels.","An intravascular thrombus can result from pathological disturbances of hemostasis, or by the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Platelet adhesion and aggregation are critical events in intravascular thrombosis. Activated under conditions of high shear blood flow in diseased vessels or by the release of mediators from other circulating cells and damaged endothelial cells lining the vessel, platelets and other cells accumulate at a site of vessel injury to form a thrombus, and recruit more platelets to the developing thrombus. The thrombus can grow to sufficient size to block off arterial blood vessels. Thrombi can also form in areas of stasis or slow blood flow in veins. Venous thrombi can easily detach portions of themselves, creating emboli that travel through the circulatory system. This process can result in blockade of other vessels, such as pulmonary arteries. Blockages of this sort can result in pathological outcomes such as pulmonary embolism. Thus, arterial thrombi cause serious disease by local blockade, whereas the morbidity and mortality associated with venous thrombi arise primarily after distant blockade, or embolization. Conditions associated with pathological thrombus formation include venous thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, arterial embolism, coronary and cerebral arterial thrombosis, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebral embolism, renal embolism and pulmonary embolism.","A number of converging pathways lead to platelet aggregation. Whatever the initial stimulus, the final common event is crosslinking of platelets by binding of fibrinogen to a membrane binding site, glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa (GP IIb\/IIIa, also known as integrin \u03b1\u03b2). Antagonists of the GP IIb\/IIIa receptor have been shown to produce potent antithrombotic effects (Ali, U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,343; Duggan, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,040,317). GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists include function-blocking antibodies like Abciximab (ReoPro\u00ae), cyclic peptides and peptidomimetic compounds (The EPIC investigators; Califf, R. M., coordinating author, 330: 956-961 (1994); The IMPACT-II investigators, 349:1422-1428 (1997); The RESTORE investigators, 96: 1445-1453 (1997)). The clinical efficacy of some of these newer drugs, such as Abciximab, is impressive, but recent trials have found that these approaches are associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, sometimes necessitating blood transfusion (The EPIC investigators; Califf, R. M., coordinating author, 330: 956-961 (1994)). Also, administration of this class of antiplatelet agent appears to be limited to intravenous methods.","Thrombin can produce platelet aggregation independently of other pathways but substantial quantities of thrombin are unlikely to be present without prior activation of platelets by other mechanisms. Thrombin inhibitors, such as hirudin, are highly effective antithrombotic agents. However, functioning as both antiplatelet and anti-coagulant agents, thrombin inhibitors again can produce excessive bleeding (The TIMI 9a Investigators, 90: 1624-1630 (1994); The GUSTO IIa Investigators, 90: 1631-1637 (1994); Neuhaus, et al., 90: 1638-1642 (1994)).","Various antiplatelet agents have been studied as inhibitors of thrombus formation. Some agents such as aspirin and dipyridamole have come into use as prophylactic antithrombotic agents, and others have been the subjects of clinical investigations. To date, therapeutic agents such as the disintegrins, and the thienopyridines ticlopidine (TICLID\u00ae) and clopidogrel (PLAVIX\u00ae) have been shown to have utility as platelet aggregation inhibitors, although they can produce a substantial number of side effects and have limited effectiveness in some patients. (Hass, et al., 321: 501-507 (1989); Weber, et al., 66: 1461-1468 (1990); Lekstrom and Bell, 70: 161-177 (1991)). In particular, the use of the thienopyridines in antiplatelet therapies has been shown to increase the incidence of potentially life threatening thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (Bennett, et al., 342: 1771-1777 (2000)). Aspirin, which has a beneficial effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation (Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, 308: 81-106 (1994); Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, 1 308: 159-168 (1994)), acts by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. Its well-documented, high incidence of gastric side effects, however, limits its usefulness in many patients. In addition, aspirin resistance has been observed in some individuals (McKee, et al, 88: 711-715 (2002)).","Many studies have demonstrated that adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP) plays a key role in the initiation and progression of arterial thrombus formation (Bernat, et al., 70: 812-826 (1993)); Maffrand, et al., 59: 225-230 (1988); Herbert, et al., 13: 1171-1179 (1993)). ADP induces inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and modulation of intracellular signaling pathways such as activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), influx and mobilization of intracellular Ca, secretion, shape change, and platelet aggregation (Dangelmaier, et al. 85: 341-348 (2001)). ADP-induced platelet aggregation is triggered by its binding to specific receptors expressed in the plasma membrane of the platelet. There are at least three different P2 receptors expressed in human platelets: P2X, P2Y, and P2Y. The P2Xreceptor is a ligand-gated cation channel that is activated by ATP, resulting in a transient influx of extracellular calcium. This receptor has been implicated in the regulation of platelet shape change, and recent evidence suggests its participation in thrombus formation in small arteries under high shear forces. (Jagroop, et al., 14:15-20 (2003); Hechler, et al., 198: 661-667 (2003)). The P2Yreceptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by ADP, and is responsible for calcium mobilization from intracellular stores, platelet shape change and initiation of aggregation. The P2Yreceptor, also referred to as the P2Yand P2receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by ADP and is responsible for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of PI3K. Activation of P2Yis required for platelet secretion and stabilization of platelet aggregates (Gachet, 86: 222-232 (2001); Andr\u00e9, et al., 112: 398-406 (2003)).","ADP-induced platelet aggregation requires the simultaneous activation of both P2Yand P2Yreceptors, and therefore, aggregation can be inhibited by blockade of either receptor. Several authors have demonstrated that ADP-induced aggregation is inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by analogues of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP, itself, is a weak and nonselective, but competitive, P2Yand P2Yreceptor antagonist. Ingall, et al. (42: 213-220 (1999)) have reported that modification of the polyphosphate side chain of ATP along with substitution of the adenine moiety at the C-position, resulted in compounds that inhibited the P2receptor (or P2Yreceptor). Zamecnik (U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,550) has disclosed a method for inhibiting platelet aggregation by administration of a diadenosine tetraphosphate-like compound, App(CH)ppA. Kim and Zamecnik (U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,823) have disclosed P, P-(dithio)-P, P-(monochloromethylene)-5\u2032, 5\u2032\u2033-diadenosine-P, P-tetraphosphate as an antithrombotic agent.","Nucleotide P2Yantagonists have been developed, however, there is still a need for compounds that have improved oral bioavailability and blood stability.","Thienopyridines, ticlopidine and clopidogrel react covalently with the P2Yreceptor and produce irreversible platelet inhibition in vivo (Quinn and Fitzgerald, 100: 1667-1672 (1999); Geiger, et al., 19: 2007-2011 (1999); Savi, et al., 84: 891-896 (2000)). Patients treated with thienopyridines usually require 2-3 days of therapy to observe significant inhibition of platelet aggregation, however, and maximal inhibition usually is observed between 4 to 7 days after initiation of treatment. Also, the platelet inhibitory effect of thienopyridines persists up to 7-10 days after the therapy is discontinued, and both ticlopidine and clopidogrel produce a significant prolongation of the bleeding time (from 1.5 to 2-fold over control). Because of the prolonged effect of thienopyridines, these drugs need to be discontinued for 7 to 10 days prior to elective surgery, leaving the patient unprotected from a possible thrombotic event during that period. Recently, the association of thienopyridine treatment with events of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported (Bennett, et al., 342: 1773-1777 (2000); Bennett, et al., 128: 541-544 (1998)).","Derivatives of 5,7-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazolol[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3-yl-cyclopentanes and -tetrahydrofurans have been disclosed as antagonists of the P2T- (or P2Y) receptor on platelets (Cox, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,496, and related patents; Bonnert, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,232; WO 98\/28300; Brown, et al., WO 99\/41254; WO 99\/05144; Hardern, et al. WO 99\/05142; WO 01\/36438; and Guile, et al. WO 99\/05143) for use in the treatment of platelet aggregation disorders.","Guile, et al. (WO 00\/04021) disclose the use of triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine compounds in therapy. Brown, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,064) disclose the use of Triazolo(4,5-d)pyrimidine compounds in the treatment of myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Dixon, et al. (WO 02\/096428) disclose the use of 8-azapurine derivatives in combination with other antithrombotic agents for antithrombotic therapy. Springthorpe discloses AZD6140 as a potent, selective, orally active P2Yreceptor antagonist which is now in Phase I clinical trials (Abstracts of Papers, 225ACS National Meeting, New Orleans, La.; March, 2003; MEDI-016). WO 02\/016381 discloses a method of preventing or treating diseases or conditions associated with platelet aggregation using mononucleoside polyphosphates and dinucleoside polyphosphates.","There is still a need in the areas of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular therapeutics, and in blood product preparation, purification, and storage, for selective, reversible inhibitors of platelet activation, which can be used in the prevention and treatment of thrombi or other aggregation-related problems.","This invention is directed to methods of preventing or treating diseases or conditions associated with platelet aggregation or where the aggregation of platelets inhibits treatment options. This invention is directed to methods of preventing or treating thrombosis and related disorders. This invention is further directed to methods of inhibiting platelet aggregation in blood and blood products comprising platelets, such as stored blood.","The method comprises administering to a mammalian subject or to a sample comprising blood or platelet-comprising material, a composition comprising one or more non-nucleotide P2Yreceptor antagonist compound that effectively binds to P2Yreceptors on platelets, preferably in a reversible manner, and thereby causes an inhibition of the ADP-induced platelet aggregation response in blood or in a platelet-comprising material.

As a practical matter however, the compounds as depicted represent the pure forms of the diastereomers. Diastereomers are distinct compounds, each with potentially different chemical and biological properties; thus pure forms are preferred as pharmaceutical agents. In addition, there are generally reasons, including but not limited to, the ease of chemical synthesis or separation, chemical or biological stabilility, toxicity, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties in living systems, and the like, to choose between the two possible isomers. While it is possible to resolve such diastereomeric mixtures using chiral chromatographic methods, more preferred is the synthesis of a single diastereomer.","Depending on the acetal in question, the synthesis of a single diastereomer can be achieved in several ways. In some cases, one diastereomer can be selectively generated over the other by carrying out the acetal-forming reaction at a low temperature (such as below 0\u00b0 C., for example, from \u221210 to \u221230\u00b0 C.). In other cases, a mixture of two diastereomers having different acetal stabilities can be subjected to aqueous acidic conditions, which leads to decomposition of the less-stable diastereomer, while leaving the more stable diastereomer intact. In general, the single diastereomer that survives the decomposition is preferred, since chemical stability is an important attribute for a pharmaceutical product. These principles are exemplified and illustrated in the following compound examples, but as they can be reasonably expanded to related structures; the specific example should not be taken as limiting.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the compound of Formula I is a compound of Formula

It outlines a solid-phase procedure that is useful for the introduction of functionality at the 6-position, as well as for transketalization at the 2\u2032,3\u2032-position, if desired. It should be noted that the chemistry procedures used in these solid phase approaches are similar to methods known and used for solution-phase chemical transformations involving the synthesis of adenosine, guanosine, 8-azaadenosine, etc., derivatives. The primary differences are the necessity of attachment of a starting material to a resin, the simplicity of resin-based purification techniques (filtration and washing by compatible solvents) compared to solution-phase techniques (chromatography, crystallization, etc.), and the requirement for cleavage of a compound of the invention, or an intermediate useful for the synthesis of a compound of the invention from a resin prior to final purification and\/or use of a compound so cleaved.","In Scheme 5, an early intermediate, such as a 6-chloroadenosine-2\u2032,3\u2032-ketal or -acetal derivative, or a 6-chloro-8-aza-adenosine-2\u2032,3\u2032-ketal or -acetal derivative is attached to a resin such as polystyrene resin via a \u03b2-thioethanol linker (e.g., hydroxyethylsulfanylmethyl polystyrene; HESM polystyrene resin; Garcia-Echeverria, 38, 8933-7 (1997)). After workup by filtration and rinsing with a useful solvent like dimethylformamide (DMF), the resin bound material is treated with a primary amine, ammonia or a hydroxylamine derivative to introduce an amino group via displacement of the 6-chloride. As with solution phase techniques, subsequent introduction of an ureido-, thioureido-, or guanidino-group at Ncan be made in one step using an excess of an appropriate isocyanate, isothiocyanate, carbodiimide, carbamoyl chloride, or 2-alkyl-2-thiopseudourea; or using a chemical equivalent of such materials. Alternatively, a two-step approach can be used to introduce a group at N, which comprises treatment of an appropriate 6-amino derivative, synthesized as in Scheme 5, with a solution of a small excess of phosgene or thiophosgene and a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene at a temperature which allows reaction, followed by treatment with an excess of a primary or secondary amine to give a resin-bound urea or thiourea after workup.

Cleavage from the \u03b2-thioethanol linker of the solid phase, as shown for the HESM polystyrene resin in Scheme 5 is performed in two steps: oxidation of the thioether-linker using an oxidizing agent like m-chloroperbenzoic acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane gives a sulfone-linker, and cleavage of the \u25a1-ether moiety from the oxidized linker occurs upon treatment with a strong base like DBU in a solvent like dichloromethane and yields a compound which can be purified by techniques known in the art. Preferred oxidizing agents include peracids like m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) and peracetic acid, but other oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide, permanganate salts, or persulfate salts can be used to oxidize a thioether to a sulfone.

Since platelets are non-nucleated cell particles that lack the ability to synthesize new proteins, treatment of subjects with irreversible P2Yantagonists results in the impairment of platelet function that lasts for the lifespan of the platelet (approximately 8 to 10 days). The use of irreversible P2Yantagonists such as clopidogrel has been associated with increases in blood loss, transfusion requirements and rate of reoperation after cardiac surgery (Kapetanakis, et al., Eur Heart J 26: 576-83, 2005). To avoid these complications, subjects undergoing elective surgeries are required to discontinue the treatment with irreversible antagonists for at least five days prior to the surgery, which increases the risk of a thrombotic event during this period. Therefore, the compounds described in this invention represent an advantage over the currently marketed compounds.","The ADP-induced platelet aggregation is mediated by the simultaneous activation of both P2Yand P2Yreceptors, thus the combined administration of the Formula I compounds with antagonists of platelet P2Yreceptors can provide a more efficacious antithrombotic effect at concentrations of each antagonist that are below the effective concentrations to block each receptor subtype in other systems, resulting in a decrease of the potential manifestation of adverse effects.

Compounds of the invention can be administered to prevent adhesion.","Other applications of these compounds include prevention of platelet thrombosis, thromboembolism and reocclusion during and after thrombolytic therapy and prevention of platelet thrombosis, thromboembolism and reocclusion after angioplasty of coronary and other arteries and after coronary artery bypass procedures.","The active compounds can be administered systemically to target sites in a subject in need such that the extracellular concentration of a P2Yantagonist is elevated to block the binding of ADP to P2Yreceptor, thus inhibit the platelet aggregation. The term systemic as used herein includes subcutaneous injection, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, intravitreal injection, infusion, inhalation, transdermal administration, oral administration, rectal administration and intra-operative instillation.","For systemic administration such as injection and infusion, the pharmaceutical formulation is prepared in a sterile medium. The active ingredient, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can also be dissolved in the vehicle. The sterile injectable preparation can be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic acceptable diligent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are sterile water, saline solution, or Ringer's solution.","Another method of systemic administration of the active compound involves oral administration, in which pharmaceutical compositions containing active compounds are in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, viscous gels, chewable gums, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.","For oral use, an aqueous suspension is prepared by addition of water to dispersible powders and granules with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent one or more preservatives, and other excipients. Suspending agents include, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose and sodium alginate. Dispersing or wetting agents include naturally-occurring phosphatides, condensation products of an allylene oxide with fatty acids, condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters from fatty acids and a hexitol, and condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anydrides. Preservatives include, for example, ethyl, and n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate. Other excipients include sweetening agents (e.g., sucrose, saccharin), flavoring agents and coloring agents. Those skilled in the art will recognize the many specific excipients and wetting agents encompassed by the general description above.","For oral application, tablets are prepared by mixing the active compound with nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients can be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets can be uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Formulation for oral use can also be presented as chewable gums by embedding the active ingredient in gums so that the active ingredient is slowly released upon chewing.","Additional means of systemic administration of the active compound to the target platelets of the subject would involve a suppository form of the active compound, such that a therapeutically effective amount of the compound reaches the target sites via systemic absorption and circulation.","For rectal administration, the compositions in the form of suppositories can be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the compound. Such excipients include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.","The active compounds can also be systemically administered to the platelet aggregation sites through absorption by the skin using transdermal patches or pads. The active compounds are absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin. Plasma concentration of the active compounds can be controlled by using patches containing different concentrations of active compounds.","One systemic method involves an aerosol suspension of respirable particles comprising the active compound, which the subject inhales. The active compound would be absorbed into the bloodstream via the lungs, and subsequently contact the target platelets in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The respirable particles can be liquid or solid, with a particle size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx upon inhalation; in general, particles ranging from about 1 to 10 microns, but more preferably 1-5 microns, in size are considered respirable.","Another method of systemically administering the active compounds to the platelet aggregation sites of the subject involves administering a liquid\/liquid suspension in the form of eye drops or eye wash or nasal drops of a liquid formulation, or a nasal spray of respirable particles that the subject inhales. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the active compound for producing a nasal spray or nasal or eye drops can be prepared by combining the active compound with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile pyrogen free water or sterile saline by techniques known to those skilled in the art.","Intravitreal delivery can include single or multiple intravitreal injections, or via an implantable intravitreal device that releases P2Yantagonists in a sustained capacity. Intravitreal delivery can also include delivery during surgical manipulations as either an adjunct to the intraocular irrigation solution or applied directly to the vitreous during the surgical procedure.","For systemic administration, plasma concentrations of active compounds delivered can vary according to compounds; but are generally 1\u00d710\u22121\u00d710moles\/liter, and preferably 1\u00d710\u22121\u00d710moles\/liter.","The pharmaceutical utility of P2Yantagonist compounds of this invention is indicated by their inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. This widely used assay, as described in S. M. O. Hourani et al. 105, 453-457 (1992) relies on the measurement of the aggregation of a platelet suspension upon the addition of an aggregating agent such as ADP.","The invention is illustrated further by the following examples that are not to be construed as limiting the invention in scope to the specific procedures described in them.","Adenosine (10 g, 37 mmol was dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide (100 mL) and dimethoxypropane (25 mL) followed by addition of Amberlyst 15H resin.

Blood is collected into one-sixth volume of acid\/citrate\/dextrose (ACD) buffer (85 mM sodium citrate, 65 mM citric acid, and 110 mM glucose). Collected blood is placed in a water bath at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Blood is then centrifuged at 275\u00d7g for 16 minutes at room temperature and the platelet-rich plasma is removed and centrifuged at 2200\u00d7g for 13 minutes at room temperature. The platelet pellet is resuspended in 40 mL of HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl, 2 mM CaCl, 12 mM NaHCO, 0.36 mM NaHPO, 5.5 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.35% bovine serum albumin or 0.35% human serum albumin) containing 10 U\/mL heparin and 5 \u03bcM (final concentration) prostaglandin I(PGI). The platelet suspension is incubated in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath for 10 minutes and then 5 \u03bcM (final conc.) PGIis added just before centrifugation at 1900\u00d7g for 8 minutes. The resulting pellet is resuspended in 40 mL of HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution containing 5 \u03bcM (final concentration) PGIand then is incubated for 10 minutes in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath. A small aliquot (500 \u03bcL) of the platelet suspension is removed for platelet counting. Prior to centrifugation 5 \u03bcM(final concentration) PGIis added to the suspension and then the suspension is centrifuged at 1900\u00d7g for 8 minutes. The pellet is resuspended at a density of 5\u00d710cells\/mL in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution containing 0.05 U\/mL apyrase.","Aggregation Studies: ADP-induced platelet aggregation is determined by measuring the transmission of light through a 0.5 ml suspension of stirred (1000 rpm) washed platelets in a lumi-aggregometer at 37\u00b0 C. (Chrono-Log Corp, Havertown, Pa.). The baseline of the instrument is set using 0.5 ml of Hepes-buffered Tyrode's solution. Prior to aggregation measurements, the platelet suspension is supplemented with 1 mg\/ml fibrinogen. Platelet aggregation is initiated by the addition of indicated concentrations of ADP or other agonists, and the light transmission is continuously recorded for at least 8 min. When inhibitors of platelet aggregation are tested, platelets are incubated for 2 min in the presence of indicated concentrations of inhibitor before addition of ADP or other agonists, and the response is recorded for at least 8 min. The potency of agonists and inhibitors of platelet aggregation is calculated from both the rate of aggregation and the maximal extent of aggregation obtained for each determination by fitting the data to a four-parameter logistic equation using the GraphPad software package (GraphPad Corp. San Diego, Calif.).","When a broad range of concentrations of P2Yantagonist is tested (usually from 1 nM to 100 \u03bcM), an ICvalue is also obtained. ICvalues represent the concentration of antagonist necessary to inhibit by 50% the aggregation elicited by a given concentration of ADP.","Human blood is obtained from informed healthy adult volunteers. Blood is collected into syringes containing heparin, sodium citrate, PPACK or hirudin as anticoagulant. Blood is carefully transferred to a conical tube and maintained at room temperature. Assays are conducted within 60 min from the collection of the blood sample. ADP-induced platelet aggregation is performed using the impedance mode of an aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp. Havertown, Pa.). Blood is gently mixed and an aliquot of 500 \u03bcL is transferred to a measurement cuvette, then, 450 \u03bcL of warm sterile saline is added to each cuvette and the sample is stirred at 1000 rpm. The impedance probe is introduced into the cuvette and the sample is allowed to warm for approx. 3-4 minutes in the aggregometer. The basal impedance is recorded for 1 minute and then 50 \u03bcL of the appropriate concentrations of ADP are added to generate an ADP dose response curve. For the evaluation of P2Yreceptor antagonists on platelet aggregation, after the basal impedance is recorded for 1 minute as indicated above, blood samples are supplemented with 50 \u03bcL of the antagonist or vehicle and after 2 minutes, 50 \u03bcl, of ADP (EC; usually 5-10 \u03bcmol\/L ADP) are added and the impedance is recorded for up to 8 minutes. The potency of agonists and inhibitors of platelet aggregation is calculated from the impedance values obtained in each sample by fitting the data to a four-parameter logistic equation using the GraphPad software package (GraphPad Corp. San Diego, Calif.).","To evaluate the ability of these compounds to inhibit platelet aggregation in vivo, an experimental protocol similar to the method of R. G. Humphries et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol. 115:1110-1116, 1995) is performed.","Surgical Preparation and Instrumentation: Male Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized. Body temperature is maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0 C. with a heating lamp. Animals breathe spontaneously and a tracheotomy is performed to ensure a patent airway. A cannula containing heparinized saline is introduced into the left femoral artery and connected to a transducer to record blood pressure and heart rate. Cannulae containing non-heparinized saline are introduced into the left common carotid artery and left jugular vein for withdrawal of arterial blood samples and intravenous administration of compounds, respectively. Experimental Protocol Either compound or vehicle is administered to each animal as an infusion. Blood samples are taken immediately prior to the first infusion, at the end of each infusion and 20 min after cessation of the final infusion for measurement of platelet aggregation ex vivo. Immediately after sampling, ADP-induced platelet aggregation is measured in duplicate in 0.5 ml blood samples diluted 1:1 with saline and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 min. For the final minute of this period, cuvettes are transferred to a lumi-aggregometer and the sample stirred at 900 rpm. ADP (3 \u03bcM) is added in a volume of 20 \u03bcl and the aggregation response is recorded using the impedance mode of the aggregometer.","To evaluate the effect of these compounds on thrombus formation in vivo, the following experimental protocol is performed.","Rats (CD-1; male; approximately 350 grams; Charles River, Raleigh, N.C.), are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg\/kg i.p.). The abdomens are shaved and a 22 gauge intravenous catheter is inserted into a lateral tail vein. A midline incision is made and the intestines are wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and positioned so the abdominal aorta is accessible. The inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta are carefully isolated and a section (approximately 1 cm) of the abdominal aorta (distal to the renal arteries proximal to the bifurcation) is dissected. All branches from the aorta in this section are ligated with 4-0 silk suture. A 2.5 mm diameter flow probe connected to a Transonic flow meter is placed on the artery and a baseline (pre-stenosis) flow is recorded. Two clips are placed around the artery decreasing the vessel diameter by approximately 80%. A second baseline flow measurement is taken (post-stenosis) and the hyperemic response is tested. Animals are then treated with either compound or saline intravenously via tail vein catheter. Thrombosis is induced five minutes after treatment by repeated external compressions of the vessel with hemostatic forceps. Two minutes post-injury, the vessel compressions are repeated and a 10 minute period of flow monitoring is started. Animals are monitored continuously for a minimum of the first ten minutes post-injury. After twenty minutes (post-injury), a flow measurement is repeated and the animals are euthanized. The section of the aorta that includes the injured section is harvested and placed in 10% formalin for possible histologic evaluation.","To evaluate the ability of these compounds to be absorbed orally and to inhibit platelet aggregation in vivo, the following experimental protocol is conducted.","Male Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized using an inhaled anesthetic. A cannula containing heparinized saline is introduced into the jugular vein for withdrawal of venous blood samples. Animals are allowed a 48-hour recovery period prior to dose administration.","Either compound or vehicle is administered to each animal as an oral gavage. Blood samples are taken immediately prior to compound administration, and at up to 12 time points ranging from 15 min to 24 hours following compound administration. HPLC-MS\/MS is used to measure the amount of compound and\/or metabolite in the blood samples.","To evaluate the effect of the compounds of this invention on dynamic thrombus formation in vivo, the following experimental protocol, similar to the method of J. L. Romson et al. (17:841-853, 1980), is performed.","Surgical Preparation and Instrumentation: Briefly, purpose-bred dogs are anesthetized, intubated and ventilated with room air. The heart is exposed by a left thoracotomy in the fifth intercostal space and suspended in a pericardial cradle. A 2-3 cm segment of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) is isolated by blunt dissection. The artery is instrumented from proximal to distal with a flow probe, a stimulation electrode, and a Goldblatt clamp. The flow probe monitors the mean and phasic LCCA blood flow velocities. The stimulation electrode and its placement in the LCCA and the methodology to induce an occlusive coronary thrombus have been described previously (J. K. Mickelson et al., 81:617-627, 1990; R. J. Shebuski et al., Circulation 82:169-177, 1990; J. F. Tschopp et al., Coron. Artery Dis. 4:809-817, 1993).","Experimental Protocol Dogs are randomized to one of four treatment protocols (n=6 per treatment group) in which the control group receives saline intravenously and the three drug-treated groups are administered compound intravenously. Upon stabilization from the surgical interventions, dogs receive either saline or compound. After approximately 30 minutes, an anodal current is applied to the LCCA for 180 min. The number and frequency of cyclic flow variations (CFV) that precede formation of an occlusive thrombus are recorded. These cyclic phenomena are caused by platelet thrombi that form in the narrowed lumen as a result of platelet aggregation (J. D. Folts et al., Circulation 54:365-370, 1976; Bush et al., Circulation 69:1161-1170, 1984). Zero flow in the LCCA for a minimum of 30 minutes indicates a lack of antithrombotic efficacy (L. G. Frederick et al., 93:129-134, 1996).","The ICvalues for the following compounds as inhibitors of ADP-induced aggregation of washed platelets were determined using the procedures provided in Example 14:\n\n","Platelet ICdata were determined using washed human platelets, according to the protocol of example 14.

For example, compounds falling under Formula I (1, 14, 19, 24, 26, and 36) show P2Yantagonist activity, despite having differing moieties at the 4\u2032 and 2\u2032\/3\u2032 (acetal) positions of the ribose, and\/or 6 (urea) position of the base. Additionally, compounds falling under preferred Formula IV (65, 69, and 70) illustrate that diastereomerically-pure molecules containing a prolinamide residue at the 4\u2032 position, a phenyl or styryl acetal moiety at the 2\u2032\/3\u2032 position, and an ethyl urea at the 6 position have improved potency relative to the less preferred compounds previously listed as falling under Formula I. Further, compounds falling under a more preferred Formula V (107, 108, 109, 110, 112, 115, 127, 128, and 130) show dramatically better potency (ICdata below 0.1 and even below 0.01 for Compound 112) believed to be as a result of their containing a benzyl ether (with or without substituents falling under the definition of M) or 2-nicotinylmethyl moiety at the 4\u2032 position, in addition to the preferred acetals and urea previously listed for preferred compounds falling under Formula IV.","Table 1 also shows that replacing the oxygen of the benzyl ether moiety and reducing the linking group between the ribose ring 4\u2032 position and the terminal phenyl ring falling under the definition of X and Formula II to two total atoms instead of three (158) still can lead to active molecules. Yet further, preferred compounds falling under Formula VII (183, 189, 191 and 210) show that P2Yantagonist activity can be obtained by modification of the ribose 4\u2032 position with simple, acyclic, non-aromatic moieties, in conjunction with the preferred styryl acetal and ethyl urea moieties previously described. Even further, preferred compounds falling under Formula IX (233) can show P2Yantagonist activity when one of the linking groups at the 4\u2032 position falling under the definition of A and B in Formula I is a carbamate moiety. In another illustration, preferred compounds falling under Formula X (239) show potent activity when part of the linking group between the 4\u2032 position of the ribose and the phenyl ring falling under the definition of moiety X in Formula I and Formula II is an amide. In yet another illustration, compounds falling under the definition of Formula XII (298) can be active when the moiety defined by X in Formula I and Formula II is a 5-membered heterocyclic ring. Taken together, Table 1 illustrates that a wide variety of molecules falling under the definitions of Formulae IV-XII can be useful as antagonists of P2Ymediated platelet aggregation, and consequently potentially useful as therapeutics in diseases where inhibition of platelet aggregation would be beneficial.","The invention, and the manner and process of making and using it, are now described in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, to make and use the same. It is to be understood that the foregoing describes preferred embodiments of the present invention and that modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims.
