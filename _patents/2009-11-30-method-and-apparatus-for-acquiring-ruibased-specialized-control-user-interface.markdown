A remote control RUIC device controls the RUIC using a CUI provided by the RUIC or the RUIS. The remote control device can be implemented as a mobile device or another portable device, such as a small display device having a communication function.","In an embodiment of the present invention, CUIs that are used for controlling the RUI rendered in an RUIC are classified in default CUIs and specialized CUIs. Thus, a user can select a specialized CUI through the remote control device and acquire the selected specialized CUI from the RUIS via the RUIC.","Referring now to , a diagram illustrates a system for providing a remote control device with default CUIs and a specialized CUI, according to an embodiment of the present invention. An RUIC  is shown having an embedded server  in communication with a remote control plug-in  via interface , and a first browser  in communication with the remote control plug-in  via interface . A remote control device  is shown having a second browser .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["502","602","502","500","500","604","604"]},"When a UI list request is received from the remote control device  at the embedded server  of the RUIC  in step , the embedded server  sends a request to the remote control plug-in  for a UI profile of a specialized CUI for controlling a RUI  currently running the RUIC  in step . The requested UI profile contains information regarding the compatible resolution of the specialized CUI and functions supported by the specialized CUI. The UI profile request is transferred in the form of an event from the remote control plug-in  to the RUI  currently running in the RUIC  in step . The RUI  forwards the request message to an RUIS  along with information on the specialized CUI that can control the currently running RUI  in step .","The RUIS  transmits the UI profile information appropriated for the specialized CUI and the RUI  to the RUI  in step . The UI profile information is transferred from the RUI  to the remote control plug-in  via an associated process, such as an application programming interface (API) in step , and then from the remote control plug-in  to the embedded server  in step . The embedded server  builds an element related to the specialized CUI and generates an XML UI list in step  that is provided to the remote control device  in step . A detailed description of the XML UI list is provided below with reference to .","In step , the remote control device  parses the XML UI list, and extracts a value of a <ui_profile> element for the specialized CUI and compares the <ui_profile> element value with its own UI_PROFILE. Specifically, the remote control device  determines whether it is capable of running the specialized CUI. If the profiles match, the remote control device  displays the UI list. In addition to the <ui_profile> element value relating the specialized CUI, element values relating to default CUIs can also be acquired from the XML UI list.","The user selects a button provided by the CUI that is currently presented on the remote control device  in order to acquire a specialized CUI. The button provided in the currently presented CUI is linked to a predetermined HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address at the CUI generation state. Thus, the selection of the button results in an HTTP protocol message requesting the specialized CUI that is transmitted via the interface between the remote control device  and the RUIC  to the embedded server  in step . The embedded server  forwards the request to the remote control plug-in  in step . Thus, by clicking the button designated for calling the specialized CUI, the user can acquire the specialized CUI from an RUIS  via the RUIC  in step .","Referring now to , a diagram illustrates a procedure for a remote control device to discover an RUIC and obtain description information, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Once the remote control device  is switched on, it discovers the RUIC  by transmitting an M-SEARCH message . The RUIC  responds to the remote control device  via an M-SEARCH response message  that provides description information based on location information. Through the description information, the remote control device  is able to extract the UI list URL. This further enables to the remote control device  to request and receive the XML UI list from the embedded server  in XML format or in the form of a modified UI. The XML UI list includes information on the CUIs that the embedded server  of the RUIC  can provide.","An XML UI list format for that provides the remote control device with access to the specialized CUI is defined as shown in . The XML UI list format is managed by an XML UI listing manager  of the embedded server  in the RUIC . In order for the XML UI listing manager  to generate the XML UI list format shown in , a specialized CUI-related element, <ui> element, is added. The <ui> element has the same XML schema as the conventional <ui> element, but includes a <uri> element that carries the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) value of the HTTP protocol used on an interface  between the remote control device  and the RUIC . Also, the name attribute of the <ui_profile> element has a value received from the RUTS.","The remote control device  can call for a specialized CUI using an HTTP get message such as URL:\/\/RUIC_ADDRESS:PORT\/request_cui via the interface  between the remote control device  and the RUIC . The specialized CUI is provided with the RUI from the RUIS and allows a user to control the RUI presented in the first browser  running in the RUIC . When an RUI has multiple CUIs, the remote control device  can call for the target CUI via a message such as URL:\/\/RUIC_ADDRESS:PORT\/request_cui?cui_name=<target cui name>, and having parameters such as the name of the target CUI or a CUI Identifier (ID).","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the specialized CUI is acquired by the remote control device  when the RUIC  provides a CUI list to the third RUIC  along with information on the specialized CUI. The user is then able to call the specialized CUI via the remote control device  quickly without a default CUI-involved intermediate process.","Referring now to , a diagram illustrates a conventional specialized CUI acquisition method and a specialized CUI acquisition method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the conventional CUI acquisition method, the remote control device  is executed in step , and a CUI list is requested by the remote control device  in step . The RUIC  creates an XML UI list having only default CUIs in step  and transmits the XML UI list to the remote control device  in step . A user of the remote control device  selects a default CUI for the remote control device . The remote control device  then uses the activated default CUI to acquire a specialized CUI in step . In step , the specialized CUI is displayed on a screen of the remote control device .","In the specialized CUI acquisition method of the present invention, the remote control device  is executed in step , and a CUI list is requested by the remote control device  in step . When a CUI list is requested by the remote control device , the RUIC  creates an element containing the specialized CUI information. The RUIC  creates an XML UI list having default CUIs and a specialized CUI in step  and transmits the XML UI list to the remote control device  in step . The user is then able to select the specialized CUI from the XML UI list and the specialized CUI is displayed on a screen of the remote control device  by parsing the XML format. Accordingly, the user may select and acquire a specialized CUI from the CUI list displayed on the screen in a single selection step.","While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
