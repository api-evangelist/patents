According to the previous example, a second type can be \u201cStrongsville, Ohio.\u201d The list can be filtered to remove \u201cVerizon\u201d and \u201cCox\u201d from the list because \u201cVerizon\u201d and \u201cCox\u201d are not cable providers in Strongsville, Ohio. The list would then include \u201cTime Warner,\u201d \u201cAT&T,\u201d and \u201cDishNetwork.\u201d The payee component  can then receive a selection of one or more of the plurality of payees. The selection can be based, for example, on services provided to a user. According to the previous example, a user can select \u201cAT&T\u201d from the list because the user receives AT&T U-Verse cable services and owes AT&T a payment for services provided. The type searched by the payee can also be \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cbusiness associate,\u201d or the like. For example, the payee component  can allow a user to enter a name of an individual or entity. The payee component can then find the payee and display a list of possible payees to the user. The user can then select a payee from the list. Still, the payee component  can allow a user to search for a payee by any type of keyword.","In an embodiment, a user can select a payee from a generated search list. The user may not know if the payee is correct or whether they have an account with the payee. In an aspect, the payee component can determine whether a user does in fact have an account with a particular payee already in existence. For example, the payee component  can verify that phone number 216-223-3798 has an account with cable service X. The payee component  can then notify the user that a match was determined and allow the user to import payee account information. Still in yet another aspect, where a match is not determined, the payee component can notify a user that an account does not exist associating a user with a payee.
