title: Implant delivery instrument
abstract: A surgical instrument has an elongate guide member and a reciprocable member. The elongate guide member provides a protected path of travel for an implant from outside the body to a position near a damaged tissue site. The reciprocable member is movable along the elongate guide member to push the implant along its path of travel. The reciprocable member can include an implant carrier. The implant can be an orthopaedic implant for repair or regeneration of soft tissue at a damaged joint site. The implant can be larger than the transverse dimension of the elongate guide member and folded or rolled to fit within the elongate guide member. Use of this instrument protects the implant from damage as it is delivered to the damaged joint site. The invention also includes a surgical method for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to a surgical instrument for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site in the human body.","Several different types of soft tissue are found in human joints. For example, a joint can include articular hyaline cartilage, intra-articular fibrocartilage, tendons and ligaments. Articular hyaline cartilage is found on the surfaces of the bones of the joint. Intra-articular cartilage is found between the joint surfaces. Tendons connect muscle to the bones of the joint, and ligaments connect articular extremities of the bones of the joint.","When the soft tissue of a joint is no longer healthy, there can be debilitating pain in the joint. Soft tissue health can be adversely affected by disease, aging, or trauma. The adverse effects of disease, aging and trauma can be, for example, in the form of a tear in the soft tissue, or in the form of a breakdown, thinning or delamination of the tissue.","One form of intra-articular cartilage that is frequently damaged or degenerated is the meniscus of the knee. The meniscus is frequently damaged in twisting injuries. It is also damaged with repetitive impact over time. Meniscus degeneration can also occur by aging; as a person ages, the meniscus can become soft in places, so that even common motions like squatting can cause meniscal tears.","Common surgical procedures for treating meniscal damage include tear repairs and menisectomies. A tear repair is most commonly performed when the tear is a clean longitudinal vertical lesion in the vascular red zone of the meniscus. The basic strategy is to stabilize the tear by limiting or eliminating radial separation of the faces of the tear when the meniscus is load bearing. Many devices and surgical procedures exist for repairing meniscal tears by approximating the faces of the meniscus at the tear. Examples of such devices and procedures are disclosed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,319,271; 6,306,159; 6,306,156; 6,293,961; 6,156,044; 6,152,935; 6,056,778; 5,993,475; 5,980,524; 5,702,462; 5,569,252; 5,374,268; 5,320,633; and 4,873,976.","Menisectomies involve the surgical removal of part of the meniscus. Such procedures have generally been performed in cases of radial tears, horizontal tears, vertical longitudinal tears outside the vascular zone, complex tears, or defibrillation. Although menisectomies provide immediate relief to the patient, in the long term the absence of part of the meniscus can cause cartilage wear on the condylar surface, eventually leading to arthritic conditions in the joint.","Such surgical procedures are commonly performed arthroscopically. In arthroscopy, small incisions are made at the affected joint to form portals for the insertion of instruments, including a small lens and lighting system (an arthroscope). The arthroscope is connected to a viewing device, such as a television monitor to allow the surgeon to see the interior of the joint. Other instruments are inserted through other portals to perform a variety of tasks. For example, the surgical instrument may include an implement for manipulating native tissue (for example, tissue grasping, tissue cutting, bone abrading).","Typical surgical instruments used in arthroscopic procedures include rongeurs, such as the Kerrison rongeur, punch forceps, basket forceps, suction punches and cup curet, for example. Examples of arthroscopic instruments are described and illustrated in O'Connor's Textbook of Arthroscopic Surgery, 2ed., 1992, Chapter 19.","Other common surgical techniques in orthopaedic surgery include open surgery and mini-arthrotomy. For example, for knee surgery, the surgery may be performed by an open knee arthrotomy, where the incision may typically be 20-30 cm in length, and wherein the patella is everted during surgery. Knee surgery may also be performed by a mini-knee arthrotomy, where the incision is typically 10-13 cm in length and patella tension is avoided.","Intra-articular fibrocartilage is also present, for example, in the temporomandibular joint and between vertebrae. Injury and degeneration can also occur to the intra-articular fibrocartilage in these other joints.","Another common site of soft tissue injury and degeneration is the rotator cuff in the shoulder. The rotator cuff comprises the tendons that attach muscles to a bone in the shoulder. Where one of the tendons is thin, delaminated or frayed to the point that surgical repair or reconstruction is necessary, the damaged tendon can be reinforced with graft tissue or with an orthopaedic implant.","A variety of orthopaedic implants are available for treating damaged soft tissue at a joint site. One commercially available orthopaedic implant is the RESTORE\u2122 orthobiologic implant. The RESTORE\u2122 orthobiologic implant comprises layers of small intestine submucosa. The commercial RESTORE\u2122 product is typically sold in the form of a thin circular sheet with a diameter of about 2.5 inches in diameter. Other shapes and sizes of RESTORE\u2122 orthobiologic implants can be used. In addition, the surgeon can cut the commercial RESTORE\u2122 product intra-operatively to the desired shape and size. The RESTORE\u2122 implant is used in treating rotator cuff injuries.","Orthopaedic implants for treatment of damaged menisci are disclosed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,042,610; 5,735,903; 5,681,353; 5,306,311; 5,108,438; 5,007,934; and 4,880,429.","Orthopaedic implants useful in approximating, repair or regeneration of fibrocartilage are disclosed in the following applications for U.S. patent Ser.

No. 09\/767,346 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,676 on Sep. 21, 2004).","As used herein \u201cimplant\u201d is intended to mean any device that is intended to be implanted at a damaged tissue site for the approximation, repair or regeneration of tissue at the damaged tissue site. \u201cOrthopaedic implant\u201d is intended to mean any device that is intended to be implanted at a joint site for the approximation, repair or regeneration of soft tissue at the joint site. While \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d are intended to include all of the devices identified in the preceding paragraph and commercial devices such as the RESTORE\u2122 orthobiologic implant, \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d should not be limited to these particular devices or to any particular material unless expressly set forth in the claims. For example, \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d as used herein are intended to include devices made from synthetic sources, from purified natural fibers as well as devices made from naturally occurring tissue. An implant may comprise a tissue scaffold, patch or graft (including autografts, allografts and hetergrafts), for example. In addition, \u201cimplant\u201d and \u201corthopaedic implant\u201d are intended to include such devices either alone or in combination with bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells, a biological lubricant, a biocompatible synthetic or a biocompatible inorganic material, for example.","Materials forming orthopaedic implants can find use in other parts of the body as well. Accordingly, the term \u201cimplant\u201d is intended to mean such materials regardless of their intended end use.","The present invention provides a surgical instrument and method that allow for delivery of implants to a damaged tissue site. The damaged tissue site can be a damaged joint site, such as in the area of the meniscus in the human knee joint or in the area of the rotator cuff of the shoulder joint, and the biologic implant can be an orthopaedic implant used to approximate, repair or regenerate damaged or diseased soft tissue at the damaged joint site.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a surgical instrument for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site in a human body. The instrument comprises an elongate guide member and a reciprocable member. The elongate guide member has a proximal end and a distal end. The elongate guide member provides a path of travel for the implant from the proximal end to the distal end. The reciprocable member is used to move the implant from a position along the elongate guide member to a position beyond the distal end of the elongate guide member at the damaged tissue site. The instrument also includes an implant carrier for carrying the implant so that the implant can be moved along the path of travel by moving the implant carrier. The implant carrier and the reciprocable member are discrete elements connected to define an assembly. The implant carrier comprises a base and a plurality of arms extending from the base. Each arm has a free end opposite the base. The implant carrier has a retracted position between the proximal end and distal end of the elongate guide member and an extended position beyond the distal end of the elongate guide member. When the implant carrier is in the retracted position, the arms of the implant carrier have a general longitudinal orientation with the free ends of the arms positioned distally away from the base and the reciprocable member when the implant carrier is in the retracted position. When the implant carrier is in the extended position, the arms of the implant carrier have a general radial orientation with the free ends of the arms positioned radially away from the base and the reciprocable member. The implant carrier has a transverse dimension perpendicular to the path of travel of the implant. The maximum transverse dimension of the implant carrier in the retracted position is less than the maximum transverse dimension of the implant carrier in the extended position. The instrument also includes a spring for urging the implant carrier to the retracted position. At least two of the instrument members include complementary structures for temporarily locking the implant carrier in the extended position.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a tissue repair system comprising a surgical instrument and an implant, the surgical instrument for delivering the implant to a damaged tissue site in a human body. The surgical instrument comprises an implant carrier, an elongate guide member and a reciprocable pusher member. The elongate guide member has a proximal end and a distal end. The elongate guide member provides a path of travel for the implant carrier from the proximal end to the distal end of the elongate guide member. The implant carrier has an extended position beyond the distal end of the elongate guide member and a retracted position between the proximal and distal ends of the elongate guide member. The reciprocable pusher member is used to move the implant carrier between the retracted and extended positions. The implant carrier comprises a base and a plurality of arms extending outwardly from the base. Each arm has a free end opposite the base. The arms of the implant carrier have a general longitudinal orientation with the free ends of the arms positioned distally away from the base and the reciprocable member when the implant carrier is in the retracted position. The arms of the implant carrier having a general radial orientation with the free ends of the arms positioned radially away from the base and the reciprocable member when the implant carrier is in the extended position. The implant carrier has a transverse dimension perpendicular to the path of travel of the implant. The maximum transverse dimension of the implant carrier in the retracted position is less than the maximum transverse dimension of the implant carrier in the extended position. The implant includes a sheet attached to the free ends of a plurality of the arms of the implant carrier when the implant carrier is in the retracted position and when the implant carrier is in the extended position. The implant has a first shape when the implant carrier is in the retracted position and a second shape when the implant carrier is in the extended position.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site in a body. A surgical instrument is provided. The instrument includes an elongate guide member having a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end of the elongate guide member is placed near the damaged joint site in the body. The implant is positioned between the proximal and distal end of the elongate guide member. The implant is moved along the elongate guide member until the implant is at the damaged tissue site.","The instrument of the present invention is useful in delivering an orthopaedic implant, as defined above, to a damaged joint site in the body. The joint site may for example be the knee, where the instrument can be used to deliver an orthopaedic implant for use in approximating, repairing or regenerating a diseased or damaged meniscus.  illustrates the use of one embodiment of the present invention in delivering an orthopaedic implant to an intra-articular site in the knee. The intra-articular site may be in other locations in the body, such as the temporomandibular joint, between vertebrae, or any site where there is fibrocartilage in need of approximation, repair or regeneration. The instrument of the present invention can also be used to deliver an orthopaedic implant to a location outside of the intra-articular space of a joint site. For example, the instrument of the present invention can be used to deliver an orthopaedic implant to the area of the rotator cuff of the shoulder joint site.  illustrate use of another embodiment of the present invention in delivering an orthopaedic implant to the area of a damaged rotator cuff in the shoulder. Unless expressly limited in the claims, \u201cjoint site\u201d as used herein is intended to include the intra-articular space and other areas near the bones comprising a joint. \u201cDamaged joint site\u201d, unless expressly limited in the claims, is intended to mean such a joint site that requires surgical repair, whether due to injury, degeneration or disease.","The instrument of the present invention may also find utility in delivering an implant to damaged tissue sites other than the joints. \u201cDamaged tissue site\u201d, unless expressly limited in the claims, is intended to mean a tissue site that requires surgical repair, whether due to injury, degeneration or disease.","Several embodiments of the instrument of the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The first embodiment of the instrument is designated A, the second embodiment is designated B, the third embodiment is designated C, the fourth embodiment D, the fifth embodiment E, the sixth embodiment F, the seventh embodiment G and the eighth embodiment H. All of these embodiments A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H share common components: they all include an elongate guide member  and an elongate reciprocable member . In each of the illustrated embodiments, the reciprocable member  is received in a telescoping manner within the elongate guide member.","The specific structures for each of these common components and other components of the surgical instruments may vary from embodiment to embodiment, as described in more detail below. In the drawings and in the following description, reference numbers for components of the different embodiments are generally followed by one or more of the letter references \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d, \u201cF\u201d, \u201cG\u201d and \u201cH\u201d, referring to the particular embodiment or embodiments discussed and illustrated. In general, components with the same number reference and different letter references are similar. The use of a reference number followed by two reference letters separated by a hyphen indicates a series including all letters between the two stated reference letters; for example, A-H refers to A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. In addition, unless a difference in structure, function or operation is emphasized for a component, it should be understood that descriptions for the various components or parts apply to all of the parts identified with the same reference number.","The elongate reciprocable member A-H in each of the embodiments A-H functions to move an orthopaedic implant, shown at  in , -, -, -, - and -, from a retracted position to an extended position. In the retracted position, the distal end of the reciprocable member A-H and the orthopaedic implant  are between the proximal end  and distal end  of the elongate guide member A-H. In the extended position, the distal end of the elongate reciprocable member is beyond the distal end  of the elongate guide member A-H, and is capable of being positioned at the damaged joint site as shown in . The elongate reciprocable member A-H and orthopaedic implant  have a path of travel between the retracted position and extended position. At least part of the reciprocable member A-H, and in some embodiments the orthopaedic implant  as well, are movable along the path of travel in both the proximal direction  and the distal direction . These directions of the path of travel are shown in , -, -,  and -.","The orthopaedic implant  can be of varying shapes and sizes. For example, the orthopaedic implant  can comprise a generally rectangular sheet as shown in , with a length shown at d, a width shown at d, a thickness shown at d, and a diagonal dimension shown at d. The orthopaedic implant  can have a pillow or pouch of additional material, such as shown at  in . This additional material can comprise, for example: extracellular matrix material; bioactive agents, biologically-derived agents, cells, a biological lubricant, a biocompatible synthetic or a biocompatible inorganic material, for example. Many such orthopaedic implants are flexible, particularly when hydrated. Thus, the orthopaedic implant  can be temporarily deformed as the implant is placed in the elongate guide member A-H. For example, the orthopaedic implant  can be rolled into a generally cylindrical shape as shown in , so that the maximum width of the implant is reduced to the dimension shown at din . Alternatively, the orthopaedic implant  can be folded over one or more times as shown in , to reduce the width or length of the orthopaedic implant; in , the overall length of the implant has been reduced to the dimension shown at dby folding the implant. When the orthopaedic implant  has been delivered to the damaged joint site, the implant can be unrolled or unfolded to its full size, returning the implant to the original shape, such as the shape shown in . It should be understood that the illustrated shapes of orthopaedic implants are provided as examples only; the present invention is not limited to any particular shape of orthopaedic implant unless expressly called for in the claims.","Values for the dimensions for the orthopaedic implant may be as follows: d=25 mm; d=15 mm; d=1 mm; d=20 mm; d=10 mm and d=12 mm. It should be understood that these dimensions are given as examples only; the present invention is not limited to any particular size of orthopaedic implant unless expressly called for in the claims. It should also be understood that the dimensions of the orthopaedic implant will depend somewhat on its intended end use; for example, a typical orthopaedic implant for use in rotator cuff repair could have a larger surface area than an orthopaedic implant for use in meniscal repair, although the meniscal repair implant could in some instances have a greater thickness.","With the reduced dimensions provided by temporarily deforming the shape of the orthopaedic implant, the implant can fit within the interior of the hollow elongate guide member A-H. The elongate guide member A of the first surgical instrument A comprises a hollow tube open at both the proximal end A and distal end A. The interior surface A of the elongate guide member A has an inner transverse dimension shown at din . Although the length dand width dof the orthopaedic implant  can be greater than the maximum inner transverse dimension dif the orthopaedic implant is in its natural shape (), the implant can be deformed until the dimension dor dis less than the inner transverse dimension dof the elongate guide member A so that the implant can be received in the elongate guide member.","The elongate guide member A illustrated in  and -D generally comprises a tube or cannula open at both proximal and distal ends A, A, with the outer surface and inner surface A being circular in shape when viewed from either the proximal end A or distal end A. It should be understood that this shape is provided as an example only; variations in the shape of the elongate guide member are possible, and the invention should not be considered to be limited to a particular shape unless expressly set forth in the claims. For example, instead of the outer surface forming a closed cylinder, the elongate guide member A could have a slot  as shown in . Instead of being circular in shape when viewed from one of the ends, the elongate guide member A could have an elliptical shape when viewed from the proximal end or distal end, as shown in , and could also have a slot  as shown in . Other shapes can also be used, such as the shape illustrated in . The elongate guide member A could also have other features, such as an actuator handle as described below with respect to the surgical instruments F and H. In addition, although the illustrated elongate guide members A-H generally comprise integral structures, it should be understood that assemblies could be used as well.","In the embodiments of , the elongate reciprocable member B-H includes an implant carrier portion B and a pusher portion B. The implant carrier portion B, C, E and pusher portion B, C, E can be integral, as in the surgical instruments B, C and E of  and -. The implant carrier portion D, F, G, H and pusher portion D, F, G, H can also be discrete elements as in the surgical instruments D, F, G and H, as shown in  and -. The discrete implant carrier F, G, H and pusher F, G, H can be connected to form an assembly, as in the surgical instruments F, G and H, as shown in , or could be separate components of the surgical instrument, as in the surgical instrument D of . In addition, the reciprocable member of the surgical instrument need not include an implant carrier; in the first illustrated surgical instrument A of , the reciprocable member A is defined by a pusher A element alone; there is no implant carrier in the first illustrated surgical instrument A.","In the first illustrated surgical instrument A, the pusher A of the reciprocable member A comprises a shaft A and an enlarged diameter head A at the distal end of the shaft. In the illustrated embodiment, the shaft A has a length of about 6 inches and a diameter of about 12 mm; the length of the shaft A is generally long enough so that the surgeon can grasp at least the distal end of the shaft both when the reciprocable member A is in the retracted position () and the extended position (); thus the shaft A is longer than the elongate guide member A. The head A of the reciprocable member A has an outer diameter shown at din . In the first illustrated embodiment, dis slightly less than the inner transverse dimension dof the elongate guide member A. The shape of the head A is generally circular in end view in the embodiment of , to complement the shape of the inner surface A of the elongate guide member A. If the elongate guide member has a different shape, such as an elliptical shape in transverse cross-section, the head A may be oval shaped to complement the shape of the inner surface of the elongate guide member.","Examples of values for the dimensions for the surgical instrument A may be as follows: d=10.5 mm and d=10 mm. The wall of the illustrated elongate guide member A has a total thickness of about 1.5 mm. Generally, it may be preferable to size the instruments so that they can be introduced through a typical arthroscopic portal if desired. Typical arthroscopic portals have a length of about 8-12 mm. However, the surgical instrument A can also be used in a minimally invasive procedure, such as a mini-arthrotomy, as well as in an open arthrotomy or other orthopaedic surgical procedure. The instruments could have larger sizes for use in these other procedures. In addition, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular dimension unless expressly called for in the claims.","To use the first illustrated surgical instrument A, the surgeon would first place the distal end A of the elongate guide member A at the damaged joint site. This step may be performed arthroscopically if desired. The surgeon would then fold or roll the orthopaedic implant  so that the implant can be inserted into the proximal end A of the elongate guide member A. With the reciprocable member A disassembled from the elongate guide member A, the surgeon would then insert the orthopaedic implant  into the proximal end A of the elongate guide member A and then insert the head  of the reciprocable member A into the proximal end A of the elongate guide member A. The reciprocable member A and orthopaedic implant would then be in a retracted position, such as that shown in . The surgeon would then push the reciprocable member A through the elongate guide member A toward the distal end A, so that the head A pushes the orthopaedic implant  in a distal direction until the orthopaedic implant  is pushed out the distal end A of the elongate guide member A and thereby delivered to the damaged joint site. At this point of the procedure, the surgical instrument A and orthopaedic implant  would be in the extended position illustrated in . The surgeon can then pull the reciprocable member A in a proximal direction and remove it from the elongate guide member A, leaving the elongate guide member in place for use with other instruments if desired; alternatively, the surgeon can pull both the reciprocable member and the elongate guide member in a proximal direction to remove both components of the instrument from the surgical site. In the first illustrated surgical instrument A, the inner surface A of the elongate guide member A is preferably smooth to enable the orthopaedic element to be slid along the inner surface A easily and without damage. The elongate guide member A and the reciprocable member A can both be made of a surgical grade plastic, such as medical grade ABS, for example. However, unless expressly called for in the claims, the present invention is not limited to any particular material for any of the components of the surgical instrument.","Thus, the orthopaedic implant  is delivered to the damaged joint site while protected from damage by the elongate guide member A.","After the orthopaedic implant  has been delivered to the damaged joint site, the surgeon may unfold or unroll the implant to restore it to its original shape. The surgeon can then secure the implant in place at the damaged joint site. The surgeon may use the device disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/609,768 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,473,259 issued Dec. 17, 2008), entitled \u201cImplant Stabilizing Instrument, Kit and Method,\u201d filed concurrently herewith by Andrew M. Jacobs, Carolyn K. Day, Rhonda B. Clarke, Herbert E. Schwartz, John W. Kemppainen, Prasanna Malaviya and Anthony D. Zannis, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The instrument, kit and method disclosed in that patent application may be used to move and stabilize the implant while securing the implant to the native tissue.","In the second illustrated surgical instrument B, the elongate guide member B may be of the same construction and size as that of the first surgical instrument A, and may be shaped as illustrated in . The second surgical instrument B differs from the first surgical instrument A primarily in the features and operation of the reciprocable member B. In the second surgical instrument B, the reciprocable member B comprises a hollow tube and includes an implant carrier B at its distal end and a pusher B extending proximally from the implant carrier to the proximal end of the reciprocable member B. In this embodiment, the reciprocable member B is an integral component: the implant carrier B and pusher B are integral parts of the elongate reciprocable member B.","As shown in , the implant carrier portion B of the elongate reciprocable member B of the second instrument B has a pair of spaced longitudinal slots ,  at its distal end, defining an integral arm  between the slots , . As shown in  and , the orthopaedic implant  can be temporarily fixed to the distal end of the reciprocable member B by wrapping the orthopaedic implant around the outer circumference of the elongate reciprocal member at the implant carrier B. Part of the implant is inserted in each of the slots ,  so that part of the implant is in the interior of the reciprocable member beneath the arm , thereby temporarily securing the implant to the implant carrier portion B of the reciprocable member B.","The elongate reciprocable member B may be made of any standard surgical grade material, such as a surgical grade plastic. An example of a suitable material is medical grade ABS. The elongate reciprocable member B may have a wall thickness of about 1-2 mm, an inner diameter of 8 mm and an outer diameter of 10 mm. The slots ,  may have a length of about 25 mm and a width of about 2 mm, and the arm  may have a length of about 2 mm and a width of about 4 mm. It should be understood that this material and these dimensions are provided as examples only; the present invention is not limited to this material or dimension unless expressly set forth in the claims.","The implant carrier B provides a structure to which the orthopaedic implant  can be temporarily secured and moved from a point outside of the body to a joint site, and more particularly to a damaged joint site. Providing such an implant carrier is advantageous in protecting the implant as it is moved to the damaged joint site, particularly where the damaged joint site is in an intra-articular space. First, any force necessary to move the implant can be exerted on the implant carrier B rather than on the orthopaedic implant itself. Second, since the implant carrier is in a retracted position within the elongate guide member as the distal end of the elongate guide member is moved to the damaged joint site, the orthopaedic implant is protected from damage as it is moved into the damaged joint site. Providing such an implant carrier also gives the surgeon some flexibility: the orthopaedic implant can be delivered to the damaged joint site in either a wet or dry condition.","To use the second illustrated instrument B, the surgeon would wrap the orthopaedic implant around the outer surface of the implant carrier portion B of the reciprocable member B and tuck a portion of the implant through the slots ,  and under the arm . The remainder of the surgical procedure would be similar to that described above for the first illustrated instrument A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 31","FIG. 32"],"b":["10","20","12","39","10","24","39","39","16","24"]},"The implant carrier B is movable along the elongate guide member B in both a proximal-distal direction and a distal-proximal direction. The elongate guide member B defines the path of travel of the implant carrier B. In addition, together the elongate guide member B and the implant carrier B are shaped to protect the orthopaedic implant from damage from tissue or other internal obstacles, which could otherwise tear, or damage the implant.","The third illustrated surgical instrument C shares features of both the first and second illustrated instruments A, B. The elongate guide member C can be substantially the same as those described above for the first and second instruments A, B. The elongate reciprocable member C of the third illustrated surgical instrument C comprises an elongate rod pusher portion C and an implant carrier portion C.","The implant carrier portion C of the third illustrated instrument C comprises a flexible enlarged portion of the distal end of the elongate reciprocable member C. The flexibility of the implant carrier portion C allows it to elastically deform to conform to the shape of the curved interior surface of the elongate guide member C when in the retracted position as shown in . Thus, when in the retracted position of , the implant carrier portion C has a maximum transverse dimension less than or equal to the inner diameter dof the elongate guide member C. When the implant carrier portion C is in the deformed, curved shape shown in , the orthopaedic implant  will roll into a shape like that shown in , reducing the maximum transverse dimension of the orthopaedic implant. When the reciprocable member C is extended so that the implant carrier portion C extends beyond the distal end of the elongate guide member C, the implant carrier portion C springs back to its enlarged shape, as shown in , where its maximum transverse dimension is that shown at din . The orthopaedic implant also springs back to its original shape as shown in , where its maximum transverse dimension is greater than the maximum transverse dimension dof the inner surface of the elongate guide member C. As with the first and second surgical instruments A, B, the third surgical instrument C allows for delivery of an orthopaedic implant larger than the maximum transverse dimension of the elongate guide member C to the damaged joint site.","In the third surgical instrument C, the implant carrier portion C has a plurality of spaced, small through-holes, shown at  in . The orthopaedic implant  can be temporarily secured to the implant carrier portion C by suturing the implant to the implant carrier. Such sutures are shown at  in .","Any surgical grade material with elastic properties can be used for the implant carrier portion C of the third surgical instrument C. An example of a suitable material is shape-memory plastic. A commercially available flexible shape memory material such as the Nitinol alloy of nickel and titanium can also be used. However, it should be understood that this material is provided as an example only; the invention is not limited to use of any particular material unless expressly set forth in the claims.","In the third illustrated surgical instrument C, the implant carrier portion C of the reciprocable member C is integral with the pusher portion C. However, it should be understood that these two portions could comprise discrete elements assembled to form the reciprocable member C.","In the third illustrated surgical instrument C, the pusher portion C of the reciprocable member C comprises a solid elongate rod, similar to the pusher portion A of the first illustrated instrument A. However, the pusher portion C of either embodiment could be a hollow tube as well.","Use of the third illustrated surgical instrument C is similar to that described above for the first two illustrated surgical instruments A, B. In using the third surgical instrument C, the surgeon would suture the orthopaedic implant  to the implant carrier portion C of the reciprocable member C and then deliver the implant to the damaged joint site by pushing the pusher portion C of the reciprocable member C and implant through the elongate guide member C. At the damaged joint site, the implant carrier B would spring into its expanded shape shown in . The surgeon can use standard surgical instruments to cut the sutures  and move the orthopaedic implant from the implant carrier C to the desired site at the joint.","The fourth illustrated surgical instrument D shares many features with those of the first three illustrated surgical instruments A, B, C. As shown in , the pusher portion D of the reciprocable member D is essentially the same as that described above for the first surgical instrument A. As shown in , the distal end D of the elongate guide member D of the fourth illustrated surgical instrument D includes an annular shoulder ; the remainder of the elongate guide member D is essentially the same as those described above for the first three illustrated instruments A, B, C. In the embodiment of , the surgical instrument D includes a discrete implant carrier D that is not connected to the pusher D. The illustrated discrete implant carrier D includes a cylindrical proximal portion  and integral opposing clip arms ,  extending axially from the cylindrical portion. The cylindrical portion  has an outer diameter slightly less than the inner diameter of the elongate guide member, and an axial length great enough to provide stability to the implant carrier D within the elongate guide member D. As shown in , the annular shoulder  of the elongate guide member D and the cylindrical portion  of the implant carrier D cooperate to prevent the implant carrier D from fully exiting from the distal end D of the elongate guide member D. In the fully extended position, only the opposing clip arms ,  of the implant carrier D extend beyond the distal end D of the elongate guide member D.","The discrete implant carrier D of the fourth illustrated instrument D may be made of any standard surgical grade material. It may be desirable for the clip arms ,  to be made of a flexible material such as spring stainless steel for example. However, the present invention is not limited to any particular material or property of material unless expressly set forth in the claims.","In using the fourth illustrated surgical instrument D, the surgeon would place part of the orthopaedic implant between the two opposing clip arms ,  of the implant carrier D and then place the combination of the implant carrier D and orthopaedic implant  into the proximal end D of the elongate guide member D, with the implant and clip arms facing the distal end D of the elongate guide member D. Next, the pusher D is inserted into the proximal end D of the elongate guide member D so that the head D of the pusher D is nearest the cylindrical portion  of the implant carrier D. With the implant carrier D in the retracted position shown in , the distal end D of the elongate guide member D is inserted at the damaged joint site, and the pusher D is pushed in a distal direction to thereby push the insert carrier D distally until the clip arms ,  and orthopaedic implant are in the extended position shown in . The surgeon can then use standard surgical instruments such as forceps at the damaged joint site to remove the orthopaedic implant from between the clip arms ,  and place the implant at the desired site for permanent attachment to the native soft tissue.","As with the other illustrated surgical instruments A-C and E-H, use of the fourth illustrated surgical instrument D allows for delivery of an orthopaedic implant larger than the maximum transverse dimension of the elongate guide member D to the damaged joint site. And as with the other illustrated surgical instruments A-C and E-H, the fourth illustrated surgical instrument D protects the orthopaedic implant from damage from tissue or other internal obstacles as the implant is delivered from outside the body to the damaged joint site.","In the fifth illustrated surgical instrument E shown in , the elongate guide member E comprises a slide, open at the top. The slide has guide channels ,  along its side edges. The maximum transverse inner dimension dof the slide is the transverse distance between these channels , . The reciprocable member E of the fifth illustrated instrument E comprises an integral implant carrier portion E and pusher portion E. The implant carrier portion E comprises a covered box open on the distal side. The implant carrier portion E has side edges ,  received and slidable within the guide channels ,  of the elongate guide member E when the implant carrier is in the retracted position shown in . The pusher portion E comprises a thin flexible sheet with side edges received within the guide channels ,  of the elongate guide member E.","The elongate guide member E of the fifth illustrated instrument E can have other shapes. Reference is made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/610,287, entitled \u201cSlide and Kit for Delivering Implants\u201d, filed concurrently herewith by Thomas S. Camino, Anthony D. Zannis, John W. Kemppainen and Herbert E. Schwartz. The shapes of the pusher portion E and the implant carrier portion E of the fifth illustrated instrument may be varied from those illustrated in  to complement the shape of the elongate guide member E.","Use of the fifth illustrated instrument E is similar to that described above for the second illustrated surgical instrument B. The orthopaedic implant can be folded or rolled and then placed in the implant carrier portion E for delivery from outside of the body to the damaged joint site. After the distal end E of the elongate guide member E is introduced at the damaged joint site, the side edges ,  of the implant carrier portion E can be inserted within the channels ,  at the proximal end E of the elongate guide member outside the body. The surgeon can then push the implant carrier portion E and implant along the length of the elongate guide member E until the implant carrier portion E is at the damaged joint site. The surgeon can then use standard surgical instruments to remove the implant from the implant carrier portion E and secure the implant at the damaged joint site.","As with the other illustrated surgical instruments A-D and F-H, use of the fifth illustrated surgical instrument E allows for delivery of an orthopaedic implant larger than the maximum transverse dimension of the elongate guide member E to the damaged joint site. And as with the other illustrated surgical instruments A-D and F-H, the fifth illustrated surgical instrument E protects the orthopaedic implant from damage from tissue or other internal obstacles as the implant is delivered from outside the body to the damaged joint site.","A sixth embodiment of the surgical instrument of the present invention is illustrated in . In the sixth illustrated instrument F, the elongate guide member F includes a hollow tube portion F and a handle portion F at the proximal end F of the elongate guide member F. The handle portion F has an enlarged diameter for the surgeon to hold, while the hollow tube portion F has an outer diameter that allows for use in arthroscopic surgical procedures, mini-arthrotomies or open arthrotomies. As best seen in , the hollow tube portion F has a J-shaped slot F extending from the exterior to the interior surface. The J-shaped slot F has two axially-oriented segments F, F joined at their distal ends by a transverse segment F. The J-shaped slot F receives a pin F fixed to the reciprocable member F of the sixth illustrated instrument F.","The reciprocable member F of the sixth illustrated instrument F comprises an assembly of four components. As best seen in , these four components include an elongate cylindrical shaft F, an enlarged actuator F connected to the proximal end of the elongate cylindrical shaft F, a connector member F connected to the elongate cylindrical shaft F, and an implant carrier F connected to the connector member F.","As shown in , the elongate cylindrical shaft F has an outside diameter that is slightly less than the inside diameter of the hollow tube portion F of the elongate guide member F to allow the elongate shaft F to be easily moved in the proximal and distal directions ,  within the hollow tube portion F. Although the illustrated shaft F is cylindrical, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to complementary cylindrical shapes for the shaft F and inner surface of the tube F.","The elongate shaft F has a first radial bore F about midway between the proximal and distal ends of the shaft F; this radial bore F receives the pin F in an interference fit. The first radial bore F extends from the outer surface of the shaft inward. The length of the pin F is greater than the depth of the bore F so that an end of the pin is exposed beyond the outer surface of the shaft F. The length of the pin F is great enough to extend into the J-slot F of the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. As the elongate shaft F is pushed in a distal direction, the pin F travels along the long axial segment F of the J-slot until the pin reaches the transverse segment F. By rotating the shaft F of the pusher F relative to the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F, the pin F can be moved along the short transverse segment F of the J-shaped slot  F until the pin F reaches the short axial segment F of the slot F. The shaft F can then be moved slightly in the proximal direction  relative to the tube F to move the pin F to the proximal end of the short axial segment F of the slot F.","The sixth surgical instrument F also includes a spring F positioned between the enlarged actuator F and the handle portion F of the elongate guide member F, urging these two components apart. As shown in , the proximal end of the spring F is received in a complementary recess in the interior of the actuator F and the distal end of the spring F is received in a complementary recess in the interior of the handle portion F of the elongate guide member F. The spring surrounds a portion of the elongate shaft F near the proximal end of the shaft. The proximal end of the shaft F is fixed to the actuator F.","When the pin F is in the long axial segment F of the J-shaped slot F, the spring F urges the shaft F and the pin F in a proximal direction, until the pin F is at the proximal end of the long axial segment F of the slot F as shown in , defining a retracted position of the reciprocable member F. When the pin F is at the proximal end of the short axial segment F of the J-shaped slot F, the reciprocable member F is in its extended position. Provision of the slot F and pin F allows the surgeon to lock the instrument in the extended position.","As shown in , the shaft portion F of the reciprocable member F includes a transverse bore F near the distal end of the shaft and an axial bore F extending in a proximal direction from the distal end face of the shaft F. The transverse bore is threaded and extends diametrically through the shaft F and intersects the longitudinal bore F. The longitudinal bore F of the shaft F receives an axial proximal rod F portion of the connector member F. To fix the connector member F to the elongate shaft F, a set screw (not shown) may be inserted through a bore F (see ) in the hollow tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. The set screw is threaded into the bore F until it contacts the axial proximal rod portion F of the connector member F. The set screw is short enough so that no part of the screw extends past the outer surface of the elongate shaft F of the reciprocable member F; thus, the set screw does not interfere with movement of the reciprocable member F in the proximal and distal directions , .","The connector member F also includes a cylindrical body portion F and a distal axial rod portion F. The cylindrical body portion F has an outer diameter that is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F to allow the cylindrical body portion F to move freely in the proximal and distal directions while providing stability to the distal end of the reciprocable member F. The cylindrical body portion remains within the tube portion F throughout the range of motion of the illustrated surgical instrument F. The distal axial rod portion F moves out the distal end of the tube portion F when the reciprocable member F is in the extended position shown in , ,  and . At the distal end of the distal axial rod portion F, the connector member F has a reduced diameter and a spherical end portion F.","The spherical end portion F of the distal axial rod portion F of the connector member  F is connected to the implant carrier portion F of the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F. The implant carrier portion F of the sixth instrument F comprises a base F and a plurality of arms F. In the sixth illustrated instrument F, the base F and arms F are integral. The base F has a spherical shape with an interior surface shaped to complement the spherical end portion F of the connector member F for mounting the implant carrier F to the connector member F.","The arms F of the implant carrier portion F extend outwardly from the base F. In the illustrated embodiment, there are four arms F spaced evenly about the base F, although fewer or more arms could be used. The arms F have different shapes depending on the position of the arms relative to the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. As shown in ,  and , the implant carrier portion F has a retracted position between the proximal end F and distal end F of the elongate guide member F. When in the retracted position, the arms F extend in a generally longitudinal direction; the free ends F of the arms F are directed toward the distal end F of the elongate guide member F. When in the extended position, the arms F extend outward from the base F in a radial direction, as shown in , ,  and .","In the sixth illustrated instrument F, the base F and arms F are made of a flexible material with elastic properties, such as a commercially available shape memory metal alloy like Nitinol (nickel-titanium alloy) or a suitable surgical grade polymer with such properties, such as shape-memory plastic. The natural shape of the base F and arms F is that shown in , ,  and , with the arms F extending radially outward from the base F. When the implant carrier portion F is moved in a proximal direction  into the elongate guide member F, the inner surface of the elongate guide member F deforms the arms F to the shape shown in ,  and , so that the arms F extend in a generally longitudinal direction. When the implant carrier portion is moved in a distal direction so that the arms F are free from the inner surface of the elongate guide member F, the elastic properties of the implant carrier portion F urge the arms F radially outward to the radially-expanded shape shown in , ,  and . Thus, in the retracted position, the maximum transverse dimension of the implant carrier portion F is less than the inner transverse dimension dof the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. In the extended position, the expanded transverse dimension dof the implant carrier portion is substantially greater than the inner transverse dimension dof the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. For example, the expanded transverse dimension dof the implant carrier portion F may be 20 mm; it should be understood that this dimension is provided as an example only, and the present invention is not limited to any particular value for the expanded transverse dimension dunless expressly called for in the claims. It should also be understood that dimensions may be varied depending on the intended end use of the surgical instrument. For example, it may be desirable to provide an instrument with a larger expanded transverse dimension for instruments intended for use in the shoulder than in the knee, or for instruments intended for use in a mini-arthrotomy instead of in an arthroscopic procedure. Since the implant carrier portion F of the sixth illustrated instrument F is a discrete component, it may be desirable to provide different sizes of implant carriers in a surgical kit to accommodate different sizes of orthopaedic implants.","As shown in , the free ends F of the implant carrier portion F of the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F include cut-outs or notches F. These notches F function in securing the orthopaedic implant to the arms F of the implant carrier portion F. For example, if the orthopaedic implant has barbs  at its periphery for securing the implant to soft tissue at the damaged joint site in the body, the barbs  can be received in the notches F in a friction fit to temporarily secure the implant to the implant carrier portion. The notches F could also serve to receive sutures. It should be understood that the notches F are provided as an example of a structure that could be used to temporarily secure the orthopaedic implant to the implant carrier. The arms F could also or alternatively include, for example, holes to receive suture for temporarily securing the implant to the implant carrier.","The connection between the implant carrier portion F and the connector member F of the reciprocable member F can be varied from that illustrated. For example, the spherical end portion F could be part of the implant carrier F and the complementary hollow portion could be part of the connector member F.","If the surgical instrument F is to be used repeatedly in numerous surgical procedures, the connector member F can be made of a material that should withstand the stresses exerted on the connector member by the deformation of the implant carrier F as it is moved between the retracted and extended positions. For example, the connector member F can be made of a surgical grade metal such as surgical grade stainless steel. The shaft F can be made of the same or a different material since the shaft F will be subjected to less stress in use. For example, the shaft F can be made of a surgical grade polymer such as medical grade acetal. The shaft F and connector member F can also comprise an integral structure if desired.","In using the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F, the surgeon would push the enlarged actuator F in a distal direction and rotate the actuator F to move the pin F along the J-shaped slot F until the pin F is at the proximal end of the short axial segment F of the slot, thereby temporarily locking the implant carrier portion F in the extended position shown in , ,  and . The surgeon can then secure part of the orthopaedic implant to the arms F of the implant carrier portion F, such as by wrapping suture around the implant and arm or, if the implant includes structures such as barbs, by placing one barb  in each notch F. Once the implant is secure on the arms of the implant carrier, the surgeon can push slightly on the actuator F and twist the actuator F to release the pin F and allow the spring F to urge the actuator F away from the elongate guide member F to thereby move the shaft F in a proximal direction . As the shaft F is moved in the proximal direction , the implant carrier F is pulled into the interior of the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. The inner surface of the tube portion F of the elongate guide member deforms the arms F of the implant carrier, pushing the arms F closer together so that the entire implant carrier F can fit within the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. As the implant carrier F is temporarily deformed, the orthopaedic implant folds into a more compact shape to fit within the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F, as shown in .","With the implant carrier F in the retracted position shown in , the distal end F of the elongate guide member F is inserted at the damaged joint site, as shown for example in . Once the distal end F of the elongate guide member F is properly positioned at the damaged joint site, the surgeon can push on the actuator F to move the shaft F in a distal direction  until the implant carrier portion F is outside of the confines of the tube portion F of the elongate guide member F. Once released from the tube portion F, the elasticity or shape memory of the arms F urges the arms F to the extended position as shown in , thereby expanding the orthopaedic implant at the damaged joint site. The surgeon can then use standard surgical instruments such as forceps at the damaged joint site to remove the orthopaedic implant from the arms F of the implant carrier F and place the implant at the desired site for permanent attachment to the native soft tissue.","As with the other illustrated surgical instruments A-E and G-H, use of the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F allows for delivery of an orthopaedic implant larger than the maximum transverse dimension of the elongate guide member F to the damaged joint site. And as with the other illustrated surgical instruments A-E and G-H, the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F protects the orthopaedic implant from damage from tissue or other internal obstacles as the implant is delivered from outside the body to the damaged joint site.","Variations can be made in the structure of the implant carrier portion F of the reciprocable member F. In the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G (), the elongate guide member G may be substantially like that of the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F. In the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G, the implant carrier portion G differs from that of the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F in that the base G and arms G of the implant carrier portion G are discrete elements rather than integral components. In the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G, each arm G has a free proximal end G, a flexion portion G, a planar portion G and a clip G at the free distal end G. The arms G are shaped so that the free proximal end G is on the outside of the base G, the flexion portion G of each arm G fits through a slot G in the base G, and the planar portion G and distal end portion G are distal to the base G. As in the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F, the arms G may be made of a flexible, elastic material such as a shape memory alloy like Nitinol or a polymer material. The base G can be made of another material that does not deform as readily, such as standard surgical grade stainless steel or a polymer for example. The base G can be connected to the distal rod portion of the connector member G through any standard connection mechanism, such as a snap fit or through a mechanical connector like a screw or nut and bolt.","The arms G of the implant carrier G of the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G may be made so that their natural shape is that shown in , with the planar portions G and free distal ends G extending radially outward and with the free proximal ends G extending in a generally longitudinal direction. The position and natural shape illustrated in  define the extended position and shape of the implant carrier G.  illustrates the retracted position and deformed shape of the implant carrier G. In the deformed, retracted position, the arms G extend in a generally distal direction and fit within the inner diameter of the tube portion G of the elongate guide member G.","The end clip portions G of the arms G of the implant carrier G of the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G are provided for temporary mounting of the orthopaedic implant  to the implant carrier G. The end clip portions G may be integral or discrete spring action clips that bear against portions of the implant to secure a part of the implant to each arm as illustrated in . Portions of the implant can be received between the end clip portion G and the underlying planar portion G of the arms G.","The remainder of the seventh illustrated surgical instrument may be the same as that described above for the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F. It should however be understood that some of the features of the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F are optional ones; for example, the spring F need not be used.","Use of the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G would be substantially the same as that described above for the sixth illustrated surgical instrument F. The main distinction in use of the seventh illustrated surgical instrument would be in the manner of temporarily securing the orthopaedic implant to the implant carrier G. With the seventh illustrated surgical instrument G, part of the implant would be tucked beneath each clip portion G of the implant carrier G.","An eighth embodiment of a surgical instrument in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in  at H. The eighth illustrated surgical instrument shares many common features with the sixth and seventh illustrated instruments F, G as described above. The implant carrier H of the eighth illustrated instrument H has arms H with end clips H like those of the seventh instrument G. The implant carrier portion H and the distal rod H of the connector member H of the eighth illustrated surgical instrument H are somewhat different from those of the sixth and seventh illustrated surgical instruments F, G. In the eighth illustrated surgical instrument H, the distal end of the distal rod H has flat parallel surfaces H. The base H of the implant carrier H is integral with the arms H, and comprises a pair of spaced parallel tabs H (see ) that are placed against the flat parallel surfaces H (see ) of the distal rod H. The spaced parallel tabs H are connected to the distal rod H through screws, bolts, pins or the like extending through aligned holes in the tabs H and flat surfaces H.","Use of the eighth illustrated surgical instrument H is like that described above for use of the sixth and seventh illustrated surgical instruments F, G.","Although the invention has been described with reference to the delivery of an orthopaedic implant to a damaged joint site, it will be appreciated that the invention has broader applications. For example, the instrument of the present invention can also be used to deliver other types of implants to other damaged tissue sites in the body. The present invention could be used to deliver any type of tissue scaffold, patch or graft to any type of tissue site, and the illustrated embodiments may be modified if desired to allow for such use. Unless otherwise expressly limited, the claims should not be construed as being limited to the delivery of orthopaedic implants to damaged joint sites.","Alternative instruments for delivering an implant to a damaged tissue site are disclosed in the following U.S. Patent Applications, filed concurrently herewith and incorporated by reference herein in their entireties: U.S. patent application Ser.
