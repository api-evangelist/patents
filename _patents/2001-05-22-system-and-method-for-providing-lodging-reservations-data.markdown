{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention pertains to the field of lodging reservations data. More specifically, the invention relates to a system and method for providing lodging reservations data that allows current availability and rate data to be provided.","Lodging reservations data systems are known in the art. Such lodging reservations data systems store room availability data, rate data, and other suitable data for use by guests, operators, or reservation agents of the lodging facility. These lodging reservations data systems allow the guests, operators, or reservation agents to determine room availability and rate information for the lodging facility, so as to make decisions on to whether to book a room, to assist with the room reservation process, or for other purposes.","Likewise, reservation systems are known that compile data for multiple lodging facilities. However, these reservation systems for multiple facilities are not updated in real time. The distributed or local lodging reservations data systems are not configured to interface with the reservation systems for multiple facilities, because they are not controlled by the same entities. Unlike the situation that exists in the airline industry, car rental industry, or other similar industries, where a there are a small number of large service providers, the lodging industry is typified by a large number of lodging facilities that are independently owned and operated. Thus, it has not been feasible to modify the large number of local reservation systems so that updated information can be provided to a reservation system for multiple facilities. As a result, search functionality for such systems is primitive, and typically limited to identifying properties that must then be separately contacted to determine whether reservations are available for a date of interest, and the rate for such reservations.","To resolve the problems with prior art systems, reservation systems for multiple facilities use static databases that reflect a small number of rates and availability data that is updated infrequently or not at all. A frequent problem encountered by such users is that the first reservation system will indicate availability of reservations or a particular rate, but upon contacting the local reservation data system, the user will find that the rate does not exist, or that rooms are not available. Thus, users of such reservation systems for multiple facilities must not only contact a reservation data system for each separate lodging facility of interest, but also frequently encounter facilities that do not have the rates of interest or do not have room availability. Thus, a user who is attempting to find a number of comparable properties to do a price comparison or provide options to a traveler must often directly contact a large number of properties to obtain on several choices or price points.","In accordance with the present invention, a system and method for providing lodging reservations data are presented that overcome known problems with providing lodging reservations data.","In particular, a system and method for providing lodging reservations data are provided that allow lodging reservations data from distributed sources to be assembled and compiled into a single database that is updated as rates or room availability changes, so as to allow a user to perform comparative analysis between available lodgings.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a system for providing reservation data is presented. The system includes a reservation data system interface that receives reservation data, such as the availability of rooms and rates for such rooms, and update data, such as when rates change or rooms are reserved, from two or more reservation systems, such as central reservation systems for two or more different hotels. A master reservation system receives the reservation data from the reservation data interface and stores the reservation data in a database, and updates the database with the update data. A user interface system coupled to the master reservation system receives reservation request data and provides updated reservation data in response to the reservation request data.","The present invention provides many important technical advantages. One important technical advantage of the present invention is a system and method for providing lodging reservations data that allows lodging reservations data from a plurality of sources to be combined and maintained. The present invention thus allows users to search across multiple properties so as to perform comparisons between available rates and rooms. The present invention also allows users to make reservations after locating a property with minimized risk that the property will not have a represented vacancy or rate.","Those skilled in the art will further appreciate the advantages and superior features of the invention together with other important aspects thereof on reading the detailed description that follows in conjunction with the drawings.","In the description that follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures might not be to scale, and certain components can be shown in generalized or schematic form and identified by commercial designations in the interest of clarity and conciseness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"System  includes reservation shopping engine , which can be implemented in hardware, software, or a suitable combination of hardware and software, in which can be one or more software systems operating on a general purpose server platform. As used herein, the term software system can include one or more objects, agents, lines of code, threads, subroutines, databases, application programming interfaces (APIs), web browser plug-ins, or other suitable data structures, and can include two or more different lines of code or suitable data structures operating in two or more separate software applications, on two or more different processing platforms, or in other suitable architectures. In one exemplary embodiment, a software system can include one or more lines of code or other suitable data structures operating in a general purpose software application, such as an operating system, and one or more lines of code or other suitable software structures operating in a specific purpose software application. In another exemplary embodiment, a software system can be implemented as a distributed software system, on a different processing platform than that shown in the exemplary embodiments herein, or in other suitable manners.","Reservation shopping engine  includes reservation data system interface , master reservation system , user interface system , and monitoring system . Master reservation system  stores room availability and rate data for a plurality of lodgings. The room availability and rate data stored in master reservation system  is updated in real time as reservations or rate changes are made at each of the distributed reservation data systems. Master reservation system  receives the updates through reservation data system interface .","Reservation shopping engine  is coupled to reservation data systems through by a communications medium . As used herein, the term \u201ccouple\u201d, and its cognate terms such as \u201ccouples\u201d and \u201ccoupled\u201d, can include a physical connection (such as through a copper conductor), a virtual connection (such as one or more randomly assigned memory locations of a data memory device), a logical connection (such as through one or more logical devices of a semiconducting circuit), a wireless connection, other suitable connections, or a suitable combination of such connections. In one exemplary embodiment, systems and components are coupled to other systems and components through intervening systems and components, such as through an operating system of a general purpose server platform. Communications medium  can be a local area network, a wide area network, the public switched telephone network, the Internet, a frame relay, a wireless network, an optical network, other suitable communications media, or a suitable combination of such communications media.","Multiple redundant servers can be used for reservation shopping engine , such that each system and data file is redundantly stored and maintained. In this manner, the maximum throughput for search and read transactions can be obtained while providing for rapid restart and recovery. Operating databases of the reservation shopping engine  in a random access memory with a non-volatile backup can likewise improve the performance of the database. Additional optimization can be achieved through the use of hashing algorithms to find chains and properties.","Reservation data systems through are lodging facility reservation data systems that are operated by single lodging facilities, collections of properties within the chain, entire chains, or other suitable entities. In one exemplary embodiment, reservation data system through can be implemented in hardware, software, or a suitable combination of hardware and software, and can be one or more software systems operating on a general purpose server platform. Reservation data systems through can be used to track room availability and rate data at one or more lodging facilities. Likewise, reservation data systems through can be configured to allow operators of the reservation data systems or users to access reservation data systems through , such as through communications medium , and to directly determine the availability of reservations, rooms, rates, or other suitable data. Likewise, reservation data systems through can allow the operator to update rate plans, room classifications, or other suitable data.","Each reservation data system through includes a master reservation interface through , respectively. The master reservation interface through can interface with reservation shopping engine  through reservation data system interface . In one exemplary embodiment, master reservation interface through can be an application programming interface that is installed on a server platform on which reservation data systems through operate, after each reservation data system has been installed and is operating. In another exemplary embodiment, master reservation interface through can be incorporated into a software package that is distributed with reservation data system through and other suitable systems, such that the software code structures for master reservation interface through can be contained as a module, sub-routine, distributed lines of code, or other suitable software structures that operate in conjunction with reservation data systems through . Other suitable configurations for master reservation interfaces through can likewise be used.","Reservation data system interface  receives an initial availability and rate loading of data from reservation data systems through via master reservation interfaces through , such as chain level descriptions of available properties within the chain, property level data defining the types of rooms and the rate plan room type availability and room identification data, and property level data for rate plans for the rates for such rooms. Reservation data system interface  can also receive the property level data on demand from reservation data systems through at predetermined batch load times, or other suitable times. Reservation data system interface  then provides this data to master reservation system , where the chain, property and rate plan data is stored for future access.","Likewise, reservation data system interface  receives status update data from reservation data systems through via master reservation interfaces through . In this exemplary embodiment, when a guest makes a reservation at one of reservation data systems through , master reservation interface receives the reservation data and generates status update data for transmission to reservation data system interface . Likewise, if rate data is modified, distressed inventory becomes available, or other suitable data is made available, this data can be provided via master reservation interfaces through to reservation data system interface  for updating of master reservation system . This status update data is used to update the existing data that has been loaded from reservation data systems through that defines the chain, property and rate plans available.","Monitoring system  monitors the transmission of status update data and generates a sequence number associated with each status update. This sequence number is stored with the status update, and is used to determine whether database updates to master reservation system  have been maintained in an appropriate order. Sequence numbers can also be assigned to maintenance transactions in order to insure that the these transactions are applied to the master reservation system database in the correct order. The status updates and maintenance transactions can also be written into a log file to ensure that all status updates and maintenance transactions received and acknowledged by the reservation data system interface  are processed by the master reservation system  even if one of two or more servers on which the master reservation system  operates was down when a status update or maintenance transaction was received by the reservation data system interface . For example, if the server or distributed servers on which reservation shopping engine  operates encounters a malfunction, it is possible that status updates might be lost. Monitoring system  is used to generate sequence numbers that are used to determine whether the status updates to master reservation system  are continuous. Thus, if the status updates to master reservation system  are determined to be missing sequence numbers, a backup of the status updates received from reservation data systems through can be performed. In this manner, the integrity of the database used by master reservation system  to maintain rate and availability data can be maintained.","User system  and property search system  can be implemented in hardware, software, or a suitable combination of hardware and software, and can be one or more software systems operating on a general purpose processing platform. In one exemplary embodiment, user system  and property search system  can include a web browser system and accompanying web browser plug-in, API, stand-alone package, or other suitable software structures that are used to allow a property search system  to interface with reservation shopping engine  through user interface system .","Property search system  allows the user to submit reservation request data and to receive reservation data from reservation shopping engine . In one exemplary embodiment, a user can search based on a specific property to identify rooms and rate data for that property. Likewise, the user can also search for classes of room (such as suites, budget rooms, ocean view rooms, or other suitable classes of room), room rates (such as family rates, weekend rates, corporate rates, or other suitable classes of rates), properties having certain amenities such as tennis courts or swimming pools, or other suitable search criteria. Property search system  thus interfaces with master reservation system  through user interface system , to provide real time availability and rate data for properties offered reservation data systems through . System  eliminates the need for property search system  to have direct, real-time access to each of reservation data systems through , such as would be required by a system that merely lists hotels in a location, systems in which reservation and rate data is not updated continuously, or other similar prior art systems. Thus, property search system  can be configured to interface with master reservation system , reservation data system interface , and reservation data systems so as to allow the user to directly interface and determine availability and rates with reservation data system . Reservation data system can then generate status updates for updating the database of master reservation system  in response to the reservation made from the user of user system  and property search system  to master reservation interface and reservation data system through ","In another exemplary embodiment, the user of property search system  can determine rates and availability by interfacing with reservation data systems through through reservation shopping engine . In another exemplary embodiment, the user can be directed to deal directly with reservation data systems through via communications medium  after a suitable reservation or rate has been located by the user of property search system . In this configuration, the user is assured that the rate and reservation that has been presented to the user will be available through the reservation data system through , and that the user will not contact that reservation data system and enter the reservation request data, only to find that the offered rate or lodging facility is not available. Likewise, other suitable configurations or processes can be used.","Property search system  can also include a soft date search system, such as when used in conjunction with an optimized database architecture as described above in regards to reservation shopping engine . The soft date system allows a user to specify a range of dates and then to search for an optimal price, rate class, day of week, location, or other suitable features. An optimal database architecture allows the search to be performed in real time, so as to allow the user to obtain results in a manner that allows them to be used for travel planning, to assist with making reservations, and for other suitable purposes.","In operation, system  allows a user to find lodging facilities offering lodgings at user-defined prices, in user-defined locations, or in accordance with other user-defined criteria directly, without requiring the user to search by accessing each reservation data system independently. Thus, system  allows a user to obtain real time reservation availability and rate data for a plurality of properties, so as to allow the user to generate a list showing the available rates and reservation data and to allow the user to make selections between properties in real time. In this manner, system  facilitates the travel planning and reservation processes for users.","Likewise, system  allows a master reservation system to be maintained that receives status update data from distributed properties such as reservation availability data and rate data. The status updates are tracked by sequence number so as to maintain the integrity of the database that used to store the real time rate and availability data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"System  includes chain system , property system , rate plan system , distribution channel system , and currency system , each of which can be implemented in hardware, software, or a suitable combination of hardware and software, and which can be one or more software systems operating on a general purpose server platform. Chain system  allows a user to add, modify, or delete a chain of hotel or lodging facility properties. In one exemplary embodiment, chain system  can include a chain addition function that allows the user to provide a chain ID and description, a chain update function that allows the user to modify the chain ID and description, a chain delete function that allows the user to identify a chain for deletion, or other suitable functions. Chain system  further allows properties, rate plans, and other suitable data to be affiliated with the chain, such as by a direct object reference. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a chain is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a chain can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the chain, or other suitable parties.","Property system  allows a user to add, delete, or modify property data, to associate the property data with a chain and rate plan, and to perform other suitable functions. In one exemplary embodiment, property system  can allow a user to add a property by providing a chain ID for the property, a property ID, and a minimum lead time for the minimum number of days prior to the date of arrival that a booking will be accepted. A flag can also see be provided to indicate whether the property has been enabled for access through master reservation system . Likewise, property system  can allow a user to update a property by providing a chain ID and property ID to locate a property with, and to adjust the minimum lead time or number of days prior to date of arrival for booking and to change the master reservation system compatibility or enablement flag. Property system  can also allow a user to delete the property upon entry of a chain ID and property ID that specifically identifies the property to be deleted. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a property is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a property can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the property, or other suitable parties.","Rate plan system  allows the user to add, modify, or delete a rate plan associated with a property, a chain, or other suitable entities or groups of entities. The rate plans can be room type based rate plans, such that for each rate plan there is a series of one or more room types associated with the rate plan to which the rate amounts are attached. The rate plans that are room based can be referred to as specific rate plans.","Likewise, rate plan system  can use two or more different reference rate plans, such as a generic rate plan and a subordinate rate plan. A generic rate plan can be configured to return a series of related rates. In one exemplary embodiment a generic rate plan for corporate rates might return specific rate plans for three different corporate rates. A subordinate rate plan may refer to multiple specific rate plans but is date driven and therefore can return only one specific rate plan for period specified.","Rate plan system  allows a user to add, modify, or delete specific rate plan data. In one exemplary embodiment, the user can add a specific rate plan by providing a chain ID, a property ID, a rate plan ID, start date data, end date data, the minimum number of days prior to the date of arrival that is permissible under the rate plan, the minimum length of stay that is permissible under the rate plan, the maximum length of stay that is permissible under the rate plan, and other suitable parameters. The user can also provide arrival day qualification parameters, such as to indicate whether or not arrival on a given date or day of the week is permissible under the rate plan. Currency code data can also be provided to indicate the type of currency that rates for the rate plan are provided in. A distribution channel flag can also be used to indicate whether only one or more distribution channels can be used to offer the rate plan, whether one or more distribution channels should be blocked from offering the rate plan, or for other suitable functions. Rate plan system  can also allow room types to be added and deleted, distribution codes to be added and deleted, and other suitable parameters to be provided. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a rate plan is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a rate plan can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the rate plan, or other suitable parties.","Distribution channel system  allows distribution channels to be identified for identification of rate and room availability data. In one exemplary embodiment, a distribution channel can be created that allows certain user systems  to offer preferred rates, to offer rates for certain rooms, or other suitable restrictions on hotel inventory. For example, if a conference is being planned and the reservations for that conference are being controlled through a single distribution channel, a distribution channel for that conference can be created. Distribution channel system  allows the user to add, update, or delete a distribution channel, such as by providing a channel identifier and description. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a distribution channel is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a distribution channel can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the distribution channel, or other suitable parties.","Currency system  allows a user to add, update, or delete currencies that can be used to provide currency conversions for lodging rates. In one exemplary embodiment, the currency system  can provide a currency ID field, a resolution field (such as to identify the smallest unit of currency that will be allowed), and an exchange rate for conversion between a base currency and the foreign currency. Modification of the resolution or exchange rate can be performed upon entry of a suitable currency ID, and the currency ID can also be used to delete the currency. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a currency is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a currency can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the currency, or other suitable parties.","In operation, system  is used to provide master reservation system setup and structuring capabilities that allow a database to be generated and maintained for a master reservation system. System  allows a structure to be created that can be updated and searched easily by a large number of users without requiring reservation data systems for lodging facilities to be directly accessed. System  thus provides a common interface between the reservation data systems for a large number of properties, and identifies the data structure and management structure for organizing and accessing the data in the manner that allows the data to be easily maintained, modified, updated. System  thus allows users to search large numbers of properties to identify properties of interest, and also allows users to assemble a portfolio or search report so as to allow comparisons between properties to be made based upon current data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"System  includes room type system , distribution code system , and rate system , each of which can be implemented in hardware, software, or a suitable combination of hardware and software, and which can be one or more software systems operating in a general purpose server platform. Room type system  allows a rate plan room type to be identified, modified, or deleted as required to support the rate plans for properties and chains. In one exemplary embodiment, room type system  can allow an operator to provide a chain ID, a property ID, and a rate plan ID for the room, and to provide a room type ID for which rates and statuses are to be maintained for the rate plan. The room type can be provided, can already be associated with the property, or can be set in other suitable manners. Multiple instances of this element can be included in a single transaction. If room type level detail is not required for the associated rate plan, a single room type with an ID of \u201cALL\u201d can be added to the rate plan. Other suitable room type data can be used. Field restrictions can also be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a room type has been added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a room type can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the room type, or other suitable parties.","Distribution code system  allows rate plans that are restricted for sale via certain distribution channels to be identified, so as to facilitate setting such restrictions. Distribution code system  can allow a distribution channel code to be added, modified, or deleted in support of distribution channel functions. In one exemplary embodiment, distribution code system  can allow a user to provide a chain ID, a property ID, and a rate plan ID, and then to provide a channel ID and associating description that is added to the distribution channel list for that rate plan. One or more instances of this element may be included in a single transaction. Other suitable distribution code data can be used. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a distribution code is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a distribution code can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the distribution code, or other suitable parties.","Rate system  allows a user to identify generic rate plan data, subordinate rate plan data, specific rate plan data, and other suitable rate plan data for use in classifying rate data for watching facility rooms. In one exemplary embodiment, rate system  can allow a code classification to be provided as a generic rate plan having one or more predetermined rate plan fields, such as:","ASC\u2014association rates","CLB\u2014club rates","CNV\u2014convention rates","COR\u2014corporate rates","FAM\u2014family plan rates","GOV\u2014government rates","MIL\u2014military rates","PKG\u2014package rates","PRO\u2014promotional rates","RAC\u2014rack rates","SNR\u2014senior rates","TUR\u2014tour rates","WKD\u2014weekend rates","These generic rate plan fields can be used as a default in the absence of any additional specific or subordinate rate plans. Other suitable rate plans can also be used, such as property specific generic rate plans.","A generic rate plan can consist of two parts\u2014the rate plan definition and the related rate plan members (i.e. the associated specific rate plans that make up the aggregation). The rate plan definition will control whether the reservation shopping engine  should provide a single rate range for the entire generic plan in response to a query, should provide individual subordinate rate plans that make up an aggregate rate plan, or should use other suitable rate plan data. A subordinate rate plan may reference multiple specific rate plans that are each associated with a reference that is date driven. In this manner, the subordinate rate plans can be used to provide date driven rate data. Rate system  allows generic rate plans to be added, modified, or deleted, upon entry of a chain ID, property ID, rate plan ID, or other suitable data. Likewise, generic rate plan members can be associated with generic rate plans, and can be added, modified, or deleted by rate system . Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a generic, specific, or subordinate rate plan is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before such rate plans can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the rate plan, or other suitable parties.","Rate system  also allows actual values to be associated with each specific rate plan and to be maintained separately so that the rate updates can be efficiently processed. Downloading of rate information from the reservation data systems through to the master reservation system  can be a scheduled event that triggers an \u201cupdate rates\u201d transaction that contains chain ID data, property ID data, rate plan ID data, room type ID data, date range start and end data, rates for each day in the date range, minimum rate data, extra person minimum data, maximum rate data, extra person maximum data, and other suitable data.","In operation, system  allows rate plan data for properties and chains to be created, updated, and otherwise maintained so as to allow coordination of rate and availability information through a master reservation system. System  allows a structured format to be applied to a database for storing room availability and rate data for a large number of properties so as to allow the database to be easily updated and maintained and to allow users to readily search the database to identify properties of interest.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400"]},"System  includes master reservation interface  and chain update system , property update system , rate plan update system , and status update system , each of which can be implemented in hardware, software, or a suitable combination of hardware and software, and which can be one or more software systems operating on a general purpose server platform. Chain update system  allows a user to add, modify, or delete a chain of hotel or lodging facility properties. In one exemplary embodiment, chain update system  can include a chain addition function that allows the user to provide a chain ID and description, a chain update function that allows the user to modify the chain ID and description, a chain delete function that allows the character to identify a chain for deletion, or other suitable functions. Chain update system  further allows properties, rate plans, and other suitable data to be affiliated with the chain, such as by assigning a chain field in a database for all properties, rate plans and other suitable data. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a chain is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a chain can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the chain, or other suitable parties.","Property update system  allows a user to add, delete, or modify property data, to associate the property data with a chain and rate plans, and to perform other suitable functions. In one exemplary embodiment, property update system  can allow a user to add a property by providing a chain ID for the property, a property ID, and a minimum lead time for the minimum number of days prior to the date of arrival that a booking will be accepted. A flag can also see be provided to indicate whether the property has been enabled for access through master reservation system . Likewise, property update system  can allow a user to update a property by providing a chain ID and property ID to locate a property with, and to adjust the minimum lead time or number of days prior to date of arrival for booking and to change the master reservation system compatibility or enablement flag. Property update system  can also allow a user to delete the property upon entry of a chain ID and property ID that specifically identifies the property to be deleted. Field restrictions can be imposed for editing and deletion purposes, such as to limit the number of fields that can be edited after a property is added, and to require certain fields to be identified before a property can be deleted. Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the property, or other suitable parties.","Rate plan update system  allows the user to add, modify, or delete a rate plan associated with a property, a chain, or other suitable entities or groups of entities. The rate plans can be specific rate plans, generic rate plans, subordinate rate plans, or other suitable rate plans. In one exemplary embodiment, the user can add a rate plan by providing a chain ID, a property ID, a rate plan ID, start date data, end date data, the minimum number of days prior to the date of arrival that is permissible under the rate plan, the minimum length of stay that is permissible under the rate plan, the maximum length of stay that is permissible under the rate plan, and other suitable parameters. The user can also provide arrival day qualification parameters, such as to indicate whether or not arrival on a given date or day of the week is permissible under the rate plan. Currency code data can also be provided to indicate the type of currency that is permissible under the rate plan. A distribution channel flag can also be used to indicate whether or not one or more distribution channels can be used to offer the rate plan.

Likewise, authority to delete and modify can be limited to a system administrator, the user that initially input the rate plan, or other suitable parties.","Status update system  receives status update data at a reservation data system and provides the status update data to a master reservation system. In one exemplary embodiment, status update system  can receive room reservation data, rate change data, or other suitable data, and can provide the data updates as status update data to a master reservation system  or other suitable systems. In this manner, status update system  provides real time status update data to master reservation system database to allow room availability and rate information to be centrally maintained. Status update system  can also provide such updates at predetermined intervals, such as once a day, once an hour, or at other suitable intervals.","In operation, system  provides distributed access to a master reservation system or other suitable systems that are used to provide centralized access to lodging facility reservation and rates and availability data. System  can provide continuous or periodic status update data to the master reservation system or other suitable systems, and also allows an operator to modify the database structure to add chain data, property data, rate plan data or other suitable data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500"]},"Method  begins at  where reservation data is initialized. Initialization of reservation data is performed to structure a database at the central search facility, update the database to reflect modifications, or perform other suitable functions. The method then proceeds to  where it is determined whether chain modification is to be performed. In one exemplary embodiment, a chain can be modified to add a new chain, to reflect acquisition of a hotel chain or hotel, the change of name of a hotel chain, or other suitable functions. If it is determined at  that modification of the chain is not required, the method proceeds to . Otherwise, the method proceeds to  where chain modification is performed. For example, a new chain can be added, the description data or chain identifier for an existing chain can be modified, a chain can be deleted, or other suitable chain functions can be performed. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether property modification is to be performed. If property modification does not need to be performed the method proceeds directly to . Otherwise, the method proceeds to  where property data modification is performed. In one exemplary embodiment, the property data modification can include the entry of a new property ID, property description or other suitable data. The property data can also be modified, deleted, or other suitable processes can be performed. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether rate plan modification is to be performed. If rate plan data does not need to be performed the method proceeds to . Otherwise, the method proceeds to  where rate plan data modification is performed. In one exemplary embodiment, the rate plan data can include entry of a generic rate plan, a subordinate rate plan, a specific rate plan or other suitable rate plans. The rate plan data can also be modified or deleted, or other suitable processes can be performed. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether other data modification is required. For example, other data fields may be set up to facilitate the distribution of hotel property lodging inventory through various advertising channels, distribution channels, for special events, for the purpose of moving distressed inventory or to reduce unreserved or undedicated room reservations on short notice, to add or delete a currency, or for other suitable purposes. If it is determined that other modifications are not required the method proceeds directly to . Otherwise, the method proceeds to  where the modification of the other data fields is performed. The method then proceeds to .","At , the reservation data is released. In one exemplary embodiment, reservation data can be released after it has been reviewed by the data entry entity to ensure that it is correct, can be released in batches at predetermined times, or other suitable reservation data release mechanisms can be implemented. The method the proceeds to  after the reservation data has been released and entered in to service.","At , status update data is received. In one exemplary embodiment, status update data is received when a room is rented, when a room is reserved, when a rate is changed, when a hotel property manager decides to lower rates to increase occupancy, when a promotion is offered, or at other suitable times. The method then proceeds to  where it is determined whether the status update requires updating the availability data, such as when one or more rooms have been reserved. If availability data update is not required the method proceeds to . Otherwise the method proceeds to  where availability data modification is performed. The availability data modification can include the generation of sequence number, in storing the availability modification record in a tracking log or database for backup purposes, or other suitable procedures. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether rate data should be updated as a result of the status update. If rate data is not required the method returns to . Otherwise, the method proceeds to  where the rate data modification is performed. Likewise, a sequence number can be generated, the rate data modification can be stored in a log file for backup purposes, or other suitable procedures can be used. The method then returns to .","In operation, method  allows reservation availability and rate data to be centrally maintained, so as to facilitate the location and placement of reservations at a large number of lodging facilities. Method  allows a centralized database to be assembled by receiving chain, property, rate plan, and other database structure data from a large number of properties. This database data is then configured into a database which is accessible by users to identify rates and availability of properties. The database is updated on a continuous basis as rate and availability changes, and the updates are stored so as to provide recovery functionality in the event the database requires recovery.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600"]},"Method  begins at  where reservation request data is transmitted to the central database. In one exemplary embodiment, a user shopping for reservations transmits the reservation request data to locate properties having availability and to identify the rates for such properties. The reservation request data can be transmitted from a suitable software system, such as a plug-in to a web browser system, a stand-alone client application, from a web browser page generated with *.html, *.xml, or other suitable data. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether the reservation request included a property request, such as a specific property, properties having a class of room or amenities, properties in a location (such as lodging facilities within a certain area, hotels within a certain zip code, hotels within a certain map quadrant or other suitable location data), or other suitable data. If a property was not requested the method proceeds to . Otherwise the method proceeds to  where current property data is received in response to the property request. The current property data can be stored for use in conjunction with rate request data or other suitable request data so that a comparison can be made between the property and other properties. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether a rate request has been received. For example, a rate request can be a request for all lodging facilities having a rate within a certain range, for lodging facilities offering rates for a predetermined class of accommodation (such as a member of a travel group), lodging facilities offering a predetermined discount, or other suitable rate request. If it is determined at  that a rate request has not been received the method proceeds to . Otherwise the method proceeds to  where property and rate data is received in response to the rate request. In one exemplary embodiment, the property and rate data can be organized so as to allow the user to compare properties and rates, such as by allowing the user to select a comparison criteria (such as location, amenities, room size, or other suitable comparison data) and to then sort or arrange the properties received by the selected criteria. The method then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether a property has been identified that the user wishes to make a reservation at. For example, it is possible that no properties could be identified from the reservation request, or that the properties identified by the reservation request do not contain any properties of interest for the user. If the user does not wish to make a reservation the method proceeds to  and terminates. Otherwise the method proceeds to  where the reservation data is received at the reservation data system and the reservation data system is updated to reflect the reservation. For example, the local property reservation system may update reservation data to indicate the receipt of a reservation, the reservation shopping engine can interface with the local property reservation system to place the reservation, or other suitable procedures can be used. The method then proceeds to  where a status update is transmitted to a master tracking system. In one exemplary embodiment, the master tracking system can interface with the local reservation data system to make the reservation. Likewise, the reservation can be made directly with the local reservation data system, and the status update can then be transmitted to the master tracking system, or other suitable processes can be used. The method then proceeds to .","At , sequence data is generated to identify the status update data for storing in a log file. The sequence data can also be tracked so as to determine whether a break in sequence has occurred. The method then proceeds to . At  a database is updated to reflect the current status of the reservations and rates at the properties. The database can be a centrally located database, or other suitable databases.","In operation, method  is used to allow a user to access a central database to determine rate and availability information for a plurality of hotels. Method  allows the user to perform hotel reservation services, travel planning services, make reservations, locate lodging facilities of interest, or perform other suitable services by obtaining information on lodging rates and availability for a large number of properties without requiring the user to directly access independent reservation data systems and compile reports and comparison data independently.","Although exemplary embodiments of a system and method of the present invention been described in detail herein, those skilled in the art will also recognize that various substitutions and modifications can be made to the systems and methods without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE, SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
