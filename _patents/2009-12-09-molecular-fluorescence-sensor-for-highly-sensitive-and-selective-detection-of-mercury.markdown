{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","DEFINITIONS","EXAMPLE"],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/121,462, filed Dec. 10, 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grants CHE0641353 and CBET730667 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights to this invention.","This invention relates generally to fluorescent materials and the use of such materials for detection of mercury. Therefore, the present invention relates generally to the fields of fluorescence chemistry and materials science.","As a highly toxic metal ion, Hgcauses serious health and environmental problems. Many kinds of chemical and physical sensors have been developed for the detection of Hg, among which fluorescence based sensing represents a simple, but sensitive technique providing detection limits of as low as ppb. However, improvement of the detection selectivity in the context of interference from coexisting metal ions remains challenging. Indeed, the concentrations of the common coexisting metal ions are usually much higher than the concentration of Hg, for which the safety level set for drinking water by the EPA is only 2 ppb (or 10 nM). To detect such trace amounts of Hgwith minimal false positives, a sensor technique with extremely high selectivity can be useful.","Recently, the selective complexation between thymine and Hghas been employed successfully to develop selective sensors for the detection of Hgions based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer and a colorimetric method. However, both of these sensing systems involve the tedious synthesis of the DNA oligomers and chemical functionalization with different fluorophores (energy donor and acceptor) and nanoparticles. Such processes present a technical hurdle to expedient, cost-effective applications. Moreover, the multiple binding sites within the DNA strands may complicate the chemical process and cause a mismatch in complexation with Hg. A DNA strand containing more than four thymine moieties may function as a multidentate ligand that enables effective binding with transition metal ions, such as Zn, Cu, Ni, etc. When these metal ions exist in large excess (as they usually do) compared to the concentration of Hg, the binding with Hg will become less competitive, leading to a decreased selectivity for the sensing.","The following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention makes reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof and in which are shown, by way of illustration, exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that various changes to the invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is presented for purposes of illustration only and not limitation to describe the features and characteristics of the present invention, to set forth the best mode of operation of the invention, and to sufficiently enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is to be defined solely by the appended claims.","In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used.","The singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca binding ligand\u201d includes reference to one or more of such groups and reference to \u201cexposing\u201d refers to one or more such steps.","As used herein, \u201calkylene\u201d refers to a saturated hydrocarbon having two valencies, i.e. for bonding with adjacent groups. Non-limiting examples of alkylenes include \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014, etc.","As used herein, when referring to a component of a composition, \u201cprimarily\u201d indicates that that component is present in a greater amount than any other component of the relevant composition.","As used herein with respect to an identified property or circumstance, \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to a degree of deviation that is sufficiently small so as to not measurably detract from the identified property or circumstance. The exact degree of deviation allowable may in some cases depend on the specific context.","As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary.","Concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a numerical range of about 1 to about 4.5 should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits of 1 to about 4.5, but also to include individual numerals such as 2, 3, 4, and sub-ranges such as 1 to 3, 2 to 4, etc. The same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value, such as \u201cless than about 4.5,\u201d which should be interpreted to include all of the above-recited values and ranges. Further, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristic being described.","Any steps recited in any method or process claims may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented in the claims unless clearly indicated otherwise. Means-plus-function or step-plus-function limitations will only be employed where for a specific claim limitation all of the following conditions are present in that limitation: a) \u201cmeans for\u201d or \u201cstep for\u201d is expressly recited; and b) a corresponding function is expressly recited. The structure, material or acts that support the means-plus function are expressly recited in the description herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined solely by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the descriptions and examples given herein.","Perylene Based Fluorescent Sensors","In light of the problems and deficiencies noted above, fluorescence sensor materials which are robust against photobleaching can be provided, while still providing exceptional detection sensitivity and selectivity.

Non-limiting examples of such side groups can include C1-C8 alkyl groups (e.g. butyl group, including branched alkyls), carboxylate groups (for improved water solubility), or any other groups that do not damage the binding (to Hg) and sensing functionality, but afford sufficient or better water solubility of the whole molecule. Good water solubility is conducive to detection kits or assays that are suited for application in aqueous samples.","The linking group and binding ligand can generally meet some basic requirements to afford the desired sensing performance. The linking groups can generally contribute to increasing the water solubility of the whole molecule, especially for most applications where sensing is under aqueous environments.

The resulting products can optionally be filtered and\/or washed, followed by running silica gel and aluminum oxide column chromatography to increase purity before use.","In practice, the fluorescent sensor compound is most often a solid in its pure form. For use as a sensor, the fluorescent sensor compound can be dissolved in a suitable aqueous solution. At least some sensor compounds fitting Structure I are only partially or poorly soluble in water. In order to improve solubility, the aqueous solution can further include an organic solvent. For example, the fluorescent sensor compound can be initially mixed with and dissolved in the organic solvent and then the water added. Non-limiting examples of suitable organic solvents can include dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane, and combinations thereof. In one aspect, the organic solvent can be dimethyl formamide. Although the specific amount of organic solvent can vary depending on the specific materials, generally the organic solvent can be present from about 40 vol % to about 90 vol % of the solution, and typically about 70 vol %. However, some fluorescent sensor compounds can allow for higher water content.","A method of detecting mercury ion (Hg) in a fluid can include exposing the fluorescent sensor compound to a fluid sample. The fluid sample can be any fluid for which mercury content needs to be assessed. This could be a wastewater effluent, river, pond, groundwater, lab samples, and the like. The presence of mercury can be assessed by displaying a fluorescence change upon exposure of the sensor compound to the fluid sample. This can be a visible change in fluorescence, an indicator change, and\/or a numerical output. For numerical quantitative measure of mercury content, a fluorometer can be used to measure changes in fluorescence before and after exposure to the fluid. Alternatively, the displaying can be qualitative. In one example, the presence of mercury can be visually assessed based on a visible decrease in fluorescence of the fluorescent sensor compound. In other embodiments, as the fluorescent sensor compound binds with mercury, the complexed molecules tend to aggregate and polymerize to form visible particles. Generally, a solution of the sensor compound can be mixed with the fluid sample. An alternative approach is to disperse the sensor compound in a support matrix, e.g., agarose gel (commercially available) or other porous hydrophilic materials that possess strong accessibility to water and large enough pore size to host the sensor molecules and allow for polymerization upon binding to mercury ion (Hg). The whole composite can be made in a format of testing kit. In this case, the mercury test can be performed by dipping such a kit into the water sample that contains mercury ion (Hg) or alternatively dropping a small amount of the water sample onto the kit.","One aspect of the sensor compounds is an ability to be easily regenerated and reused. The fluorescent sensor compound can be regenerated by flushing with an acid sufficient to remove bound Hg. The result is an unbound fluorescent sensor compound which can be reused. Although almost any acid can be used, hydrochloric acid is effective and inexpensive. Most often the regenerating can be substantially completely reversible, although some material loss may be expected depending on the process and care taken during regeneration and use.","Dideoxythymidine-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (TT-PTCDI) was synthesized via the condensation method. Briefly, 3.6 mg (9.2 \u03bcmol) 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (Aldrich), 5 mg (21 \u03bcmol) 5\u2032-amino-5\u2032-deoxythymidine (Sigma), and 0.6 g imidazole (Fisher) were heated under argon at 120\u00b0 C. for 3 hours to form a precursor sensor compound. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and dispersed in 10 mL ethanol, followed by addition of 20 mL 2 M HCl in order to close the side ring structure to form the imide compound. The mixture was stirred overnight. The resulting red solid was collected by vacuum filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filter (Osmonics). The solid was then washed thoroughly with distilled water until the pH of washings turned to neutral. The collected fluorescent compound solid was dried in vacuum at 60\u00b0 C. TLC: Rf (silica gel\/dioxane:CHCl=75:25)=0.83. All other chemicals were used as received.","Due to the limited solubility of TT-PTCDI in common NMR solvents, it was challenging to run NMR measurements on this compound. Mass spectra were run on a MALDI instrument using angiotensin as an external standard. MS (M+2H), m\/z: 840.29 (calc. 840.22). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured using a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorometer.","The sensor molecule, N,N\u2032-dideoxythymidine-3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic diimide (TT-PTCDI), represents a robust class of fluorophore with extremely high fluorescence yield (close to 100% in organic solvents). The high photostability of PTCDI molecules provides the sensor with additional credits in terms of sustainability and reproducibility in real applications, where repeated measurements are usually required to avoid false positives. One unique property of PTCDI molecules is that the fluorescence of the individual molecules diminishes dramatically when the molecules are associated into an aggregate state. Without being bound to any one particular theory, the cause of such efficient fluorescence quenching appears to be the strong intermolecular pi-pi interaction between the PTCDI backbones. Particularly, TT-PTCDI possesses a \u2018Z\u2019 structure that favors linear intermolecular coordination with Hg, which enables chain polymerization of the molecules, eventually leading to aggregation of the whole molecular system.","The molecular aggregation induced fluorescence quenching found in this example is in sharp contrast to the more common fluorescent sensing systems, for which the photoinduced electron transfer (between the fluorophore and the targeted species) usually dominates the quenching mechanism. Indeed, for the sensor molecule shown in  it is unlikely that such an electron transfer will occur, mainly because of the large spatial distance between the bound mercury and the PTCDI backbone, where the linker is primarily composed of s-bonds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"sub":"2","sup":["2+","2+","2+"]},"The 1:1 complexation between Hg and TT-PTCDI was confirmed by a Job's plot (), which was obtained by measuring the difference in absorption at 527 nm with the change in molar fraction of TT-PTCDI. The effective molecular aggregation resulted in a dramatic decrease in fluorescence intensity as depicted in , mainly owing to the strong p-p interaction between the tightly packed PTCDI molecules within the aggregate.","The fluorescence titration shown in  was also conducted in DMF solutions with varying volume fractions of water to investigate the effect of solvent property on the fluorescence quenching efficiency. Since the binding affinity between Hg and TT-PTCDI is determined by the solubility of both species (Hg is more soluble in water, whereas TT-PTCDI is predominantly soluble in DMF), there is an optimal volume fraction of water in DMF that provides the maximum fluorescence quenching. Indeed, upon examination for various volume fractions ranging from 0% to 50% the optimal fluorescence quenching was observed for the solvent containing 30% water, the binary solvent used in . Such a water-containing sensor system can be highly desirable for applications of the sensor in aqueous environments, where Hg ions usually exist.","With the 70:30 (vol.) DMF-HO solvent the detection limit can be determined by decreasing the concentration of TT-PTCDI. Within a certain concentration range (where effective binding between Hg and the thymine ligand still exists as determined by the binding affinity), it is generally true that the lower the concentration of the fluorophore, the less quencher is required for the same percentage of fluorescence quenching. For a 0.1 \u03bcM solution of TT-PTCDI as low as 5 nM (or below) of Hg can be feasibly detected considering the fact that a well-calibrated photodetector can reliably measure an intensity change down to 1% or lower ().","The high sensitivity thus obtained is consistent with the strong complexation of T-Hg-T, for which Hg binds to the thymine by replacing the proton at the secondary amine (), in a manner similar to metallic coordination within a porphyrin.","Since the linear coordination of T-Hg-T is extremely selective for Hg, the presence of other metal ions should not produce fluorescence quenching similar to that observed for Hg. Indeed, as tested for the environmentally relevant metal ions including Cu, Ni, Fe, Co, Pb, Cd, Zn, Mn, Cr, Mg, Ca, K and Na, none of these ions demonstrated a positive response to the same sensing system depicted in . As shown in , even at relatively higher concentration (e.g., 12.5 \u03bcM) the fluorescence decrease observed for all these background ions was around only 1% or below, whereas ca. 87% fluorescence quenching was observed in the presence of only 3.5 \u03bcM Hg. Such a high selectivity was further tested in an extreme case as presented in , where a mixture of all the metal ions mentioned above (each at 12.5 \u03bcM) was added to the sensing system, and resulted in almost no change in the fluorescence intensity. However, addition of 3.5 mM Hgto the mixed solution led to ca. 83% quenching of the fluorescence.","Consistent with these fluorescence observations, no significant change was observed for the absorption spectra of the TT-PTCDI solution upon addition of the background ions (). Indeed, no precipitation was observed for the TT-PTCDI solution in the presence of any of the interfering ions. The ultrahigh selectivity thus obtained for the sensor can help avoid the false positives in dynamic field use conditions, where detection of Hgis often interfered with by other transition metal ions (particularly when they are present in much higher concentrations).","This ultrahigh selectivity and sensitivity thus obtained can also be used in a sensor assay, which can find broad application in both environmental monitoring and clinical diagnostics. For example, fluorescent sensor compounds can be used in applications of EPA authorities and other water\/air QC labs where frequent monitoring of water\/air quality (against mercury) with high accuracy is needed. One application of this sensor system is to help solve the emerging problem of mercury pollution in the Great Salt Lake area. Monitoring the mercury pollution and examining the pollution sources require huge amount of work of sampling and analysis. The sensor system can also be applied to clinical labs, where toxicity test of Hgare needed.","The foregoing detailed description describes the invention with reference to specific exemplary embodiments.
