However, current systems and methods require a significant amount of data to be sent to a device or system for tracking purposes to provide such information in a meaningful way. The data is accrued at frequent intervals (e.g., whenever a user changes pages, changes a display state, etc.). The communication and processing of these tracking events uses valuable bandwidth and processing time.","Certain embodiments of the present invention provide tracking electronic paper display device events. More particularly, certain embodiments of the present invention provide a system for and method of tracking electronic paper display device events and a log of such events. Electronic paper display devices may track events, such as page views, device power statuses, resource requests, resource responses and other events. For example, an electronic paper display device may track a resource request such as a click on a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d). To track one or more events, an electronic paper display device may use a data structure mapping electronic content structure to one or more identifiers. One or more portions of data associated with an event may be compared against the data structure to identify a corresponding identifier. A corresponding identifier may be transmitted to a network accessible element such as, for example, a server. The network accessible element may record the electronic paper display device event.","Electronic paper display devices may be, by way of non-limiting example, a device utilizing an electronic paper display (referred to herein as \u201cEPD\u201d), such as electrophoretic displays or electro-wetting displays.

Other methods of approximating location may be used including, but not limited to, cellular telecommunications handoff algorithms, network triangulation, trilateration, multilateration, measurements of signal strength, measurements of signal attenuation, measurements of noise, and dynamically associated network address information (e.g., detecting that a user device is associated with a network address of a service provider in a particular region). In one or more embodiments, electronic paper display devices , , , and  may contain mapping software enabling a user to specify a current location and obtain directions and other information. Location information obtained from these techniques and others may be tracked and movement of an electronic paper display device may be logged as an event. For example, movement of an electronic paper display device out of a service area may be logged.","According to one or more embodiments, one or more portions of an electronic paper display device containing unauthorized electronic content (e.g., copied or stolen) may be disabled. Exemplary systems and methods for disabling electronic paper display devices are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/578,972 entitled \u201cDisabling Electronic paper display devices\u201d filed Oct. 14, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Detection of an event associated with unauthorized electronic content or actions may be logged.","According to one or more embodiments, electronic paper display devices , , , and  may track user activity such as, for example, viewing a page of electronic content on the electronic paper display device. Electronic paper display devices , , , and  may track a page view event by identifying the portion of electronic content viewed using a data structure mapping portions of electronic content to one or more identifiers. The data structure may be provided by network element  or other network elements. Electronic content viewing may be tracked by electronic paper display devices , , , and  and may be logged using identifiers such as, for example, a publication identifier, a page identifier, a zoom state, a scroll position, an indicator of highlighted content, and a user interface focus, and other user interface display characteristics.","Electronic paper display devices , , , and  may track other events and user activity. For example, electronic paper display devices , , , and  may track a resource request received by the device from a user such as a click on a Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d), a submission via a HTTP (\u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u201d) POST request, a submission via a HTTP GET request, and an FTP (\u201cFile Transfer Protocol\u201d) download. Other events tracked by electronic paper display devices , , , and  may include a device power state change; a user interface control change, a resource response, a device status, and an error code. For example, a device power state change may include detection of one or more of: a device powering on, a device powering off, a device hibernating, and a device suspending. A user interface control change may include detection of one or more of: a button up, a button down, a touch screen tap, a scroll wheel rotation, a touchpad input, a mouse input, a trackball input, adjustment of a sliding control, and a flipping of a toggle switch. A resource response may include one or more of: one or more portions of an HTTP server response, an indicator of a server connection, an error code, a timeout, a file transmission, or another data response from the resource. A device status may include one or more of: status of a process, status of a processor, a measurement associated with a processor, a measurement of memory, a measurement of storage, an indicator of one or more available software resources of a device, and an indicator of one or more available hardware resources of a device. Error events tracked by electronic paper display devices , , , and  may include errors generated by a process or component of an electronic paper display device and errors received via an interface to an external system, process or component. Electronic paper display devices , , , and  may track other events or user activity.","Electronic paper display devices , , , and  may record tracked events and user activity using local or remote storage. Electronic paper display devices , , , and  may use identifiers or indicators corresponding to events or user activity to record events and user activity. Electronic paper display devices , , , and  may use mapping data structures to find a corresponding identifier for events. Once an event or user activity is detected, a lookup, query, or translation may be performed using a mapping data structure to obtain a proper identifier for an event or user activity. The user activity or event may be recorded and transmitted using an identifier. The use of an identifier may reduce storage space for logging events and bandwidth for transmitting event information. A plurality of identifiers may be used for a single event such as, for example, the use of a date\/time identifier, a publication identifier, a page identifier, and a zoom state identifier to log a page view by a user.","According to some embodiments, electronic paper display devices , , , and  may transmit one or more identifiers to one or more network accessible devices for storage, analysis, reporting, or other processing. The transmission of identifiers may include one or more of: an event time, an event action, an event user interface control identifier, user interface display coordinates, an event time; an identifier of a resource request associated with an event, and one or more portions of a resource response associated with an event.","According to one or more embodiments, different levels of identifiers may be recorded locally than transmitted. For example, a greater level of detail may be recorded for a user activity or event on electronic paper display devices , ,  than is transmitted to a network accessible device. In some embodiments, a network accessible device may receive a first level of logging information such as for example, an event type and a date\/time, and the network accessible device may be able to query or retrieve further information from an electronic paper display device if desired.","According to one or more embodiments, network element , or another component associated with an electronic content provider network, may receive one or more event identifiers from one or more electronic paper display devices. Network element  may be a server, a computer or other network accessible device capable of receiving and storing data associated with electronic paper display device event logging. Network element  may contain or access a mapping data structure which may contain the mapping used by an electronic paper display device to log an event. Network element  may lookup a received event identifier using the mapping data structure and may log the event. In some embodiments, an event may be logged using only the one or more received event identifiers. More detail of events logged using only identifiers may be produced using a data mapping structure when analysis or reporting of events is performed. Network element  may enable analysis or reporting of events. For example, certain events, such as error events, may trigger notifications which may include emails, text messages, or other electronic notifications to users of an electronic paper display device, administrators, account managers, or other individuals or groups. Other events, such as page views, for example, may be used for marketing purposes such as to determine interests, usage of content, potential sales of electronic content, etc. Certain device events may be used for diagnostic purposes (e.g., to identify a bug, performance issues, quantify bandwidth usage and needs, identify a need for an upgrade, identify a need for a new battery, etc.). Device events may also be used for other marketing such as for example, to market peripherals including storage, memory, application upgrades, network interfaces (e.g., wireless modem upgrades), new electronic paper display devices, etc.","Network element  may produce one or more reports associated with electronic paper display device events. For example, network element  or other network elements may produce reports analyzing trends, summarizing data across network devices, grouping data, filtering data, performing statistical analysis, or performing other processing. Network element  may also produce reports or analysis of one or more events associated with an individual electronic paper display device.","According to one or more embodiments, electronic content may be published or provided using XML (\u201cextensible Markup Language\u201d) formatting. For example, electronic content may be provided using an Open Publication Structure (\u201cOPS\u201d) standard, such as OPS 2.0. XML elements in an OPS publication may optionally be identified using an \u201cid\u201d attribute. These \u201cid\u201d attributes may contain any value that conforms to the XML naming conventions. This capability may be used to track one or more content views, user activity and other events. For example, a data structure, such as a mapping, may be setup between ids assigned to connect to an electronic resource and identification provided by a third party provider. This may provide tracking and reporting of user viewing and interaction statistics. An electronic paper display device may thus track usage of external resources, such as clicks on URLs (\u201cUniform Resource Locators\u201d) as well as viewing of electronic content accessed or obtained via the external resources.","According to some embodiments, an electronic paper display device may have the ability to log the time and zoom state of each page view. To provide additional detail and functionality for the tracking of page view logs, information such as which page an element identifier falls on in an available zoom state may be tracked. For example, depending on display option settings such as a zoom level of an electronic paper display device, different portions of a page of electronic content may be displayed in a page view (e.g., when a display is zoomed in less of a page of electronic content will be shown in a page view). Existing devices and software provide no method correlating these page views with content, therefore a content map may be created for electronic content. For example, a content map may be created at the time electronic content is rendered, such as when content is rendered into an internal secured transport format. This may be done by creating a content ID map. This ID map may contain a list of IDs displayed in one or more zoom states on one or more pages.","In addition to logging page views, devices may also log link actions whenever a user clicks on a link (<a> element). In order for the server to be able to identify the links that have been logged and have access to the entirety of their attribute lists, the ID map may contain a list of one or more attributes specified on \u201c<a>\u201d elements identified by the \u201cid\u201d specified on the \u201c<a>\u201d element. An exemplary \u201c<a>\u201d element may be:","<a id=\u201dL01100001\u201dhref=\u201d#picture1\u201d>Click Here<\/a>","The exemplary \u201c<a>\u201d element above may generate an entry in the ID map such as, by way of non-limiting example:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<link content_id=\u201cL011_00001\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003attributes=\u201cid&#61;&#34;L011_00001&#34;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003href&#61;&#34;&#35;picture1&#34;\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Referring to , a sample of the XML ID mapping format is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. Note that an element may fall on more than one page. This is evident for the element identified as P36D00777 above. In zoom state \u201c\u201d above, part of the article is visible on page  and part on page  (pages included in the single page of ).","To facilitate the ability to create ID maps, a number of enhancements may be provided to electronic content publishing tools. For example, a publishing tool such as PubX3.Builder of the eBook Publisher suite of tools from eBook Technologies Inc. may be modified to create ID Maps. In order to request the creation of an ID while building a publication using one of the PubX.Builder build methods, the Builder.IDMapPath property may be set to a pathname of a log file to create. The ID Map may be created when the publication is being built for a specific device. This may be indicated by a TargetDevice setting being greater than zero. Other methods of creating ID Maps may include creating ID Maps using NMUtil of the eBook Technologies Inc. NewsManager System. The ability to create ID Maps may be provided as a NMUtil command line parameter. To request the creation of an ID Map when building a publication a \u201c-idmap file\u201d parameter may be added to the command line. An ID Map may be created when the \u201c-format\u201d parameter is specified using a value greater than 0. For example:","NMUTIL NYTimes-build-format 7-idmap id.map","ID Maps may also be created using the eBook.NewsManager .NET Interface. The ability to create ID Maps may be provided as a new OCFToIMP (\u201cOpen eBook Publication Structure (\u201cOEBPS\u201d) Container Format to IMP\u201d) method that may take an additional IDMapPath parameter. When the IDMapPath parameter is specified and the buildTarget parameter specifies a value greater than 0, then an ID log file may be created in addition to the .IMP output publication. For example:","eBook.Publication.OCFToIMP(\u201cpub.epub\u201d, \u201cpub\u201d, \u201cpub.map\u201d, 7).","According to one or more embodiments, in order to track which links a user activates (e.g., clicks or taps), user link events may be logged using the \u201cid\u201d attribute that was originally specified in the markup. For example, only the \u201cid\u201d attribute will be provided to the logging API. To determine the other attributes that were originally specified on the <a> element a processor on the server may match ids from the log with <link> elements provided in the ID map. For example:","<p>Tap<a id=\u201cX0011\u201d href=\u201c#advert1\u201d>here<\/a> to learn more.<\/p>","The above example shows how one might code a link to content in such a way that a user link action could be tracked.
