title: Information processing device, disc, information processing method, and program
abstract: A configuration is provided wherein usage restrictions of an application are determined in accordance with timestamps. A certificate revocation list (CRL) in which the revocation information of a content owner who is a providing entity of an application program recorded in a disc is recorded is referred to verify whether or not a content owner identifier recorded in an application certificate is included in the CRL, and in the case that the content owner identifier is included in the CRL, comparison between a timestamp stored in a content certificate and a CRL timestamp is executed, and in the case that the content certificate timestamp has date data equal to or later than the CRL timestamp, utilization processing of the application program is prohibited or restricted. According to the present configuration, a configuration is realized wherein an unrevoked application is not subjected to utilization restriction, and only a revoked application is subjected to utilization restriction.

For example, a movie content or the like is recorded in a disc (e.g., ROM disc) and provided to a user, but such a disc-recorded content is often a content of which the copyright and distribution right and the like are possessed by a producer or seller thereof. With regard to such a content, for example, utilization control for preventing unauthorized copy and the like is performed.","There are various modes as a utilization control mode, but under the stipulations of AACS (Advanced Access Content System) which stipulates copyright protection art, for example, an arrangement is made wherein, in order to use a disc-recorded content, ID information such as an media ID or the like is read out from a disc, confirmation of the read ID, key generation using the ID information, or the like is executed, and accordingly, content utilization control is performed.","For example, identification information (ID) such as the following is recorded in a disc. Identification information (IDs) of","(a) Media ID (also referred to as PMSN (Pre-recorded Media Serial Number)) that is disc-specific identification information,","(b) Volume ID set in increments of disc titles, and","(c) Content certificate ID serving as the identification information of a content certificate set in a manner correlated with a disc-recorded content is recorded in a disc, for example.","A player reads out, for example, at least one of the above (a) through (c) identification information (IDs) from a disc, and performs content utilization by processing conforming to a predetermined sequence, e.g., key generation or content decoding using the ID, or the like. Further, there is a case where the player transmits the above each type of the identification information (IDs) to a server, and receives various additional contents and service data and the like from the server based on ID confirmation at the server.","Note that, instead of the above (a) through (c) recorded in the disc,","(d) Device binding ID that is player associated identification information may be used. The device binding ID is recorded in memory within the player as player-specific identification information, and at the time of using a disc-stored content, obtaining the subsequent data from the server, using the subsequent data stored in a storage unit such as a hard disk of the player, or the like, the device binding ID is used at processing, for example, ID confirmation serving as the confirmation processing of the player, key generation, content decoding, and the like.","In order to perform content playback or copy processing by reading out the above (a) through (d) identification information (IDs), or data obtaining processing from the server, or the like, a predetermined program has to be executed at the player. The program is often a program created in a manner correlated with a disc-stored content, and is recorded in a disc along with the content, and the player reads out the program from the disc to execute this.","Such a program is created as a simple program in which Java (registered trademark) is employed for example, often created by, for example, a content possessor or provider (content owner), or commissioned thereby, and accordingly, an unauthorized program may be mixed therein.","An unauthorized program may be used at unauthorized processing, such as obtaining identification information (ID) recorded in a disc in an unauthorized manner to use the content thereof, obtaining of service data from a server in an unauthorized manner, or the like.","Description will be made regarding the outline of a content utilization control configuration according to the current AACS rule, with reference to .  illustrates a disc (medium)  in which a content  is stored, a content owner  who provides a disc-recorded content, and a license management department  configured to perform content management processing.

According to the present configuration, a configuration is realized wherein utilization restriction is not performed upon an unrevoked application, and is performed upon a revoked application alone."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
