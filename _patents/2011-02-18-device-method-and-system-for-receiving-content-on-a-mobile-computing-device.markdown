{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to mobile computing devices. In particular, but not by way of limitation, the present invention relates to devices, methods and systems for receiving content on a mobile computing device based on a usage pattern.","Users of mobile computing devices are increasing the amount of time the device is used to access digital content. For example, mobile computing device users are frequently accessing email, receiving rss feeds, updating blogs, and viewing websites and videos from their mobile devices, as well as providing updates to on-line networking sites such as, but not limited to, Facebook\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, and Myspace\u00ae. Though a web browser may be used to perform such functions, mobile computing device applications such as, but not limited to, applications for the above listed on-line social networking sites may also be adapted to provide digital content to and from the mobile computing devices.","Although the amount of digital content being accessed from mobile computing devices is increasing, the satisfaction of users accessing such digital content is decreasing. For example, due to increasing mobile network congestion related to the increase in the amount of digital content being accessed across mobile networks, some mobile carriers are putting bandwidth limits and\/or data caps on new customers. Thus, users may choose to view lower-quality content comprising less data\/bandwidth in order to remain under the data cap\/bandwidth limit set by the network carrier. Furthermore, since some high-bandwidth networks are not pervasive throughout a user's network carrier, a mobile computing device application may supply the user with a lower-quality content upon changing from a higher data rate network to a lower data rate network.","Illustrative embodiments of the present invention that are shown in the drawings are summarized below. These and other embodiments are more fully described in the Detailed Description section. It is to be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the forms described in this Summary of the Invention or in the Detailed Description. One skilled in the art can recognize that there are numerous modifications, equivalents, and alternative constructions that fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the claims.","One embodiment of the invention may be characterized as a mobile computing device comprising processing components, memory components, a wireless receiver\/transmitter, and an agent stored in the memory components. The agent in one embodiment is adapted to determine a pattern in the data received and requested by the mobile computing device and determine a pattern in the location of the mobile computing device. The agent is further adapted to request to receive data based on the pattern in the data received and requested by the mobile computing device and the pattern in the location of the mobile computing device.","Another embodiment of the invention may be characterized as a non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium, encoded with processor readable instructions to perform a method of receiving data at a mobile computing device. The method includes determining a pattern in a location of the mobile computing device. The method further includes receiving one or more requests from one or more applications requesting whether the mobile computing device will enter into one of a lower cost network and a lower bandwidth network. One or more responses are provided to the one or more requests and, based on the one or more responses, the one or more applications are adapted to change the operation of the one or more applications.","Yet another embodiment of the invention may be characterized as a mobile computing apparatus. The mobile computing apparatus comprises a means for determining a mobile computing device data usage pattern and a means for determining a mobile computing device location pattern. The mobile computing apparatus further comprises a means for determining an upcoming change in a mobile computing device network, and a means for informing one or more applications of the upcoming change in the mobile computing device network prior to the change in the mobile computing device network occurring. Furthermore, the mobile computing apparatus comprises a means for the one or more applications to respond to the change in the mobile computing device network prior to the change in the mobile computing device network occurring.","And other embodiment of the invention may be characterized as a method of receiving data at a mobile computing device. One method comprises determining a mobile computing device location pattern, determining a first mobile computing device data pattern, and using the mobile computing device location pattern and the first mobile computing device data pattern to create a second mobile computing device data pattern. The method further comprises receiving data at the mobile computing device in general accordance with the second mobile computing device data pattern.","Referring first to , shown is a block diagram depicting physical components of a mobile computing device . The mobile computing device  may also be referred to as a mobile computing apparatus. The physical components seen in  comprise processing components , memory components , location components  and a wireless receiver\/transmitter . As seen, stored in the memory components  may be an agent . The agent  may be adapted to monitor requested data sent and received by the mobile computing device  to determine a pattern in the data received and requested by the mobile computing device . The agent  may also be adapted to determine a pattern in the location of the mobile computing device . The agent  may further be adapted to correlate the location of the mobile computing device  to the data received and requested by the mobile computing device . In one embodiment, the agent  may comprise a plurality of agents.","In one embodiment, the agent  may be adapted to use the processing components  to store data transmitted to and from the wireless receiver\/transmitter  in the memory components . For example, the agent  may inform the processing components  to store\/record certain information about the data received and requested from the mobile computing device  such as, but not limited to, file types, an identifier corresponding to the sender of a received file, a bandwidth used for each file received\/sent, and when the file was requested\/received\/sent by the mobile computing device  (i.e. a timestamp). Such information may be recorded in a log file in the memory components  for a user-specified or agent-specified time period\u2014such as, but not limited to, a 24-hour time period. The agent  may be further adapted to store such information for multiple consecutive or non-consecutive time-periods. In addition to storing information related to the data received\/requested by the mobile computing device , the agent  may also inform the processing components  to store in the memory components  information related to the location of the mobile computing device  and additional information related to the network that the mobile computing device  is connected to.","Location information and timestamp information may be obtained from the wireless receiver\/transmitter . However, location and timestamp information may also be received from the location components  such as, but not limited to, a global positioning system (gps) device. However the location information and time information is obtained, the agent  may be adapted to use such information to create a pattern of the location of the mobile computing device  for any given time period.","Seen in  is a weekday pattern  of the location of, and the data requested\/received by, the mobile computing device  as determined by the agent  of . Also seen in  is a weekend pattern  of the location of, and the data requested\/received by, the mobile computing device  as determined by the agent . As seen, the agent  may determine that for a weekday pattern , the mobile computing device  accesses a home Wi-Fi  network from about 12:00 am to 7:00 am at a home  location, a 3G network  from about 7:00 am to 7:45 am, (which may include a brief occasional interruption in service at about 7:30 am) at a commute  location located between the home  location and a work  location, a work Wi-Fi  network from about 7:45 am to 5:45 pm at the work  location, and the 3G network  again from 5:45 pm to 6:30 pm (which may include a brief occasional interruption in service at about 6:00 pm), before accessing the home Wi-Fi  network again from about 6:30 pm to 12:00 am.","The agent  may correlate the mobile computing device  location, time, and network pattern to a pattern in the data received and requested by the mobile computing device . For example, the agent  may determine that during the weekday pattern , data requested and received by the mobile computing device  includes sending and receiving various data types to and from home applications  such as, but not limited to, Gmail\u00ae, Facebook\u00ae, and Twitter\u00ae from about 12:00 am to 7:00 am. Similarly, data may be received from commute applications  such as, but not limited to, Pandora\u00ae, from about 7:00 am to 7:45 am and 5:45 pm to 6:30 pm. Furthermore, work applications  such as, but not limited to, an Outlook enterprise application may send data to and from the mobile computing device  from about 7:45 am-5:45 pm. The agent  may then determine that the home applications  are accessed at the home Wi-Fi , work applications  at the work Wi-Fi  and commute applications  on the 3G network  during the commute  between the home  location and work  location. It is to be appreciated that although the term \u201capplication\u201d is used throughout the specification to define a content host, the term \u201capplication\u201d may be used interchangeably with \u201cwebsite\u201d, where appropriate.","In the weekend pattern  seen in , the agent  may determine that the home Wi-Fi  is accessed from about 12:00 am to 12:00 pm at the home  location, and the 3G network  is accessed at a mall  location from about 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, and at or near a restaurant  location from about 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. The data requested\/received at the home  location may comprise the home applications , while connected to the home Wi-Fi . While connected to the 3G network , data may be requested\/received between one or more shopping applications\/websites  such as, but not limited to a Groupon\u00ae application\/website while shopping at the mall  location, and a restaurant reservation\/review website  such as, but not limited to, an Opentable\u00ae application\/website on the 3G network  while near the restaurant  location. The weekday pattern  and weekend pattern  may be continually updated as the agent  tracks (i) the movement of the mobile computing device  and (ii) the data accessed and received by the mobile computing device . Alternatively, the mobile computing device  may request permission from the user to update the location pattern and\/or data pattern on-the fly, or once or more daily, weekly, etc. Furthermore, there may be settings to identify applications to add to the patterns For example, an application may only be added to the pattern when it is accessed at a substantially similar time in back-to-back days. Other settings and time frames are contemplated.","In one embodiment, and as seen in , the agent  may operate as a background daemon process that may comprise a first module  and a second module . Additional modules are contemplated. The first module  may comprise a tracking and profiling module and the second module  may comprise a fetching\/receiving and caching module. In one embodiment, the first module  may create and store patterns such as, but not limited to, the weekday pattern  and weekend pattern , in the memory components , while the second module  may receive, obtain and store data, based on the patterns. The first module  may be referred to as a first interface which may be adapted to communicate with a browser software platform , HTTP stack , location components  such as, but not limited to a gps unit, and an interface module  for a mobile computing device operating system. For example, the agent  may comprise a mobile computing device software tracking agent adapted to track HTTP stack  and browser requests sent through the browser software platform  such as, but not limited to, a browser software platform. Such an agent  may also be adapted to determine (or receive information related to) the bandwidth available to the mobile computing device  at each location of the mobile computing device . Various operating systems are contemplated. Monitoring the browser software platform  allows for browser-based profiling\/patterns, while monitoring the HTTP stack  allows for native application profiling\/patterns. It is also contemplated to sync the patterns to a device calendar.","One second module  may comprise a second interface adapted to communicate with the interface module  of the mobile operating system and a system cache . The agent  may be further comprised of a third module  comprising a third interface adapted to communicate with one or more applications . The third module  may comprise an Application Programming Interface (API) and may be adapted to provide a means for informing mobile computing device applications  such as, but not limited to, a Facebook\u00ae application and a media player, of a change in the mobile computing device network prior to the change in the mobile computing device network occurring.","Upon obtaining data and location patterns such as, but not limited to, the weekday pattern  and weekend pattern  seen in , the agent  may request to receive (i.e., \u201cfetch\u201d) data based on the patterns. Alternatively, or additionally, the agent  may also inform the applications , through the API, to \u201cpull\u201d data to the mobile computing device . For example, in one embodiment, a \u201cstreaming\u201d application may be utilized as an application . The streaming application may be informed of upcoming likely changes in the network in response to a request for such information, based on the pattern. In one embodiment, one of the commute applications  of  may comprise the streaming application . The agent  may inform the streaming application that service is often interrupted at about 7:30 am and 6:00 pm during the weekday pattern . In such a case, the agent  may then fetch additional data prior to each of these times so the application may operate properly during the service interruption. Alternatively, the commute application  may pull additional data to the mobile computing device  prior to these times. In either event, the agent  may store the additional data in the system cache . In one embodiment, the system cache  comprises a portion of the memory components . The agent  may subsequently retrieve the data from the cache , or elsewhere in the memory components , prior to the service being interrupted, so that the commute application  continues to operate properly during the service interruption. In another example, the application  may comprise the Facebook\u00ae application. The Facebook\u00ae application may reside on the mobile computing device  and data may be pulled from a network server by the application prior to a change to a more expensive network.","The agent  may determine whether to pre-fetch data, or to inform applications  to pull data, prior to the data being requested from the mobile computing device , based upon (i) the network bandwidth available at the time the data will be requested\/received, as established by the patterns and (ii) the bandwidth that is used for the data that is sent\/received by the mobile computing device , as established by the patterns. For example, sticking with the commute  portion of the weekday pattern  of , the agent  may determine that an average bandwidth requirement to properly and\/or fully operate or enable the commute applications  is about 250 kbps. The agent  may also determine that an average bandwidth of the 3G network  during the commute  is only about 200 kbps. The agent  may also be aware that prior to the commute , the mobile computing device  is connected to either the home Wi-Fi  or the work Wi-Fi . Furthermore, the agent  may determine that the bandwidth of the home Wi-Fi  or work Wi-Fi  is sufficient to properly operate all work applications  or home application , and to pre-fetch data to enable the commute applications  to operate properly during the commute . If the agent  determines that the home Wi-Fi  or work Wi-Fi  does not have sufficient bandwidth to operate home applications  or work applications , the user may pre-configure the agent  to allow the commute applications  to have priority over the home applications  and\/or the work applications . Additionally, instead of pre-configuring the agent , the agent  may be adapted to provide on-the-fly requests to a mobile computing device  user to determine which applications have priority over other applications. The agent  may also be configured to use a prior-connected network such as the home Wi-Fi  and work Wi-Fi  to download data to properly run applications such as, but not limited to, the commute applications  only when the mobile computing device  is connected to the prior-connected network within a specified time period from when the commute applications  will be accessed by the mobile computing device . For example, the agent  may be configured to fetch data when connected to an appropriate network less than one hour prior to the commute applications  being accessed. Other time periods and configurations known in the art are also contemplated. In one embodiment, the agent  may be configured to fetch data at the home Wi-Fi  due to the home Wi-Fi comprising a \u201cfree\u201d network that does not charge for downloads, unlike many 3G\/4G data plans.","In either case\u2014when the home Wi-Fi  or work Wi-Fi  bandwidth is sufficient to run all applications at the home  or work  to fetch or receive pulled data needed to properly run a commute application  during the commute , and when the commute application  has priority over the home applications  and\/or work applications \u2014prior to and\/or during the commute  the agent  may fetch data that the agent  determines will be accessed during the commute . In one embodiment, the user may also configure the agent  to fetch specific types of data for specific applications. In one example, through the API, specific songs\/artists\/genre of music may be requested for a music application service such as, but not limited to, Pandora\u00ae. Instead, or additionally to pre-configuring the agent , the user may also receive a notice from the agent  requesting which data should be presently fetched for a later application that the agent  determines will not have the bandwidth needed to properly run the application. Therefore, when an agent  determines that the mobile computing device  will likely transfer to a low data rate network from a high data rate network, the agent  may determine that data should be fetched prior to this change of network.","In one embodiment, the home Wi-Fi  and\/or the work Wi-Fi  may also comprise networks that do not include a fee for the mobile computing device  to access data across the network. For example, these networks may not have a data cap associated with them. However, the commute 3G network  may have a data fee, such as, but not limited to, a data cap associated with it. The agent  may be aware of these network cost limitations and therefore, may also be able to determine when the mobile computing device  is about to move from a less expensive network to a more expensive network. Similar to the description above related to bandwidth, when the mobile computing device  is connected to the less expensive network, the agent  may download data for use during the more expensive network. It is contemplated that the agent  is aware of limits in the network carrier plan supporting the mobile computing device  and is aware when accessing the content may charge a mobile computing device account such as, but not limited to, an account the mobile computing device has with a network carrier.","In one embodiment, the agent  may determine which data is frequently received by the mobile computing device , such as, but not limited to, frequently received data in the home applications , commute applications  and work applications . Defining what constitutes frequently received data may be established by a user adjusting a configuration setting in the agent . When the frequently received data is received by the mobile computing device , one agent  may store, or cache, this data in the memory components . For example, the agent  may determine that certain content types are frequently accessed through the shopping applications  accessed during the weekend pattern . In one embodiment, a Groupon\u00ae application may provide similar data every time the application is accessed\u2014such as, but not limited to, a .gif file displaying the \u201cGroupon\u00ae\u201d trademark. The agent  may recognize these frequently received data types and may store such data in the memory components . In one embodiment, the agent  may store this frequently accessed data in the memory components  when the agent  determines that the mobile computing device  often accesses the data when connected to a low-bandwidth or a high-cost network. Therefore, by storing such frequently-accessed data on the mobile computing device , more bandwidth may be available for core application processes on the low-bandwidth network; or, lower charges may be incurred when accessing applications across the high-cost bandwidth.","One embodiment of the invention comprises a non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium, encoded with processor readable instructions to perform a method of receiving data at a mobile computing device . For example, such an embodiment may comprise the agent  described above\u2014adapted to determine one or more patterns in the data received by the mobile computing device  and one or more patterns in the location of the mobile computing device , such as, but not limited to, the weekday pattern  and\/or the weekend pattern . Furthermore, the agent  may comprise the API such as, but not limited to, the third module  which may be adapted to receive one or more requests from one or more applications  providing data to the mobile computing device . It is to be appreciated that the one or more applications  may comprise applications  locally-stored on the mobile computing device  in the memory components  or may comprise remote, cloud-based applications\/websites.","When such applications  are operating and providing data to the mobile computing device , the applications  may provide one or more requests to receive information comprising whether the mobile computing device  is likely to connect to a network comprising one of a higher and lower cost network and a lower and higher bandwidth network. The agent  may provide one or more responses to the applications , and if, upon receiving at least one of the one or more responses, the one or more applications  are informed that the mobile computing device  will connect to, for example, a higher cost network and\/or a lower bandwidth network, the one or more applications  may change the operation of the one or more applications . In one embodiment, one of the one or more applications  may comprise a video streaming application. The video streaming application may change from a first resolution to a second resolution prior to changing to the one of a higher cost network and\/or a lower bandwidth network, with the second resolution being lower than the first resolution. Upon or prior to entering the second network, the mobile computing device  may display the lower resolution video. Additionally, second or first resolution video data may be cached prior to changing from the higher bandwidth network to the lower bandwidth network, and displayed upon changing to the second network.","As described, the mobile computing device  may comprise a means for determining a pattern in the data requested\/received by the mobile computing device  and a means for determining a pattern in the location of the mobile computing device . For example, the weekday pattern  and the weekend pattern  described above include both a pattern in the data accessed and received by the mobile computing device  and the location of the mobile computing device . As stated above, the agent  may be able to determine when a change in a mobile computing device network will occur during the mobile computing device location pattern and data usage pattern and can inform one or more applications  of the change in the mobile computing device network prior to the change in the mobile computing device network occurring. In response, the application  may change the operation of the application to respond to the change in the mobile computing device network prior to the change in the mobile computing device network occurring. In one embodiment, the change in the mobile computing device network comprises a change from a non-bandwidth-limited network to a bandwidth-limited network. Furthermore, in response to the change in the network from a high-bandwidth network to low bandwidth network, one or more applications  may request data from one or more remote locations such as, but not limited to, websites, and the mobile computing device  may store\/cache the data.","Turning now to , seen is a method  of receiving data at a mobile computing device. In one embodiment, the mobile computing device comprises the mobile computing device  seen in . One method  starts at  and at  comprises determining a first mobile computing device location pattern. For example, the mobile computing device  may comprise the agent  described above adapted to create a pattern such as, but not limited to, the weekday pattern  and the weekend pattern . At  the method comprises determining a first mobile computing device data pattern. One first mobile computing device data pattern may comprise a pattern in the data requested\/received by the mobile computing device  where the home applications  receive data while connected to the home wifi , the commute applications  receive data while connected to the 3G network , and the work applications  receive data when connected to the work wifi  with respect to the weekday pattern  and\/or the weekend pattern . At  the method comprises using the mobile computing device location pattern and the first mobile computing device data pattern to create a second mobile computing device data pattern. One second mobile computing device data pattern may comprise a data pattern where data determined to be accessed while connected to a network by the first mobile computing device data pattern is retrieved or received prior to entering the network. For example, as seen in , the first data pattern may comprise the mobile computing device  accessing the commute applications  during the commute  times of 7:00 am-7:45 am and 5:45 pm-6:30 pm. The second mobile computing device data pattern may therefore comprise receiving data to run the commute applications  prior to the commute .","In one embodiment, determining a mobile computing device location pattern and determining a first mobile computing device data pattern  may comprise operating the first module . Additionally, using the mobile computing device location pattern and the first mobile computing device data pattern  to create a second mobile computing device data pattern , and receiving data at the mobile computing device  in general accordance with the second mobile computing device data pattern  may comprise operating the second module . One agent  may also comprise a plurality of agents . This method ends at .","In conclusion, embodiments of the present invention enable more efficient use of less-expensive and higher-bandwidth networks by determining when a mobile communicating device is about to enter into a more-expensive or lower-bandwidth network. Those skilled in the art can readily recognize that numerous variations and substitutions may be made in the invention, its use and its configuration to achieve substantially the same results as achieved by the embodiments described herein. Accordingly, there is no intention to limit the invention to the disclosed exemplary forms. Many variations, modifications and alternative constructions fall within the scope and spirit of the disclosed invention as expressed in the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various objects and advantages and a more complete understanding of the present invention are apparent and more readily appreciated by reference to the following Detailed Description and to the appended claims when taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings, where like or similar elements are designated with identical reference numerals throughout the several views and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
