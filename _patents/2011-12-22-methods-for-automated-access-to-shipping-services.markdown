A telephone call center receives orders for merchandise. The telephone call center requests shipping services information from a server for the shipment of the merchandise. The telephone call center receives the requested shipping services information from the server, and provides the shipping services information to an operator. The shipping services information may be provided to the operator in the format of a label. The telephone call center may include a facility for printing the label. The label may be attached to the packaged merchandise for shipment.","2. Background of the Invention","In the aforementioned U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/227,903 and copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/344,992, methods are disclosed for providing an Internet customer with information relative to shipping services using application programming interfaces (\u201cAPI's\u201d) supplied by the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d). The API's are designed to provide access to USPS shipping data and information over a network. The network is preferably the Internet; however, any type of network known to those skilled in the art may be used.","The shipping services information to be transferred over the network may include postal rates, international and domestic service standards, addressing information, shipping labels, merchandise return labels, delivery confirmation labels, courtesy reply labels, etc. All of this useful shipping information resides on one or more USPS servers.","Mail order retailers that use a telephone call center from which operators access a marketing database server while taking telephone orders from a customer have a need for the information provided by the above described API's but may not have the time for programming resources to integrate them into their existing systems.","It is accordingly an object of an embodiment of the invention to provide access to USPS shipping information to telephone call centers, such as mail order retailers that use a telephone call center to take telephone orders from customers.","This is achieved by providing, to telephone call centers, software that is integrated with the API's. For convenience the software will be referred to as \u201cthe shipping assistant.\u201d The shipping assistant may be installed on a computer for use by a telephone operator for accessing servers having USPS shipping information. The servers may include, for example, one or more USPS servers. The shipping assistant may be written in any programming language or tool known to those skilled in the art, for example, C, C++, visual basic, HyperText Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d), Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d), etc.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, systems and methods are disclosed for obtaining shipping services information over a network by a telephone call center receiving orders for merchandise. Instructions are received at the telephone call center, which permits the telephone call center to access the shipping services information residing on a server. The telephone call center generates a request for the shipping services information on the server for shipment of the merchandise. The telephone call center sends the request for the shipping services information to the server. Thereafter, the telephone call center receives the requested shipping services information from the server. The telephone call center provides the shipping services information to an operator at the telephone call center.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, systems and methods are disclosed for obtaining shipping services information over a network by a mail center, wherein the shipping services information is in the format of a label and includes postage thereon. Instructions are received at the mail center for accessing the shipping services information residing on a server; the mail center generates a request at the mail center for the shipping services information; sends the request for the shipping services information to the server over the network; receives at the mail center the requested shipping services information from the server over the network; and provides the shipping services information by the mail center to a customer.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate one embodiment of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.","Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
