title: Quasi-static bend sensor using electro-active materials
abstract: A quasi-static bend sensor is taught that comprises a layering of a plurality of ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) sections with intervening dielectric sections in a vertical stack configuration. The IPMC sections are electrically connected in parallel. The surface of the stack is coated with high-purity synthetic isoparaffins for polymer hydration to increase step response consistency. Finally, the vertical stack configuration is electrically connected to an electric field measurement device and a linear quadratic regulator based controller for reducing settling time.

Electro-active materials are most often used as energy harvesting devices, active noise cancellation, vibration control, microphones and acoustic transducers. Electro-active polymers are also being studied for their use in artificial muscles. Recent advances and characterization of electro-active material bend sensors have exhibited a correlation between charge flow and rate of motion of the material, with relatively constant sensitivities over the frequency ranges from 0.1-20 Hz.","IPMCs are active materials that exhibit electro-mechanical coupling and consist of an ionic polymer membrane  with ion exchange capability (such as Nation\u00ae or Flemion\u00ae) whose planar surfaces are coated with conductors  such as platinum or gold, as illustrated in . IPMCs have been investigated for use as actuators and motion sensors and have exhibited similar properties to piezoelectric materials. Under an applied voltage (1-5V), ion migration and electrostatic repulsion result in bending actuation. Under an applied dynamic deformation IPMC material generates a dynamic electric field with a voltage proportional to the applied force causing the deformation and with voltage polarity representative of the deflection direction. IPMC bending transducers or sensors have demonstrated relatively constant sensitivities on the order 30 \u03bcm (deflection)\/mm (polymer length) over the frequency range from 0.1-20 Hz. Stacking IPMC materials as illustrated in (also referred to as morphing) can increase the sensitivity of IPMC bending transducers.","One drawback of current IPMC bend sensors is that their settling time associated with a step input is on the order of 5-20 seconds for devices (on the order of 40 mm long) and increases with length. Another disadvantage of sensors and actuators fabricated with IPMCs is their inconsistent and non-repeatable step responses. Step response inconsistencies are attributable to polymer stiffness, which is a function of surface hydration. Another disadvantage of IPMC bend sensors is their limited sensitivity to deflection when compared to bend sensors of other electro-active material.","For this reason, what is needed is an IPMC bend sensor with a more consistent step response and greater sensitivity.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide an IPMC bend sensor with a more consistent step response than prior art bend sensors.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an IPMC bend sensor with greater sensitivity than prior art bend sensors.","These objects are accomplished by layering a plurality of IPMC sections with intervening dielectric sections in a vertical stack configuration and electrically connecting the positive and negative electrodes of each IPMC section in parallel. The surface of the stack is coated with high-purity synthetic isoparaffins for polymer hydration to increase step response consistency. Finally, the vertical stack configuration is connected to an electric field measurement device and a linear quadratic regulator based controller for reducing settling time.","Referring now to  there is illustrated several Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) sections  each section having a top conductive surface  and a bottom conductive surface . There is also illustrated multiple dielectric sections . In a preferred embodiment, the dielectric section  is made of a thin flexible light weight material. An example of dielectric section  is electrical insulating adhesive tape.","The IPMC sections  are stacked vertically in a modified morphing arrangement with a dielectric section  between the top conductive surface  of an IPMC section  below it and the bottom conductive surface  of an IPMC section  above it to prevent electrical conduction between the two surfaces. This modified morphing arrangement creates a multilayer configuration  of IPMC sections  and dielectric sections .","Each of the top conductive surfaces  of each IPMC section  serves as a positive electrode in the multilayer configuration . Each of the bottom conductive surfaces  of each IPMC section  serves as a negative electrode in the multilayer configuration . In an alternative embodiment each of the top conductive surfaces  of each IPMC section  serves as a negative electrode in the multilayer configuration , and each of the bottom conductive surfaces  of each IPMC section  serves as a positive electrode in the multilayer configuration .","All of the positive electrodes are attached to individual wire leads  connecting all of the positive electrodes together. All of the negative electrodes are attached to individual wire leads  connecting all of the negative electrodes together. This type of wiring scheme essentially wires the stacked multiple IPMC sections  in parallel. The surface of the multilayer configuration  is coated with high-purity synthetic isoparaffin  (such as Isopar\u2122) for polymer hydration to increase step response consistency. In an alternative embodiment, the surface of the multilayer configuration  is coated with silicone.","The IPMC sections  exhibit sensitivity to deflections. The sensitivity is manifested in an induced dynamic electric field that is generated by the IPMC sections  and can be measured via the positive electrodes and negative electrodes being connected via wire leads  and  to an appropriate electric field measurement device  and a linear quadratic regulator based controller  for feedback control to reduce settling time.","The advantage of the present invention over the prior art is that the prior art does not teach using IPMC sections as bend sensors due to the very small magnitude of the sensing signal compared to the actuation signal. The present invention solves the magnitude of the sensing signal problem by electrically connecting IPMC stacks in parallel to increase the sensitivity of the IPMC sections . The prior art does not specify the characteristics and ability of IPMC sections as \u201csoft\u201d sensors because the operational mechanism of IPMC sections are not clear. As such there is no prior art teaching or suggestion to electrically connect IPMC stacks in parallel. The multilayer configuration  of the present invention, electrically connected in parallel, dramatically increases the sensitivity of the IPMC sections  to deflections. This is analogous to adding capacitors in parallel to increase the overall capacitance of a circuit.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
