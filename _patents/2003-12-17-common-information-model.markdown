Technical Field","The present invention relates to management and control of resources in a computing system. More particularly, the invention concerns efficiently retrieving information concerning system resources such as storage resources.","2. Description of Related Art","Modern computing systems commonly include servers, storage systems, and other devices. Management and modeling programs are often used to manage the devices in computing systems.","Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S)\/Bluefin, and Common Information Model (CIM) technologies, are widely used for managing storage devices and storage environments. The SMI-S is a standard management interface that allows different classes of hardware and software products to interoperate for monitoring and controlling resources. For example, the SMI-S permits storage management systems to identify, classify, monitor, and control physical and logical resources in a SAN. The SMI-S is based on CIM, and Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) architecture. CIM is a model for describing management information, and WBEM is an architecture for using Internet technologies to manage systems and networks. The SMI-S uses CIM to define objects that represent storage entities such as Volumes, Disks, Storage SubSystems, Switches, and host Computer Systems. (In many, but not all cases, the term \u201cvolume\u201d is interchangeable with the term \u201cLogical Unit Number\u201d (LUN).) CIM also defines the associations that may or may not exist between these objects, such as a Disk being associated to a Storage SubSystem because it physically resides in the Storage SubSystem.","The CIM Objects mentioned above may be managed by a CIM Object Manager (CIMOM), also known as a CIM Server. A storage management software application, such as IBM Tivoli Storage Resource Manager (ITSRM), can use a CIM Client to connect to a CIMOM, to retrieve information about the storage entities that the CIMOM manages, and also to perform active configuration of the storage entities. Storage management software that uses a CIM Client may be called a CIM Client Application.","CIM Client Applications use a CIM Client API (Application Programming Interface) to communicate with a remote CIMOM. There are several CIM Client APIs available (SNIA, Pegasus, Java WBEM Services), and they all are similar in that the methods available to the CIM Client Application deal with the use of meta-data. CIM Client APIs include methods for the following common tasks:\n\n","Using the CIM Client API to obtain commonly needed information from the CIMOM typically requires an excessive number of steps. As an example, Disk Array Storage Systems are modeled as ComputerSystems. The ComputerSystem's Dedicated property is used to identify the ComputerSystem as a Switch, Host, Disk Array System, or some other type of computer system. In addition, certain Disk Array information, such as Location, Model, and ProductID, are not modeled as properties of a Disk Array ComputerSystem, but rather as properties of objects associated to the ComputerSystem. Thus, to enumerate all Disk Array Systems and to get complete information about their properties, the following elaborate process is required:\n\n","Additionally, when using the CIM Client API, it is not possible to get information about a top-level entity and all of its components in one step. Component entities are modeled as separate objects, so an extra step is required to get information for each additional type of component object that the CIM Client Application is interested in. To get information about a Disk Array System and information about a specific subset of its components (Volumes, Storage Pools, FCPorts), the CIM Client must perform the following operations:\n\n","In summary, known methods for using CIM Client Applications to obtain information pertaining to a single storage entity that may be distributed through several objects in the CIM\/SMIS model, are complex and require too many steps. Additionally, known methods for CIM Client Applications to obtain a top-level object and all of its components are excessively difficult. Further, with known methods, CIM Client Applications are unable to easily retrieve a complete view of a top level object and its components, because WBEM (or CIM-XML) only allows for requests for targeted pieces of information.","One aspect of the invention is a method for responding to an inquiry. An example of the method includes receiving the inquiry, obtaining information from a CIMOM, and creating at least one Storage Object. This example of the method also includes populating the at least one Storage Object with information received from the CIMOM, and sending the at least one Storage Object to a calling function.","Other aspects of the invention are described in the sections below, and include, for example, a computing system, and a signal bearing medium tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform a method for responding to an inquiry.","Some examples of the invention provide one or more of the following advantages:\n\n","The nature, objectives, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings.","One aspect of the invention is a computing system that can be used for responding to an inquiry, for example, for managing resources associated with the computing system. As an example, the resources may be storage resources. The computing system may be embodied, for example, by all or portions of the computing system  shown in . The computing system  includes a first host server , a second host server , a first CIM server , a second CIM server , a first storage system , and a second storage system . (The host servers ,  may be called hosts , .) Alternatively, in this embodiment and in the other embodiments discussed below, only one host could be included, or additional hosts could be included, and\/or client computers could be included. Also, in this embodiment and in the other embodiments discussed below, only one CIM server could be included, or additional CIM servers could be included, or one or more CIM servers could be embedded in other devices.

The application programs could include a CIM Client Application and could generally be any suitable applications. The CIM Client Application may have knowledge of, and may establish connections with, one or more of the CIM servers , .","The non-volatile memory  could be, for example, a hard disk drive, a drive for reading and writing from optical or magneto-optical media, a tape drive, non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), or any other suitable type of storage. In some examples the primary memory  or the non-volatile memory  could be eliminated, or the primary memory  and\/or the non-volatile memory  could be provided on the processor , or alternatively, external from the host . The host  also has a hardware bus adapter (HBA) , coupled to the processor , for coupling the host  via connector  to a Fibre Channel network (which may be called a \u201cfabric) that may be used to implement a SAN . As an example, connector  may support FICON (FIber CONnector), ESCON (Enterprise Systems CONnnector) communications channels. As an example, the hardware bus adapter  could be a model 2200 hardware bus adapter available from QLogic Corporation. Generally, the SAN  may be implemented using Fibre Channel network(s) and\/or Ethernet network(s). As will be discussed below, in other embodiments a SAN need not be included. Using the SAN  permits coupling a large number of storage devices to the hosts , .","Similar to host , host  has a processor , a memory subsystem that that may include a primary memory  (for example RAM), and\/or a non-volatile memory , both of which are coupled to the processor . The memory subsystem may be used to store data and application programs and\/or other programming instructions executed by the processor . The application programs could include a CIM Client Application and could generally be any suitable applications. The host  also has a hardware bus adapter , coupled to the processor , for coupling the host , via connector  (which may be similar to connector ), to the Fibre Channel network that may be used to implement the SAN . In an alternative embodiment, SCSI protocol, rather than Fibre Channel protocol, could be used to couple the hosts ,  to the SAN .","Similar to hosts , , CIM Server  has a processor , a memory subsystem that may include a primary memory  (for example RAM), and\/or a non-volatile memory , both of which are coupled to the processor . The memory subsystem may be used to store data and application programs and\/or other programming instructions executed by the processor .

Additionally, CD-R, WORM, DVD-R, and\/or DVD+R devices could be included in the plurality storage devices. As an example, one or more of the storage systems ,  could be implemented with a model F20 or model 800 Enterprise Storage Server, available from IBM Corporation. As another example, disk storage could be implemented with an IBM FAStT 900, and a tape library could be implemented with an IBM 3494 tape library using IBM 3590 drives, all of which are available from IBM Corporation.","An alternative computing system  is shown in . All or portions of the computing system  could be used to implement one or more examples of the invention. Computing system  includes host servers , , storage systems , , SAN , and IP network . Storage system  includes storage devices , , storage controller , and hardware bus adapter . The storage devices -may be any of the types of storage devices discussed above with regard to storage devices -, -. Storage system  further includes embedded CIM server .

In the computing system , hosts ,  and the CIM server  in storage system  are connected through the IP network . IP network  may use any suitable type of communications channel technology, for example, Ethernet, ESCON (Enterprise Systems CONnnector), FICON (FIber CONnector). Additionally, network  could use the Internet, and could utilize wireless technology.","Another alternative computing system  is shown in . All or portions of the computing system  may be used to implement one or more examples of the invention. Computing system  includes host servers , , CIM server , and storage systems , , . Storage system  includes storage devices , , storage controller , and hardware bus adapter . Similarly, storage system  includes storage devices , , storage controller , and hardware bus adapter .

Additionally, network  could use the Internet, and could utilize wireless technology.","In addition to the hardware embodiments described above, another aspect of the invention concerns a method for responding to an inquiry.","In the context of  the method aspect of the invention may be implemented, for example, by having host , host , CIM server , CIM server , or CIM server  execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions, which can also be referred to as code. These instructions may reside in various types of signal-bearing media. In this respect, one aspect of the present invention concerns a programmed product, comprising a signal-bearing medium or signal-bearing media tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform a method for responding to an inquiry.","This signal-bearing medium may comprise, for example, primary memory  and\/or non-volatile memory , primary memory  and\/or non-volatile memory , primary memory  and\/or non-volatile memory , primary memory  and\/or non-volatile memory , and\/or, primary memory  and\/or non-volatile memory .

As an example, the machine-readable instructions may comprise software object code, compiled from a language such as \u201cC++\u201d, or may comprise Java bytecode.","Referring to , some examples of the invention may be called \u201cSRM CIM Utilities for Storage Reporting and Discovery\u201d , referred to as the \u201cSRM Client CIM Utilities\u201d. The SRM CIM Utilities  is a set of code modules that is an intermediary between a CIM Client Application  on one end and a CIM Client API  on the other end. The CIM Client API  is the interface to a library that the SRM CIM Utilities  use, and may be called the CIM Client library. The SRM CIM Utilities  simplifies and abstracts the Common Information Model for Storage and the CIM Client API , allowing Storage Resource Management CIM Client Applications  to more easily retrieve information about storage resources from a CIMOM , . A CIMOM can be used for managing many types of resources. Consequently, any resources managed by CIMOMs may benefit by the SRM CIM Utilities  as described herein for some examples of the invention. The SRM CIM Utilities  may be used specifically for Storage Resource Management, but also could be used for SAN Management through CIM, or for management of other resources or networks through CIM. For example, the SRM CIM Utilities  could be used to manage one or more of any of the following:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["502","602","604","606","504","506"]},"Storage Objects :","The following is a discussion of the Storage Objects : The Storage Objects  are a Java package comprised of classes that define several storage entity objects, including Disk Array Systems, Storage Pools, Volumes, Host Systems, FCPorts, and Disks. In alternative embodiments, programming languages other than Java could be used. In an example of the SRM CIM Utilities  managing a Disk Array System, the Disk Array System is the top level object, with all other objects being associated as a component of the top level object or as a subcomponent of another component object. The Storage Objects' associations to each other reflect the storage entities' relationships as they are modeled in SNIA SMI\/Bluefin Profiles. The properties of the Storage Objects directly map to the properties of the CIM Classes that are used to represent the storage entity. For example, the Storage Objects' DiskArraySystem objects' properties map directly to properties defined in the following CIM classes: CIM_ComputerSystem, CIM_Product, and CIM_Location. The Storage Objects' Volume object's properties map directly to properties defined in the CIM_StorageVolume class.","The following operations may be performed to produce the Storage Objects : Identify entities and subcomponent entities of a class of device to be managed. For example, if managing a disk array, identify the disk array and attached entities, for example disks and volumes. Also, identify the parent-child relationships between the entities. As an example, a disk may be a child of a storage pool, and the storage pool and the disk may be children of a disk array.","Object Retrieval Tool :","The following is a discussion of the Object Retrieval Tool : The Object Retrieval Tool  is a Java module or set of Java modules that allows callers to make small and specific inquiries concerning storage entities that are managed by a CIMOM , . In alternative embodiments, programming languages other than Java could be used. The Object Retrieval Tool  may be called directly by the SRM CIM Client  Application or by the CIM Discover Tool .","For each inquiry that the Object Retrieval Tool  receives, the Object Retrieval tool  does the following:\n\n","The Object Retrieval Tool has two primary types of tasks:\n\n","The following is a discussion of the CIM Discover Tool : The CIM Discover Tool  is a Java module or set of Java modules that allow callers to obtain large amounts of information from a CIMOM ,  with just one step. In alternative embodiments, the CIM Discover Tool  could be implemented in different programming languages. The CIM Discover Tool  uses the Object Retrieval Tool's  methods to fulfill a caller's request, and thus never directly calls the CIM Client API . The CIM Discover Tool  may be thought of as an API for management software applications using CIM.","The CIM Discover Tool  has three primary types of tasks:\n\n","For ease of explanation, but without any intended limitation, the method aspect of the invention is described with reference to the computing system  described above and shown in . An example of the method aspect of the present invention is illustrated in , which shows a sequence  for a method for responding to an inquiry. As an example, the operations in the sequence  may be performed by host  or host . Alternatively, the operations could be performed by CIM server  or CIM server , or any suitable computing device in computing system  (which could include an ITSRM server).","Referring to , the sequence  may include, and begin with, operation  which comprises receiving an inquiry. As an example, the inquiry may be an inquiry for information concerning a storage entity. The inquiry may be received, for example, from a SRM CIM Client Application. Alternatively, the inquiry may be received from a CIM Discover Tool. As an example, the inquiry may include the unique ID of a designated storage entity, may be a request for a Storage Object corresponding with the designated storage entity. As another example, the inquiry may include the unique ID of a designated storage entity, and may be a request for all storage entities of a specified type associated with the designated storage entity. As another example, the inquiry may not include the unique ID of a designated storage entity, and may be a request for all storage entities of a specified top-level storage entity type.","Sequence  may also include operation , which comprises obtaining information from a CIMOM . Operation  may comprise using a CIM Client API to obtain requested information from the CIMOM .","Sequence  may also include operation , which comprises creating at least one Storage Object. Operation  may comprise creating a set of Storage Objects. Each Storage Object may be created by using a Java package comprising classes that define a plurality of storage entity objects. The plurality of storage entity objects may include Disk Array System, Storage Pool, Volume, Host System, FCPort (Fibre Channel Port), and Disk, objects. As an example, the Disk Array System object may be a top level object, and each object other than the Disk Array System object may be associated as a component of the Disk Array System object. As another example, for SAN Management, the top-level object may be an object that represents a SAN Fabric, and in another example, for management of a FibreChannel Switch, the top-level object may be an object that represents a FibreChannel Switch. In another example, the Disk Array System object may be a top level object, and at least one object other than the Disk Array System object may be a subcomponent of an object other than the Disk Array System object. In another example, the creating operation  may comprise creating a plurality of Storage Objects, wherein the Storage Objects have associations to each other that are consistent with corresponding storage entities' relationships modeled in a SMI\/Bluefin profile. In another example, the creating operation  may comprise creating a plurality of Storage Objects, wherein properties of each Storage Object map directly to properties of at least one CIM Class used to represent a corresponding storage entity.","Sequence  may also include operation , which comprises populating the at least one Storage Object with information received from the CIMOM . Sequence  may also include operation , which comprises sending the at least one Storage Object to a calling function.","Sequence  may also include operation , which comprises determining if a request, for example received from the CIM discover tool, requires an additional inquiry. If so, operations - may be repeated. As an example, the inquiry may include the unique ID of an identified top level storage entity, and the receiving , obtaining , creating , populating , and sending  operations may be repeated to obtain information concerning the identified top level storage entity and all of the components of the identified top level storage entity. As another example, the inquiry may include the unique ID of a component storage entity, and the receiving , obtaining , creating , populating , and sending  operations may be repeated to obtain information concerning the component storage entity and subcomponents of the component storage entity. In another example, the inquiry may include the unique ID of a component storage entity, and the receiving , obtaining , creating , populating , and sending  operations may be repeated to obtain information concerning the component storage entity and the component storage entity's relationships to other components.","Many examples of the invention will benefit developers working on a CIM Client Application because these examples reduce development time and improve code maintainability, which allows for faster time to market for a CIM Client Application product.","The following are some examples of unique benefits of utilizing the SRM CIM Utilities :\n\n","While the foregoing disclosure shows a number of illustrative embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
