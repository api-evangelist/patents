{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/145,479 filed on Jan. 16, 2009, for COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM USER DEVICES, with inventors Beryl Tomay, Howard S. Kapustein, William D. Dozier, John B. Roy, Paul F. Ferraro and David Berbessou.","Electronic distribution of information has gained in importance with the proliferation of personal computers and has undergone a tremendous upsurge in popularity as the Internet has become widely available. With the widespread use of the Internet, it has become possible to distribute large, coherent units of information using electronic technologies.","Advances in electronic and computer-related technologies have permitted computers to be packaged into smaller and more powerful electronic devices. An electronic device may be used to receive and process information. The electronic device may provide compact storage of the information as well as ease of access to the information. For example, a single electronic device may store a large quantity of information that might be downloaded at any time via the Internet. In addition, the electronic device may be backed up, so that physical damage to the device does not necessarily correspond to a loss of the information stored on the device.","Electronic devices may experience problems from certain hardware, certain software, from data or messages on the device, etc. Sometimes a user may be aware of a problem or error, while at other times a user may be unaware of a problem. Benefits may be realized from improved systems and methods for collecting and using error information from a user device.","The present disclosure relates generally to an information collection system. Such a system may include a server and one or more user devices (e.g., electronic book readers) that are in electronic communication with each other. Information, such as errors that occur on a user device, may be collected. For example, a user device may unexpectedly shut down during operation. The user device may create an error report when an error occurs. The error report may include information about the error and information about the system parameters of the user device when the error occurred.","The server may monitor the user devices on a system-wide basis. For example, the server may monitor events that occur on the user devices such as user statistics and errors that have occurred on the user devices. The server may monitor events that occur on the user devices by requesting information from the user devices such as error reports. The server may also instruct the user devices to perform self-corrective actions such as fixing corrupt data files.","As used herein, the term \u201citem\u201d may correspond to any type of content. In one case, the item corresponds to a digital media item. The media item may include, without limitation, text content, image content, audio content, video content, hypertext protocol content, and so on, or any combination of these kinds of content. In addition, or alternatively, the item may include instruction-bearing content, such as machine-readable program code, markup language content, script content, and so forth. For instance, an item may correspond to a software upgrade or the like.","More specifically, in one case, the term \u201citem\u201d may refer to a specific unit of merchandisable content, such as an electronic book (referred to herein as an \u201ceBook\u201d), an issue of a magazine, and so on. Alternatively, an item may refer to smaller parts of a merchandisable unit, such as a chapter of a book or a song in an album. Alternatively, an item may refer to a larger compilation of component items which are related in any manner. For instance, an item may refer to multiple issues of a magazine in a particular year.","In general, the various features described in the implementations may be regarded as optional features, meaning that these features may be omitted or replaced with other features. Further, the various implementations described herein may be supplemented by adding additional features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","104","104"]},"As explained above, the term \u201citem\u201d has broad connotation. The following list, which is non-exhaustive, identifies representative types of items.","An item may correspond to an eBook item. An eBook item, in turn, may refer to a book in electronic form or to one or more portions of a book (such as a chapter of a book) or to a compilation of multiple books (such as a book series), and so on. An eBook is an example of a general class of items referred to herein as pre-generated items. The term pre-generated item refers to content typically (although not necessarily) provided to a user in response to the user's on-demand request for the content after it has been received and stored by the IPS .","An item of content may also correspond to a subscription-related item. A subscription-related item refers to any item the user receives based on a schedule or based on some other type of pre-established arrangement. Without limitation, representative forms of subscription-related items include magazines, journals, newspapers, newsletters, and so on. Other forms of subscription-related items include electronic feeds of various types, such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, and so on. In contrast to a pre-generated item, a subscription-related item is typically provided to a user in response to the receipt of the item by the IPS , rather than the user's on-demand request for a pre-generated item.","An item may also correspond to a personal document item, or simply \u201cpersonal item.\u201d A personal item refers to a document the user forwards in advance to the IPS , whereupon the IPS  converts the item to a device-readable format.","An item may also correspond to audio content, such as a piece of music, a collection of music, an audio book, and so on. An item may also correspond to a bundle of information generated in response to a query made by the user. An item may also correspond to instruction-bearing content, such as a software update. An item may also correspond to advertising material downloaded to the user device by any entity or combination of entities. Various rules may be applied to govern the downloading of this type of item.","An item may also correspond to a sample of a more complete version of the item. In one case, a sample-type item may embed one or more links to allow the user to acquire its full-version counterpart, or another part (e.g., chapter) of the item. In another case, a publisher or author may release an eBook or other item in a series of installments. Each installment may be regarded as an item.","The item-providing system (IPS)  corresponds to any functionality or combination of functionality for forwarding items to the user device . In one case, the IPS  may correspond to network-accessible server-based functionality, various data stores, and\/or other data processing equipment. The IPS  may be implemented by a single collection of functionality provided at a single physical site. Alternatively, the IPS  may be implemented by multiple collections of functionality, optionally provided at plural physical sites. The IPS  may be administered by a single entity or plural entities.","In one case, the IPS  corresponds to an entity that provides items to users upon the users' purchase of the items. In this role, the IPS  may essentially act as a bookseller or the like. In one particular commercial environment, the IPS  may also offer services which allow users to purchase hard-copy books for physical delivery to the users; in this context, the IPS  may allow users to download electronic items to respective user devices as part of its entire suite of services. In other cases, the IPS  corresponds to an entity which provides items to users on a non-fee basis or on the basis of some other type of alternative compensation arrangement. Thus, the term \u201cprovider\u201d of items should be construed broadly to encompass educational institutions, governmental organizations, libraries, non-profit organizations, and so on, or some cooperative combination of any two or more entities.","The user device  corresponds to any type of electronic processing device  for receiving items from the IPS . In one implementation, the user device  is readily portable, meaning the user may freely carry the user device  from one location to another. In one particular case, the user device is designed as a book reader device, also known as an eBook reader device. In this case, the user device  functions as the electronic counterpart of a paper-based book. The user may hold the user device  in a manner similar to a physical book; the user may electronically turn the pages of the book, and so on.","Without limitation,  illustrates a particular type of eBook reader device. Additional details regarding this particular type of reader device are provided below. Alternatively, the user device  may correspond to any other type of portable device, such as a portable music player, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a game module, a laptop computer, and so on, or any combination of these types of devices. Alternatively, or in addition, the user device  may correspond to a device which is not readily portable, such as a personal computer, a set-top box associated with a television, a gaming console, and so on.","A communication infrastructure  bi-directionally couples the IPS  to the user device . Namely, the IPS  downloads items, upgrades, or other information to the user device  via the communication infrastructure . The IPS  receives various instructions and other data from the user device  via the communication infrastructure .","The communication infrastructure  may include any combination of communication functionality, including any combination of hardwired links, wireless links, etc. For instance,  (to be discussed below in turn) shows one implementation of the communication infrastructure  which includes a combination of a wide area network (WAN) and wireless infrastructure. By virtue of the wireless component of the communication infrastructure , the user may use the user device  to purchase items and consume items without being tethered to the IPS  via hardwired links. Thus, for instance, a user may purchase and consume an eBook using the device while riding in a car as a passenger, while hiking in a park, while boating on a lake, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["104","108","102","104","108","104","102","110","104","102","102"]},"The user device  receives the list from the IPS  in response to the second message  (note  does not specifically identify the transmission of the list from the IPS  to the user device ). If the instructions identify items to be downloaded, in a third message , the user device  sends a request to the IPS , asking the IPS  to provide for download of the items identified in the list. In a fourth message , the requested items are downloaded from the IPS  to the user device . In effect, the user device  retrieves the items using a pull approach, but the pull approach is initiated by a push operation (by virtue of the IPS  \u201cpushing\u201d a notification message  to the user device ).","In a fifth message , the IPS  may request information from the user device . For example, the IPS  may request error and health information from the user device . Error and health information are discussed in more detail below in relation to . In a sixth message , the user device  may then provide the requested information to the IPS . In effect, the IPS  retrieves the requested information using a pull approach. Requested information may also be pushed to the IPS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","102","104","106"]},"The communication infrastructure  may include multiple components. A first component may be a wireless provider system . The wireless provider system  corresponds to any infrastructure for providing a wireless exchange  with the user device . In one case, the wireless provider system  is implemented using various data processing equipment, communication towers, and so forth (not shown).","Alternatively, or in addition, the wireless provider system  may rely on satellite technology to exchange information with the user device . The wireless provider system  may use any form of electromagnetic energy to transfer signals, such as, without limitation, radio-wave signals. The wireless provider system  may use any communication technology to transfer signals, such as, without limitation, spread spectrum technology, implemented, for instance, using the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) protocol. The wireless provider system  may be administered by a single entity or by a cooperative combination of multiple entities.","The communication infrastructure  may also include a communication-enabling system . One purpose of the communication-enabling system  is to serve as an intermediary in passing information between the IPS  and the wireless provider system . The communication-enabling system  may be implemented in any manner, such as, without limitation, by one or more server-type computers, data stores, and\/or other data processing equipment. The communication-enabling system  may include one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) .","The communication-enabling system  may communicate with the wireless provider system  via a dedicated channel , also referred to as a dedicated communication pipe or private pipe. The channel  is dedicated in the sense it is exclusively used to transfer information between the communication-enabling system  and the wireless provider system . In contrast, the communication-enabling system  communicates with the IPS  via a non-dedicated communication mechanism, such as a public Wide Area Network (WAN) . For example, the WAN  may represent the Internet.","The users may access the IPS  through alternative communication routes which bypass the wireless provider system . For instance, as indicated by alternative access path , a user may use a personal computer or the like to access the IPS  via the wide area network , circumventing the wireless provider system  and the communication-enabling system . The user may download items through this route in conventional fashion. The user may then transfer the items from the personal computer to the user device , e.g., via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) transfer mechanism, through the manual transfer of a portable memory device, and so on. This mode of transfer may be particularly appropriate for large files, such as audio books and the like. Transferring such a large amount of data in wireless fashion may have a relatively high cost. However, the system  may also be configured to transfer large files (such as audio files) via the wireless exchange .","Other network-accessible resources  may be accessed by the IPS  through the wide area network . For example, the IPS  may access additional databases through the wide area network . The wireless provider system  may facilitate communication traffic  with one or more user devices  and store statistics for the communication traffic  in a database. The wireless provider system  may also facilitate merchant-related communication traffic  with one or more merchants and store statistics for the merchant-related communication traffic  in a database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","102","104","300"]},"In another implementation, the system  may use some other communication infrastructure than is shown in , which may optionally omit the use of wireless communication.","Addressing the details of the IPS  first, this system  performs various functions. Different modules are associated with these different functions. One module is a content reception system . The content reception system  receives content from one or more sources of content . The sources  may represent any type of provider of content, such as eBook publishers, newspaper publishers, other publishers of periodicals, various feed sources, music sources, and so on. The content reception system  may also access network-accessible resources  through the network , such as databases.","The sources  may be administered by a single entity or may be administered by separate respective entities. Further, the entity administering the IPS  may correspond to a same entity which administers one or more of the sources . Alternatively, or in addition, the entity administering the IPS  may interact with one or more different entities administering one or more respective sources . In the latter case, the entity administering the IPS  may enter into an agreement with the source entities to receive content from these source entities.","In the above example, the entities associated with the sources  may correspond to commercial organizations or other types of organizations. In another case, one or more of the sources may correspond to individual users, such as the creators of the items. For example, a user may directly provide items to the IPS . Alternatively, or in addition, a user may supply content to a community repository of items, and the IPS  may receive content from this repository, and so on.","The content reception system  may obtain the content through various mechanisms. In one case, the content reception system  obtains the content via one or more networks . The networks  may represent a WAN, such as the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), or some combination thereof. The content reception system  may receive the information in various forms using any protocol or combination of protocols. For instance, the content reception system  may receive the information by making a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, by making a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) request, by receiving a feed (e.g., an RSS feed), and so forth.","In another case, the IPS  may obtain content via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of sources . More generally, the content reception system  may proactively request the content in an on-demand manner (based on a pull method of information transfer), or the content reception system  may receive the content in response to independent transfer operations initiated and performed by the sources  (based on a push method of information transfer). Alternatively, the content reception system  may use a combination of pull and push transfer mechanisms to receive the content.","The content reception system  may receive content in the form of items. Without limitation, the items may include eBooks, audio books, music, magazine issues, journal issues, newspaper editions, various feeds, and so forth. In one case, the content reception system  may receive some items expressed in a format not readable by the user device  (where the user device may optionally be configured to receive, process, and present content expressed in one or more predefined formats). To address this situation, the content reception system  may convert the items from their original format into a device-readable format.","The content reception system  stores the items received (and optionally converts them to another format) in a content store . The content store  includes one or more storage systems for retaining items in electronic form, located at a single site or distributed over plural sites, administered by one or more entities.","The IPS  also includes a subscription module . The subscription module  manages users' subscriptions to subscription-related items. Generally, a subscription entitles a user to receive one or more subscription-related items (which are yet to be received and stored by the content reception system ) based on any type of consideration or combination of considerations. Without limitation, subscription-related item types include magazines, journals, newsletters, newspapers, various feeds, and so forth. Users may arrange to receive subscription-related items by purchasing such subscriptions, or, more generally, by registering to receive such subscriptions (which, in some cases, may not involve the payment of a fee).","Alternatively, or in addition, the IPS  may automatically register users to receive subscription-related items without the involvement of the users (and possibly without the approval of the users). The latter scenario may be appropriate in the case in which the IPS  (or some other entity) registers a user to receive unsolicited advertisements, newsletters, and so on. The system  may allow the user to opt out of receiving such unsolicited information.","The IPS  may consult the subscription module  to determine which user devices should receive a newly-received subscription-related item. For instance, upon receiving an electronic issue of the magazine Forbes, the IPS  consults the subscription module  to determine the users who have paid to receive this magazine. The IPS  then sends the issue to the appropriate user devices.","An item delivery system  represents the functionality which actually performs the transfer of content to the user device . In one illustrative representation, the item-delivery system  includes two components: a to-do list server module  and a content delivery module . The to-do list server module  generally provides instructions for the user device . The instructions direct the user device  to retrieve items and perform other operations. The content delivery module  allows the user device  to obtain the items identified in the instructions received from the to-do list server module .","More specifically, in a first phase of information retrieval, the to-do list server module  sends a notification message to the user device . The user device  responds to the notification message by waking up (if \u201casleep\u201d), which may involve switching from a first power state to a second power state (where the second power state consumes more power than the first power state).","The user device  may then contact the to-do list server module  to request instructions from the to-do list server module . More specifically, for each user device, the to-do list server module  maintains a list of entries, also referred to herein as a \u201cto-do queue.\u201d An entry provides an instruction for a user device to perform an action. As will be described in greater detail below, there are different instructions that a device may be directed to perform, wherein a collection of instructions defines an IPS-device interaction protocol. One such action (e.g., associated with a GET instruction of the protocol) directs the user device  to retrieve an item from a specified location by specifying an appropriate network address (e.g., a URL) and appropriate arguments.","In a first phase of the downloading procedure, the user device  may retrieve n such entries, wherein n is an integer. In one scenario, the number n may be a subset of a total number of items in the to-do queue associated with the user device . In a second phase of the downloading procedure, the user device  may contact the content delivery module  to retrieve one or more items identified in the GET-related entries.","In general, after receiving the notification message, the item delivery system  may interact with the user device  in a data mode, e.g., using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or some other protocol or combination of protocols.","The IPS  may also include a merchant store module . The merchant store module  may provide access to an item catalog , which, in turn, may provide information regarding a plurality of items (such as eBooks, audio books, subscription related items, and so on). As will be described in greater detail below, the merchant store module  may include functionality allowing a user to search and browse though the item catalog . The merchant store module  may also include functionality allowing a user to purchase items (or, more generally, acquire items based on any terms).","In one case, a user may interact with the merchant store module  via the user device  using wireless communication. Alternatively, or in addition, the user may interact with the merchant store module  via another type of device , such as a personal computer, optionally via wired links. In either case, when the user purchases or otherwise acquires an item via the merchant store module , the IPS  may invoke the item delivery system  to deliver the item to the user.","The IPS  may also include a personal media library module . The personal media library module  may store, for each user, a list of the user's prior purchases. More specifically, in one case, the personal media library module  may provide metadata information regarding eBook items and other on-demand selections (e.g., \u201ca la carte\u201d selections, such as subscription issues, etc.) which a user already owns. The personal media library module  may also provide links to the items in the content store . As will be described in greater detail below, to download an eBook item (or the like) which the user has already purchased, the user device  contacts the content delivery module .","The content delivery module  may interact with permission information and linking information in the personal media library module  in order to download the item to the user. In one use scenario, the user device  may access the content delivery module  in this manner to initiate downloading of an item which has been previously purchased by the user but has been deleted by the user device  for any reason.","The IPS  may also include an information reporting\/information analyzing system . The information reporting\/information analyzing system  may request error information from the user device  including information related to the health and status of the user device . For example, the information reporting\/information analyzing system  may send error configuration messages to the user devices  which configure the user devices  to produce error reports and send the error reports to the IPS . The information reporting\/information analyzing system  may also process and analyze the error reports received from the user device . The information reporting\/information analyzing system  is discussed in more detail below.","The IPS  may also include various security-related features, such as one or more authorization stores . The authorization stores  may provide information which enables various components of the IPS  to determine whether to allow the user to perform various functions, such as access the merchant store module , download items, change settings, and so on.","The above-enumerated list of modules is representative and is not exhaustive of the types of functions performed by the IPS . As indicated by the label \u201cOther Server-Side Functionality,\u201d the IPS  may include additional functions, many of which are described below.","Now turning to the device-side features of the system , the user device  may include a device to-do list processing module . The purpose of the device to do list processing module  may be to interact with the item delivery system  to download items from the item delivery system . Namely, in a first phase of the downloading procedure, the device to-do list processing module  may first receive a notification message from the to-do list server module , which prompts it to wake up (if \u201casleep\u201d) and contact the to-do list server module  to retrieve a set of n entries.","Each entry may include an instruction which directs the device to-do list processing module  to perform an action. In a second phase, for a GET-type entry, the device to-do list processing module  may contact the content delivery module  to request and retrieve an item identified by the GET-type entry. As will be described in greater detail below, the user device  may signal a successful completion of the download process or a failure in the download process.","Upon downloading an item, the user device  may store the item in a device side memory , which in one example is a flash-type memory and may be any other type of memory in other examples. Although not shown, the user device  may also exchange information with any other source of content . In one illustrative case, the other source of content  may represent a personal computer or other data processing device. Such other source of content  may transfer an item to the user device  via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection and\/or any other type(s) of connection(s). In this scenario, the other source of content , in turn, may receive the item from the IPS  (or other source) via hardwired connection (e.g., non-wireless connection). For example, to receive an audio book, the user may use a personal computer to non-wirelessly download the audio book from a network-accessible source of such content. The user may then transfer the audio book to the user device  via USB connection. In another illustrative case, the other source of content  may represent a portable memory module of any type, such as a flash type memory module, a magnetic memory module, an optical memory module, and so on.","The user device  may also include a reader module . The illustrative purpose of the reader module  is to present media items for consumption by the user using the user device . For example, the reader module  may be used to display an eBook to the user to provide a user experience which simulates the reading of a paper-based physical book.","The user device  may also include a content manager module . The purpose of the content manager module  is to allow the user to manage items available for consumption using the user device . For example, the content manager module  may allow the user to view a list of items available for consumption.","The content manager module  may also identify the sources of respective items: one such source corresponds to the device memory ; another source corresponds to an attached portable memory (e.g., represented by the other source ); another source corresponds to items identified in the personal media library module  (as may be revealed, in turn, by device-side metadata provided by the IPS ); another source corresponds to subscription-related items identified by the subscription module , and so on. The content manager module  may allow the user to filter and sort the items in various ways. For example, the user may selectively view items which originate from the device memory .","The user device  may also include a store interaction module . The store interaction module  may allow the user device  to interact with the merchant store module . The user may engage the store interaction module  to search and browse through items, to purchase items, to read and author customer reviews, and so on. As described above, the user may also use a personal computer or the like to interact with the merchant store module  via hardwired links.","The user device  may also include an information reporting module . The information reporting module  may communicate information from the user device  to the IPS . For example, the information reporting module  may communicate error information from the user device  to the IPS . The information reporting module  may receive configuration messages from the information reporting\/information analyzing system  of the IPS . For example, the information reporting module  may receive error configuration messages from the information reporting\/information analyzing system  of the IPS . The configuration messages may instruct the information reporting module  to collect, store, or send information. For example, the configuration messages may instruct the information reporting module  to collect, store, or send error information. The information reporting module  may collect and store information pertaining to the user device , such as error information. The information reporting module  may collect information such as error information upon receiving an information configuration message from the information reporting\/information analyzing system . Alternatively, the information reporting module  may periodically collect information. Alternatively still, the information reporting module  may only collect information when an event occurs on the user device .","The information reporting module  may then send the information collected to the information reporting\/information analyzing system  of the IPS  in an information report. The information reporting module  may send the information report to the information reporting\/information analyzing system  upon receiving an error configuration message from the information reporting\/information analyzing system . Alternatively, the information reporting module  may periodically send an information report to the information reporting\/information analyzing system  of the IPS . Alternatively still, the information reporting module  may send an information report to the information reporting\/information analyzing system  of the IPS  after an event has occurred on the user device . The information reporting module  is discussed in more detail below.","The data received in an information report may be used by the IPS  to track and fix errors occurring on the user device . The data received in an information report may also be used by the IPS  for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, bandwidth reports, determining the impact of radio usage on the battery, annotation synchronization usage, and the impact on the battery by contacting a user device .","The above-enumerated list of modules is representative and is not exhaustive of the types of functions performed by the user device . As indicated by the label \u201cOther Device-Side Functionality,\u201d the user device  may include additional functions, many of which are described below. In fact,  shows additional device-side functionality. For completeness,  also identifies the various modules described above, including the device to-do list processing module , the device memory , the reader module , the content manager module , the store interaction module , and the information reporting module . These features perform the functions described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["104","104","404","404","102","102","404"]},"The user device  may also include a home presentation module . The home presentation module  may provide a home page when the user first turns on the user device  and\/or at other junctures. The home page may act as a general portal allowing a user to access media items and various features provided by the user device . In one illustrative case, the home page may present a summary of some (or all) of the items available for consumption using the user device .","The user device  may also include an audio player module . The audio player module  may provide an interface which allows the user to play back and interact with audio items, such as music, audio books and the like.","As discussed above in relation to , the information reporting module  may receive configuration messages from the IPS  and may collect, store, and send information pertaining to the user device . The information reporting module  may include error information such as a list of errors  that the user device  has encountered or is currently encountering. The information reporting module  may also include other types of information such as events  pertaining to the user device . As another example, the information reporting module  may include a listing of the current event  on the user device  such as the user device  downloading an item, the user device  running diagnostic software, or the like.","The information reporting module  may also include information such as the health  of the user device . The health  of the user device  may be an overall indicator of the health  of the user device . For example, the health  of the user device may include usage statistics of the user device , the rate of errors of the user device , present and past errors that the user device  has encountered, etc.","As another example, the information reporting module  may include information concerning the current (and prior) battery status  of the user device . The information reporting module  may also include information concerning the current (and prior) memory status  of the user device .
