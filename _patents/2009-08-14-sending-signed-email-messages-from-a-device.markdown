title: Sending signed e-mail messages from a device
abstract: Sending signed e-mail messages. An output data stream is created for streaming a signed e-mail message, and streamed attachment data is read. In response to receiving a portion of the read streamed attachment data, the received portion of the attachment data is digested to generate a digest value, and the received portion of the attachment data is sent to a mail server via the output data stream. The received portion of the attachment data is smaller than the size of the attachment data. The digest value is updated as additional portions of the streamed attachment data are received and digested. In response to sending all attachment data to the mail server, a signer generates the signature data by signing the digest value using a signer's private key, and the generated signature data is sent to the mail server via the output stream.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to sending signed e-mail messages from a device, and more particularly relates to sending streamed data from a device using a secure e-mail exchange format.","In the field of e-mail messaging, formats for secure e-mail exchange have been proposed that permit signing of e-mail messages and their attachments. One such secure e-mail exchange format is defined by the secure MIME (S\/MIME) standard for public key signing and encrypting of e-mail messages encapsulated in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) using a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). The PKI provides an S\/MIME system with public key certificates that bind together an identity with a public key used to sign and\/or encrypt an e-mail message, including any attachments.","To sign a message, a message sender uses the sender's private key (which is stored in a secure location) to encrypt a hash of the message and then send the message along with the sender's certificate (or a list of certificates for validating the validity of the certificate), which contains the sender's public key information. The recipient uses the received public key in the certificate to verify the message's digital signature.","To encrypt a message, a message sender obtains the recipient's public key, and uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the message and send the message, along with the recipient's certificate, to a receiver. The recipient will use the recipient's private key (which is stored securely somewhere that the recipient can access) to decrypt the message.","Some secure e-mail exchange formats allow for creation and formatting of a signed-only message and an enveloped(encrypted)-only message. In addition, these formats specify that signing and encrypting operations can be applied in any order. For example, signing can be performed before encrypting to create a signed-first-then-encrypted (signed-and-encrypted) message. Also, encrypting can be performed before signing to create an encrypted-and-signed) message.","As one example of a secure e-mail exchange format, and as specified by the S\/MIME standard, a signed-only S\/MIME message (clear-signed) contains a MIME body part that contains a MIME entity (i.e., the message content and attachment data) and a separate MIME body part that contains a signature (PKCS7 signature data). The MIME entity included in the message is signed by virtue of the separate signature that is included in the message. Before adding the signature to the signature MIME body part, Base64 transfer encoding is applied to the signature. The signature MIME body part has an \u201capplication\/pkcs7-signature\u201d content type, and a Base64 content transfer encoding.","The S\/MIME standard is defined at RFC 3851, \u201cS\/MIME Version 3.1 Message Specification\u201d, dated July 2004 (which obsoletes RFC 2633), RFC 3850, \u201cS\/MIME Version 3.1 Certificate Handling\u201d, dated July 2004 (which obsoletes RFC 2632), and RFC 3852, \u201cCryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\u201d, dated July 2004 (which obsoletes RFC 3369, and is updated by RFC 4853), the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein","These secure e-mail exchange formats often specify that the signature (PKCS7 signature data, in the case of the S\/MIME format) is created by using a digest algorithm to calculate a message digest for the entity that is to be signed, and then encrypting (i.e., signing) the message digest value using the signer's private key. The message digest value is the signature (again, PKCS7 signature data, in the case of the S\/MIME format).","Because the clear-signed message includes a signature that is separate from the signed entity (i.e., the message content and attachment data), and because the signature is created using a message digest of the signed entity, a typical transmission of secure e-mail is often compelled to access attachment data twice. For example, the S\/MIME system accesses the attachment data a first time to generate the attachment data to be sent, and the S\/MIME system accesses the attachment data a second time to generate the message digest that is used to generate the signature.","When sending an attachment file with e-mail messages, secure e-mail systems typically read the entire attachment file into a memory buffer before generating and sending the e-mail message, to facilitate access to the attachment data. Examples of S\/MIME systems that exhibit such behavior are believed to include Oyster S\/MIME Open Source lib.","One problem with known e-mail systems that read the entire attachment file (or files) into a memory buffer is that the size of attachment files may be limited by the size of the memory buffer. Therefore, a large memory buffer may be needed to send e-mail messages having large attachment files. Moreover, typical e-mail systems use the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which limits the memory buffer size to around 30 MB.","To avoid limits on in-memory size when generating e-mail messages containing attachments, e-mail systems that use the Bouncy Castle S\/MIME library create an attachment file, and read the attachment file twice. The attachment file is read a first time to generate an attachment body part of the e-mail message using attachment data contained in the attachment file. The attachment file is read a second time to generate a digital signature body part of the e-mail message. In particular, during the second read, a hash value is calculated, that hash value is signed, and the signed hash value is used as the digital signature, which is added to the digital signature body part of the e-mail message.","One problem with secure e-mail systems that read each attachment file twice is that it may be difficult to sign a partially sent e-mail message. In particular, if only part of an attachment file is read during the first read operation, the same portion of the attachment file read during the first read operation should also be read during the second read operation, so that the appropriate hash value for the digital signature is generated. However, it may be difficult to determine when to stop reading the attachment file during the second read operation.","Furthermore, it may be difficult to send real-time data (i.e., data that is generated and not saved) using a secure e-mail system that reads each attachment file twice, because the real-time data may only be available during the first read operation.","The foregoing situation is addressed by reading streamed attachment data from a streaming data source one time, and by digesting the streaming attachment data at the time when the attachment data is being sent to a recipient.","Thus, in an example embodiment described herein, a signed e-mail message is sent to a mail server from a device that communicates with the mail server over a network. The signed e-mail message has attachment data and signature data. Signer information, recipient information and attachment information are received. The signer information, recipient information, and attachment information are packaged into an e-mail message having a clear-signed secure e-mail exchange format that includes an attachment body part and a signature body part. The attachment body part contains the location of at least one attachment file included in the attachment information. The signature body part contains the signer information for generating the digital signature. An output data stream is created for streaming the e-mail message from the device to a mail server specified by the recipient information. The attachment body part is processed to acquire at least one input data stream for the at least one attachment file location contained in the attachment body part. Attachment data is read from the at least one input data stream, and in response to receiving a portion of the read streamed attachment data from the at least one input data stream, the received portion of the attachment data is digested to generate a digest value, and the received portion of the attachment data is sent to the mail server via the output data stream. The received portion of the attachment data is smaller than the size of the attachment data, and the digest value is updated as additional portions of the streamed attachment data are received and digested. In response to sending all attachment data specified by the attachment information to the mail server, the signature body part is processed to acquire a signer specified by the signer information contained in the signature body part, the signer generates the signature data by signing the digest value using a signer private key, and the generated signature data is sent to the mail server via the output data stream.","The foregoing arrangement is particularly advantageous in situations where it may not be possible to read and digest an entire attachment file all at once due to the size of the attachment file. Because attachment data is streamed, a large attachment file can be sent in a signed e-mail message, even if the entire attachment file cannot be read and digested all at once.","Because attachment data is digested on-the-fly as it is being streamed from the file locations, the attachment data can be read once. Because the attachment data can be read once, and a digest value is updated as additional portions of the streamed attachment data are received and digested, it is possible to sign a partially sent e-mail message. Moreover, because attachment data is read once, performance can be improved, as compared to an e-mail system in which attachment data is read more than once. Furthermore, because attachment data is read once, it is possible to send real-time data that might not be available after the first read operation is performed.","In example embodiments, the e-mail message has an S\/MIME format, and the signature has a PKCS7 content type. The signer can include at least one of a secure e-mail library module, an application module, and a smart card. The received portion of the attachment data can be encrypted before being sent to the mail server via the output data stream.","The device can include a multi-function printer (MFP), wherein the streamed attachment data is generated by at least one of a scan operation and a copy operation of the MFP. The attachment body part can contain signer's digest algorithm information specified by the signer information. The received portion of the attachment data can be digested using a digest algorithm, wherein the digest algorithm includes at least one of an MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) digest algorithm, a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-1 digest algorithm, and an SHA-2 digest algorithm, wherein the SHA-2 digest algorithm includes at least one of an SHA-224 digest algorithm, an SHA-256 digest algorithm, an SHA-384 digest algorithm, and an SHA-512 digest algorithm.","Responsive to a cancel instruction issued by a user of the device in the midst of the scan operation, the signer can generate the signature data, and the generated signature data can be sent to the mail server via the output data stream. As such, a partially sent e-mail message is signed, in correspondence to the information scanned so far in the interrupted scan operation. Information can be added to the message content of the partially sent e-mail message to indicate that the message is a partially sent e-mail message. Information can be added to the attachment data of the partially sent e-mail message to indicate that the message is a partially sent e-mail message, wherein if the message includes a plurality of attachment files, the information is added to the attachment file that is partially sent. Additional information indicating that the message is a partially sent e-mail message can be added to the partially sent e-mail message as a new attachment.","The JavaMail API and Java Activation Framework (JAF) can be used to send the signed e-mail message.","The received portion of the read attachment data can be buffered in a memory buffer, wherein a capacity of the memory buffer is smaller than a size of the attachment data specified by the attachment information, and wherein after the buffered portion of the attachment data is digested and sent to the mail server, additional portions of the streamed attachment data are buffered in the memory buffer.","This brief summary has been provided so that the nature of this disclosure may be understood quickly. A more complete understanding can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and to the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","103","105","104","106","107"]},"Mail server  is a computer that executes an e-mail server application, such as, for example, Microsoft Exchange Server, Sendmail e-mail server, or any other suitable type of e-mail server application.","Data server  is a computer that executes a data server application, such as, for example, a file server application, a web server application, a database server application, a media server application, or any other suitable type of data server application.","Network  is an intranet, but in other embodiments, network  can be the Internet, or any other suitable type of network for sending e-mail messages.","Certificate Authority (CA) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server  is a computer that executes a Certificate Authority server application and an OCSP server application.","Sending device  is a device that executes an e-mail client application that generates and sends signed e-mail messages having a clear-signed secure e-mail exchange format to recipient devices  and  via mail server .

After creating the output data stream, mail module  calls S\/MIME library module  (which is registered as the callback class for the MimeMessage object, in a manner similar to that described above for step S of ), and passes a pointer to the output data stream to S\/MIME library module . S\/MIME library module  rejects the output data stream.","In response to S\/MIME library module  rejecting the output data stream, at step S, mail module  creates a Base64 output data stream (e.g., a Base64EncoderStream that wraps an SMTPOutputStream via PKCS7Mime class) for streaming the clear-text header attributes and PKCS7 encrypted information of the e-mail message represented by the MimeMessage object. After creating the Base64 output data stream, mail module  calls S\/MIME library module  (which is registered as the callback class for the MimeMessage object, in a manner similar to that described above for step S of ), and passes a pointer to the Base64 output data stream to S\/MIME library module .","At step S, in response to receiving the callback from mail module , S\/MIME library module  sends the header attributes of the MimeMesage object to the mail server via the Base64 output data stream, sends PKCS7 encrypted information (which includes recipients' certificates), and then sends the header attributes of the attachment MimeBodyPart object to the mail server via the Base64 output data stream.","As step S, S\/MIME library module  starts processing PKCS7 signature data and calls a method in mail module  to create an Encryption output data stream (e.g., a CMSEncryptionStream object embedded inside a Base64EncoderStream via PKCS7Siganture class) for streaming the encrypted attachment data of the encrypted e-mail message represented by the MimeMessage object from the sending device to the mail server. After creating the Encrypted output data stream, at step S, mail module  calls S\/MIME library module , and passes a pointer to the Encryption output data stream to S\/MIME library module .","At step S, S\/MIME library module  gets a pointer to an input data stream for the attachment file locations contained in the attachment MimeBodyPart object of the MimeMes sage object, and calls a streaming method of mail module  to read the attachment data via the input data stream. In response to receiving the call from S\/MIME library module , at step S, mail module  reads the attachment data from the input data stream, and calls S\/MIME library module  to write the streamed attachment data to the mail server via the Encryption output data stream.","At step S, S\/MIME library module  receives streamed attachment data from mail module , and buffers the received attachment data in a buffer memory (e.g., a RAM). After a predetermined number of bytes of attachment data is buffered in the buffer memory, at step S, S\/MIME library module  digests the buffered portion of the attachment data (using digest algorithm information specified by the signer information) to generate a message digest value at the same time that the buffered portion of the attachment data is sent to the mail server via the Encryption output data stream, wherein the attachment data is encrypted as it is output via the Encryption output data stream. The digest value is updated as additional portions of the streamed attachment data are received and digested.","At step S, after S\/MIME library module  sends all attachment data specified by the attachment information to the mail server, S\/MIME library module  generates the PKCS7 signature data using the signer that is specified by the signer information. After generating the PKCS7 signature data, S\/MIME library module  calls an encoding method of mail module  to apply Base64 transfer encoding to the PKCS7 signature data. Mail module  creates a Base64 output data stream (e.g., a Base64EncoderStream that wraps an SMTPOutputStream via SMIMEStreamPKCSHandler class) for streaming the clear-text PKCS7 signature data of the e-mail message represented by the MimeMessage object.","At step S, after creating the Base64 output data stream, mail module  calls S\/MIME library module  (which is registered as the callback class for the MimeMessage object, in a manner similar to that described above for step S of ), and passes a pointer to the Base64 output data stream to S\/MIME library module .","At step S, S\/MIME library module  buffers the Base64-transter-encoded PKCS7 signature data in the buffer memory, and then writes the buffered PKCS7 signature data to the mail server via the Base64 output data stream.","In the example embodiment, there are callbacks at steps S and S to notify S\/MIME application module  of the status of the send and then encrypt operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0182"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1401","1402","1402","1403","1403"]},"This disclosure has provided a detailed description with respect to particular representative embodiments.
