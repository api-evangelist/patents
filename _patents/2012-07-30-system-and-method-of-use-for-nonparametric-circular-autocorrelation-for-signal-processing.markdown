title: System and method of use for non-parametric circular autocorrelation for signal processing
abstract: A computer-implemented method to characterize a signal structure is provided. The method may receive a first set of time-dependent data vectors; select a sample size of data vectors; determine a minimum number of lags to process to characterize the first set of data vectors; calculate a cross-product term for each data vector in the sample size for each lag, a mean value and a variance value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag; calculate a circular correlation function for each lag; determine an upper and a lower correlation bound for the circular correlation based on the mean value, the variance value, and a desired false alarm rate; and characterize the signal structure based on the number of calculated circular correlation functions that exceed the upper or lower correlation bounds so as to generate a signal characterization data signal.

It describes the dependence of a signal's value at one point with the value of the same signal at another time. The measure is designed to detect repeating patterns or trends in noise-corrupted nonlinear time series distributions (e.g., periodic, quasi-periodic, parabolic, etc.) and identify frequencies. The ACF is one measure to determine whether the time waveform is random noise. The ACF is a basic building block of time series analysis.

The standard discrete non-circular correlation index removes one observation with each lag calculation, a serious drawback for small samples, a condition for which the present disclosure models accurately and efficiently.","Wald and Wolfowitz generally describe the properties of Rin the context of non-parametric (or distribution free) methods. To summarize the large sample non-parametric approach of Wald and Wolfowitz at page 378 provide:\n\n","This method has been adapted for application in signal processing studies of random signals to determine if the distribution is random and to document other properties of the signal structure such as periodicities or other trends. The underlying distribution function may be continuous or discrete.","Further, a number of prior art references address various aspects of signal processing methodologies\/techniques. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,369,961, to Castelli et al., relates to clustering structures of time sequences. Generally, the Castelli et al. patent discloses a system and method to discover potential periodicities of time series by examining power spectral density (PSD) and circular autocorrelation functions (ACFs). Their ACF formula is designed to \u201cestimate dominant periods of a time series.\u201d (Col. 4, lines 55-56). The present disclosure, however, uses an entirely different circular autocorrelation function and addresses a different purpose.","Other prior art references include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,966,414 and 6,597,634, to O'Brien et al. (of the present disclosure). These patents generally relate to methods for distinguishing signal from noise in time-series data. However, these patents do not teach or suggest the present disclosure. For example, these patents can be distinguished in the dimensionality analyzed, the ensemble of statistical and probability methods for data analysis. Neither patent uses a circular autocorrelation method for signal\/noise determination.","In view of the above, there is a need for an improved system on non-parametric circular autocorrelation for signal processing and method of use, such as is described in the present disclosure.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved computer-aided means to detect a random process and characterize signal structure in a two-dimensional time-series or other in situ distributions. The present disclosure, in some aspects, comprises an improved system and method to compute the one-dimensional, normalized, circular autocorrelation function in the analysis of synthetic or real signals when the distribution is unknown (Gaussian or non-Gaussian). The present disclosure presents a logical alternative to commonly available autocorrelation procedures such as provided by MATLAB\u2122 and other data processing software systems including R, S+, SAS\u2122, SPSS, Scilab, and the like. One characteristic of the present disclosure is the capability to provide the described functionality while handling moderately small data sets.","The operation of the present disclosure may be structured to be as flexible as possible with multiple uses in mind, according to the philosophy that, in a black box real time operating system of inputs, it is judicious to examine the entire autocorrelation function for indications of randomness or trends (linear, nonlinear, and periodic). Analysis of a single lag can at most be a test of randomness in a time series; however, a single lag cannot detect periodic or quasi-periodic structure embedded in noise for a time limited or varying waveform. Thus, the inventive method herein disclosed is as general as possible allowing the user wide discretion and flexibility as to the uses to which the invention can be of service in military and commercial settings.","In some aspects, the present disclosure may not be designed to distinguish random noise from deterministic noise although properties of the non-circular ACF have been documented in the case of strange attractors, and are well known to those skilled in the art. Rather, the inventive method is designed, by way of example, to distinguish noise-corrupted signals from randomness (the absence of quantifiable useful signal information) regardless of the origination of the noise.","With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the present disclosure is the provision of a computer-implemented method to characterize a signal structure. The method may comprise receiving, via a first data channel, a first set of time-dependent data vectors. Each of the data vectors may have an associated amplitude. The method may further comprise activating a signal characterization module that executes instructions. When executed, the instructions may cause the signal characterization module to: select a sample size of data vectors from the first set of data vectors; determine a minimum number of lags to process to characterize the first set of data vectors based on the sample size from the first set; calculate a cross-product term for each data vector in the sample size for each lag, a mean value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag, and a variance value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag; calculate a circular correlation function for each lag; determine an upper and a lower correlation bound for the circular correlation based on the mean value, the variance value, and a desired false alarm rate; and characterize the signal structure based on the number of calculated circular correlation functions that exceed the upper or lower correlation bounds so as to generate a signal characterization data signal. Lastly, the method may further comprise providing the signal characterization data signal on a second data channel.","In accordance with a further feature of the present disclosure, there is provided a signal structure characterization system. The system may comprise a first data channel configured to receive a first set of time-dependent data vectors, each data vector having an associated amplitude. The system may further comprise a processing system configured to read the first set of time-dependent data vectors and store the first set in a memory. The processing system may further comprise a signal characterization module configured to execute instructions that, when executed, causes the processing system to: select a sample size of data vectors from the first set of data vectors; determine a minimum number of lags to process to characterize the first set of data vectors based on the sample size from the first set; calculate a cross-product term for each data vector in the sample size for each lag, a mean value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag, and a variance value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag; calculate a circular correlation function for each lag; determine an upper and a lower correlation bound for the circular correlation based on the mean value, the variance value, and a desired false alarm rate; and characterize the signal structure based on the number of calculated circular correlation functions that exceed the upper or lower correlation bounds so as to generate a signal characterization data signal.

The method may comprise receiving, via a first data channel, a first set of time-dependent data vectors, each data vector having an associated amplitude. The method may comprise selecting a sample size of data vectors from the first set of data vectors. The method may comprise determining a minimum number of lags to process to characterize the first set of data vectors based on the sample size from the first set. The method may further comprises calculating a cross-product term for each data vector in the sample size for each lag, a mean value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag, and a variance value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag. The method comprises calculating a circular correlation function for each of the determined minimum number of lags and determining an upper and a lower correlation bound for the circular correlation. The method may further comprise characterizing the signal structure based on the number of calculated circular correlation functions that exceed the upper or lower correlation bounds so as to generate a signal characterization data signal. Lastly, the method may even further comprise providing, via a second data channel, the signal characterization data signal.","Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art reading the instant specification, drawings, and appended claims.","Before explaining the presently disclosed and claimed inventive concepts in detail by way of exemplary embodiments, drawings, and appended claims, it is to be understood that the present disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.

In certain aspects, the equivalency between the two measures may be a primary theoretical basis of the present inventive method designed for non-large samples.","In accordance with certain aspects, inventive formulations are derived and documented in the present disclosure, wherein said formulations may be adapted for implementation via a computer-implemented processing system. For example, the computing correlation index of equation (5) above may be derived from the definition given by Wald and Wolfowitz (p. 378). Moreover, the present disclosure demonstrates that the discrete circular autocorrelation is symmetric with respect to the median value of the maximum lag of a discrete series on time t>0. This is different from the non-circular case in which a defining property of the ACF is symmetry about 0 on time t, \u2212\u221e<t<+\u221e. This finding results in the option to process only one half of the time series to characterize fully the correlational structure for samples of small to moderate size\u2014or obtain an estimate of the ACF derived from a random sample of a large sample. Overall, the inventive concepts recited in the present disclosure have found that the circular autocorrelation is a useful tool in two-dimensional space to detect and characterize a random process or signal in the time domain regardless of the underlying distribution of the data\/noise (Gaussian or non-Gaussian).","For non-limiting illustration purposes, the present disclosure provides an example of the circular correlation function (circular ACF) for a quite small data set of 15 discrete observations of random data mimicking a discrete-time random process. Although this data set is less than the minimum of n=25, it is used for illustrative purposes only. We will use this data set to provide a demonstration of certain aspects of the inventive method and its application to two-dimensional time series typically encountered in signal processing and various other fields of engineering or science. It is to be understood that the present disclosure is not limited in its application to the data set discussed herein.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , shown therein is a table  including a random data set used to illustrate certain aspects of the present disclosure. Generally, the table  shown in  illustrates a small random data set (n=15) taken from Hoel, P. J. et al., Introduction to Statistical Theory, Houghton-Mifflin, Boston 1971, chap. 6 (Hereinafter \u201cHoel, et al.\u201d), page 180. Equations (5) through (9) generally comprise the classical approach for assessing a noise hypothesis based on 1 lag of data commonly taught in statistical texts provided the sample size is large enough; e.g., Hoel et al., p. 178. This example demonstrates that the method detects randomness for n of 15.

Another interpretation is that p represents the \u201cbelief\u201d of the operator that the null hypothesis of random noise is true. Small values of p lead to rejection of the null hypothesis of noise only. For example, in the case of pure noise, \u03c4=0, and p=1. In the case of pure signal, \u00b1|\u03c4|\u2192\u00b1\u221e and p=0. The calculation of p, well known to those skilled in the art, is performed in a standard finite series expansion.","The same mean \u03c1=E(R) and variance \u03c3=var(R) are constant terms used across all lags since they are defined for the entire sample by considering all possible permutations of the sample. The sample size n for lag h is always the same value unlike the standard non-circular correlation index which drops one observation per lag.  shows a table  illustrating a complete analysis of these data for the maximum number of lags permissible; h=n\u22121, i.e., a complete analysis for 14 lags (n=15) for the random data set of Hoel et al. shown in Table  of . Table  shows that all correlations indicate \u201cnoise\u201d (p\u22670.05) at the 5% false alarm level. The occurrence of identical results between the lower lags and upper lags will be explained below.","As noted, provided the sample size is large enough, equations (5) through (10) comprise the standard procedure for assessing a distributional noise hypothesis commonly taught in statistical texts. Interestingly, a sample as small as 15 observations-known a priori to be random\u2014was detected to be a random series for the n\u2192\u221e asymptotic method of Wald and Wolfowitz. It is doubtful, however, that engineers would accept as valid a 1-lag test for such a small sample. More lags are needed to be certain the data does not possess hidden signal structures. In accordance with certain aspects, the presently disclosed inventive methods and system addresses this need. The inventive aspects of the present disclosure has been verified by empirical investigation based on a number of computer runs using the currently disclosed algorithm and method steps on, for example, programs that run in the MATLAB\u2122 environment.","Researchers who have used this large sample one-lag randomness method for analysis include Giles who applied Wald and Wolfowitz's method for the removal of high frequency random noise for serial electromagnetic pulse data, and Kay et al. who investigated the complex circular correlation detector for the case of a complex sinusoidal in complex white Gaussian noise. Some refer to the statistic Ras \u201cthe correlation\u201d but this terminology introduces confusion.","Turning now to certain inventive aspects of the present disclosure, a new method and system based on the correlations, R, to assess an entire ACF for a predetermined number of lags of circular data in the time domain is described. Research has shown that the methods and systems implementing the current disclosure are useful for sample sizes smaller than recommended for asymptotic theory to work. As noted, in computing the circular serial correlation for any lag h by equation (5), only the cross-product term Rchanges, a computing formula for which can be expressed in summation notation

The step  may further include performing preprocessing conditioning, filtering, formatting, etc., as necessary. The method  may also include a step  of selecting a discrete sample size n.

A large data set can be randomly sampled to obtain an estimate of the ACF of the entire sample by use of the mincriterion of the inventive method. Small sample sizes of about 100 or less may not need to be sampled in order to analyze the entire ACF.","Once any required sampling is accomplished, the method  may further include a step  of determining a minimum number of lags to process to characterize the first set of data vectors. The minimum number of lags to process may be based on the sample size n from the first set of data vectors. The minimum number of lags to process may be determined with the criterion",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0129"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00042","num":"00042"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["min","h"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["n","odd"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}},{"mfrac":{"mi":"n","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["n","even"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}],"mo":[";","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":"."}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"22"}}]}}}}},"The method  may further include a step  of calculating a cross-product term for each data vector in the sample size for each lag, a mean value based on the sum of the cross-product term for each lag, and a variance value.

In certain aspects, a parameter c may be counted to ascertain the number of computed autocorrelation values which exceed the noise bounds. Fractional values of c may be rounded up to the next higher integer. The decision module (e.g., the signal characterization module) determines whether the ACF is signal or noise. Eq. (20) makes this determination at the 5% false alarm level and Eq. (21) at the 1% false alarm level. Other conclusions and decisions about the vector data set may be made about the structure of the time waveform such as periodicity or other trends to inform further analysis of the data set. A signal characterization data signal may be generated which is indicative of whether the first set of data vectors include a signal component, a noise component, combinations thereof, and the like.","The method  may further include a step  of outputting the signal characterization data signal on a second data channel. The second data channel may utilize the same or similar data channel as the first data channel or may be an independent data channel. The output signal characterization data signal may be output as an electronic or hard copy computer analysis (graphic or text). The output signal characterization data signal may be provided to additional processing modules for further analysis. Additional exemplary analysis may include a power spectral density (PSD) analysis of the ACF to further characterize the signal information of non-random data, or noise reduction algorithms used to remove the identified noise, or Fishers' classical test for periodicities, among other procedures, well known to those skilled in the art of this field.","From the description discussed above, it is clear that the currently disclosed inventive method possesses several key advantages and new features over the standard autocorrelation method currently available to scientists and engineers for testing a signal-noise binary hypothesis\u2014for example the popular MATLAB\u2122 procedure with syntax, autocorr (Series,nLags,M,nSTDs). An important advantage of the current disclosure is that it makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution; that is, it is non-parametric. This means the method can be used for Gaussian or non-Gaussian models and call \u201csignal\u201d or \u201cnoise\u201d with high certainty. Second, the method can perform a complete analysis for the maximum number of lags in one-half the time the same data set is processed by the standard non-circular correlation method. This is due to the symmetry of the correlations for h lags, as explained herein. Third, the method does not lose \u201cone observation per lag\u201d as the standard non circular parametric method does. This is especially important for small samples in which the hlag may contain only a handful of observations which results in lower confidence in the estimates.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
