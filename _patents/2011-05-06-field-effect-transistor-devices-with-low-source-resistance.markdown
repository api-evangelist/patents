{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DAAD19-01-C-0067 awarded by Army Research Laboratory. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to electronic devices and fabrication methods. More particularly, the present invention relates to high power insulated gate transistors and fabrication methods.","Power devices made with silicon carbide (SiC) are expected to show great advantages as compared to those on silicon for high speed, high power and\/or high temperature applications due to the high critical field and wide band gap of SiC. For devices capable of blocking high voltages, such as voltages in excess of about 5 kV, it may be desirable to have bipolar operation to reduce the drift layer resistance via conductivity modulation resulting from injected minority carriers. However, one technical challenge for bipolar devices in silicon carbide is forward voltage degradation over time, possibly due to the presence of Basal Plane Dislocations (BPD) in single crystals of silicon carbide. Thus, unipolar devices such as SiC Schottky diodes and MOSFETs are typically used for high power applications, e.g., up to 10 kV or more.","SiC DMOSFET devices with a 10 kV blocking capability have been fabricated with a specific on-resistance of about 100 m\u03a9\u00d7cm. DMOSFET devices may exhibit very fast switching speeds of, for example, less than 100 ns, due to their majority carrier nature. However, as the desired blocking voltage of devices increases, for example up to 15 kV or more, the on-resistance of a MOSFET device may increase substantially, due to the corresponding increase in the drift layer thickness. This problem may be exacerbated at high temperatures due to bulk mobility reduction, which may result in excessive power dissipation.","With the progress of SiC crystal material growth, several approaches have been developed to mitigate BPD related problems. See, e.g., B. Hull, M. Das, J. Sumakeris, J. Richmond, and S. Krishinaswami, \u201cDrift-Free 10-kV, 20-A 4H\u2014SiC PiN Diodes\u201d, Journal of Electrical Materials, Vol. 34, No. 4, 2005. These developments may enhance the development and\/or potential applications of SiC bipolar devices such as thyristors, GTOs, etc. Even though thyristors and\/or GTOs may offer low forward voltage drops, they may require bulky commutating circuits for the gate drive and protections. Accordingly, it may be desirable for a SiC bipolar device to have gate turn-off capability. Due to their superior on-state characteristics, reasonable switching speed, and\/or excellent safe-operation-area (SOA), 4H\u2014SiC insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are becoming more suitable for power switching applications.","A semiconductor device according to some embodiments includes a drift layer having a first conductivity type, a well region in the drift layer having a second conductivity type opposite the first conductivity type, and a source region in the well region. The source region has the first conductivity type and defines a channel region in the well region. The source region includes a lateral source region adjacent the channel region and a plurality of source contact regions extending away from the lateral source region opposite the channel region. A body contact region having the second conductivity type is between at least two of the plurality of source contact regions and is in contact with the well region, and a source ohmic contact is in contact with the source contact regions and the body contact region.","The body contact region may include a plurality of body contact regions that are interspersed between the source contact regions. The plurality of body contact regions may be spaced apart from the channel region by the lateral source region.","The source ohmic contact may be in contact with the source region in a source contact area and the source ohmic contact may be in contact with the body contact region in a body contact region area.","In some embodiments, a ratio of a minimum dimension p of the contact region area to a minimum dimension w of the well region may be greater than 0.2. In further embodiments, the ratio of the minimum dimension p of the contact region area to the minimum dimension w of the well region may be greater than about 0.3.","The drift region may include a wide bandgap semiconductor material, such as silicon carbide.","The source region has a sheet resistance and the source ohmic contact has a sheet resistance that is greater than 75% of the contact resistance of the source region, and in some embodiments is greater than the contact resistance of the source region.","The device may have a reverse blocking voltage in excess of 1000 volts and a current density greater than 200 amps per square centimeter.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.

It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.","Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. The thickness of layers and regions in the drawings may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and\/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described with reference to semiconductor layers and\/or regions which are characterized as having a conductivity type such as n-type or p-type, which refers to the majority carrier concentration in the layer and\/or region. Thus, n-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons, while p-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes. Some material may be designated with a \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2212\u201d (as in n+, n\u2212, p+, p\u2212, n++, n\u2212\u2212, p++, p\u2212\u2212, or the like), to indicate a relatively larger (\u201c+\u201d) or smaller (\u201c\u2212\u201d) concentration of majority carriers compared to another layer or region. However, such notation does not imply the existence of a particular concentration of majority or minority carriers in a layer or region.","Some embodiments of the invention provide silicon carbide (SiC) insulated gate devices that are suitable for high power and\/or high temperature applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10","sub":["GS","DS","S ","D ","S ","Rs"]},"In a MOSFET device, current passing through a channel of the device from the drain to the source is regulated by applying a voltage to the gate. The gate is insulated from the channel by a gate insulator, such as silicon dioxide. As the voltage on the gate terminal is increased, current passing through the device may increase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","104"],"sub":["GS","D","DS"]},"In particular, as the drain current Ipassing through the device increases, the amount of voltage dropped over the source resistance Rincreases in direct proportion.  is a graph illustrating the effect of source resistance on gate voltage. In , the voltage from the gate terminal to the source terminal is denoted V. A portion of the gate voltage Vapplied to the device across the gate and source terminals is dropped over the internal source resistance Rof the device. That portion of the gate voltage is denoted Vin . The remainder of the gate-to-source voltage appears as a voltage across the gate insulator, denoted Vin . Thus, Vis equal to the sum of Vand V.","As shown in , the gate-to-source voltage may remain constant as the drain current increases. However, the portion of the gate voltage Vthat is dropped over the internal source resistance of the device, V, increases as the drain current Iincreases, while the portion of the gate-to-source voltage that appears as a voltage across the gate insulator, V, decreases as the drain current Iincreases.","Thus, as the drain current increases the portion of the gate voltage that is being used to maintain the channel decreases, which may cause the device to go into saturation at a lower level of drain-to-source voltage. Accordingly, a high source resistance can adversely affect the operation of a MOSFET or other insulated gate controlled device.","A unit cell  of a MOSFET structure according to some embodiments is shown in . The device  of  includes an n\u2212 drift epitaxial layer  on an n-type, 8\u00b0 off-axis 4H\u2014SiC substrate . The n\u2212 drift layer  may have a thickness of about 100 \u03bcm to about 120 \u03bcm, and may be doped with n-type dopants at a doping concentration of about 2\u00d710cmto about 6\u00d710cmfor a blocking capability of about 10 kV. Other doping concentrations\/voltage blocking ranges are also possible.","The structure further includes a p+ well region  and an n+ source region  that may be formed by selective implantation of, for example, aluminum and nitrogen, respectively. The junction depth of the p+ well region  may be about 0.5 \u03bcm, although other depths are possible. The structure  further includes a p+ contact region  that extends from a surface of the drift layer  into the p+ well region . A junction termination (not shown) may be provided around the device periphery.","All of the implanted dopants may be activated by annealing the structure at a temperature of about 1600\u00b0 C. with a silicon over pressure and\/or covered by an encapsulation layer such as a graphite film. A high temperature anneal may damage the surface of the silicon carbide epitaxy. In order to reduce such damage, a graphite coating may be formed on the surface of the device. Prior to annealing the device to activate the implanted ions, a graphite coating may be applied to the top\/front side of the structure in order to protect the surface of the structure during the anneal. The graphite coating may be applied by a conventional resist coating method and may have a thickness of about 1 \u03bcm. The graphite coating may be heated to form a crystalline coating on the drift layer . The implanted ions may be activated by a thermal anneal that may be performed, for example, in an inert gas at a temperature of about 1600\u00b0 C. or greater. In particular the thermal anneal may be performed at a temperature of about 1600\u00b0 C. in argon for 5 minutes. The graphite coating may help to protect the surface of the drift layer  during the high temperature anneal.","The graphite coating may then be removed, for example, by ashing and thermal oxidation.","After implant annealing, a field oxide of silicon dioxide (not shown) having a thickness of about 1 \u03bcm may be deposited and patterned to expose the active region of the device.","A gate oxide layer  may be formed by a gate oxidation process, with a final gate oxide thickness of 400-600 \u212b.","In particular, the gate oxide may be grown by a dry-wet oxidation process that includes a growth of bulk oxide in dry Ofollowed by an anneal of the bulk oxide in wet Oas described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,801, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As used herein, anneal of oxide in wet Orefers to anneal of an oxide in an ambient containing both Oand vaporized HO. An anneal may be performed in between the dry oxide growth and the wet oxide growth. The dry Ooxide growth may be performed, for example, in a quartz tube at a temperature of up to about 1200\u00b0 C. in dry Ofor a time of at least about 2.5 hours. Dry oxide growth is performed to grow the bulk oxide layer to a desired thickness. The temperature of the dry oxide growth may affect the oxide growth rate. For example, higher process temperatures may produce higher oxide growth rates. The maximum growth temperature may be dependent on the system used.","In some embodiments, the dry Ooxide growth may be performed at a temperature of about 1175\u00b0 C. in dry Ofor about 3.5 hours. The resulting oxide layer may be annealed at a temperature of up to about 1200\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere. In particular, the resulting oxide layer may be annealed at a temperature of about 1175\u00b0 C. in Ar for about 1 hour. The wet Ooxide anneal may be performed at a temperature of about 950\u00b0 C. or less for a time of at least about 1 hour. The temperature of the wet Oanneal may be limited to discourage further thermal oxide growth at the SiC\/SiOinterface, which may introduce additional interface states. In particular, the wet Oanneal may be performed in wet Oat a temperature of about 950\u00b0 C. for about 3 hours. The resulting gate oxide layer may have a thickness of about 500 \u212b.","In some embodiments, the dry Ooxide growth may be performed at a temperature of about 1175\u00b0 C. in dry Ofor about 4 hours. The resulting oxide layer may be annealed at a temperature of up to about 1175\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere. In particular, the resulting oxide layer may be annealed at a temperature of about 1175\u00b0 C. in Ar for about a time duration ranging from 30 min to 2 hours. Then the oxide layer receives an anneal in NO ambient at a temperature ranging from 1175 C to 1300 C, for a duration ranging from 30 minutes to 3 hours. The resulting gate oxide layer may have a thickness of about 500 \u212b.","After formation of the gate oxide , a polysilicon gate  may be deposited and doped, for example, with boron followed by a metallization process to reduce the gate resistance. Al\/Ni contacts may be deposited as the p-type ohmic source contact metal , and Ni as the n-type drain contact metal . All contacts may be sintered in a Rapid Thermal Annealer (RTA), and thick Ti\/Au layers may be used for pad metals.","Referring to , the source resistance of a MOSFET device has two primary components, namely, the contact resistance Rbetween the source ohmic contact  and the source region , and the sheet resistance Rin the source region  between the source ohmic contact  and the channel. Thus, R=R+R. In a conventional silicon-based MOSFET device, the sheet resistance Ris the dominant factor in determining the source resistance, because it is possible to form very low resistivity ohmic contacts to silicon and other narrow-bandgap semiconductors. However, in wide bandgap semiconductors (i.e., semiconductors having a bandgap greater than about 2.0 V), including compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, diamond, and ZnO, the contact resistance Rmay be the dominant contributor to the source resistance. In particular, it is difficult to form very low resistivity ohmic contacts to silicon carbide and other wide bandgap materials because of the high energy barrier associated with such materials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["18","14","20","18","22","20","34","20","22","32","18","20","14","42"]},"As noted above, in a wide bandgap semiconductor material system, the source resistance may be more affected by the contact resistance of the source ohmic contact than by the sheet resistance of the source layer. Accordingly, to decrease the source resistance of a wide bandgap power semiconductor device, it may be desirable to decrease the contact resistance of the source ohmic contact. In general, contact resistance can be decreased by increasing the minimum dimension of the contact, which is the smallest dimension of the contact in any direction. However, simply increasing the minimum dimension of the source ohmic contact of an electronic device can undesirably increase the cell to cell spacing, or pitch, of the device. The pitch of a MOSFET device may be proportional to the width of the p-well region of the device. Increasing the pitch of the device reduces the density of the devices that can be formed on a single substrate, reducing the devices yielded and increasing manufacturing costs.","According to some embodiments, an insulated gate device layout is provided that increases the minimum dimension of the source ohmic contact without increasing the pitch of the device and\/or the width of the p-well region of the device. A device layout according to some embodiments may increase the sheet resistance of the device. Such an effect may be highly undesirable in a device based on a narrow bandgap semiconductor material. However, since sheet resistance is not the dominant factor in determining source resistance of a wide bandgap device, such a tradeoff may be acceptable for wide bandgap devices. In devices according to some embodiments, a ratio of the source sheet resistance to the source contact resistance may be greater than 0.75 (i.e. R\/R>0.75). In some embodiments, the device may have a source contact resistance that is less than the source sheet resistance. That is, in some embodiments, the ratio of the source sheet resistance to the source contact resistance may be greater than 1 (i.e. R\/R>1), and in further embodiments, the ratio of the source sheet resistance to the source contact resistance may be greater than 5.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 7 and 8","FIGS. 9 and 10","FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 10","FIG. 8"],"b":"100"},"The device  shown in  includes an n\u2212 drift epitaxial layer  on an n-type, 8\u00b0 off-axis 4H\u2014SiC substrate .
