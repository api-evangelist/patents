{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention pertains to entities connected to a network. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for associating network entities.","Associating a networked entity, such as a device, with either an application and\/or a controlling function may increase the capability of the networked device. Additionally networking a device to a network may lower costs and\/or allow for more flexibility. For example, a vending machine may operate as a standalone device having the electronics and equipment necessary for accepting change, reading and identifying currency bills, dispensing, etc. However, by connecting the vending machine to a network and associating it to another networked entity, such as an application for controlling the machine, may allow for production of a lower cost machine. For example, a networked machine may only need a bill reader that sends the data to an application to verify if the bill is acceptable. Using the network would allow the machine to have less electronics as the computation for bill validation may now be done at a centralized place rather than being done in every machine. Additionally, network control allows for more flexibility. For example, when the face on the dollar bill changed, each independent machine bill changer had to be reprogrammed locally. If the machine was networked for this function, then a single change at the network level was available to every such networked machine. Additional functions may also be added to machines. For example, in an airport where various currencies may be in use, a networked machine would be able to identify the currency, calculate the exchange rate, prompt the user as to purchase status, and even display instructions in other languages, etc.","Thus, networked devices have a variety of potential advantages. However, the association of a device with an application and\/or controlling function may present a challenge. If the device is hardwired into an interface this is inflexible. If the device is dedicated to an application this may also be inflexible. If the device may only access a single resource then availability may be downgraded if the resource is off-line. This presents a problem.","A method and apparatus for associating network devices are described.","The invention by providing for associating network devices, allows for greater flexibility in associating network devices to other resources.","In the explanation below various terminology is used. These are understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. For the benefit of the reader the following should be noted. To provide a concise illustration of the invention the context of the description will often refer to connecting machines or devices to a network or the Internet. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Internet is but one example of a network and that the invention may be practiced with other networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","2","302","1","302","2","302","304","1","304","2","304","306","1","308","306","1","1","308","302","1","302","306","1","306","306","1","306","1","308"],"i":["n ","n ","n","d","c","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","2","402","1","402","2","402","404","1","404","2","404","406","1","408","406","1","1","408","402","1","402","406","1","406","1","408","408","2","3","41","1","408","2","410","1","408","408","409","2","410","411","3","412","3","412","1","408","408","413","3","412","1","408","413","411","2","410","409","1","408","411"],"i":["n ","n ","n","d","c","c","c"]},"An alternative embodiment of  described above is where the respective direct links from the drivers to the devices (- to -, - to -) now go through a network.","In , Device  -, Device  -, to Device n -are coupled via links -, -, to -respectively to a Network .

Likewise when a device is removed, the context router may no longer keep open communications with the removed device. A new application will register with the context router, and then it may be used by devices. An application going offline will no longer provide services. What is to be appreciated is that the n-devices to m-services communication is effected through the context router. One embodiment of the invention accomplishes this through the use of emitters, receivers, observers, context rules, context definitions, and context services as is described in more detail below.","For illustrative purposes, the context router  and its connection  are shown as separate from the Network . One of skill in the art will appreciate that in alternative embodiments the context router may be part of a network, such as a network server, a router, etc. The function of the context router  may also be performed by an application running on a machine, for example on a server, a client, a combination of these.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","806","806","808","810"]},"For example, the hardware , stack , and API  may be viewed as a device.

What is to be noted is that services or applications as well as devices may have one or more emitters and\/or receivers. Additionally the emitter(s) and receiver(s) may be combined in a transceiver for bi-directional communication between an application and a device, thus a transceiver would be associated with an application and a device. What is to be appreciated is that communications between devices () and services () are done through the context (). There is not a direct communication between the devices and the services. It is important to understand that the representation of devices and applications within the context are potentially at the same time emitters and receivers. That is, devices and applications may have entries into the context for emitting events and an observer of the context for receiving events. It is not mandatory for a device or an application to be at the same time a receiver and emitter.","In  a device or service may have an emitter which \u201csends\u201d out or emits an event. Now the receivers R associated with an application or device may or may not choose to \u201creceive\u201d the emitted event via the context. If a receiver (or more than one receiver) decides to receive the emitted event then there is, via the Context , an association between the device and the application(s). Thus any event emitted is emitted to the context and any event received always come form the context, therefore everything is done via the context as was earlier noted.","The emitted event has an identifier (ID) which may be sensed by the receiver. The ID may be associated with a particular device, a group of devices, a class of devices, an application, a group of applications or services, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1008","1007","1","1007","2","1007","1009","1","1009","2","1009","1010","1012","1011"],"i":["n ","m"]},"The Definition , in one embodiment of the invention, may define the nature of the context. For example, the Definition  may be static or dynamic varying with, for example, time of day. Thus, the nature of the context may be static or dynamic. The Rules , in one embodiment, may define how to handle events. Services , in one embodiment, may define the characteristic of the context itself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A-11D"},"The application can set up a list of device(s) to be added in the context and therefore will invoke the command to add the corresponding entries into the context.","By definition being an entry into a context, implies that a context observer associated with the entry is added to the list of observer. However, it is possible to only add an observer without having an entry into the context. Another variation is to register the events to be sent by the entry.","The context may have a static event table or a dynamic event table. Depending on some context definition the context may not accept any new event to be received or sent by the entry. In the case of a dynamic table, each time a new event signature is proposed by an entry, the table is modified to add the new event signature to the table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B","FIG. 11C","FIG. 11D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-12C","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A-13F","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13C","FIG. 13D","FIG. 13E","FIG. 13F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A-14H","FIG. 14A","FIG. 14B","FIG. 14C","FIG. 14D","FIG. 14E","FIG. 14F","FIG. 14G","FIG. 14H"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A-15D","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B","FIG. 15C","FIG. 15D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A-16D","FIG. 16A","FIG. 16","FIG. 16C","FIG. 16D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 17A-17G","FIG. 17A","FIG. 17B","FIG. 17C","FIG. 17D","FIG. 17E","FIG. 17F","FIG. 17B","FIG. 17C","FIG. 17G"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 18A-18C","FIG. 18A","FIG. 18B","FIG. 18C"]},"One embodiment of the invention in an application may be as follows. Assume that all the thermostats in a new building complex are capable of sending the current temperature to, and of being set by an external entity (for up to 1 hour). Assume further that the thermostats when plugged in and powered on, registered with a service bureau via their network connection. In one simple example, each of the devices may be associated with the nearest two fire stations. Groups of devices belonging to the same fire stations may be aggregated. Assume now that the thermostats are programmed to send a fire alert event when they sense a temperature over, say 50 deg C. This event if associated with others may then call the fire department, the police, etc. Assume now that we add a context to the event. That is, during the day there are two fire stations operational, however at night, only one is operational. Therefore, based on the time of day, the event may evoke a different response. Calling a closed fire station would be avoided by a proper context. From this simple example several of the aspects of the invention have been illustrated.","Many other embodiments of the invention are possible. For example, continuing the thermostat example, a power company may decide that setting a group of thermostats back 1 degree during a hot summer day may avoid having to purchase peak power at a premium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","1","104","108","1","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"200"},"Referring back to ,  illustrates a network environment  in which the techniques described may be applied. The network environment  has a network  that connects S servers - through -S, and C clients - through -C. As shown, several computer systems in the form of S servers - through -S and C clients - through -C are connected to each other via a network , which may be, for example, a corporate based network. Note that alternatively the network  might be or include one or more of: the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), satellite link, fiber network, cable network, or a combination of these and\/or others. The servers may represent, for example, disk storage systems alone or storage and computing resources. Likewise, the clients may have computing, storage, and viewing capabilities. The method and apparatus described herein may be applied to essentially any type of communicating means or device whether local or remote, such as a LAN, a WAN, a system bus, etc.","Referring back to ,  illustrates a computer system  in block diagram form, which may be representative of any of the clients and\/or servers shown in  as well as devices and apparatus in other Figures. The block diagram is a high level conceptual representation and may be implemented in a variety of ways and by various architectures. Bus system  interconnects a Central Processing Unit (CPU) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , Random Access Memory (RAM) , storage , display , audio, , keyboard , pointer , miscellaneous input\/output (I\/O) devices , and communications . The bus system  may be for example, one or more of such buses as a system bus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Advanced Graphics Port (AGP), Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard number 1394 (FireWire), Universal Serial Bus (USB), etc. The CPU  may be a single, multiple, or even a distributed computing resource. Storage , may be Compact Disc (CD), Digital Versatile Disk (DVD), hard disks (HD), optical disks, tape, flash, memory sticks, video recorders, etc. Display  might be, for example, a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a projection system, Television (TV), etc. Note that depending upon the actual implementation of a computer system, the computer system may include some, all, more, or a rearrangement of components in the block diagram. For example, a thin client might consist of a wireless hand held device that lacks, for example, a traditional keyboard. Thus, many variations on the system of  are possible.","For purposes of discussing and understanding the invention, it is to be understood that various terms are used by those knowledgeable in the art to describe techniques and approaches. Furthermore, in the description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, electrical, and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","Some portions of the description may be presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on, for example, data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others of ordinary skill in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of acts leading to a desired result. The acts are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, can refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission, or display devices.","The invention can be implemented by an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer, selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, hard disks, optical disks, compact disk read only memories (CD-ROMs), and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), electrically programmable read-only memories (EPROM)s, electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), FLASH memories, magnetic or optical cards, etc., or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions either local to the computer or remote to the computer.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method. For example, any of the methods according to the invention can be implemented in hard-wired circuitry, by programming a general-purpose processor, or by any combination of hardware and software. One of ordinary skill in the art will immediately appreciate that the invention can be practiced with computer system configurations other than those described, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, digital signal processing (DSP) devices, set top boxes, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network.","The methods of the invention may be implemented using computer software. If written in a programming language conforming to a recognized standard, sequences of instructions designed to implement the methods can be compiled for execution on a variety of hardware platforms and for interface to a variety of operating systems. In addition, the invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Furthermore, it is common in the art to speak of software, in one form or another (e.g., program, procedure, application, driver, . . . ), as taking an action or causing a result. Such expressions are merely a shorthand way of saying that execution of the software by a computer causes the processor of the computer to perform an action or produce a result.","It is to be understood that various terms and techniques are used by those knowledgeable in the art to describe communications, protocols, applications, implementations, mechanisms, etc. One such technique is the description of an implementation of a technique in terms of an algorithm or mathematical expression. That is, while the technique may be, for example, implemented as executing code on a computer, the expression of that technique may be more aptly and succinctly conveyed and communicated as a formula, algorithm, or mathematical expression. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize a block denoting A+B=C as an additive function whose implementation in hardware and\/or software would take two inputs (A and B) and produce a summation output (C). Thus, the use of formula, algorithm, or mathematical expression as descriptions is to be understood as having a physical embodiment in at least hardware and\/or software (such as a computer system in which the techniques of the invention may be practiced as well as implemented as an embodiment).","An \u201cevent\u201d is understood by one skilled in the art and may be defined as transmitting information to\/from one component to another, or for one component to call a method on another component. Upon reception an event may generates a state change in the receiving component, which by itself may change operation, program flow, etc. (for example, how a posting, filtering, aggregation, error, etc. should be handled).","A machine-readable medium is understood to include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium includes read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.); etc.","Thus, a method and apparatus for associating network devices have been described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","b":["4","5","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A-11D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A-12C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A-13F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A-14H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A-15D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A-16D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A-17G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A-18C"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
