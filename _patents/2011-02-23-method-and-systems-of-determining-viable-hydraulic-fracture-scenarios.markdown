{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","NOTATION AND NOMENCLATURE","Detailed Description"],"p":["None.","The production of hydrocarbons from underground reservoirs is a highly complex operation, from the initial exploration using seismic data to the decisions on how to perform a hydraulic fracture of the formation surrounding a borehole sometime prior to production. This specification focuses on the latter\u2014decisions regarding fracture of the formation (sometimes referred to singularly as a \u201ccompletion\u201d, or plural \u201ccompletions\u201d).","There are host of software tools available to the engineer charged with making decisions regarding completions. However, the software tools are \u201cislands\u201d to themselves, each performing a specific task in the overall series of steps to be performed, but not communicating, or not communicating well, with the software tools used before and\/or after in the overall flow of work. For this reason, the task of selecting a completion for a borehole is a very time consuming task for the engineer. In fact, some experts estimate that around 70% of an engineer's time is spent coordinating data flows between software tools (i.e., gathering, formatting, and translating data for use by disparate software tools).","Thus, any advance which shortens the amount of time needed for an engineer to make a selection regarding completion, provides the engineer with non-intuitive information by way linking of separate software tools, or provides the engineer a broader array of completions from which to make a selection, would provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.","Certain terms are used throughout the following description and claims to refer to particular system components. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, different companies may refer to a component or actions by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components or actions that differ in name but not function.","In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are used in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to . . . .\u201d Also, the term \u201ccouple\u201d or \u201ccouples\u201d is intended to mean either an indirect or direct connection. Thus, if a first device couples to a second device, that connection may be through a direct connection, through an indirect connection via other devices and connections.","The terms \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d are used throughout the specification and claims. Each of the terms \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d refer to executable computer code, groups of executable computer code, or computer code that can become or be used to create execute computer code. Particular components referred to as \u201cprograms\u201d in this specification could equivalently be referred to as \u201csoftware\u201d. Likewise, particular components referred to as \u201csoftware\u201d in this specification could equivalently be referred to as \u201cprograms\u201d. The terminology is adopted merely to help the reader distinguish different computer codes (or groups of computer code).","The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. Although one or more of these embodiments may be preferred, the embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted, or otherwise used, as limiting the scope of the disclosure, including the claims. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to that embodiment.","The various embodiments are directed to software tools which assist an engineer in making decisions regarding which completion to apply to a particular underground formation or portion of an underground formation. More particularly, the various embodiments are directed to methods, systems, and computer-readable media that increase the number of completion scenarios evaluated for a particular underground formation, and which may aid the engineer in selecting the most viable, in some cases economically viable, completion scenario.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112"]},"Fracture planning program  is an application that applies fracture design principles to a set of input data, and thereby creates either a single\u201cschedule\u201d or set of schedules  for a proposed fracture. The fracture planning program  may take input data such as: well log data (e.g., well log data in \u201c.las\u201d format); constituents of a proposed fracture (e.g., fluid type, proppant type); permeability of the formation to be fractured; and\/or fluid efficiency range (i.e., an indication of the volume of fluid used to create or an fracture). Each schedule  is a proposed set of fracture parameters (e.g., volume of fracture fluid, amount of proppant, and flow rate for application of the fracture fluid). In some cases, a single schedule is produced based on a single set of input data, and in other cases the fracture planning program  produces multiple schedules for a single set of input data. The schedules  produced may take any suitable form, such as a text file, a file created using hyper-text markup language (HTML), or a file coded in a predefined schema such as extensible markup language (XML).","In a particular embodiment, the fracture planning program  is based on the software utilized in the FracPac-N brand service available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, Tex. The software code utilized for the FracPac-N brand service has the ability to create multiple schedules  based on selected fluid efficiencies provided in the input data. For example, a user may provide, as part of the input data, both a high and low efficiency range. The software code utilized for the FracPac-N brand service produces three fracture treatment outcomes or schedules  for a given volume of fluid and proppant with a known range: a low efficiency, reduced proppant design (i.e., smaller fracture geometry, reduced proppant placement); a low efficiency, increased proppant design (i.e., smaller fracture geometry, increased proppant placement); and a high efficiency, increased proppant design (i.e., larger fracture geometry, increased proppant placement). In yet other cases, if the high and low efficiency ranges are set equal, three identical schedules  are produced (this is effectively a single schedule from a data standpoint). Other fracture planning programs may be equivalently used.","In accordance with at least some embodiments, the fracture planning program  also calculates data regarding perforations of the casing (e.g., perforation lengths, entry hole diameter). The calculations regarding perforations are based on analytical pressure drop equations. Using the log parameters and formation fluid properties, and applying perforating skin pressure drop principles, enables calculation of a perforating geometry which can be supplied to the inflow performance relationship analysis program . In other embodiments, the perforating geometry can be calculated by other, stand alone, design optimization programs.","The next program in the illustrative system is the stress analysis program . The stress analysis program  is a program that calculates stress in downhole tubulars (e.g., work string tubulars, production tubulars, borehole casing), based on pressure, temperatures and flow rates. More particularly, the stress analysis program  may take as input data regarding the tubulars through which a proposed fracture will take place (e.g., number of tubulars, combined length, and wall thickness). The stress analysis program  produces, for each proposed fracture schedule , an indication  of whether the flows and\/or pressures (in combination with other data, like expected downhole temperatures) of a proposed fracture schedule  exceeds engineering limits of the tubular string. Stated otherwise, the stress analysis program predicts whether the tubing string is capable of handling, without catastrophic failure, the pressures and\/or flow rates for fracturing fluid with respect to a proposed schedule . It follows that if the stress analysis program  predicts a failure with respect to a particular schedule , the schedule is not a viable hydraulic fracture scenario. In some cases, the stress analysis program  takes a single schedule  (along with other data), and produces a single indication  of whether the flows and\/or pressures exceed engineering limits. In such cases, the stress analysis program  may be invoked multiple times to create a set of indications  for a corresponding set of schedules . In other cases, the stress analysis program  may receive multiple schedules  in a single invocation, and thus produce a set of indications  corresponding to each respective schedule in a set of schedules . The indication or set of indications  may take any suitable form, such as a text file, a HTML file, or a XML file. Before proceeding, it is noted that, while illustrative  discusses invocation of programs in a particular order, the order may equivalently change. For example, the stress analysis program may be implemented after the fracture simulation program.","In a particular embodiment, the stress analysis program  is the WELLCAT\u2122 brand program available from Landmark Graphics Corporation of Houston, Tex. The WELLCAT\u2122 brand program is a suite of programs that perform engineering analysis for various phases of the creation of a borehole and production of hydrocarbons from the borehole. One illustrative of the components is the \u201cPROD\u201d design module. The PROD design module simulates fluid and heat transfer during completion, production, stimulation, testing, and well servicing operations. The software enables transient and steady-state analysis for single-phase and multiphase flow. Another of the components within the WELLCAT\u2122 brand program is a component that performs stress analysis for tubulars, known as the \u201cTUBE\u201d design module. The TUBE design module analyzes tubing loads and movements, buckling behavior, and design integrity under complex mechanical, fluid pressure, and thermal loading conditions with standard and automatic load-case generation. The TUBE design model provides linked analyses with the PROD design module. For example, the TUBE design module of the WELLCAT\u2122 brand program takes into account expected downhole temperature along with pressures within the tubulars, and can predict failures such as tubing collapse, buckling, triaxial (von Mises) stress failure, axial stress failure, and yield strength limit failures. Other stress analysis programs may be equivalently used.","The next program in the illustrative system is the fracture simulation program . The fracture simulation program  may take input data such as: rock properties of the formation to be fractured (e.g., Young's Modulus, permeability profile); length and orientation of borehole in the zone where fracturing is to take place; and\/or one more schedules  produced by the fracture planning program . From the data provided, the fracture simulation program simulates or estimates the physical extent and dimensions of each proposed fracture scenario, referred to as \u201cfracture geometry.\u201d That is, the fracture simulation program  may estimate the length, width, and height of fractures created under the conditions proposed in each schedule , and produce output data indicative of the three-dimensional fracture geometry that can be expected. In some cases, the fracture simulation program  takes a single schedule  (along with other data), and produces a fracture geometry . In such cases, the fracture analysis program  may be invoked multiple times to create a set fracture geometries  for a corresponding set of schedules . In other cases, the fracture analysis program  may receive multiple schedules  in a single invocation, and thus produce a set of fracture geometries  corresponding to each respective schedule in a set of schedules . The fracture geometry of set of fracture geometries  may take any suitable form, such as a gridded text file (e.g., a spreadsheet), a HTML file, or an XML file.","In a particular embodiment, the fracture simulation program  is the STIMPLAN\u2122 brand program available from NSI Technologies, Inc. of Tulsa, Okla. Other fracture simulation programs  that may be equivalently used comprise FRACPRO PT\u2122 brand programs available from Carbo Ceramics of Houston, Tex., and the GOHFER\u2122 brand programs available from Barree & Associates, LLC of Houston, Tex.","Inflow performance relationship (IPR) analysis program  is a program that estimates an initial hydrocarbon flow rate at surface condition by taking into account the pressure drop in the total wellbore system from the reservoir to the surface facility. The pressure drop and rate may be influenced by factors such as restrictions to flow created by the tubing string. The IPR analysis program creates an initial hydrocarbon flow value or a set of initial hydrocarbon flow values . The IPR analysis program  may take input data such as: perforation geometry; fracture geometry; proposed casing perforation information; tubing size; and\/or tubing length. Each hydrocarbon flow value  is an estimate of the hydrocarbon flow at the surface (e.g., oil flow, natural gas flow) based on Vertical Lift Performance (VLP) correlations in the program. In some cases, the fracture simulation program  takes a single fracture geometry  (along with other data), and produces a single initial hydrocarbon flow . In such cases, the IPR analysis program  may be invoked multiple times to create a set initial hydrocarbon flows  for a corresponding set of fracture geometries . In other cases, the IPR analysis program  may receive multiple fracture geometries  in a single invocation, and thus produce a set of initial hydrocarbon flow values  corresponding to each respective fracture geometry in a set of fracture geometries . The set of initial hydrocarbon flow values  may take any suitable form, such as text file, a HTML file, or XML file. In a particular case, the IPR analysis program  may enable more direct access to the set of initial hydrocarbon flow values  by way of an application programming interface (API) that enables other programs to \u201creach\u201d directly into IPR analysis program  and extract desired data like the VLP tables and the production operating point.","In a particular embodiment, the IPR analysis program  is Prosper\u2122 brand software available from Petroleum Experts, Ltd. of Edinburg Scotland, UK. Other inflow performance relationship analysis programs that may be equivalently used include: Well Evaluation Model (WEM) software available from P.E. Mosely & Associates, Inc. of Houston, Tex.; Pipesim\u2122 brand software available from Schlumberger Limited of Houston, Tex.; and the Wellflo\u2122 brand software available from Weatherford International Ltd. of Edinburg Scotland, UK.","Numerical reservoir modeling program  is a program that models or estimates time-based hydrocarbon flow from the underground formation (that is, models or estimates hydrocarbon flow over months or years) taking into account initial hydrocarbon multiflow rates, and thus creates either a single time-based hydrocarbon production flow or a set of time-based hydrocarbon production flows . The reservoir modeling program  may take as input data such as: fracture geometries; initial hydrocarbon flows; as well as a reservoir model (e.g., geo-cellular reservoir, structural geological framework, well log data with layer-by-layer formation properties, and\/or formation data from other hydrocarbon producing boreholes in the formation). In some cases, the reservoir modeling program  takes a single fracture geometry , a related initial hydrocarbon flow , and produces a single time-based hydrocarbon production flow . In such cases, the reservoir modeling program  may be invoked multiple times to create a set time-based hydrocarbon production flows  for a corresponding multi-set of fracture geometries  and respective initial hydrocarbon flow rates . In other cases, the reservoir modeling program  may receive multiple fracture geometries  and respective multiple initial hydrocarbon flows  in a single invocation, and thus produce a set of time-based hydrocarbon production flows  corresponding to each respective fracture geometry and initial hydrocarbon flow. The set of time-based hydrocarbon production flows  may take any suitable form, such as text file, a HTML file, or a XML file.","In a particular embodiment, the reservoir modeling program  is the QuikLook\u2122 brand products used by Halliburton Energy Services. Other reservoir simulation programs may be equivalently used, such as the Nexus\u00ae brand software available from Landmark Graphics Corporation, or the ECLIPSE\u2122 brand software available from Schlumberger Limited.","Financial analysis program  analyzes financial viability of a proposed completion taking into account not only the cost of the proposed completion (both in outlay to perform the proposed completion, but also in some cases the time-based considerations (i.e., time value of money)), and thus creates either a single indication of financial viability or a set of indications of financial viability . The financial analysis program  may take input data such as: time-based hydrocarbon production flows ; schedules ; indications of time required for each step of each schedule; cost of each step of each schedule; daily cost of operations surrounding completions (e.g., drilling rig costs, overhead); and\/or predicted hydrocarbon market values over time. In some cases, the financial analysis program  analyzes a single proposed completion (i.e., a single schedule along with a single time-based hydrocarbon production flow), and produces a single indication of financial viability . In such cases, the financial analysis program  may be invoked multiple times to create a set of indications of financial viability  for a corresponding set of schedules  and respective time-based hydrocarbon production flows . In other cases, the financial analysis program  may receive multiple schedules  and respective multiple time-based hydrocarbon production flows  in a single invocation, and thus produce a set of indications of financial viability  corresponding to each respective completion. The set of indications of financial viability  may take any suitable form, such as a gridded text file (e.g., a spreadsheet), a HTML file, or a XML file. In a particular embodiment, the financial analysis program  may be the Excel\u00ae brand software as part of the Microsoft\u00ae Office\u00ae suite of programs, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. The ARIES\u2122 brand program available from Landmark Graphics Corporation is another example of a financial analysis program. Other financial analysis programs may be equivalently used.","In the related art, an engineer responsible for selecting a particular completion to implement separately interfaces with each of the illustrative programs discussed above to arrive at a single completion. However, the interaction, and more particularly the movement of data between programs, is a time consuming task. More particularly, each program - may produce not only the desired information, but also a plethora of additional information that, while useful in some sense, is not necessarily used by the downstream program in the flow of work. For example, the IPR analysis program  may produce significantly more information than just initial hydrocarbon flow(s) at the surface. The IPR analysis program may produce additional data such as pressure drop at each point or node in the flow system, and indications relative concentrations of liquid and entrained gas at each node in the flow system, to name just a few. While such information may be ultimately useful, for purposes of determining or selection a completion to implement, such information is not necessarily needed, for example, such information is not necessarily needed by the financial analysis program . Thus, the engineer previously embarked on the time-consuming task of extracting and formatting information for the next phase of the flow of work. Because of the work involved in extracting and formatting data for movement between the analysis steps, an engineer practicing the related art may only evaluate a small handful of proposed completions (e.g., three).","In accordance with the various embodiments, the tasks associated with invoking each program - and moving data between the programs is handled by management software . In a particular embodiment, the engineer provides or otherwise makes available certain \u201cstatic\u201d data to the programs -, and thereafter the management software  invokes each program, parses data, passes the parsed data to the next program, and invokes automatically the next program. More particularly still, the engineer may provide (as indicated by line ) log data (e.g., log data in \u201c.las\u201d format) and parameters regarding hydraulic fracturing (e.g., fluid type, proppant) to the fracture planning program . The engineer may provide (as indicated by line ) information regarding the tubing string through which the fracturing may take place to the stress analysis program . The engineer may provide (as indicated by line ) the log data to the fracture simulation program . The engineer may provide (as indicated by line ) data regarding the underground formation (e.g., rock type, permeability, hydrocarbon saturation) to the IPR analysis program . The engineer may provide (as indicated by line ) an up-scaled geo-cellular reservoir model to the reservoir modeling program , where the reservoir modeling program  simulates hydrocarbon movement through the reservoir based on the model. The engineer may provide (as indicated by line ) data regarding expected future prices per hydrocarbon unit (e.g., price per barrel, bank interest rate) to the financial analysis program . The various pieces of \u201cstatic\u201d data provided by the engineer are merely illustrative, and other static data may be equivalently provided. For example, other \u201cstatic\u201d parameters the engineer may provide may comprise: permeability of the formation; an indication of permeability anisotropy within the formation; porosity of the formation to be fractured; an indication of water saturation of the formation; Young's modulus for the formation to be fractured; an indication of horizontal stress in the formation; bottom hole pressure; bottom hole temperature; critical draw down (i.e., limits of reservoir pressure minus the reservoir flowing pressure at the wellbore\/reservoir interface pressure drop cause by flow), drainage area of the reservoir; and\/or fracturing fluid characteristics (e.g., non-Newtonian fluid characteristics).","Once static data is provided, the engineer may invoke the management software . The management software  is configured to perform the workflow to evaluate proposed completions, including invoking the various programs - in a desired order, parsing data provided by each program -, and passing parsed data to the next program in the workflow. Still referring to , the management software  may invoke the fracture planning program  to produce the set of schedules . In some cases, the schedules  are produced directly, and in yet other cases the management software  is configured to parse data produced by the fracture planning program  to extract the data to produce the schedules . In cases where the fracture planning program  produces a single schedule, or produces data from which a single schedule  can be extracted, the management software  may invoke the fracture planning program  multiple times to produce a set of schedules .","Management software  may then provide or make available the set of schedules  to the stress analysis program , and then automatically invoke the stress analysis program  to produce the indications or parameters . In some cases, the indications  are produced directly, and in yet other cases the management software  is configured to parse data produced by the stress analysis program  to extract the data to produce the indications . In cases where the stress analysis program  produces a single indication, or produces data from which a single indication can be extracted, the management software  may invoke the stress analysis program  multiple times to produce a set of indications .","Management software  may then provide or make available the set of parameters  to the fracture simulation program , and then invoke the fracture simulation program  to produce the fracture geometries . In a particular embodiment, the management software  may cull from the set of schedules  any schedule whose respective indication  indicates that the schedule has a volume, flow, and\/or pressure that exceeds engineering limits of the tubing string through which the proposed fracture would take place. In some cases, the fracture geometries  are produced directly by the fracture simulation program , and in yet other cases the management software  is configured to parse data produced by the fracture simulation program  to extract the data to produce the fracture geometries . In cases where the fracture simulation program  produces a single fracture geometry, or produces data from which a single fracture geometry can be extracted, the management software  may invoke the fracture simulation program  multiple times to produce a set of fracture geometries .","Management software  may then provide or make available the set of fracture geometries  to the IPR analysis program , and then automatically invoke the IPR analysis program  to produce the initial hydrocarbon flows . In some cases, the initial hydrocarbon flows  are produced directly by the IPR analysis program , and in yet other cases the management software  is configured to parse data produced by the IPR analysis program  to extract the data to produce the initial hydrocarbon flows . In cases where the IPR analysis program  produces a single initial hydrocarbon flow, or produces data from which a single hydrocarbon flow can be extracted, the management software  may invoke the IPR analysis program  multiple times to produce a set of initial hydrocarbon flows .","Management software  may then provide or make available the set of initial hydrocarbon flows , as well as the set of fracture geometries , to the reservoir modeling program , and then invoke the reservoir modeling program  to produce the time-based hydrocarbon production forecasts . In some cases, the time-based hydrocarbon production forecasts  are produced directly by the reservoir modeling program , and in yet other cases the management software  is configured to parse data produced by the reservoir modeling program  to extract the data to produce the time-based hydrocarbon production flows . In cases where the reservoir modeling program  produces a single time-based hydrocarbon production flow, or produces data from which a single time-based hydrocarbon production flow can be extracted, the management software  may invoke the reservoir modeling program  multiple times to produce a set of time-based hydrocarbon production flows .","Management software  may then provide or make available the set of time-based hydrocarbon production forecasts , and then invoke the financial analysis program  to produce the indications or parameters of financial viability . In some cases, the parameters of financial viability  are produced directly by financial analysis program , and in yet other cases the management software  is configured to parse data produced by the financial analysis program  to extract the data to produce the parameters of financial viability . In cases where the financial analysis program  produces a single parameter of financial viability, the management software  may invoke the financial analysis program  multiple times to produce a set of parameters of financial viability .","In some embodiments, the management software  may then provide the parameters of financial viability  to the engineer, from which the engineer can select the completion. Because of the time savings associated with using management software  to coordinate the workflow as between the various programs -, an engineer may be able to evaluate a significantly greater number of possible completions than in cases where some or all of the workflow as between the programs - is manually controlled by the engineer. For example, in the same period of time when only three proposed completions can be evaluated without the assistance of the management software , an engineer may be able to evaluate three thousand (3000) or more proposed completions. It is noted that the \u201cevaluation\u201d need not turn strictly on the proposed completions that have an indication of financial viability, and schedules that propose fracturing parameters that exceed the engineering limits of the tubing (i.e., those schedules rejected based on the parameters  from the stress analysis program ) are still considered evaluated.","In some embodiments, the parameters of financial viability may be indications of net present value (NPV) or net present worth (NPW). Net present value is a numerical value created based on the timing and size of expected capital outlays, and timing and size of income, with each adjusted to \u201cpresent value\u201d (i.e., taking into account the time value of money, though the \u201cpresent\u201d value may be calculated with respect to future date). Thus, for a set of indications of financial viability in the form of net present values, the engineer may select a completion having a more favorable net present value, or a completion whose net present value turns positive earlier in the life of the well. In some cases, the proposed completion with the maximum net present value or earliest positive net present value is selected, but in other cases a completion with a less favorable net present value may be selected (e.g., highest net present value may be from a completion with greater financial risk, like a massive hydraulic fracturing treatment requiring proprietary downhole tools with higher upfront costs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","200","202","206","204","208","210","212","27"]},"Thus, one illustrative parameter of financial viability that may be evaluated is the month at which the net present value becomes positive, with completions having a first positive net present value earlier being more desirable. In other cases, the indication of financial viability that may be evaluated is the highest net present value over the life of the evaluation. Thus, even though a particular completion may result in a later period of time at which the first positive net present value occurs, the long term value of the completion may be higher, and thus may be selected as the completion actually implemented.","In other embodiments, the parameter of financial viability may be an indication of return on investment (ROI) or rate of return (ROR). Return on investment is a numerical value that relates money gained or lost to the amount of money invested. Thus, for a set of parameters of financial viability in the form of return on investment, the engineer may select a completion having a more favorable return on investment. In some cases, the proposed completion with the maximum return on investment is selected, but in other cases a completion with a less favorable net present value may be selected taking into account other, in some cases non-monetary, considerations.","The various embodiments discussed to this point are based on the management software  executing the workflow in an open-loop sense. That is, the workflow is started and proceeds to the end, where the results are presented. However, in yet still further embodiments the management software  may repeat some or all of the workflow to evaluate an objective function. For example, in a particular embodiment the management software  executes the workflow multiple times until a set of parameters of financial viability meet a predetermined criteria. That is, the management software may itself evaluate the parameters of financial viability  and an objective function, and if the parameters do not meet a predetermined criterion, or if enough of the parameters do not meet the predetermined criteria, the management software  may again perform some all of the workflow. In some cases, the management software  may again perform the workflow starting with the fracture planning program , but with an adjusted set of parameters (e.g., different fracturing fluid, different efficiency variables). In other cases, the management software  may resume the workflow at any suitable point, such as the stress analysis program  (e.g., based on changed parameters regarding the tubing string through which the fracturing fluid will be pumped into the borehole). In such cases, the management software  may produce an indication of a single completion being the most favorable, or a small group of proposed completions, while effectively evaluating several thousand possible proposed completions. In a particular embodiment, the management software  is AssetConnect\u2122 brand software available from Landmark Graphics Corporation. The AssetConnect\u2122 brand software can use optimization routines, such as Latin hypercube sampling, optimal Latin hypercube sampling, orthogonal array sampling, and\/or parameter study sampling to help generate and\/or evaluate one or more objective functions to arrive at a single or small group of proposed completions. Other software with similar functionality, and which may be configured to operate as discussed herein, may be equivalently used.","The workflow illustrated by  is implicitly based on a single fracture zone in the borehole, and is presented in the fashion of  to simultaneously show an example workflow, illustrative interactions of the engineer with the various programs, and the interactions of the various programs - with the management software . However, the manner of presentation of illustrative  is not explicit regarding a level of functionality provided in some embodiments. In a particular embodiment, the workflow orchestrated by the management software  includes not only evaluating with respect to a single fracture zone, but also evaluating completion types across multiple fracture zones in the same borehole.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["112","300","100","100","100","302","304","306","302","304","306","112","104","308","310","312","102","104"]},"Based on the fracture geometries , , and , the management software  then invokes the IPR analysis program  to create the initial hydrocarbon flow rate , which in some cases includes both the flow rate for oil, water and gas. In the example situation of , it is assumed that the initial hydrocarbon flow rates from each respective fracture zone affect each other (e.g., a zone with higher producing pressure reduces flow from a zone with lower pressure), and thus a single initial hydrocarbon flow rate  is created that takes into account all three illustrative zones. From there, the management software  invokes the reservoir simulation program  to create the time-based hydrocarbon flow . Here again, it is assumed that hydrocarbon production flows from each respective fracture zone affect each other, and thus a single time-based hydrocarbon forecast  is created that takes into account all three illustrative zones. From there, the management software  invokes the financial analysis program  to create indications of financial viability .","The multiple zone analysis illustrated by  shows repeating some or all the analysis (by way of line ). That is, the analysis for multiple zones may take several iterations, with parameters changing within particular zones. It may be that the best economic set of completions for the overall borehole may involve different types of fracturing in the different zones. For example, because of the interplay of pressure of the various zones feeding a single production tubing, the best economic set of completions may involve more aggressive fracturing for the zones of larger reservoir height, and performing an analysis by way of management software  may reveal such a fact. In the related art, an engineer simply may not have the time to perform the various permutations across multiple fracture zones to enable such a comparison.","As discussed above, some fracture planning programs  have the ability to produce multiple schedules. Embodiments illustrated by  may thus comprise multiple (e.g., three) schedules for each fracture zone. For example, the zone  schedule(s)  may comprise three schedules, the zone  schedule(s)  may comprise three schedules, and the zone  schedule(s)  may comprise three schedules (nine schedules for an illustrative three fracture zones). Each schedule produces a fracture geometry, and thus the various permutations of the fracture geometries may be evaluated by the management software  in a single \u201cloop\u201d, with the number of permutations considered increasing somewhat exponentially if the analysis is repeated. Here again, the number of possible scenarios that may be evaluated by an engineer within a fixed period of time, over the number possible in the manual operation, is enormous. The result is that completions ultimately selected may be combinations an engineer would not have considered trying with a limited amount of time to make the determination.","There are several programs and software packages that interact to enable the various embodiments. In some cases, each program and\/or software executes on its own computer system, such as a server computer system, with the interaction occurring by way of network (e.g., local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), across the Internet). Thus, there may be significant physical distances between the computer systems on which the various tasks are performed. In other cases, two or more programs and\/or software packages may execute on the same computer system. Further still, some or all of the programs and\/or software packages may execute in a \u201ccloud\u201d computing environment, which \u201ccloud\u201d computing environment may be a group of remote server systems which share work load dynamically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406","408","410","412"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506","508"]},"Some optimization algorithms are selected by the user, depending upon the number of parameters. The fracture optimization process is setup with a number of iterations, and the same time a specific object function or multiple object functions are selected such as maximizing net present value while minimizing fracture cost. A series of penalties and correction factors are added to create constraints in the optimization process. The management software will automatically stop when the object functions are maximized (minimized) honoring the constraints and minimizing the penalties function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"600"},"In particular, computer system  comprises a main processor  coupled to a main memory array , and various other peripheral computer system components, through integrated host bridge . The main processor  may be a single processor core device, or a processor implementing multiple processor cores. Furthermore, computer system  may implement multiple main processors . The main processor  couples to the host bridge  by way of a host bus  or the host bridge  may be integrated into the main processor . Thus, the computer system  may implement other bus configurations or bus-bridges in addition to, or in place of, those shown in .","The main memory  couples to the host bridge  through a memory bus . Thus, the host bridge  comprises a memory control unit that controls transactions to the main memory  by asserting control signals for memory accesses. In other embodiments, the main processor  directly implements a memory control unit, and the main memory  may couple directly to the main processor . The main memory  functions as the working memory for the main processor  and comprises a memory device or array of memory devices in which programs, instructions and data are stored. The main memory  may comprise any suitable type of memory such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or any of the various types of DRAM devices such as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) (including double data rate (DDR) SDRAM, double-data-rate two (DDR2) SDRAM, double-data-rate three (DDR3) SDRAM), extended data output DRAM (EDODRAM), or Rambus DRAM (RDRAM). The main memory  is an example of a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing programs and instructions, and other examples are disk drives and flash memory devices.","The illustrative computer system  also comprises a second bridge  that bridges the primary expansion bus  to various secondary expansion buses, such as a low pin count (LPC) bus  and peripheral components interconnect (PCI) bus . Various other secondary expansion buses may be supported by the bridge device . In accordance with some embodiments, the bridge device  comprises an Input\/Output Controller Hub (ICH) manufactured by Intel Corporation, and thus the primary expansion bus  comprises a Hub-link bus, which is a proprietary bus of the Intel Corporation. However, computer system  is not limited to any particular chip set manufacturer, and thus bridge devices and expansion bus protocols from other manufacturers may be equivalently used.","Firmware hub  couples to the bridge device  by way of the LPC bus . The firmware hub  comprises read-only memory (ROM) which contains software programs executable by the main processor . The software programs comprise programs executed during and just after POST.","The computer system  further comprises a network interface card (NIC)  illustratively coupled to the PCI bus . The NIC  acts as to couple the computer system  to a communication network, such the Internet.","Still referring to , computer system  may further comprise a super input\/output (I\/O) controller  coupled to the bridge  by way of the LPC bus . The Super I\/O controller  controls many computer system functions, for example interfacing with various input and output devices such as a keyboard , a pointing device  (e.g., mouse), game controller , various serial ports, floppy drives and hard disk drives (HD) . The hard disk drive  is another example of a computer-readable media. In other cases, the hard disk drive  may couple to a separate drive controller coupled to a more powerful expansion bus, such as the PCI bus , particularly in cases where the hard disk drive is implemented as an array of drives (e.g., redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID)). In cases where the computer system  is a server computer system, the keyboard , pointing device  and game controller  may be omitted.","The computer system  further comprises a graphics processing unit (GPU)  coupled to the host bridge  by way of bus , such as a PCI Express (PCI-E) bus or Advanced Graphics Processing (AGP) bus. Other bus systems, including after-developed bus systems, may be equivalently used. Moreover, the graphics processing unit  may alternatively couple to the primary expansion bus , or one of the secondary expansion buses (e.g., PCI bus ). The graphics processing unit  couples to a display system  which may comprise any suitable electronic display device or multiple distinct display devices, upon which any image or text can be displayed. The graphics processing unit  comprises an onboard processor , as well as onboard memory . The processor  may thus perform graphics processing, as commanded by the main processor . Moreover, the memory  may be significant, on the order of several hundred gigabytes or more. Thus, once commanded by the main processor , the graphics processing unit  may perform significant calculations regarding graphics to be displayed on the display system, and ultimately display such graphics, without further input or assistance of the main processor . In some case, such as the computer system  operated as server computer system, the graphics processing unit  and display system  may be omitted.","From the description provided herein, those skilled in the art are readily able to combine software created as described with appropriate general-purpose or special-purpose computer hardware to create a computer system and\/or computer sub-components in accordance with the various embodiments, to create a computer system and\/or computer sub-components for carrying out the methods of the various embodiments, and\/or to create a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (i.e., other than an signal traveling along a conductor or carrier wave) for storing a software program to implement the method aspects of the various embodiments.","The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention.
