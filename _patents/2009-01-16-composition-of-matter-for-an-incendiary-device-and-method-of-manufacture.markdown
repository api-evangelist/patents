It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description.

Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.","It has been determined that the absence of a binder in the conventional formulations described in Tables 1 and 2 contributes to the cold functioning problems experienced. Without a binder, rough handling and temperature cycling causes the grain of the composition to crack. This cracking results in a larger surface area for the reaction to occur. When the reaction rate becomes too great, the munition can explode; potentially injuring those in the area. Another reason for the cold weather failures is the method utilized for consolidating the conventional final increment. By creating a surface profile containing sharp edges, the ignition stimulus is better focused resulting in a more reliable ignition transfer.","The embodiments herein provide a barium nitrate free thermate formulation which is provided in Table 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Barium nitrate free thermate formulation"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Component","Parts by weight %"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Strontium Nitrate Gr A","20.59"]},{"entry":[{},"Black Iron Oxide Gr B ","48.04"]},{"entry":[{},"Aluminum Gr D Cl 5","17.57"]},{"entry":[{},"Aluminum Gr E Cl 6","9.88"]},{"entry":[{},"Sulfur Gr E","1.96"]},{"entry":[{},"Polyacrylic Rubber","1.96"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The addition of a binder to the formulation helps to maintain the grain integrity of the composition during temperature cycling as well as increase overall durability of the item.

The embodiments herein aid in enhancing the AN-M14 grenade performance as well as lowering overall toxicity. The performance is enhanced by the addition of a polyacrylic rubber binder as well as by using a ram profile with sharp edges  during consolidation for increased ignition transfer. The consolidation process occurs as follows: the first two increments are placed in a consolidation device  (e.g., sharp-edged ram) and contain 250 grams of the thermate. The first two increments are consolidated using a flat faced ram (not shown). All increments are consolidated under a force of 15,000 pounds dead load with a dwell time of approximately five seconds. The third increment contains 200 grams of thermate followed by twenty grams of ignition composition. The thermate and ignition compositions are pressed in a single increment in an effort to increase the intimacy of contact thereby increasing the reliability of ignition transfer.","The sharp edges  of the ram  reduce the cross-sectional contact area thereby reducing the rate at which heat can be conducted away from the ignition site. Less heat conduction away from the ignition site results in an increased temperature and therefore increases the likelihood of ignition transfer.","The embodiments herein remove barium nitrate from the thermate composition and remove lead from the ignition composition.
