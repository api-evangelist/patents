{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Web browsers are increasingly used as platforms for two-way client-server and peer-to-peer architecture communications, both in traditional electronic documents and increasingly in audio-video communications. Such communications may use layered Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) employing a variety of protocol stacks, e.g., Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Data Protocol (UDP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\/Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), WebSocket (WS), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), etc.","When a link containing a conventional URI is clicked, browsers are instructed to retrieve the representation of the resource at the URI. However, layered URIs may be problematic for certain web applications. For example, a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) webpage may contain the following multi-level URI in a link according to the following code: <a href=http:\/\/xmpp:bob@example.com\/camera> This is my camera<\/a>. The first level of this URI is an HTTP level and the second level is an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) level. If the executing browser does not inherently support XMPP, when the link is clicked the browser may not recognize the referenced authority \u201cxmpp:bob@example.com\u201d, e.g., because the XMPP library is defined in JavaScript. Consequently, the browser may not know the association between the authority and the XMPP library. Browsers generally cannot submit forms to URIs without knowing how to contact the authority of the URI. As the result, HTTP requests may not be invokable from built-in HTML interactions existing in the browser. Rather, web applications may have to write their own code to handle all such URIs in HTML pages, e.g., to dereference URI and submit forms. This may create an extra burden on developers for using protocol bindings.","The various communications protocol stacks are generally hidden from web applications, as no standardized JavaScript Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are defined for them. It has historically been resource prohibitive for web browsers to support all such combinations concurrently. Consequently, web developers have generally had to either (a) wait for browsers to implement support for such protocols (which may lead to increased web browser footprints), or (b) write JavaScript to take over hyperlink interactions from the web browsers (which may increase JavaScript size and thereby reduces performance). The ability to use a layered URI may provide certain flexibility to web developers, e.g., by permitting innovation while avoiding interoperability problems.","In one aspect, the disclosure includes an apparatus comprising a processor configured to compose a plurality of protocol stacks, and dereference a layered URI using at least one of the plurality of protocol stacks.","In another aspect, the disclosure includes a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions stored on a non-transitory medium that when executed by a processor cause the processor to receive a layered URI, and call a URI dereference extension, wherein the dereference extension is configured to construct a protocol stack, wherein the protocol stack comprises a first connector, a second connector, and a binder, and wherein the first and second connectors are selected from a plurality of connectors based on the URI.","In yet another aspect, the disclosure includes a method for dereferencing layered URIs, comprising receiving a layered URI at a user agent, calling a URI dereference extension, constructing a protocol stack using the URI dereference extension, wherein the protocol stack comprises a first connector, a second connector, and a binder, wherein the first connector and the second connector are instantiated based on the URI, and wherein the binder is instantiated based on the first connector and the second connector, dereferencing the URI with the URI dereference extension, and changing at least one state of the user agent using the dereferenced URI.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","The disclosure describes systems and methods to permit web applications to dynamically dereference layered URIs in web browsers using JavaScript without pre-composed protocol stacks, e.g., by permitting web browsers to dynamically assemble protocol stacks from the JavaScript to access the resources identified by the layered URIs. Using the disclosed systems and methods may reduce the web browser footprint, since only core transport stacks require implementation; may reduce JavaScript code size, since only message formatting is required; may improve interoperability and performance, since web applications may mix and match protocols at runtime; and may permit web applications to experiment with new protocols and architectures using JavaScript without changing browsers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 7"],"b":["100","100","102","102","104","100","100","110","112","110","100","100","700","110","112","110","100","112","112","112","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","112","200","202","204","206","202","206","204","200","208","208","200","208","200","202","206","204","208","202","204","204","206","204","202","202","200"]},"Connectors and binders may be created and registered with a user agent using JavaScript. Techniques for creating and registering connectors and binders may be apparent to those of skill in the art, and may be used separately or in connection with other known techniques. For example, one JavaScript snippet may contain an instruction to get an HTTP connector, e.g., connector  of , from a user agent, e.g., a browser, e.g., var connector1=new HTTPConnector( ). Another snippet may contain an instruction to implement a second connector, e.g., connector  of , namely, by creating a new XMPP client with an XMPP library, e.g., loaded into the browser by a remote web server, e.g., var xmpp=new XMPP (\u201ctalk.google.com\u201d). Another snippet may contain an instruction for creating a connector for XMPP in JavaScript, e.g., var connector2=new Connector (XMPP). Yet another snippet may contain instructions to implement a third connector, e.g., connector  of , namely, by creating a WS from a user agent, e.g., var socket=new websocket( . . . ), and by creating a connector for the WS in JavaScript, e.g., var connector3=new Connector(socket). Still another snippet may contain an instruction for creating and implementing a first binder, e.g., binder  of , for binding the second and third connectors, e.g., var binder12=new Binder(connector2, connector3). Another snippet may contain an instruction for implementing a fourth connector, e.g., second complex connector  of , comprising the first binder, e.g., var connector12=new Connector(binder12). Yet another snippet may contain instructions for creating and implementing a second binder, e.g., binder  of , e.g., var binder01=new Binder(connector0, connector12), and a new connector, e.g., first complex connector  of , e.g., var connector01=new Connector(binder01). Still another snippet may contain an instruction for informing the user agent of the HTTP\/XMPP connector, e.g., Connectors.register(\u201chttp\/xmpp\u201d, connector01). Since the Connector objects are exchanged between the user agent and User JavaScript, the Connector interface should be agreed upon by all browsers and all web applications. For this reason, standardization may be desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","300","1","2","202","206","208","300","1","2","300","1","2","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","402","404","406","408","202","410","204","412","412","400","412","414","416","418","400","414","418","408","406","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","501","100","102","400","402","404","202","204","406","408","510","512","514","516"]},"As stated under , XMPP generally requires an underlying two-way communication protocol. Consequently, although not explicitly set out in the URI, XMPP may establish the needed two-way connection using WS; other embodiments may employ alternate protocols. Thus, at block  an XMPP stanza may be passed by the XMPP connector to the XMPP\/WS binder of block , which at block  sends a WS message to the WS connector of block . The WS connector of block  may pass a WS message at block  to a receiving user having a correspondingly constructed URI dereference extension. Upon receipt of the WS message, the XMPP\/WS binder of block  may extract the XMPP stanza of block  from the WS message and send it to the XMPP connector of block . Similarly, the XMPP connector may extract the HTTP\/XMPP stanza of block  from the XMPP stanza of block  and may pass the HTTP\/XMPP stanza to the HTTP\/XMPP binder of block . The HTTP\/XMPP binder may send the HTTP response of block  to the HTTP connector of block . The HTTP connector may process the HTTP response and may send the payload data of block  to the URI dereference extension of block .
