U.S.C. \u00a7371 of International Application PCT\/JP2010\/068060, filed Oct. 14, 2010, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-239729, filed Oct. 16, 2009 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-239789, filed Oct. 16, 2009. The International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in a language other than English.","The present invention relates to a semiconductive composition having low hardness and exhibiting low-resistant ionic conductivity, which is used in electrophotographic equipment applications and the like, and a crosslinked rubber product obtained by vulcanizing the same composition.","An epichlorohydrin-based rubber material has widely been used as parts of office automation apparatuses by making use of specific ionic conductivity thereof. Further a reduction in resistance and a reduction in hardness have been required to parts of office automation apparatus. Electrophotographic equipment applications will be described below as an example of a semiconductive member. However, applications of the present invention are not limited only to electrophotographic equipment applications.","In image forming apparatuses such as electrophotographic equipments, a direct contact charging system has recently employed as a means to charge a surface of a body to be charged of a photoreceptor, a dielectric or the like. In the direct contact charging system, a surface of a body to be charged is charged by directly bringing a charged member applied with voltage into contact with the surface of a body to be charged. The charged member to be generally used is a roller in which a semiconductive elastic body layer is formed on an axis of a mandrel made of metal or the like.","It have hitherto been known, as a method for forming a semiconductive elastic body layer, a method in which an electronic conducting semiconductive composition having semiconductivity by blending conductive particles such as carbon black, and a crosslinked rubber product are used, and a method in which a polar rubber per se having semiconductivity, such as an epichlorohydrin rubber or a nitrilebutadiene rubber is used (see Patent Document 1).","In the method in which a semiconductive composition using a polar rubber having semiconductivity, and a crosslinked rubber product are used, there is known, as a technique to cope with a reduction in hardness, a method in which a liquid rubber is blended so as to reduce hardness (see Patent Document 2).","However, in the method in which an electronic conducting semiconductive crosslinked rubber product having semiconductivity by blending conductive particles such as carbon black is used, it is difficult to control the hardness of a rubber composition. Also in the method in which a polar rubber per se having semiconductivity is used, there are requirements for further reductions in resistance and hardness. Thus, a problem to be solved is that it is difficult to reconcile both requirements and design freedom is low.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent Document 1: JP-A-2000-063656","Patent Document 2: JP-A-2005-148467"]}},"An object of the present invention is to reconcile low hardness and low resistance by blending an ion-conductive polar rubber with various additives.","The present inventors have intensively studied about the above problems and found that it is possible to reconcile low hardness and low resistance of a crosslinked rubber product by blending an epichlorohydrin-based rubber with an ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate and vulcanizing the obtained blend using at least one kind of a crosslinking agent selected from the group consisting of a sulfur-based crosslinking agent, a quinoxaline-based crosslinking agent and a triazine-based crosslinking agent.

comparative examples shown in Tables 4 and 5 are crosslinked products obtained by blending an epichlorohydrin-based rubber with only a crosslinking agent. The crosslinked products obtained by blending with the ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate of the examples were crosslinked rubbers with low resistance value and low hardness as compared with the crosslinked products obtained by blending with no ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate of the comparative examples.","The examples and comparative Examples described in Tables 6 and 7 are crosslinked products obtained by blending an epichlorohydrin-based rubber with fillers which are generally used in the relevant applications. The crosslinked products obtained by blending with the ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate of the example were crosslinked rubbers with low resistance value and low hardness as compared with the crosslinked product obtained by blending with no ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate of the comparative examples, or obtained by blending with a liquid NBR. In Comparative Example 15 subjected to peroxide crosslinking, the crosslinked product could not be evaluated since it was brittle in case of removing from a mold at the time of crosslinking.","In Examples 15 to 18 described in Tables 8 and 9, the environment dependency of the crosslinked products obtained by blending the ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate of the present invention is evaluated. When a small number of ethylene oxide units of the ethylene oxide-modified (meth)acrylate are included (for example, the number of ethylene oxide units is from 6 to 16), the environment dependency decreases, and therefore it is more preferable.","The crosslinked rubber product of the present invention can be widely applied in the field where semiconductive rubber parts are usually used. For example, the crosslinked rubber product is useful as a charge roll, transfer roll, development roll and rubber blade for electrophotographic equipment."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
