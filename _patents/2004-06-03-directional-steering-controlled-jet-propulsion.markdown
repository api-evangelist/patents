title: Directional steering controlled jet propulsion
abstract: An elongated fluid dynamic water jet type of propulsion body receives an inflow of fluid through inlet openings for entry into a jet propulsor from which an outlet jet emerges for passage through an internal transition passage to an exit end between two pairs of horizontal flaps hinged to the body at the exit end for angular displacement about parallel spaced horizontal axes from horizontal neutral positions. Four pair of flaps are pivotally mounted within the transition passage for angular displacement about parallel spaced vertical axes from neutral positions. Actuators inside of the propulsion body connected to the flaps are selectively controlled to impart in-phase angular displacement to all of the flaps about their horizontal and vertical axes from the neutral positions for directional steering by angular deflection of the jet exit outflow from the exit end of the body. To reverse propulsion, only the actuators for the horizontal flaps are activated in an out-of-phase mode to effect angular displacement of each pair of the horizontal flaps in opposite directions into engagement with each other thereby blocking jet outflow from the exit end of the body causing a directional reversal of the propulsion jet by outflow from openings formed in the body rearwardly of the exit end.

Control linkages for such directional control devices located outside the vehicle undergoing jet propulsion were vulnerable to damage and constituted a serious source of drag, especially where the vehicle is of a submersible type. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for water jet propulsion with directional steering and reversing controls, which avoids the damage vulnerability and drag problems heretofore experienced.","Pursuant to the present invention a water jet propulsion vehicle has an aft convergent body section within which one transition passage is formed terminated at an exit end from which forward propulsion jets emerge during overflow while fluid inflow is received through inlets formed in the vehicle body forwardly of the convergent aft section. The propulsion jets emerging at the exit end are under directional steering control of horizontal flaps hinged to the vehicle body at the exit end for adjusted angular displacement under internal in-phase steering control about parallel spaced horizontal axes of the vehicle body. Such steering control also involves in-phase angular displacement of vertical flaps about parallel spaced vertical axes within the transition passage in the convergent aft body section. Directional reversal of propulsion is effected by exclusive out-of-phase angular displacement of the horizontal flaps under internal control into end contact with each other so as to block jet outflow from the exit end of the vehicle body thereby forcing jet outflow through outlets formed axially between the exit end and the inlets.","Referring now to the drawing in detail, ,  and  illustrate an axially elongated water jet propulsion vehicle  which may for example be hydrodynamically integrated with a seawater hull for propulsion thereof. The vehicle  has a bow end  from which a cross-sectionally cylindrical body section  extends to a cross-sectionally converging conical section  terminating at a rectangular exit end  from which propulsion jets emerge. Four water inflow inlet openings  are formed in the cylindrical section  of the body , located in angularly spaced relation to each other about a central axis  of the body . Cross-sectionally circular ducts  extend inwardly into the body  from each of the four inlets  to direct inflow of water to an assembly of propulsors  from which the propulsion jets exit into a one transition passage  within a cross-sectionally rectangular duct  so as to emerge from the exit end  of the body  for propulsion thereof. Pursuant to the present invention the propulsion exit jets emerging from the transition passage  at the body exit end  are directionally controlled vertically by vertically spaced upper and lower pairs of horizontal flaps , pivoted by actuators  about parallel spaced horizontal axes established through hinges  at the body end . As shown in , the hinges  are fixed to the cross-sectionally rectangular duct  through which parallel spaced fins  externally project. Positioned within the duct passage  as shown in  are four horizontally aligned gear box actuators  through which four pair of vertically aligned flaps  are simultaneously rotated about four parallel spaced vertical axes extending through the transition passage  in the duct  to directionally control exiting of the propulsion jets horizontally from the duct passage .","Referring now to , A, B,  and A, the two pairs of the horizontal flaps  and the four vertical flaps  are respectively angularly adjusted in phase about their two horizontal axes and their four vertical axes between \u221245\u00b0 and +45\u00b0 from neutral positions in alignment with their horizontal or vertical axes, in order to correspondingly directionally change exit flow of the propulsion jets from the end  of the body . Thus,  respectively illustrate the flaps  and  in their neutral positions while  respectively illustrate the flaps  and  angularly displaced in phase in the same angular direction from their neutral positions to correspondingly change the direction of propulsion both horizontally and vertically for full steering of the body .","In addition the foregoing referred to adjustments of propulsion jets exiting from the body  for forward propulsion thereof, reverse propulsion of the body  may be induced by out-of-phase angular displacement of each pair of the horizontal flaps  from their neutral positions to positions with their outer ends in contract with each other as shown in . Forward directional outflow of the propulsion jets are thereby blocked. As shown in , A and B, such directionally controlled angular adjustments of the horizontal flaps  is effected through the actuators  pivotally connected to the inner ends of the horizontal flaps .","As diagrammed in , a directional controlling power supply system  is associated with the gear box actuators  for the vertical flaps  and the actuators  for the horizontal flaps . The actuators  and  are thereby selectively energized to effect the angular adjustments of the flaps  and  in the horizontal and vertical directions for forward steering control and for reverse directional control as hereinbefore described. The flaps  and , the actuators  and  and the dimensional relationships between such components may be varied to meet different propulsion requirements associated with the body .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 3"],"b":["6","6","7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6"],"b":["8","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 1\u20137"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
