The government has certain rights in the invention.","This application contains, as a separate part of the disclosure, a Sequence Listing in computer-readable form (filename: 45409A_SeqListing.txt; created May 24, 2011, 16,592 bytes\u2014ASCII text file) which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates to methods of treating lipocalin 13-related conditions such as metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.","Insulin controls glucose homeostasis by both suppressing hepatic glucose production and stimulating glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Impaired insulin action (insulin resistance) contributes to multiple metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance is not only a hallmark but also a determinant of type 2 diabetes.","Obesity is the primary risk factor for insulin resistance. Multiple factors contribute to insulin resistance. Abnormal lipid accumulation impairs insulin action in skeletal muscle and livers, thereby contributing to systemic insulin resistance in obesity. Obesity is associated with chronic, low grade inflammation that also contributes to insulin resistance. Additionally, adipocytes secrete a variety of polypeptides, collectively called adipokines, which regulate insulin sensitivity. Many proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines have been documented to regulate insulin sensitivity.","Hepatic lipid levels are determined by several physiological processes, including lipogenesis, fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation, lipid uptake, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. These processes are tightly controlled by metabolites and metabolic hormones, and aberrant regulation results in hepatic steatosis, leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and liver failure.","The liver is the key organ for the maintenance of lipid homeostasis. During the fed state, glucose is taken up by hepatocytes and converted to fatty acids and triacylglycerols that are exported via VLDL to extrahepatic tissues. During the fasted state, fatty acids are oxidized to generate ATP and ketone bodies. Ketone bodies, a metabolic fuel, are exported to extrahepatic tissues. Hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation are precisely regulated by metabolic hormones, including insulin and glucagon.","A major therapeutic goal in treating type 2 diabetes is to improve insulin sensitivity. It is extremely important to identify molecules that sensitize insulin action. Moreover, obesity is an important risk factor for NAFLD. Thus, there exists in the art a need for improved methods of treating and preventing metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.","In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method of treating a lipocalin 13 (LCN13)-related condition comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a lipocalin or a physiologically active fragment thereof.","In various aspects, the lipocalin is a protein with a sequence at least 45% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 50% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 55% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 50% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 60% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 65% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 70% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 75% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 80% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 85% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 90% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, is at least 95% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 96% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 97% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 98% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1, or at least 99% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1.","In other aspects, the lipocalin is a protein with a sequence at least 45% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 50% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 55% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 50% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 60% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 65% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 70% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 75% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 80% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 85% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 90% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 96% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 97% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, at least 98% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1.","In another aspect of the method, the lipocalin has the amino acid sequence set out in SEQ ID No: 1.","In another aspect of the method, the lipocalin is selected from the group consisting of LCN1 (SEQ ID NO: 30), LCN3 (SEQ ID NO: 31), LCN4 (SEQ ID NO: 32), LCN14 (SEQ ID NO: 33), OBP2B (SEQ ID NO: 34), and OBP2A (SEQ ID NO: 35).

The diverse lipocalin super-family members share a relatively low level of homology in amino acid sequences; however, their tertiary structures are highly conserved, containing a characteristic \u03b2-barrel at the center. Lipocalins bind via this central cavity to small lipophilic molecules, including fatty acids, retinol, steroids, odorants, and pheromones. Thus, lipocalins are predicted to act as carriers to regulate the transportation, stability, release, and activity of these small bioactive molecules. Additionally, several lipocalins may bind to their cognate receptors and directly stimulate cellular responses.","Several lipocalin family members appear to be involved in the regulation of insulin action. For instance, the levels of retinol-binding protein (RBP)4, a lipocalin family member, are increased in obesity. RBP4 promotes insulin resistance. Lipocalin 2 also induces insulin resistance, and major urinary protein 1 (MUP1), a lipocalin family membrane primarily expressed in hepatocytes, improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in mice. MUP1 overexpression markedly improves hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in mice with type 2 diabetes.","In a search for additional lipocalins that may regulate insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, gene expression patterns in the livers of db\/db mice were profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. As shown herein, lipocalin-13 (LCN13) was identified as a potential candidate. The LCN13 gene was initially identified by its genomic location in the epididymal lipocalin cluster in mouse chromosome 2. Based on its predicted amino acid sequences, LCN13 belongs to the lipocalin super-family. The LCN13 gene contains 7 exons and is predicted to encode 176 amino acids with a putative N-terminal signal peptide (1-18 amino acids). Prior to the instant disclosure, LCN13 protein had not been demonstrated in cells or animals, and an LCN13 function was unknown.","LCN13 appears to target multiple cell types, including adipocytes and hepatocytes. In the absence of insulin, LCN13 increases basal glucose uptake in adipocytes (after 6 h treatments) and suppresses glucose production in hepatocytes, suggesting that LCN13 is able to regulate glucose metabolism. Two isoforms of LCN13 were detected in both cells and the bloodstream and methods provided herein contemplate use of either isoform or both isoforms. LCN13 shares a high similarity in amino acids with several other lipocalin family members, including LCN1 (58%), LCN3 (58%), LCN4 (54%) LCN14 (71%), odorant binding protein (OBP) 2B (67%), and OBP2A (60%).","LCN13 protein is secreted into the bloodstream by multiple cell types, and circulating LCN13 is markedly reduced in obese animals. Restoration of circulating LCN13 levels improves hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetes.","Methods provided thus include those wherein the lipocalin to be administered is at least 45% similar, at least 50% similar, at least 55% similar, at least 60% similar, at least 65% similar, at least 70% similar, at least 75% similar, at least 80% similar, at least 85% similar, at least 90% similar, at least 95% similar, at least 96% similar, at least 97% similar, at least 98% similar, or at least 99% similar to SEQ ID NO: 1.

For example, the lipocalin (e.g., LCN13, LCN1, LCN3, LCN4, LCN14, OBP2B, and OBP2A) in one aspect is derived from cells that express the endogenous lipocalin. Alternatively, the source of the lipocalin or fragment thereof is derived from cells that are transformed with a nucleic acid vector that encodes a lipocalin or a precursor thereof, and are in various aspects mammalian cells, bacterial cells, yeast cells, insect cells, whole organisms, or other cells that are a useful source recombinant protein.","Thus isolated DNA and\/or recombinant vectors that encode a recombinant lipocalin protein and control sequences that direct protein expression in bacterial, mammalian or insect cells are provided. In some cases it is desirable that the recombinant lipocalin coding sequence be fused with an additional amino acid sequence that can, without limitation, facilitate recombinant protein purification. For example, in one aspect, expressed lipocalin protein is expressed as a fusion protein that includes one or more histidine tags, glutathione S-transferase (GST) sequences, maltose binding protein (MBP) sequences, Flag sequences and\/or myc tagged RGT sequences. These additional sequences which aid in purification of the recombinant protein are optionally removed by protease cleavage.","LCN13-Related Conditions","Methods provided are utilized for the treatment of any condition that can be alleviated by administration of a lipocalin protein or biologically active fragment. In some aspects of methods provided, the LCN13-related condition is a metabolic disorder. Exemplary metabolic disorders considered LCN13-related conditions include, but are not limited to, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and obesity. In other aspects, the LCN13-related condition is a cardiovascular disease. Exemplary cardiovascular diseases considered LCN13-related conditions include, but are not limited to, hypercholesterolemia, non-familial hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, a risk of developing atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, a history of coronary heart disease, early onset coronary heart disease, one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperfattyacidemia, hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the administered agents.","Besides those representative lipocalin dosage forms described herein, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers are generally known to those skilled in the art and are thus included in the instant invention. Such excipients and carriers are described, for example, in \u201cRemingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a lipocalin for use in accordance with the present invention are formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of a therapeutic composition into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.

Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.","When a therapeutically effective amount of a lipocalin composition is administered by e.g., intradermal, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, the composition is, in one aspect, in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable protein or polynucleotide solutions, having due regard to pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art.

Such penetrants are generally known in the art.","The lipocalin formulations are, in certain aspects, designed to be short-acting, fast-releasing, long-acting, or sustained-releasing as described below. Thus, one type of pharmaceutical formulations is formulated for controlled release or for slow release. The instant lipocalin compositions, in other aspects, comprise, for example, micelles or liposomes, or some other encapsulated form, or may be administered in an extended release form to provide a prolonged storage and\/or delivery effect. Therefore, the pharmaceutical lipocalin formulations are optionally compressed into pellets or cylinders and implanted intramuscularly or subcutaneously as depot injections or as implants such as stents. Such implants may employ known inert materials such as silicones and biodegradable polymers.","For oral administration, the compositions can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art.

Specifically contemplated are methods including intravenous administration.","Treatment in a method provided, in various aspects, consists of a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period of time. Administration of the lipocalin is systemic or local, and may comprise a single site injection or infusion of a therapeutically-effective amount of the lipocalin protein composition. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the therapeutic lipocalin composition is delivered to the patient at multiple sites. Multiple administrations are rendered simultaneously or administered over a period of time. Also contemplated is additional therapy wherein a lipocalin is administered on a period basis, for example, daily, weekly, or monthly.","In certain embodiments, parenteral administration of the therapeutic compounds is carried out with an initial bolus followed by continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic circulating levels of drug product. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily optimize effective dosages and administration regimens as determined by good medical practice and the clinical condition of the individual patient. Methods provided include those wherein the lipocalin is administered orally and by injection. In methods wherein the lipocalin is injected, the injection is intravenous or subcutaneous. In certain aspects, injection is with a depot forming composition, and in embodiments including depot formation, the depot forming composition is administered by implanting a suitable delivery device in the patient. In one aspect, the delivery device is implanted subcutaneously, and in certain aspects, the delivery device is a pump.","The frequency of dosing will depend on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the lipocalin and the routes of administration. Depending on the route of administration, a suitable dose is calculated according to body weight, body surface areas or organ size. The availability of animal models is particularly useful in facilitating a determination of appropriate dosages of a given therapeutic.","Further refinement of the calculations necessary to determine the appropriate treatment dose is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. The final dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician, considering factors which modify the action of the lipocalin, e.g., the specific activity, the responsiveness of the patient, the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of any condition, time of administration, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired, and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment for specific diseases and conditions.","In certain embodiments, the lipocalin is administered alone, in other embodiments the lipocalin is administered in conjunction with other therapeutics directed to the target condition or directed to other symptoms thereof. Dosage levels of the order from about 0.01 mg to 30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, for example from about 0.1 mg to 10 mg\/kg.","Unit dosages of a lipocalin are also provided. \u201cUnit dose\u201d is defined as a discrete amount of a therapeutic composition dispersed in a suitable carrier.","It will be appreciated that the lipocalin and treatment methods provided are useful in fields of human medicine and veterinary medicine. Thus, the subject to be treated is a mammal, such as a human or other mammalian animal. For veterinary purposes, subjects include for example, farm animals including cows, sheep, pigs, horses and goats, companion animals such as dogs and cats, exotic and\/or zoo animals, laboratory animals including mice rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters; and poultry such as chickens, turkey ducks and geese. The patient being treated is of any age, for example, between the ages of 10-50 years, age 20 or less, or age 10 or less.","In addition, it is contemplated that the lipocalins of the present invention are used in combination with any present treatments for LCN13-related disorders. For example, in certain embodiments, it is contemplated that the methods of the invention are useful in combination with known metabolic disorder, cardiovascular disorder and\/or elevated lipid disorder therapy. Compositions comprising a lipocalin, or a fragment are administered before, after or during such therapy.","Combination Therapy","In order to increase the effectiveness of a treatment with the lipocalin compositions provided, it is in one aspect desirable to combine these compositions with other therapies effective in the treatment of specific diseases or conditions.","In some cases, the compositions of the present invention precede or follow the other agent treatment by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. It is contemplated that one administers both modalities within about 12-24 h of each other or within about 6-12 h of each other. In some situations, it is desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly, where several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations.","In certain specific instances lipocalin compositions are administered in combination with a second agent to prevent or treat a metabolic disorder or to prevent or treat a cardiovascular disease. For examples, agents that are useful in combination therapies include, but are not limited to, blood sugar-lowering agents (i.e., agents that lower blood sugar) or lipid-lowering agents (i.e., agents that reduce lipid levels).","Blood Sugar-Lowering Agents","Currently, there are various pharmacological approaches for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. They act via different modes of action: 1) sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, glisentide, sulfonylurea, AY31637) essentially stimulate insulin secretion; 2) biguanides (e.g., metformin) act by promoting glucose utilization, reducing hepatic glucose production and diminishing intestinal glucose output; 3) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose, miglitol) slow down carbohydrate digestion and consequently absorption from the gut and reduce postprandial hyperglycemia; 4) thiazol-idinediones (e.g., troglitazone, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, glipizide, balaglitazone, rivoglitazone, netoglitazone, troglitazone, englitazone, AD 5075, T 174, YM 268, R 102380, NC 2100, NIP 223, NIP 221, MK 0767, ciglitazone, adaglitazone, CLX 0921, darglitazone, CP 92768, BM 152054) enhance insulin action, thus promoting glucose utilization in peripheral tissues; 5) glucagon-like-peptides and agonists (e.g. exendin) or stabilizers thereof (e.g. DPP4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin) potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; and 6) insulin or analogues thereof (e.g. LANTUS\u00ae) stimulate tissue glucose utilization and inhibits hepatic glucose output. The above mentioned pharmacological approaches may be utilized individually or in combination therapy.","Lipid-Lowering Agents","The term \u201clipid-lowering agent\u201d refers to a pharmaceutical agent provided to a individual to achieve a lowering of lipids in the individual.

Ideally, administration of a lipid-lowering agent leads to a reduction of one or more serum lipids in an individual over time.","In certain such embodiments, lipid-lowering pharmaceutical agents that may be co-administered with a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include, but are not limited to atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and ezetimibe. In certain such embodiments, the lipid-lowering agent is administered prior to administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In certain such embodiments, the lipid-lowering agent is administered following administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In certain such embodiments the lipid-lowering agent is administered at the same time as a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In certain such embodiments the dose of a co-administered lipid-lowering agent is the same as the dose that would be administered if the lipid-lowering agent was administered alone. In certain such embodiments the dose of a co-administered lipid-lowering agent is lower than the dose that would be administered if the lipid-lowering agent was administered alone. In certain such embodiments the dose of a co-administered lipid-lowering agent is greater than the dose that would be administered if the lipid-lowering agent was administered alone.","Kits","The present invention also contemplates kits for use in the treatment of an LCN13-related disorder. Such kits include at least a first sterile composition comprising a lipocalin described above in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Another component is optionally a second therapeutic agent for the treatment of the disorder along with suitable container and vehicles for administrations of the therapeutic compositions. The kits optionally comprise solutions or buffers for suspending, diluting or effecting the delivery of the first and second compositions. The kits also optionally comprise catheters, syringes or other delivering devices for the delivery of one or more of the compositions used in the methods of the invention. In another aspect, the kits optionally further comprise instructions containing administration protocols for the therapeutic regimens.","Methods of Diagnosing LCN13-Related Conditions","The present disclosure also contemplates methods of diagnosing an LCN13-related condition in a patient comprising determining lipocalin (e.g., LCN13, LCN1, LCN3, LCN4, LCN14, OBP2B, and OBP2A) levels in a sample from the patient suspected of suffering from an LCN13-related condition.","It will be appreciated that determination of the level of a lipocalin in a patient sample will be useful in determining how to manage the LCN13-related condition in the patient. For example, since reduced levels of LCN13 are associated with metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases, the clinician may use the information concerning the levels of LCN13 to facilitate decision making regarding treatment of the patient. Thus, if the level of LCN13 is indicative of an early stage of an LCN13-related condition, appropriate treatment regimens may be prescribed.","The level of lipocalin which is indicative of an LCN13-related condition may be defined as the decreased level present in samples from individuals known to have an LCN13-related condition over the lipocalin level in samples from individuals known to be free of an LCN13-related condition. The level of lipocalin may be, for example, at least 1.1 fold, 1.2 fold, 1.3 fold, 1.4 fold, 1.5 fold, 1.6 fold, 1.7 fold, 1.8 fold, 1.9 fold, 2.0 fold, 2.1 fold, 2.2 fold, 2.3 fold, 2.4 fold, 2.5 fold, 2.6 fold, 2.7 fold, 2.8 fold, 2.9 fold, 3.0 fold, 3.1 fold, 3.2 fold, 3.3 fold, 3.4 fold, 3.5 fold, 3.6 fold, 3.7 fold, 3.8 fold, 3.9 fold, 4.0 fold, 4.1 fold, 4.2 fold, 4.3 fold, 4.4 fold, 4.5 fold, 4.6 fold, 4.7 fold, 4.8 fold, 4.9 fold, 5.0 fold, 5.1 fold, 5.2 fold, 5.3 fold, 5.4 fold, 5.5 fold, 5.6 fold, 5.7 fold, 5.8 fold, 5.9 fold, or 6.0 fold lower in a sample from an individual with an LCN13-related condition.","It will be appreciated that the methods of the invention include methods which aid diagnosis and methods of prognosis. It will also be appreciated that the methods of the invention are useful to the physician in determining a course of management or treatment of the patient.","The lipocalin markers identified using the methods provided are, in one aspect, used to evaluate treatment efficacy (e.g., amelioration of one or more symptoms of a pathology). Where the amelioration of an LCN13-related condition can be related to an increase in levels of a lipocalin, lipocalin levels in a sample taken from the patient are measured before (for background) and during or after (e.g., at a designated time, periodically or randomly) the course of treatment. Because an increase in lipocalin levels may be transient, the method is, in one aspect, performed at regular intervals, (e.g., every 6 hours, every 12 hours, every 18 hours, every 24 hours, every 2 days, every 3 days, every 4 days, every 5 days, every 6 days, every 7 days, every 8 days, every 9 days, every 10 days, every 11 days, every 12 days, every 13 days, every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks, every 4 weeks, every 5 weeks, every 6 weeks, every 7 weeks, every 2 months, every 3 months, every 4 months, every 5 months, every 6 months, every 7 months, every 8 months, every 9 months, every 10 months, every 11 months, every year, or more) closely before and after each treatment. Depending on the course of treatment and other clinical variables, clinicians of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine an appropriate schedule for performing the assay for diagnostic or disease\/treatment monitoring purposes.","In various embodiments, the lipocalin protein is detected and\/or quantified in the sample using any of a number of well recognized immunological binding assays (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,366,241; 4,376,110; 4,517,288; and 4,837,168). For a review of general immunoassays, see also Methods in Cell Biology Volume 37: Antibodies in Cell Biology, Asai, ed. Academic Press, Inc. New York (1993); Basic and Clinical Immunology 7th Edition, Stites & Terr, eds. (1991).","In another embodiment, immunoblot (Western blot) analysis is used to detect and quantify the presence of a lipocalin in the sample. The technique generally comprises separating sample proteins by gel electrophoresis on the basis of molecular weight, transferring the separated proteins to a suitable solid support, (such as a nitrocellulose filter, a nylon filter, or derivatized nylon filter), and incubating the sample with the antibodies that specifically bind the lipocalin. The anti-lipocalin antibodies specifically bind to the lipocalin on the solid support. These antibodies may be directly labeled or alternatively may be subsequently detected using labeled antibodies (e.g., labeled sheep anti-mouse antibodies) that specifically bind to the anti-lipocalin antibody.","In another embodiment, quantitative assays of a lipocalin are deemed to show a positive result, e.g., elevated or decreased lipocalin level, when the measured lipocalin level is greater or less than the level measured or known for a control sample (e.g. either a level known or measured for a normal healthy individual or a \u201cbaseline\/reference\u201d level determined at a different time for the same individual. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the assay is deemed to show a positive result when the difference between sample and \u201ccontrol\u201d is statistically significant (e.g. at the 85% or greater, preferably at the 90% or greater, more preferably at the 95% or greater and most preferably at the 98% or greater confidence level).","In one embodiment of the disclosure, antibodies immunoprecipitate lipocalin proteins from solution as well as react with lipocalin protein on western or immunoblots of polyacrylamide gels. In another embodiment, antibodies detect lipocalin proteins in stored serum samples.","The following examples are provided for illustration and are not in any way to limit the scope of the invention.","Generation of LCN13 Adenoviruses","A full-length of LCN13 cDNA was inserted 3\u2032 prime of the CMV promoter sequences in an adenoviral vector and used to generate recombinant LCN13 adenoviruses using pAdEasy kits (QBiogene, Carlsad, Calif.). Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified in QBI-293A cells and purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. LCN13 or (\u03b2-galactosidase ((\u03b2-gal) (control) adenoviruses were administrated into mice via tail vein injection at 2\u00d710viral particles per mouse.","Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting","Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 1% Nonidet P-40; 150 mM NaCl; 2 mM EGTA; 1 mM NaVO; 100 mM NaF; 10 mM NaPO; 1 mM benzamidine; 10 \u03bcg\/ml aprotinin; 10 \u03bcg\/ml leupeptin; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Tissue extracts were incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 h and with protein A-agarose beads (RepliGen Corp., Waltham, Mass.) for an additional hour at 4\u00b0 C. The immunocomplexes absorbed on the protein A-agarose beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 1% Nonidet P-40; 150 mM NaCl; 2 mM EGTA) and boiled at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 mM in loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS, 2% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol; 10% glycerol; 0.005% bromphenol blue). Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with indicated antibodies, and visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebr.) or ECL (Amersham, Piscataway, N.J.). Polyclonal anti-LCN13 antibodies were raised against glutathione-S-transferase-LCN13 fusion protein. Phospho-Akt (Thr), Akt and insulin receptor \u03b2 subunit antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, Calif.). Anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody was from Upstate (Billerica, Mass.). AntiphosphoAkt (Ser) antibody was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.).","Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)","Total RNA was extracted from the liver or hepatocytes and used to synthesize the first strand cDNAs using oligo(dT)and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The mRNA abundance of various molecules was measured using Absolute QPCR SYBR Green kits (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) and the Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Primers for qRT-PCR were: LCN13 forward: 5\u2032-GTCATTCGGGATGGGAAAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 2), LCN13 reverse: 5\u2032-GCTGTTGCAGACCTGGGTA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 3); \u03b2-actin forward: 5\u2032-AAATCGTGCGTGACATCAAA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 4), \u03b2-actin reverse: 5\u2032-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 5); PEPCK forward: 5\u2032-ATCATCTTTGGTGGCCGTAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 6), PEPCK reverse: 5\u2032-ATCTTGCCCTTGTGTTCTGC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 7); G6Pase forward: 5\u2032-CCGGTGTTTGAACGTCATCT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 8), G6Pase reverse: 5\u2032-CAATGCCTGACAAGACTCCA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 9); PGC-1\u03b1 forward: 5\u2032-TGGACGGAAGCAATTTTTCA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 10), PGC-1\u03b1 reverse: 5\u2032-TTACCTGCGCAAGCTTCTCT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 11); 36B4 forward: 5\u2032-AAGCGCGTCCTGGCATTGTCT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 12), 36B4 reverse: 5\u2032-CCGCAGGGGCAGCAGTGGT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 13); ChREBP forward: 5\u2032-CTGGGGACCTAAACAGGAGC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 14), ChREBP reverse: 5\u2032-GAAGCCACCCTATAGCTCCC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 15); CPT1\u03b1 forward: 5\u2032-CTGATGACGGCTATGGTGTTT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 16), CPT1\u03b1 reverse: 5\u2032-GTGAGGCCAAACAAGGTGATA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 17); FAS forward: 5\u2032-TTGACGGCTCACACACCTAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 18), FAS reverse: 5\u2032-CGATCTTCCAGGCTCTTCAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 19); LCAD forward: 5\u2032-CACTCAGATATTGTCATGCCCT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 20), LCAD reverse: 5\u2032-TCCATTGAGAATCCAATCACTC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 21); MCAD forward: 5\u2032-ACCCTGTGGAGAAGCTGATG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 22); MCAD reverse: 5\u2032-AGCAACAGTGCTTGGAGCTT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 23); PPAR\u03b3 forward: 5\u2032-CCAGAGTCTGCTGATCTGCG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 24), PPAR\u03b3 reverse: 5\u2032-GCCACCTCTTTGCTCTGATC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 25); SCD1 forward: 5\u2032-AGGTGCCTCTTAGCCACTGA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 26), SCD1 reverse: 5\u2032-CCAGGAGTTTCTTGGGTTGA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 27); SREBP1c forward 5\u2032-AACGTCACTTCCAGCTAGAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 28), SREBP1c reverse 5\u2032-CCACTAAGGTGCCTACAGAGC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 29).","Results","To examine tissue distribution of LCN13, total RNAs were prepared from various tissues and used to specifically amplify LCN13 by reverse transcription PCR using primers unique to LCN13. LCN13 mRNA was detected in multiple tissues, including livers, skeletal muscle, the pancreas and white adipose tissue (WAT) (). To measure the levels of endogenous LCN13 protein, anti-LCN13 antibody (\u03b1LCN13) was raised against glutathione S-transferase-LCN13 fusion protein. Tissue extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with \u03b1LCN13. Two isoforms of LCN13 were detected in the liver, skeletal muscle and WAT, but at relatively low levels in the last two tissues ().","To determine whether LCN13 is a secretary protein, a full-length of mouse LCN13 cDNA was inserted into an adenoviral vector under the control of the CMV promoter. FAO cells (rat hepatoma cells) were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses. Culture medium was collected 48 h after infection and immunoblotted with \u03b1LCN13. Two isoforms of LCN13 were detected in the medium from LCN13 but not \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected cells (, right two lanes). LCN13 was also detected in cell extracts prepared from LCN13 but not \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected cells (, left two lanes). These results indicate that LCN13 was secreted as two isoforms, presumably due to differential proteolytic cleavages.","To determine whether LCN13 is present in the bloodstream, plasma was prepared from fasted (16 h) or randomly fed mice and immunoblotted with \u03b1LCN13. LCN13 was detected in the blood; interestingly, fasting reduced plasma LCN13 levels (). To determine whether circulating LCN13 levels are altered in obesity, plasma was prepared either from male mice fed a standard chow and high fat diet (HFD) or from leptin-deficient ob\/ob and wild type littermates. The plasma was immunoprecipitated with \u03b1LCN3 and immunoblotted with \u03b1LCN3. Circulating LCN13 was dramatically reduced in mice with either genetic (ob\/ob) or dietary fat-induced obesity (). In agreement with these observations, LCN13 expression markedly decreased in the livers of mice with HFD-induced obesity (). These results suggest that LCN13 deficiency contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in obese mice.","Generation of LCN13 Transgenic Mice.","The LCN13 transgene constructs were engineered by inserting a full-length mouse LCN13 cDNA into a pCAGGS vector (FIG. S2A). A \u201cstop\u201d cassette, which was flanked by two loxp sites, was inserted between the chicken \u03b2-actin\/rabbit \u03b2-globin hybrid promoter and the LCN13 cDNA. The transgenic constructs were linearized with SalI and ApL1, purified, and microinjected into F2 mouse oocytes (in C57BL\/6 background). The oocytes were surgically transferred to recipients in the University of Michigan Transgenic Animal Model Core. Transgenic animals were identified by PCR-based genotyping assays. The transgenic mice were crossed with EIIA-Cre mice (in C57BL\/6 genetic background) to generate LCN13 and EIIA-Cre double-transgenic mice. Cre was expressed in the germ cells of the LCN13\/EHA-Cre double-transgenic mice and deleted the \u201cSTOP\u201d cassette via the two loxp sites; therefore, the progenies of the LCN13\/EIIA-Cre transgenic mice were predicted to express the LCN13 transgene under the control of the chicken \u03b2-actin\/rabbit \u03b2-globin hybrid promoter. This hybrid promoter is constitutively active in multiple tissues of the transgenic mice. The ElIACre transgene was removed by a series of backcross of the LCN13\/EIIA-Cre transgenic mice with wild type mice (in C57BL\/6 background). We obtained two independent lines of LCN13 transgenic mice: LCN13-642 and LCN13-783.","ob\/ob and db\/db mice (in C57BL\/6 background) were from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). Mice were housed on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle in the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of Michigan (ULAM), and fed either normal chow (9% fat; Lab Diet) or HFD (45% fat; Research Diets) ad libitum with free access to water. Animal experiments were conducted following protocols approved by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA).","Animal Experiments","Blood samples were collected from mouse tail veins using heparin-pretreated capillary tubes. Blood glucose was measured by a glucometer (Bayer Corp., Tarrytown, N.Y.), and plasma insulin was measured using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem, Inc., Chicago, Ill.). HOMA index was calculated as: fasting blood glucose (mmol\/l)\u00d7fasting plasma insulin (\u03bcU\/ml)\/22.5.","For glucose tolerance tests (GTT), mice were fasted overnight (16 h) and intraperitoneally injected with D-glucose. Blood glucose was measured 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection. For insulin tolerance tests (ITT), mice were fasted for 6 h (from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) and intraperitoneally injected with human insulin. Blood glucose was monitored 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after insulin injection.","Results","To determine whether LCN13 regulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, a full-length mouse LCN13 cDNA was inserted into a transgenic construct under the control of the chicken \u03b2-actin\/rabbit \u03b2-globin hybrid promoter and used to generate LCN13 transgenic mice. This hybrid promoter is constitutively active in multiple mouse tissues. Two independent lines (LCN13-783 and LCN13-642) were generated and used in the following experiments. Circulating LCN13 levels were higher in LCN13 transgenic mice than in wild type (WT) littermates (). LCN13 overexpression did not alter body weight in both LCN13-783 and LCN13-642 mice.","LCN13-783 and WT male littermates (7 weeks) were fed a HFD. Chronic overexpression of LCN13 protected against HFD-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (). Plasma insulin decreased by 47% in LCN13-783 mice (). HOMA index, which is commonly used to estimate insulin sensitivity, decreased by 63% in LCN13-783 mice (). To further analyze insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, LCN13-783 and WT littermates were fed a HFD for 12 weeks and subjected to insulin tolerance tests (ITT) and glucose tolerance tests (GTT). Exogenous insulin reduced blood glucose levels to a greater extent in LCN13-783 than in WT littermates (). Glucose injection increased blood glucose in both LCN13-783 and WT mice, but to a much lower level in LCN13-783 than in WT littermates (). Chronic overexpression of LCN13 also protected against HFD-induced glucose intolerance in LCN13-642 line ().","Plasma LCN13 levels were markedly reduced in obese, insulin resistant mice (). To determine whether restoration of circulating LCN13 improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice with type 2 diabetes, db\/db mice, which serve as a genetic model of obesity and type 2 diabetes, were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses via tail vein injection. Recombinant adenoviruses primarily infect liver cells under these conditions. Recombinant LCN13 was detected as two isoforms in the livers of LCN13 but not \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected mice (). These results support the observations in  that two isoforms of LCN13 are generated from proteolytic cleavages of a LCN13 precursor. Plasma LCN13 levels were also significantly elevated in LCN13 adenovirus-infected mice ().","Restoration of LCN13 markedly improved both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in db\/db mice (). In LCN13 adenovirus-infected mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin decreased by 46% and 51%, respectively. In GTT, glucose injection increased blood glucose levels to a lesser extent in LCN13 adenovirus-infected mice than in \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected mice (). In ITT, blood glucose levels were significantly lower in LCN13 than in \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected mice at each time point after insulin injection (). These data indicate that restoration of circulating LCN13 largely reverses hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetes.","To determine whether LCN13 overexpression reverses insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in dietary fat-induced type 2 diabetes, C57BL\/6 mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks and infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses. Fasting blood glucose levels were 29% lower in LCN13 than in \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected mice (). In ITT, blood glucose levels were also lower in LCN13 than in 0-gal adenovirus-infected mice at each time point after insulin injection (). Adenovirus-expressed LCN13 also improved glucose intolerance in HFD-fed mice (). Taken together, these data suggest that liver-specific overexpression of LCN13 attenuated insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in both genetic and diet-induced type 2 diabetes.","To determine whether purified LCN13 regulates glucose metabolism, mouse LCN13 was N-terminally His-tagged and purified from bacteria. ob\/ob mice (10 weeks) were chronically administrated with vehicles or purified LCN13 (33 pmol\/h) via osmotic minipump. Insulin sensitivity was slightly improved 10 days after LCN13 treatment as revealed by ITT (). Glucose intolerance was also improved 12 days after LCN13 treatments (). However, the insulin sensitizing effect of purified LCN13 was relatively mild, presumably due to a low dose of LCN13 used in these experiments. Alternatively, bacteria-produced LCN13 may be improperly processed and folded, thus less active than LCN13 expressed by mammalian cells.","To examine the effect of chronic LCN13 treatments on insulin signaling, LCN13-783 and WT littermates were fed a HFD for 15 weeks. Mice were fasted overnight and treated with PBS or insulin (3 U\/kg body weight). Tissue extracts were prepared 5 min after the treatments and used to measure phosphorylation of key components of the insulin pathways. Insulin only slightly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and phosphorylation of Akt (pSer) in the skeletal muscle of WT mice, indicating that HFD induces insulin resistance in WT mice (). By contrast, insulin potently stimulated phosphorylation of both IR and Akt in LCN13-783 mice (). Insulin was unable to stimulate Akt phosphorylation in the livers of WT mice, but robustly stimulated Akt phosphorylation in LCN13-783 mice (). These results suggest that LCN13 is likely to improve glucose metabolism by increasing insulin sensitivity in animals.","Adipocyte Differentiation and Glucose Uptake Assays","3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 25 mM glucose, 10% calf serum at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO. Two days post-confluency, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured for 3 days in a differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 \u03bcM insulin, 1 \u03bcM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and 3 additional days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1 \u03bcM insulin. Differentiated adipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and pretreated with purified LCN13 for the indicated times in DMEM supplemented with 0.6% bovine serum albumin (BSA). In glucose uptake assays, adipocytes were incubated with DMEM containing 0.6% BSA for 3 h, washed with Krebs-Ringer buffer (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl, 1.3 mM MgSO, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and incubated with or without insulin for 30 min. [H]2-deoxy-D-glucose was added during the last 5 min of insulin stimulation. Cells were immediately washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 0.1% SDS buffer. [H]2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was determined by scintillation counting.","Results","To determine whether LCN13 directly enhances insulin signaling, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with LCN13 or vehicles, and then stimulated with insulin. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with phospho-Akt antibodies. Insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation, whereas LCN13 did not; however, LCN13 increased insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (). To further determine whether LCN13 sensitizes insulin action, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with LCN13 (100 nM) or vehicles for 3 or 6 h. The cells were subsequently stimulated with insulin, and glucose uptake was measured. LCN13 did not alter basal glucose uptake after LCN13 pretreatment for 3 h, but it markedly enhanced insulin stimulation of glucose uptake (). Interestingly, LCN13 enhanced both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after LCN13 pretreatment for 6 h (). These data suggest that LCN13 directly promotes glucose uptake in adipocytes by an insulin-dependent mechanism in the short-term and by both insulin-dependent and -independent mechanisms in the long-term.","Hepatic Glucose Production (HGP) Assays","Mouse hepatocytes were isolated by liver-perfusion with type II collagenase (Worthington Biochem, Lakewood, N.J.) and grown on collagen-coated plates for 2 h in Williams' Medium E (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) containing 2% FBS, 100 units\/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin. Cells were rinsed with PBS and cultured for an additional 4 h in KRB buffer (118 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO, 1.1 mM KHPO, 1.2 mM MgSO, 10 \u03bcM ZnSO, 0.6% BSA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of recombinant LCN13 protein. For HGP assays, primary hepatocyte cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated with HGP buffer (KRB buffer supplemented with 10 mM sodium DL lactate and 5 mM pyruvate) in the presence or absence of 100 nM insulin or MIX (10 \u03bcM N,2\u2032-O-dibutyryladenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt and 100 nM dexamethasone). Culture buffer was collected 4 h later and used to measure glucose using Glucose LiquiColor kits (Fisher Scientific Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.).","Results","LCN13 is expressed at relative high levels in the liver (). To determine whether LCN13 is involved in glucose metabolism in hepatocytes, primary hepatocyte cultures were pretreated with LCN13 for 4 h, and then subjected to hepatic glucose production (HGP) assays in the presence of PBS (basal), insulin, Mix (a combination of a cAMP analog and dexamethasone), or both insulin and Mix. Mix stimulated HGP by 102%; insulin suppressed both basal and Mix-stimulated HGP by 25% and 38%, respectively (). Importantly, LCN13 alone also suppressed both basal (by 13%) and Mix-stimulated (18%) HGP (). LCN13 and insulin act synergistically to further inhibit both basal (50%) and Mix-stimulated (56%) HGP ().","To determine whether LCN13 regulates the expression of the genes that control hepatic gluconeogenesis, primary hepatocyte cultures were pretreated with LCN13 and then treated with Mix or Mix plus insulin as described above. The expression of key gluconeogenic genes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phostatase (G6Pase), and PGC-1a, were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and normalized to 0-actin expression. Mix potently stimulated the expression of PEPCK, G6Pase and PGC-1\u03b1; insulin suppressed Mix-stimulated expression of PEPCK (by 88%), G6Pase (86%) and PGC-1a (81%) (). LCN13 alone also inhibited the expression of these genes, but to a lesser extent than insulin (). Together, these data suggest that LCN13 is able to suppress HGP by both insulin-dependent and -independent mechanisms.","LCN13 Decreases Blood Cholesterol Levels in Obese Mice.","LCN13 transgenic males and wild type littermates were fed a high fat diet (HFD) (45% fat). Blood samples were collected from tail vein and used to measure cholesterol levels. LCN13 significantly reduced blood cholesterol levels (). These data demonstrate that LCN13 can be used to treat and prevent multiple cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart attack.","LCN13 suppresses the lipogenic program and fatty liver diseases.","LCN13 was overexpressed in male mice with genetic obesity and type 2 diabetes (db\/db) (lacking functional leptin receptor) via adenoviral infection. LCN13 markedly reduced liver lipid levels (). LCN13 also dramatically suppressed the expression of many key genes that control hepatic lipogenic program (). These results demonstrate that LCN13 can be used to treat various fatty liver diseases, such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic hepatitis (NASH).","Conditioned Medium","HepG2 cells were infected with \u03b2-gal or LCN13 adenoviruses, and culture medium was changed 24 hours after infection. Conditioned medium was collected 24 hours later.","Lipogenesis Assays","Primary hepatocyte cultures were prepared by liver-perfusion with type II collagenase (Worthington Biochem, Lakewood, N.J.) and grown on collagen-coated plates. Primary hepatocytes were pretreated with LCN13 recombinant protein, conditioned medium, or anti-LCN13 antibodies for 16 hours. The cells were then incubated for 4 hours in Williams Medium E (Sigma) supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 0.5 mM cold acetate, and 4 \u03bcCi\/ml [H]-acetate (Moravek Biochemicals Inc, Brea, Calif.). Cells were lysed in 0.1 M HCl and lipids were extracted with chloroform\/methanol (2:1). The organic phase was collected and dried by evaporation at 50\u00b0 C. The pellets were dissolved in 50 \u03bcl hexane and 200 HSO(1.8% in methanol) and heated for 30 min at 100\u00b0 C. The mixtures were cooled down to room temperature, and mixed with 100 \u03bcl water and 250 \u03bcl petroleum. After centrifugation, petroleum phase was collected and used to measure [H] radioactivity. Lipogenesis rates were normalized to total protein levels.","Results","To overexpress LCN13, primary hepatocytes were prepared from C57BL\/6 male mice (8-9 weeks) and infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses as described previously. LCN13 was detected in LCN13-, but not \u03b2-gal-adenovirus-infected cells (). Two forms of LCN13 were detected that likely resulted from differential proteolysis of a common LCN13 precursor. Hepatocytes were subjected to lipogenesis assays 16 hours after infection. LCN13 overexpression reduced lipogenesis by 18% ().","To verify these findings by a different approach, LCN13 conditioned medium was prepared from HepG2 cells (human hepatoblastoma cells). HepG2 cells were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses, and LCN13 or \u03b2-gal conditioned medium was collected as described above. Recombinant LCN13 proteins were detected in LCN13 conditioned medium but not \u03b2-gal conditioned medium (). Primary hepatocytes were treated with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal conditioned medium for 16 hours and then subjected to lipogenesis assays. LCN13 conditioned medium inhibited lipogenesis by >11% (). To further analyze LCN13 action, recombinant LCN13 was produced and purified from bacteria. Primary hepatocytes were treated with recombinant LCN13 for 16 hours and subjected to lipogenesis assays. Recombinant LCN13 inhibited lipogenesis by 19% (). Together, these results demonstrate that LCN13 is a novel negative regulator of hepatic lipogenesis.","Hepatic lipogenesis rates are controlled by key transcription factors and metabolic enzymes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)1c, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS). To determine whether LCN13 inhibits the expression of these lipogenic genes, the mRNA abundance of these genes was measured. Primary hepatocytes were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses, and total RNAs were extracted 16 hours after infection and used to measure the mRNA abundance of these lipogenic regulators by qRT-PCR. LCN13 overexpression significantly inhibited the expression of SCD1, FAS, ChREBP, PPARy, and SREBP1c (). These data suggest that LCN13 directly inhibits the hepatic lipogenic program.","Fatty Acid \u03b2 Oxidation Assays","Primary hepatocytes were treated as described above. The treated cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. with 0.4 \u03bcCi\/ml [9,10-H(N)]-oleic acid (Moravek Biochemicals Inc, Brea, Calif.) 100 \u03bcM cold oleic acid (conjugated with BSA) in Krebs-Ringer buffer (119 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl, 2.6 mM MgSO, 24.6 mM NaHCO, 2.6 mM KHPO, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Supernatant was collected, incubated with perchloric acid (1.3 M), and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 10 min.","Results","Primary hepatocytes were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses as described in  and subjected to \u03b2 oxidation assays 16 hours after infection. LCN13 overexpression increased fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation rates by 26% (). To confirm these findings by an independent approach, primary hepatocytes were treated with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal conditioned medium for 16 hours and subjected to \u03b2 oxidation assays. LCN13 conditioned medium treatments increased \u03b2 oxidation rates by 23% (). To further examine LCN13 action, primary hepatocyte cultures were treated with purified, bacteria-derived recombinant LCN13. Recombinant LCN13 also stimulated \u03b2 oxidation rates by 21% (). The effect of LCN13 on the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I\u03b1 (liver form), long chain acyl coA dehydrogenase (LCAD), and medium chain acyl coA dehydrogenase (MCAD) that mediate \u03b2 oxidation was also examined. Primary hepatocytes were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses, and total RNAs were extracted 16 hours after infection and used to measure the mRNA abundance of CPT1\u03b1, MCAD and LCAD by qRT-PCR. LCN13 overexpression significantly increased the expression of CPT1\u03b1 but not MCAD and LCAD (). Therefore, LCN13 directly stimulates fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation in hepatocytes, at least in part by stimulating CPT1\u03b1 expression.","To determine whether LCN13 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism in animals, we performed studies in LCN13 transgenic (Tg) mice. In Tg mice, the expression of the LCN13 transgene is under the control of the constitutively active chicken \u03b2-actin\/rabbit \u03b2-globin hybrid promoter. To determine whether chronic LCN13 overexpression protects against diet-induced hepatic steatosis, Tg and control male littermates (7 weeks) were fed a high fat diet (HFD). Body weight was similar between Tg and WT mice at 18 weeks of age (Tg: 39.5\u00b11.4 g, n=9; WT: 41.6\u00b11.5 g, n=10; p=0.38). Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) levels decreased by 12% in Tg mice at 18 weeks of age (). Liver weights were similar between WT and Tg mice (); however, liver TAG contents decreased by 40% in Tg mice at 20 weeks of age (). In agreement with the findings in primary hepatocytes, chronic LCN13 overexpression significantly inhibited the expression of key lipogenic genes (e.g., SCD1, FAS, ChREBP, PPAR\u03b3, and SREBP1c) but stimulated CPT1\u03b1 expression in the liver (). These results indicate that LCN13 suppresses lipogenesis and enhances fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation in the liver.","To determine whether overexpression of LCN13 similarly protects against hepatosteatosis in mice with genetic obesity, Tg mice were crossed with ob mice to generate LCN13 transgenic and leptin-deficient double mutant mice (ob\/ob\/Tg). ob\/ob mice have been commonly used as a genetic model of obesity. LCN13 overexpression did not alter body weights of ob\/ob\/Tg mice (). However, transgenic overexpression of LCN13 markedly reduced both fasted (by 54%) and randomly-fed blood glucose (by 41%) in ob\/ob\/Tg mice (). To further analyze glucose metabolism, we performed glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT). In GTT, blood glucose levels were significantly lower in ob\/ob\/Tg than in ob\/ob mice at each time point after glucose injection (). In ITT, insulin was unable to reduce blood glucose in ob\/ob mice due to insulin resistance; however, chronic LCN13 overexpression increased the ability of insulin to reduce blood glucose in ob\/ob\/Tg mice (). These results are consistent with the results presented in Example 2 that LCN13 improves glucose metabolism in part by sensitizing insulin action.","Plasma TAG levels decreased by 18% in ob\/ob\/Tg mice compared with ob\/ob mice (). Liver weights decreased in ob\/ob\/Tg mice (13 weeks), but the difference between ob\/ob and ob\/ob\/Tg mice was not statistically significant (). Liver structures were examined by hematoxylin & eosin (H & E) staining and measuring hepatic lipid levels using biochemical assays. The sizes of lipid droplets and the number of large lipid droplets were markedly decreased in ob\/ob\/Tg mice (). In agreement, liver TAG contents were significantly lower in ob\/ob\/Tg than in ob\/ob mice (). Furthermore, the expression of lipogenic genes (e.g. SCD1, FAS, ChREBP, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP1c) was significantly reduced in ob\/ob\/Tg mice, whereas CPT1\u03b1 expression increased in LCN13-overexpressing mice with genetic obesity (). These data indicate that LCN13 is able to suppress hepatic lipogenesis, promote \u03b2 oxidation, and ameliorate hepatosteatosis and NAFLD in obesity.","To determine whether a short-term LCN13 treatment improves hepatosteatosis in obesity, db\/db mice (9 weeks) were infected with LCN13 or \u03b2-gal adenoviruses via tail vein injection, and livers were harvested 16 days after infection. db\/db mice are deficient of functional leptin receptors and widely used as a genetic model of obesity. Recombinant LCN13 was detected as two forms in LCN13 adenovirus-infected livers (). Liver weights decreased in LCN13-overexpressing mice (). Liver TAG contents decreased by 80% in LCN13 adenovirus-infected mice compared with that in \u03b2-gal adenovirus-infected mice (). Taken together, these data indicate that LCN13 therapy attenuates hepatosteatosis at least in part by suppressing hepatic lipogenesis and\/or promoting 13 oxidation in the liver.","To determine whether endogenous LCN13 regulates lipogenesis and \u03b2 oxidation, primary hepatocytes were treated with anti-LCN13 antibody to neutralize hepatocyte-secreted LCN13 in culture medium. Pre-immune serum was used as control. The treated cells were then subjected to lipogenesis or \u03b2 oxidation assays. Neutralization of endogenous LCN13 increased lipogenesis by 24% () and decreased fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation by 41% (). The expression of genes that control lipogenesis and \u03b2 oxidation by qRT-PCR was also examined. In contrast to LCN13 treatments, neutralization of LCN13 significantly increased the expression of lipogenic genes (e.g., SCD1, FAS, ChREBP, PPAR\u03b3, and SREBP1c) and decreased CPT1\u03b1 expression (). These data indicate that endogenous LCN13 in the liver regulates hepatic lipogenesis and \u03b2 oxidation in an autocrine\/paracrine manner."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","i":"E. coli ","sub":["6","6","6"],"sup":"2+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B","sup":["473","473 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B","sup":"308"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B","sup":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A-9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A-11D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A-12D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A-13D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A-14E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A-15C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A-16C"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
