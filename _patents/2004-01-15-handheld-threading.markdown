title: Handheld threading
abstract: The present invention determines which messages to display in message threads to a user. An electronic communication device receives and stores numerous SMS messages transported through an SMS network, but the SMS messages are sent without explicit linking information such as a previous message or subject line. A threading module applies threading rules to determine which messages to correlate into an SMS message thread through implicit link information. The threading rules thread outgoing messages sent in response to an incoming message from a user, or incoming messages where a previous outgoing message was sent to the user. An SMS application displays threads in a user interface and indicates messages threads with an icon in one view, and displays an expanded message thread in another view.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to network messaging applications and, more specifically, to correlating messages received in network messaging applications.","2. Description of Related Art","Messaging applications are the \u201ckiller apps\u201d for networked devices. Mobile phone networks have traditionally been limited to voice communications, but new technologies such as GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) have enabled mobile phone networks to also include data communications. For example, SMS (Short Message Service) messaging provides a software-independent protocol to send short text messages composed of either: 160-7 bit characters; 70-16 bit characters; or 140 octets of binary data. Individual SMS messages thus require a relatively small network bandwidth and devices can receive messages, even when connected to a voice call. The number of SMS messages a user receives has continually increased because many new types of network devices have joined mobile phone networks. These devices include, for example, PDAs, hybrid PDA\/mobile phone devices, and other text messaging devices using GSM networks. An inherent limitation of the small SMS packet size is that neither previous messages nor subject lines are included within a current SMS message.","Because there is no inherent linking information (e.g., subject line or application session tags) in SMS messages, they are displayed as discrete interchanges without the context of related SMS messages. A user exchanging SMS messages with multiple other users can thus quickly lose track of the multiple conversations. Moreover, messages identified by phone numbers add a level of confusion. Consider a situation where User A sends a message to User B\u2014\u201cWhat time shall we meet?\u201d\u2014and also to User C\u2014\u201cHow many times?\u201d A response message of \u201c3\u201d identified only by the sender's phone number may leave User A wondering whether the message was from User B or from User C.","A similar problem can arise when exchanging multiple messages with a single user. Because SMS messages are held while a mobile device is not reachable, User A may not receive User B's response to a message for hours or even days. The entire conversation topic can thus span hours or days. Without the context of previous messages, User B's response may leave User A wondering what question is being answered or how the conversation started.","What is needed is a robust messaging application that solves the above constraints of mobile devices and the inherent shortcomings of their communication protocols. Furthermore, the messaging application should determine which messages to thread despite the above problems.","The present invention determines which messages to display to a user as a message thread. In one embodiment, an SMS device receives and stores numerous SMS messages transported through an SMS network. SMS messages do not contain any explicit linking or relationship between the messages. Thus the SMS device must apply threading rules to determine whether to thread SMS messages by identifying implicit links. A threading engine generates an SMS message thread by applying threading rules from the outgoing SMS message rules for outgoing messages and from the incoming SMS message rules for incoming messages. An SMS application, operating independently from the threading engine, displays SMS message threads to the user.","One embodiment of the threading engine identifies related messages from implicit links between messages from a unique identifier native to SMS data packets, such as a source or destination address. The unique identifier is independent of an SMS application, or instantiations of the SMS application. In another embodiment, the SMS application assigns an application identifier to an identified message thread. As such, the source and destination SMS applications, and instantiations of the same, are capable of further communications.","In another embodiment, the threading engine applies threading rules to correlate current messages with previous messages. The threading engine appends the current message to an active thread when available. If not, the threading engine generates an SMS thread having the previous and current messages in a hierarchy according to relationships between the messages. For example, the hierarchy may represent the order of arrival of included messages, who sent each message, and\/or which messages are replies to others.","In yet another embodiment, the threading rules database is organized according to outgoing message rules and incoming message rules. In another embodiment, the threading rules database is organized by interrelated set of message inclusion rules, message hierarchy rules, message formatting rules, and thread management rules. The threading rules may be predetermined and\/or dynamically updated according to user configurations.","In still another embodiment, the user interface displays an icon to indicate message threads. In another embodiment, the user interface displays an expanded message thread representing message hierarchy. In yet another embodiment, the user interface displays a drop-down menu to list active threads.","The present invention determines which messages to display in a message thread to a user. A \u201cthread,\u201d as used herein, refers to a set of correlated messages. The threads are displayed to show current incoming or outgoing messages and their relationship to previous messages.","It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that although the described embodiment uses an SMS messaging, the invention may also be applied to MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), EMS (Enhanced Messaging Service), or any data protocol capable of encapsulating messages for transport between networked devices. Also, the terms \u201cSMS messages\u201d and \u201cmessages\u201d are used interchangeably herein. Additionally, the terms \u201coutgoing\u201d and \u201csent\u201d messages are used interchangeably herein, as are the terms \u201cincoming\u201d and \u201creceived.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","110","140","110","1210","1220","1230","100","110","140","905"],"i":["a,b","a,b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 7"],"b":["210","210","220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","340","310","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 15A","FIG. 16"],"b":["400","400","400","410","430","440","400","400","400"]},"The SMS message database  persistently stores incoming and outgoing SMS messages. Incoming messages are received from other SMS devices. Outgoing messages are entered into the electronic communication device by the user. The SMS message database  stores messages until a corresponding memory is full, a maximum number of messages has been reached, a time period has passed, or the like. If the SMS device is powered down, and then powered up again, the messages are still available for correlating into threads. By contrast, prior art systems without persistent memory are not able to recover message threads after powering down, resetting, or the like. In one embodiment, unthreaded messages are stored in format as shown in , and threaded messages are stored in a format as shown in .","The threading rules database  stores rules that characterize relationships between incoming and outgoing messages stored in the SMS message database .  is a block diagram illustrating a threading rules database according to one embodiment of the present invention. The threading rules database  comprises outgoing SMS message rules  and incoming SMS message rules . In one embodiment, the incoming SMS message rules  prevent unnecessary or unsolicited threads.","The outgoing SMS message rules  are applied to messages sent from the electronic communication device to determine its relationship to previous messages. Example categories of threading rules include rules that determine: thread association; the type of thread in which to include the message; previous messages to include in the thread; and thread hierarchy. One rule always threads outgoing messages sent in reply to incoming messages. Another rule only thread outgoing messages sent to devices listed in the phone book. Yet another ensures that messages older than, for example, an hour or a week, are not threaded. Also, if the last message is older than a predetermined time, a new messages are included in a new thread.","The incoming SMS message rules  are applied to messages received to the electronic communication device to determine its relationship to previous messages. For example, one rule limits unsolicited threads by only threading incoming messages from known users, or that are verified by the device user. A similar rule does not thread messages that originate from known spammers or commercial entities. Other do not thread rules relate to special addresses that, although are from a common source, are not desirable for threading. For example, rules detect and exclude voicemail notifications and numerical pages from a database of special addresses. Another rule attempts to thread incoming messages sent in reply to outgoing messages by assuming that any incoming message received from the destination of an outgoing message within a time limit, such as 15 minutes, is a reply. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the outgoing and incoming threading rules ,  are provided solely for the purpose of illustration and that other rules may also be included without departing from the spirit of the invention.","In , the threading engine  applies threading rules to correlate the current and previous messages into threads. In response to receiving incoming or outgoing messages, or indications of such, from the operating system, the threading engine  associates the current message with previous messages of the same thread. The threading engine  identifies the messages based on a unique identifier native to SMS packets containing the SMS message. One example of a unique identifier is the source or destination address. A thread is organized by the unique identifier, a sender's or receiver's name, a contact from a phone book, a phone number, SMS address, group affiliation, a business entity, a subject matter category, a device, a location, a message urgency, or otherwise. The threading engine  may find an appropriate active thread, and add the message into that thread. In another embodiment, the threading engine  generates a thread on-the-fly by sorting or previous messages in the SMS message database  to find messages of similar characteristics. The messages are then put in chronological order. In yet another embodiment, if there are no active threads or previous messages that correlate to the current message, the threading engine  initializes a new SMS thread. Methods related to the threading engine  are described in more detail below.","The SMS application  displays threads in a user interface and receives messages input by a user. The SMS application  displays a SMS messages thread icon responsive to receiving an indication that the message belongs to a thread as shown in . In response to selecting the threaded message icon  or active thread  from the drop down menu, the SMS application  displays an expanded thread as shown in .","The SMS application  may perform additional analysis on the message thread. In one embodiment, the SMS application  initiates a ring-tone when receiving an incoming message included in an SMS thread. In another embodiment, the SMS application  determines format of the message text. In yet another embodiment, the SMS application  receives display formats from the threading engine . For example, the threading engine  indicates separate display formats for incoming and outgoing messages, outgoing messages in progress, or otherwise.","The SMS application  is, for example, a network browser to view remotely stored SMS threads, an application dedicated to SMS threading, or any other messaging application that configured to send and\/or receive messages (SMS and\/or other types of messages) according to the present invention. In one embodiment a sending SMS application  is different from a receiving SMS application . The threading engine  thus threads messages independently and outputs its results through an application programming interface.

In one embodiment, a first identifier is the identified receiver as indicated by the receiver's name, phone number, SMS address, group affiliation, or other unique identifier. In another embodiment, a second identifier is associated with two or more first identifiers. One example of a second identifier is a phone book contact with two phone numbers, each phone number constituting a first identifier. Based on the specific implementation, two SMS threads can be generated based on the first and second phone numbers, or a single SMS thread can be generated based on the phone book contact.","The threading engine  correlates  the outgoing message with previous messages according to threading rules and outputs the resulting thread to the SMS application  as shown below in .","The SMS application  displays  the resulting SMS thread in a user interface.
