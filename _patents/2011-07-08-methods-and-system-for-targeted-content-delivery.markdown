No. 61\/399,231 entitled \u201cSimplified Content Dissemination To Recipients Acquired Via External Means\u201d filed Jul. 9, 2010, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The conventional paradigm for delivering marketing materials concentrates on mono-directional communication. After discovery of the initial interest of a new contact, information is distributed to the contact with limited opportunity for feedback. This pattern of mono-directional communication transcends media, asserting itself from the trade show floor to the website. In the trade-show example, the most conventional delivery of marketing material involves a booth attendant handing a brochure to a contact.","Alternatively, in a slightly more technologically sophisticated iteration of delivery of marketing material, the booth attendant solicits an email address from a potential recipient and sends a document by electronic mail. While an email-based delivery paradigm does open a channel for subsequent communication to the user, an email-based delivery paradigm maintains a mono-directional line of communication.","The most technologically advanced paradigm for mono-directional communication currently available is the distribution of web pages. A user is able to place a web page on a server and receive requests that the page be sent. While the web-based paradigm does generate limited identity information with respect to a requesting party, a web-based delivery paradigm maintains a mono-directional line of communication.","Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for targeted message delivery are disclosed. A set of document delivery transactions are initiated with respect to a set of intended document recipients. The initiating includes sending to each of the set of intended document recipients a respective one of a set of pointers for requesting delivery of one or more documents designated with respect to a respective document delivery transaction. Each of the set of pointers is identified with a respective one of the set of intended document recipients. In response to actuations of respective ones of the set of pointers, the one or more documents designated with respect to the respective document delivery transaction are delivered from a centralized document repository. Analytic measures are recorded with respect to the delivering the one or more documents. The analytic measures include a measure of actuations of each of the pointers. A target for a subsequent communication is identified.","While the invention is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description. As used throughout this application, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201cincludes\u201d mean including, but not limited to.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, methods, apparatuses or systems that would be known by one of ordinary skill have not been described in detail so as not to obscure claimed subject matter. For example, where flowcharts are used below to describe a series of operations that may be performed by embodiments, one of skill in the art will readily realize in light of having read the present disclosure that various operations may be omitted, or other operations may be added, or the order of operations may be varied without departing from the scope and intent of the embodiments presented herein. Likewise, one of skill in the art will readily realize in light of having read the present disclosure that, in diagrams with respect to which software or hardware modules are discussed, that various modules may be omitted, or other modules may be added, or the placement of modules and operations in various systems may be varied from the forms discussed without departing from the scope and intent of the embodiments presented herein.","Some portions of the detailed description which follow are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on binary digital signals stored within a memory of a specific apparatus or special purpose computing device or platform. In the context of this particular specification, the term specific apparatus or the like includes a general purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software. Algorithmic descriptions or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the signal processing or related arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and is generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar signal processing leading to a desired result. In this context, operations or processing involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, although not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared or otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals as bits, data, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, numerals or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these or similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining\u201d or the like refer to actions or processes of a specific apparatus, such as a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device. In the context of this specification, therefore, a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device is capable of manipulating or transforming signals, typically represented as physical electronic or magnetic quantities within memories, registers, or other information storage devices, transmission devices, or display devices of the special purpose computer or similar special purpose electronic computing device.","As used herein, a document delivery transaction is, unless otherwise noted where used, a transaction in which a pointer for requesting delivery is generated and associated with identifying information of an intended document recipient.","As used herein, an intended document recipient is, unless otherwise noted where used, an identity associated with an item of contact information. In some embodiments, an intended document recipient is recorded in a contact record of a contact records data store and is associated with a pointer for requesting document delivery that is transmitted to the intended document recipient.","As used herein, a pointer for requesting delivery is, unless otherwise noted where used, an instruction or addressing value used to initiate, encourage, or complete a transaction involving delivery of a document to an intended recipient. Examples of a pointer for requesting delivery include but are not limited to a uniform resource identifier (URI) associated with a contact record and providing a location of a document intended for delivery to the intended recipient. As discussed below, in some embodiments, delivery further includes a physical delivery of a physical embodiment of a document. As discussed below, in some embodiments, delivery further includes transmission of video and\/or audio content, such as by streaming or by physical transport of a tangible medium containing a such video and\/or audio content.","As used herein, a document designated with respect to a respective document delivery transaction, unless otherwise noted where used, is a document intended to be transmitted to an intended recipient.","As used herein, an actuation of a pointer is, unless otherwise noted where used, an activity that results in sending a request for a document designated with respect to a respective document delivery transaction. Examples of actuation of a pointer can include clicking on a link to download a document, sending an email, sending a message using short message service (SMS), sending alternative forms of text messaging, entering a code into a keypad, uttering voice commands, sending messages using social messaging interfaces such as Tweets\u2122 or Facebook\u2122 messages or other message types containing a unique document delivery code, or performing another activity intended to stimulate automated delivery of a document to a user.","As used herein, a centralized document repository is, unless otherwise noted where used, a server or series of servers for storing and delivering documents to users in response to the actuation of pointers, as described above. As used herein, such a server or series of servers may be a single machine or may take the form of instructions executing on a distributed computing system or cloud.","As used herein, an analytic measure is, unless otherwise noted where used, data, measurement or statistical analysis for tracking user interaction with a document. Analytic measures provide information about the number of entities requesting a document and the number of document views, as well as providing information about the behavior of viewers while they are viewing the document. Other examples of analytic measures are hybrids of information directly related to document view behavior with information regarding related commercial behavior. Examples include \u201cconversion efficiency\u201d as described below.","As used herein, a ranking of a plurality of intended document recipients with respect to analytic measures is, unless otherwise noted where used, any process of comparing a value of an analytic measure describing a first user or document to a value of the analytic measure describing a second user or document.","As used herein, a target for subsequent communication is, unless otherwise noted where used, an identity associated with an item of contact information to which a subsequent communication is to be routed based on values of analytic measures.","As used herein, alerting a communication agent to an identity of a target for subsequent communication is, unless otherwise noted where used, any process of prompting a communication agent to initiate a communication to a target for subsequent communication.","As used herein, initiating a subsequent communication is, unless otherwise noted where used, the automated preparation or transmission of a customized message to a target.","As used herein, a transaction conversion is, unless otherwise noted where used, a commercial transaction linked to a document delivery transaction. In some embodiments, the commercial transaction will be an electronic commerce transaction. In other embodiments, the commercial transaction will be a transaction completed through conventional commerce. In some embodiments, embodiments will sometimes maintain a linkage between a commercial transaction and a document delivery transaction through identities associated with an item of contact information.","As used herein, a conversion efficiency is, unless otherwise noted where used, a measure of the frequency with which a document or a subsequent communication results in a transaction conversion. Examples of conversion efficiency include but are not limited to ratios of pointers sent to transaction conversions, ratios of documents delivered to transaction conversions, ratios of subsequent communications to transaction conversions, any of which may be customized to identify the performance of particular documents or document versions, communication agents, communication channels, or the influence of demographic or external factors.","As used herein, a communication agent is, unless otherwise noted where used, an entity or computer program used to prepare, initiate or transmit a communication to a target for subsequent communication.","As used herein, a distinct computing device is, unless otherwise noted where used, a separate user account, computing instance, user identity, MAC address or IP address identifiably distinct from another user account, computing instance, phone number, user identity, MAC address or IP address performing an actuation of a pointer.","As used herein, a particular user is, unless otherwise noted where used, a separate user account, computing instance, phone number, person, unique individual, user identity, MAC address or IP address identifiably distinct from another user account, computing instance, phone number, user identity, MAC address or IP address performing an actuation of a pointer.","As used herein, rates at which respective ones of the plurality of pointers for requesting delivery of one or more documents are transmitted are, unless otherwise noted where used, measures of the frequency, rate, or relative or absolute number of transmissions of respective ones of the plurality of pointers. In some embodiments, rates indicate time-based frequencies. In other embodiments, rates indicate ratio as a fraction of a total sample.","As used herein, a delivery efficiency is, unless otherwise noted where used, a measure of the frequency with which or length of elapsed time until a document is delivered after transmission a pointer.","As used herein, a length of time recorded with respect to an actuation is at least one of a length of time that a document was viewed, a length of time transpiring between delivery of a pointer and forwarding of a pointer by a pointer recipient, a length of time transpiring between delivery of a pointer and actuation of a pointer, or a length of time between delivery of a pointer and transaction conversion.","As used herein, delivery confirmation includes but is not limited to confirmation of physical delivery, confirmation of a download, or confirmation of viewing a portion of a document.","Introduction to One Embodiment of Targeted Message Delivery","Embodiments provide systems and methods for targeted message delivery. A plurality of document delivery transactions are initiated with respect to a plurality of intended document recipients. In some embodiments, initiating the document delivery transactions occurs through manual entry of contact information for one or more intended recipients for each of the plurality of document delivery transactions. In other embodiments, an automated document delivery transaction initiation option is available to receive data in a pre-configured format, such as a physical business card or a v-card, extract contact and identity information, and automatically initiate the document delivery transactions based on the contact and identity information, as well as a set of pre-configured characteristics for automatically triggering initiation.","Some embodiments include a means performing targeted message delivery. For example, a targeted message delivery system may receive input identifying intended document recipients, communicate pointers to the intended document recipients, and target subsequent communications to the intended document recipients based on analytic data resulting from actuations of the pointers. A document delivery module or a target identification module is in some embodiments implemented by a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium and one or more processors (e.g., CPUs) of a computing apparatus. The computer-readable storage medium stores, in some embodiments, program instructions executable by the one or more processors to cause the computing apparatus to perform receiving input identifying intended document recipients, communicating pointers to the intended document recipients, and targeting subsequent communications to the intended document recipients based on analytic data resulting from actuations of the pointers. Other embodiments of the document delivery module and target identification module are at least partially implemented by hardware circuitry and\/or firmware stored, for example, in a non-volatile memory.","A pointer is sent to each of the intended document recipients at an address or other item of contact information. The pointer provides an instruction or addressing value used to initiate, encourage, or complete a transaction involving delivery of a document to an intended recipient. In response to actuations of pointers, documents designated with respect to respective document delivery transactions are delivered from a centralized document repository. Analytic measures with respect to document delivery are recorded. In some embodiments, the analytic measures include various measure of actuations of each of the plurality of pointers. Using the analytic measures, a target is identified for a subsequent communication. In some embodiments, targets are identified based on a ranking with respect to one or more of the analytic measures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","104","106","106","108"],"i":["a","n ","a","n "]},"As used herein, the notation xxxa-xxxn indicates a flexibly variable quantity of a specified item, such as client devices -, and the presence of differently numbered devices bearing the same reference letter (e.g., and ), may but does not necessarily indicate any correspondence or interaction between differently numbered devices bearing the same reference letter. Further, the recurrence of \u2018n\u2019 as an alphabetical designator does not indicate that multiple flexibly variable quantities of devices are equal. Nor does the designation of a single member of such a plurality as \u2018n\u2019 indicate that it necessarily corresponds to an \u2018n\u2019 member of a different plurality, though they may correspond. Further, for simplicity in the following figures, an arrow indicating a communication between modules, processes, or functions may indicate a series of non-identical communications serving different purposes and containing different information in disparate formats.","In one embodiment, communication agents -send initiation requests -to a document delivery module  of targeted communications provider . Each of communication agents -is a data processing system or program used to prepare, initiate or transmit a communication to a target (or potential target) for subsequent communication. Some embodiments of communication agents -perform \u201cdownstream\u201d functions in which communication agents -are used to prepare and transmit a targeted communication  to a target (or potential target) for subsequent communication. Additionally, some embodiments of communication agents -perform \u201cupstream\u201d functions in which communication agents -are used to prepare and send initiation requests -to a targeted communications provider .","As depicted in , each of communication agents -performs an upstream function of sending initiation requests -. In one embodiment, communication interfaces -are used to receive contact information with respect to identities of intended document recipients and to send that contact information with respect to the identities of the intended document recipients to document delivery module  as part of initiation requests -","As one of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand in light of having read the present disclosure, features and capabilities of communication agents -and communication interfaces -vary between embodiments without departing from the scope and intent of the embodiments disclosed herein. In one embodiment, communication agents are deployed as programs presenting free-standing communication interfaces -while executing on conventional data processing systems or terminals, such as that discussed below with respect to . In another embodiment, communication agents -are deployed as programs presenting free-standing communication interfaces -while executing on mobile data processing systems, such as a tablet computer or mobile telephone, which will also contain many of the components discussed below with respect to . In yet another embodiment, communication agents -are deployed as web pages presenting a form for use as a communication interfaces -within a browser window (not shown) of a browser (not shown).","Functions of communication agents -and communication interfaces -likewise vary between embodiments without departing from the scope and intent of the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, in some embodiments, communication interface presents a form for manual entry of contact information with respect to an identity of an intended document recipient through a touch screen or keyboard. In other embodiments, communication interface provides commands for communication agent to read external data , such as a printed business card, an RFID tag, a barcode off of an identification tag, a QR code encoding contact information, or a vcard transmitted through electromagnetic signals (e.g., infra-red or radio frequency emissions from a portable digital assistant).","Embodiments of communication interfaces -also present varying levels of automation with respect to the intake of contact information and the transmission of initiation requests -without departing from the scope and intent of the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, in some embodiments, communication agents -are pre-configured, prior to entry or retrieval of contact information with respect to the identity of the intended document recipient, to automatically send initiation requests -upon receipt of contact information with respect to the identities of the intended document recipients. Such a pre-configuration will, in some embodiments, include designating documents for a document delivery transaction to be associated with contact information with respect to the identity of the intended document recipient contained in such automatically sent initiation requests. In other embodiments, users of communication interfaces -are able to edit contact information with respect to the identity of the intended document recipient, designate documents for a document delivery transaction to be associated with contact information with respect to the identity of the intended document recipient, and otherwise control the content and transmission of initiation requests -, as well as the results of initiation requests -","In some embodiments, upon receipt of initiation requests -, document delivery module  will initiate a plurality of document delivery transactions with respect to a plurality of intended document recipients identified in initiation requests -. In some embodiments, the initiating includes sending over network  to each of the plurality of intended document recipients (e.g., users of client devices , , ) a respective one of a plurality of pointers -for requesting delivery of one or more documents designated with respect to a respective document delivery transaction. Each of the plurality of pointers -is identified with a respective one of the plurality of intended document recipients indicated in initiation requests -. Each of the plurality of pointers -is an instruction or addressing value used to initiate, encourage, or complete a transaction involving delivery of a document to an intended recipient. Examples of pointers -for requesting delivery include a uniform resource identifier (URI) associated with a contact record and providing a location of a document intended for delivery to the intended recipient.","Network  may include any channel for providing effective communication between each of the entities of targeted communications provider . In some embodiments, network  includes an electronic communication network, such as the internet, a local area network (LAN), a cellular communications network, or the like. Network  may include a single network or combination of networks that facilitate communication between each of the entities (e.g., communication agents -, client devices -and targeted communication provider ).","In some embodiments, one or more of pointers -may be forwarded between client devices -. For example, client device forwards a pointer  to client device . While client device is not an intended recipient of one of pointers -, client device may, in some embodiments, use forwarded pointer  to request a document delivery and analytics may be compiled based on the transmission of forwarded pointer  and subsequent use to request delivery. Examples of metrics enabled by tracking of forwarded pointer  include forwarding frequency ratios, measures of virality (e.g., number of forwards, forwards per intended recipient, repeat forwards), and time metrics (e.g. time to forward, time from forward to request), among others, which may be used to identify a potential target for subsequent communications or to rank targets for subsequent communications.","In some embodiments, client devices -request documents -for viewing in document viewer applications -by sending requests -to document delivery module . In some embodiments, sending requests -is accomplished through actuation of respective ones of the plurality of pointers -or forwarded pointer . In response to actuations of respective ones of the plurality of pointers -or forwarded pointer , document delivery module  delivers the one or more documents -designated with respect to the respective document delivery transaction from a centralized document repository. In some embodiments, the centralized document repository is a database  associated with document delivery module . In other embodiments, document delivery module  includes the centralized document repository.","In some embodiments, document delivery module  records analytic measures with respect to the delivering the one or more documents -and\/or their viewing in document viewer applications -. The analytic measures include a measure of actuations of each of the plurality of pointers -, and some embodiments include measures related to behavior of document viewer applications -. In some embodiments, a target identification module  ranks the plurality of intended document recipients (e.g., client devices -) with respect to the analytic measures. Target identification module  identifies a target (e.g., client ) for a subsequent communication  based on the ranking. In some embodiments, target identification module  alerts one or more of communication agents -of the identity of a target for a subsequent communication by sending a target of subsequent communication alert  one or more of communication agents -, which may then initiate subsequent communication .","Introduction to Document Analytics","Target identification module  and document delivery module  may include analytics modules (shown in ) for the collection and processing of analytics data, and the generation of corresponding document metrics (e.g., document requests, document views, repeated document views by a user, length of document views, document downloads, first document requests, document viewers, unique document viewers, repeat document viewers, new document viewers, exit percentages for particular documents or portions of a document, visibility time for a document or portion of a document, viewing session duration for a document or section of a document, document view duration, time on page or section of document, active time of document, engagement time for document viewer applications -, document view depth, document page views per session), document analytics reports including various metrics of the document analytics data and data describing behavior external to the documents (e.g., document conversion efficiencies and\/or subsequent communication conversion efficiency). Analytics data may include data that describes usage and request patterns for documents -and\/or individual pages within the documents -. As used herein, the term analytics data is interchangeable with the term analytic measures.","Analytics data -may include information relating to the activity and interactions of one or more users with a given one of documents -or portions of given documents -. For example, analytics data may include historic and\/or current document request and viewing information for one or more intended recipients, including, but not limited to identification of documents -requested, identification of documents -viewed, identification of conversions (e.g., desired actions taken\u2014such as the purchase of an item) in response to being sent a particular one or more of documents -, number of purchases associated with one or more of documents -, value of purchases associated with one or more of documents -, and other data that may help gauge user interactions with documents -","In some embodiments, document analytics data includes information indicative of a location of one of client devices -. For example, analytics data may include location data indicative of a geographic location of one of client devices -. In some embodiments, location data may be correlated with corresponding user activity, such as viewing one of documents -. For example, a set of received analytics data may include information regarding a user's interaction activity with a document page (e.g., request and viewing) and corresponding location data indicative of a location of the respective one of client devices -at the time of the activity. Thus, in some embodiments, analytics data can be used to assess a user's activity with respect to a document and the corresponding location of the user during the activities. In some embodiments, location data includes geographic location information. For example, location data may include an indication of the geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates), IP address or the like or a user of one or more of client devices -","In some embodiments, document analytics data is accumulated over time to generate a set of analytics data (e.g., a document analytics dataset) that is representative of activity and interactions of one or more users with a given document or set of documents. For example, a document analytics dataset may include document analytics data associated with all document delivery transactions and their respective pointers -. Document analytics data may be processed to generate document metric values or other analytic measures that are indicative of a particular trait or characteristic of the document (e.g., a number of requests -, a number of document views for a particular one of documents -, a number of items purchased in response to views of a particular one of documents -, value of items purchased in response to views of a particular one of documents -, a conversion rate for a particular one of documents -, a promotion effectiveness index rate for a particular one of documents -, etc.).","Additionally, document analytics data may track the relationships between documents -and targeted subsequent communications . For example, a document analytics dataset may include document analytics data associated with all document delivery transactions and their respective subsequent communications. Document analytics data may be processed to generate document metric values that are indicative of a particular trait or characteristic of a subsequent targeted communication (e.g., a number of requests -after the subsequent targeted communication, a number of document views for a particular one of documents -after the targeted subsequent communication, a number of items purchased in response to a targeted subsequent communication, value of items purchased in response to targeted subsequent communications, a conversion rate for a particular one of a group of communication agents sending targeted subsequent communications, a promotion effectiveness index rate for a particular one of the communication agents or a user of the communication agent, etc.).","Targeted communications provider  divides, in some embodiments, the processing and analysis of metrics between target identification module  and document delivery module , such that each of target identification module  and document delivery module  performs different functions, generates different metrics, or is otherwise functionally distinct. Other embodiments do not preserve such distinctions and one of skill in the art will readily realize in light of having read the present disclosure that various embodiments locate various functions in one or the other of target identification module  and document delivery module  or in separate modules or systems without departing from the scope and intent of the embodiments disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, targeted communications provider  may include computer executable code (e.g., executable software modules) stored on a computer readable storage medium that is executable by a computer to provide associated processing. In some embodiments, any of the functions of targeted communications provider , client devices -, and communication agents -may be executed by distinct computing systems or on distributed computing systems, such as a computing cloud.","Document delivery module  may service multiple requests -from one or more client devices -with respect to a single one of documents -. For example, upon loading\/rendering of a document by a document viewer application of client device , document viewer application may generate a second request to document delivery module  via network . Document delivery module  may process the request and return appropriate content (e.g., an image embedded within document ) to document viewer application of client device . In some embodiments, the request includes a request for an image, and document delivery module  simply returns a single transparent pixel for display by document viewer application of client device , thereby fulfilling the request . The request itself may also include document analytics data embedded therein.","Some embodiments support document delivery module  embedding or otherwise providing pointers -to resources, known as \u201cbugs\u201d, within documents -provided to client devices -. The resources may be invisible a user, such as a transparent one-pixel image for display in a document. The pointers -may direct document viewer applications -of client device -to request the resources from document delivery module . Document delivery module  may record the requests and any additional information associated with the request (e.g., the date and time, and\/or identifying information that may be encoded in the resource request).","In some embodiments, requests -may include codes\/strings that are indicative of document analytics data, such as data about a user\/client, the user's computer, the content of the document that has been viewed, or any other document analytics data that is accessible and of interest. A request for an image may include, for example, \u201cimage.gif\/XXX . . . \u201d wherein the string \u201cXXX . . . \u201d is indicative of the document analytics data. For example, the string \u201cXXX\u201d may include information regarding user interaction with a document (e.g., activity data, such as a page of a document that is viewed, or a noise level recorded by a microphone of one of client devices -).","Document delivery module  may parse the request to extract the document analytics data contained within the request. Analytics data may be stored in database  for access by target identification module , or a similar storage\/memory device, in association with other accumulated document analytics data. In some embodiments, target identification module  may receive\/retrieve analytics data from document delivery module  and\/or database . Targeted communications provider  records and processes the analytics data or analytic measures to generate one or more web analytics reports, including graphical displays, identification of targets for subsequent communication, and trend and prediction analysis, as described herein. For example, targeted communications provider  may filter the raw document analytics data received at document delivery module  to be used by target identification  in generating targets for subsequent communications, such as subsequent communication  targeted to client device . Further, reports may be generated by targeted communications provider. Reports, for example, may include overviews and statistical analyses describing the relative frequency with which various site documents are being viewed, the rate of converting a document view to a purchase (e.g., conversion), an effectiveness of various targeted communications, and so forth, and identifying trends in and making predictions from the data as requested.","In some embodiments, client devices -execute software applications, such as document viewer applications -, for accessing and displaying one or more of documents -. In response to a user command, such as actuating a pointer, document viewer applications -may issue document requests -to document delivery module  via network  (e.g., via the Internet). In response to requests -, document delivery module  may transmit the documents -to document viewer applications -. Document viewer applications -may interpret the received documents -to display the requested documents -at user interfaces (e.g., monitor) of client devices -. Document delivery applications -may generate additional requests -for content from the document delivery module , or other remote network locations, as needed.","In some embodiments, client devices -also transmit document viewing tracking information to targeted communications provider .
