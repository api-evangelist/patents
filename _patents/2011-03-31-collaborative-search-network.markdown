{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates to a data search engine, in particular to a network of intelligent computing devices capable of assisting each other in producing accurate and rapid search results.","Today's internet searching is a tedious task that typically begins with interrogating a search engine with queries, reviewing the response to the query, then ranking and classifying, until a suitable set is achieved. For each new search, this painstaking process is repeated by every person or a computer program looking for information on the internet. Each user individually submits queries and separately reviews the results. This process is repeated a multitude of times, even if thousands of other users already searched for the same thing and had already paired the search response from the search engine down to the same or similar set. The present invention will help unify internet searching that is presently being conducted in a disconnected fashion.","Presently collaborative search method must be undertaken contemporaneously, or by a group of searchers working together on a common goal. However, once each member tries a separate and unrelated search, this member will no longer benefit from a team effort, and will instead be forced into the traditional, individual effort of identifying relevant information from millions of probable results. The present invention is particularly useful for scientific and engineering research, where searching tends to be complex and multi-tiered. Currently collaborative research can only be undertaken by universities and think tanks and has to be especially funded due to resources and time involved. However, students or doctorate candidates, who do not have sufficient resources to fund such collaboration, are presently forced to do all of their electronic research alone. Therefore, a pool of prior searches from, for example several schools or campuses, which functions passively and autonomously will be a tremendous low cost enhancement for such uses.","The present invention revolutionizes data searching by creating a constant, passive team of research collaborators where individual search results are available for look-up and review by other participants. It would be preferable potential members are required to agree or consent to participate in the search network. Once consent is obtained. it would not matter which particular searches are going to be executed, alternatively a consent can be obtained prior to each search. Each search by the participants embodied in the present invention is able to access an existing bank of search results and can further improve or create a new set of search results. Instead of starting from scratch each time, each research effort improves an existing knowledge base.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention there is no requirement for expensive computer processing and storage hardware since searches are stored on each client machine that ran the search, with just an identifying stub being sent to a central intelligence unit or to other intelligent clients. Any combination of data search request and the identifying stub creates a coordinate value of the member of the collaborative network. If the search result is lost or can no longer be accessed, the present query and similar subsequent queries will rebuilt this result for the particular collaborative search community by having the current user pair down results to the most relevant subset. In this manner all members have a common incentive in sharing their search results, because by sharing their search results now, they can avail themselves of search results in the future. Furthermore, the present invention does not require any guarantee accuracy or availability of information, since results can be created or supplemented at any point in the future through additional searching.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,836,769 describes a client-server multitasking process comprising: receiving a request comprising searching criteria, comprising search queries, at least two of which comprise different query values directed to different server addresses, criteria specifying for which request group information is to be returned; for the search queries in the specified request group, sending to the server designated by the server address a query derived from the corresponding search query; receiving response information from the servers; processing the response information into a plurality of return groups by associating a different query value with a different one of the return groups and merging into the return group the response information from the servers that received queries directed to the query value associated with the return group; incorporating into the return group means for inputting at least one request for ordering at least one item; consolidating the return groups into a consolidated response; returning the consolidated response.","US Pat. App No. 20090089296 discloses a system for automated aggregation, and possible augmentation, of search results generated or otherwise provided in response to search queries\/requests to multiple network resources, such as search engines, the search requests being originated by client devices; at the direction of a server, to the various network resources. In one embodiment, a user, using a client device, enters a search request which is provided to the server. The search request, which may comprise one or more search terms, may be entered via a web based or client based interface\/application provided via the client device. As will be described, the client device may be any device capable of accessing the server and network resources via a network, such as the Internet. Exemplary client devices include a computer, cell phone, personal digital assistant, network appliance, etc. The server identifies which network resources, out of a set of available network resources, are likely to provide relevant results to the user's query. The server may further modify the search request to increase the likelihood that the search request will return relevant results. The identified list of resources is then provided back to the client device, along with the modified search request if applicable, which then originates and transmits the search request to each of the identified resources or subset thereof. The search results may then be received and presented to The user by the client device. Alternatively, the search results may be passed to the server which processes the search results and then provides the processed search results back to the client device for presentation to the user.","Various implements are known in the art, but fail to address all of the problems solved by the invention described herein. One embodiment of this invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings and will be described in more detail herein below.","The invention relates to a collaborative searching network having at least one intelligent client, a network medium capable of linking the intelligent client with at least one other intelligent client. The disclosed intelligent client is capable of receiving a data search request; and said intelligent client capable of responding with a data search result to said data search request by retrieving data from at least said one other intelligent client or a from computer network.","Therefore, the present invention succeeds in conferring the following, and others not mentioned, desirable and useful benefits and objectives.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a search engine.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a network of clients capable of collaborating together to obtain search results.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a search engine that is capable of applying a team approach to internet searching","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a having at least one intelligent client or a central intelligence unit connected to an intelligent client.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a collaborative network that is almost entirely virtual, with all nodes residing within the world wide web and not on a physically private network.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a for intelligent clients that may be personal computers, smart communication devices, smart terminals or any other type of computing electronic devices.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a collaborative network capable of searching the internet for search results.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an intelligent client capable of engaging the internet, processing a query and responding with search results.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an intelligent client capable of storing and indexing prior search results.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a central intelligence unit or an intelligent client capable of tracking prior search queries and hashing these queries to network members that ran them.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method that teaches a collaborative interne searching by a passive team of researchers as opposed to a coordinated team that deliberately acts with a common objective.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method that teaches a method of establishing a community of users that are able to provide query results to each other.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method having a step of evaluating the difference in response time between local collaborative network and a general interne search.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. Identical elements in the various figures are identified with the same reference numerals.","Reference will now be made in detail to embodiment of the present invention. Such embodiments are provided by way of explanation of the present invention, which is not intended to be limited thereto. In fact, those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate upon reading the present specification and viewing the present drawings that various modifications and variations can be made thereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","30","40","50","60","70","90","100","110","130","140","41","42","41"]},"The collaborative searching network  is shown as a loosely bound set of physical or logical computers or intelligent clients  and  that are capable of communicating with each other over a network medium . Each intelligent client  and  may typically be deployed in an independent sub-network that in turn connects to the world wide web, also known as the internet, or may each reside on the same private network , which connects to other networks . These networks (not shown) may have additional intelligent clients  and  that are part of the same collaborative searching network .","The intelligent clients  and  locate each other via the Transmission control protocol (TCP\/IP) or any other network addressing protocol known in the art. One skilled in the art would appreciate that a network medium  refers to an environment where signals are being sent and received over a medium that may utilize an Ethernet, a wireless LAN, an optical fiber, a microwave, radio or infrared waves, or any combination thereof. Signals travel from source intelligent client  to a target other intelligent client  using an electronic address schema supported by network protocols known in the art, which include but are not limited to telephonic communication protocols. The addresses of both intelligent clients  and  is reported to and being tracked by a domain network service (DNS) running on a centralized server or router or any other type of packet switching device that manages or facilitates communication within such a network. Individual signals may be further directed along a typical network medium  over physical layer using switches, hubs and repeaters and or by means of any other devices and cables found in a typical network.","The intelligent client  preferably generates the data search request . The data search request  is then routed to the other intelligent client  this is likely to contain the desired search result . If the desired search result  is found, the process of data retrieval  occurs, where the search results are aggregated into a single data packet or a series of data packets that are sent back to the requesting intelligent client  of form of a response . Such data packets may be created within a context of internet protocol (IP), or Short Message Service (text messaging) or any other type of message protocol known in the art. One should appreciate that the roles of the intelligent search client and the other\/target intelligent search client may constantly reverse as the intelligent client  may that issues the search request  may be similarly called upon to produce the result  by the other intelligent client . It is therefore preferable that the terms intelligent client and the other intelligent client are a mere semantics that refer to computing devices of same or similar capabilities or devices of different capabilities. The one skilled in the art may further appreciate that the enabling description of the present invention may be varied in significant ways without departing from the overall purpose of the invention, that primarily being a peer to peer network that facilitates collaborative querying and data retrieval.","Still referring to , the collaborative search network  may preferably be maintained and enforced by an automated software agent . The automated software agent  is preferably an application written in a high level language, such as, but not limited to C#, C++, Java or any other computer language known in the art. The automated software agent , may also contain markup and string parsing capabilities by utilizing Shell, Perl, XML, HTML or any other markup or data parsing techniques. Such string parsing capabilities may be required to interact with system processes found on that particular intelligent client device, or to deploy installation and upgrades of the automated software agent . It may also be appreciated by one skilled in the art, that the automated software agent  may function within a commercially available framework, such as but not limited to .Net Framework, WebSphere, Jboss, Tomcat or any other application server framework known in the art. Alternatively, the automated software agent  may interact directly with system and hardware resources offered by a typical Operating system, such as, but not limited to Windows OS, Apple Macintosh, Unix, Linux, Aix or Solaris. The automated software agent  may listen for connections from packets sent by intelligent clients  and  by registering a port in a Portmapper type Utility found on Unix and Windows, or by utilizing a similar Utility in another operating system. Alternatively, the automated software agent  may utilize a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) addressing registered with a local web server, such as IIS, Iplanet or Apache or any other web server known in the art. One skilled in the art will appreciate that any other types of addressing paradigms and infrastructure can be used to enable the flow of data between intelligent clients  and  or any other members embodied in the present invention.","The automated software agent  may provide its own search interface (one example shown in ) that is capable of accepting a search request  and displaying a search result . Alternatively, the automated software agent  may be installed as wrapper software around an internet browser's native application programming interface or API. In yet another alternative the automated software agent  may listen to entries being made into a freely available search engine, such as but not limited to Google, Yahoo or Bing, or any other search engine available. The latter arrangement can be accomplished by initially activating a wrapper utility around a Google search window, which would be triggered when a URL for Google or some other search engine is entered into a web browser. It will be appreciated by the one skilled in the art that the present invention may be used with any type of web browser, such as but not limited to Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera or any combination thereof.","This wrapper software would preferably function by first accepting the search request string as input from the user, which would then be passed to the automated software agent . The automated software agent  then tries to determine whether a search result  can be obtained from another intelligent client  within the collaborative searching network . If the automated software agent  determines that such a search result cannot be obtained from any of the other intelligent clients  on the collaborative network , it will pass the search request  to the Google search engine, or another search engine, which will perform a standard internet based search.","For the purpose of this disclosure the terms internet or computer network are used to refer to a two or more computers or other processing devices linked together by a network medium. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP\/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. Within this definition, the term computer network may refer to the internet or to a more localized network.","The search result  is preferably stored locally by the intelligent client . The automated software agent  is preferably capable of recording the search query  and result  by storing the actual query string, a compressed search result and a stub, or coordinate value of a collaborative network member, which may be a file that would record the address or identifying information of the intelligent client , as well as the compressed search result This search query and stub would then be communicated to all the other automated software agents  running on other intelligent clients  within the collaborative search network  or to the agent  running on a central intelligence unit  (). The automated software agent  thus keeps track of searches and search results and track of intelligent clients executing them, both locally  and by other clients .","As a further enhancement, the automated software agent  may write search results and queries into a database that may be subdivided for viewing into a series of indexes which are then sorted by age. Thus a quick search would only look through most recent indexes and a more thorough and time consuming search would interrogate additional indexes or a complete set of indexes. The automated software agent  may use a commercially available database server to support its storage requirements or may compile its own storage files using raw data devices, comma separated files or hashed file combinations or any other known or novel means of organizing and storing large amounts of data. It may be highly desirable that the automated software agents  within the same collaborative network  have a mechanism for syncing up their local records against records circulated among each intelligent client  and  and central intelligence unit  (), so that the content of the data search result bank  builds up content over time, while remaining uniform among all of the intelligent clients  and  within a particular collaborative search network .","Still referring to , the authentication mechanism  may be a commercially available firewall, a security utility provided by the automated software agent  or a hardware authentication device, such as a router or a proxy server. The authentication mechanism  may also be enabled through a synchronized circulation of encryption certificates among all of the members of the collaborative searching network , with members being the intelligent clients  and  or the central intelligence unit  (). Each message circulating within such a collaborative search network  would then be encrypted using the protocol or key specified by such a certificate. The authentication mechanism  is highly preferable but may not represent one of the essential components of the present invention.","Collaboration and communication among the members of the collaborative searching network  may also preferably be conducted through the automated software agent . The automated software agent  may be capable of supplying authentication data to outgoing search requests  and incoming search requests , as well as authenticating other traffic to and from intelligent clients  and . The authentication  may be in form of certificates shared among members, or with login and password. In case of login password authentication, each intelligent client  would preferably be required to register with all other intelligent clients  and vice versa or with the central intelligence unit  (). There may be other authentication alternatives which are implied here but not expressly enumerated.","As mentioned above, the automated software agent  is preferably capable of determining the most efficient path of returning search results to the data search requests . One way how this may be accomplished is with the automated software agent  first reviewing the search result bank  that is local to the physical machine, where this instance of the software agent  is running, with the objective of verifying whether such a search query  has ever been executed before and at what intervals. If the same or similar query  is not located locally, the other intelligent client  or the central intelligence unit  () that is on record for having the data search result  would then be interrogated in a similar way. The response time for this process would then be recorded in a separate variable. The automated search agent  may also run a preliminary search using a known internet search engine to determine the initial pool of results that a user may have to sift through. The automated search agent  may then compare the two paths and attempt to estimate which would lead to greater precision, which path would require additional sorting by the requester, and with both of these factors in mind, which path would take longer. There may still be other algorithms for evaluating most efficient path that determine the best search route to take for a given query.","Turning now to , there shown is another embodiment of the present invention. Shown is a collaborative searching network , at least one intelligent client , a network medium , at least one other intelligent client , a data search request , a response , a data search result , a central intelligence unit , a data retrieval , a search result sorting and storing , a data search result bank , a data search query , an automated software agent , and an authentication . In this embodiment, a central intelligence unit  is responsible for maintaining and managing the collaborative searching network . Shown also is a typical path  of a data search request , originating from the intelligent client  and destined for the central intelligence unit . A data retrieval and response shown as  is being sent in response from the central intelligence unit . In this case the responder is the central intelligence unit , but may also be one of the other intelligent clients . The central intelligence unit  or one of the other intelligent clients  may be initially responding with the location of the desired data search result  and the client  would need to make a subsequent request directed at the actual location of this search result .","The central intelligence unit  may be a single server or a cluster of servers, running Windows or UNIX or Linux flavor or any other known operating system. The central intelligence unit  may preferably be capable of increased data throughput and data storage to provide support a large number of simultaneous requests  and responses  from various intelligent clients  and .","The automated software agent  as shown in  may primarily be running on the central intelligence unit  and may have listener or client processes  on intelligent clients  and . Alternatively, the automated software agent  may be the same everywhere, with the automated software agent  residing on the central intelligence unit  capable of assuming greater responsibility. In the latter embodiment, a fail-over scenario may include one of automated software agents  residing on one of the intelligent clients  or  assuming greater responsibility in the event of a failure of the central intelligence unit  or any software component thereon.","Still referring to , the intelligent clients  and  may be but are not limited to personal computers, web books, electronic personal assistants such as Apple\u00ae ipads, personal organizers, cellular phones, television units with or without internet hookup, or any other devices having an internet hookup or an ability to connect to a network. All of such devices may be equipped with a version of automated software agent  for storing and sorting queries  in a local search result bank  or on a result bank  residing on the central intelligence unit , or in an independent third location accessible by either the central intelligence unit  or the intelligent clients  and .","In the embodiment shown in , when a user of an intelligent client  or  enters a query, it is first processed by an automated software agent  that is running locally or on the central intelligent unit . The automated software agent  tries to determine if this search query was ever executed before by user or by another intelligent client  or by the same intelligent client . To do so, the automated software agent  may access a list of prior queries  that is preferably mapped according to last access date or according to the address of an intelligent client  or  that hosted such a search before and has stored the response in its search bank . Such a list may be in form of a hash table . Alternatively, this may be a series of tables in a database having relevant fields mapped to each other with the interne addresses of intelligent clients  and  serving as primary keys. In another alternative, recognizing that internet addresses often change, individual intelligent clients  and  may be tracked based on user id or unique identifier used by the user to participate in the collaborative network . The unique identification need not be linked to a specific physical device, but may be linked to a specific user or organization. Such an identification may be passed between intelligent clients  and  after first being authenticated by the authentication module . These identifiers may be, but are not limited to cookies and certificates. Issuance, tracking and maintaining of such identifiers may be assigned in whole or in part to the automated software agent  residing on the central intelligence unit . Issuance, tracking and maintenance of identifiers or other security features may also be performed by the authentication module  or by a third party security product that may be able to interact with the automated software agent , through a series of API calls.","Still referring to , the automated software agent  residing the central intelligence unit  may preferably be capable of maintaining a status list of intelligent clients  and  that sent a search query  or a response , or which have acknowledged a polling request from this automated software agent . The list of such intelligent clients  and  may be stored entirely on the central intelligence unit  or may be circulated throughout the collaborative search network . Identifiers or logins into the collaborative search network may be physical servers or may be based on individual users and not connected with any particular physical device. Such identifiers may be unique user names assigned to individual users or unique numeric or alphanumeric identifiers assigned to each intelligent client  or . In yet another alternative each intelligent client may be authenticated based on it Media access control or Mac address of its network interface or by any combination of factors. Any type of intelligent client authentication would preferably be carried out by the authenticator process , which may be a firewall or a network based service, such as but not limited to Network Information System (NIS), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or by any other Means. The authenticator process  may reside on the central intelligence unit  or on the intelligent clients  or , in which case each authenticator process  may be synchronized among all network members or may be independent for each specific member. The authentication may also be stateless with the authenticator  recognizing a specific key used by members, with this key being shared among members.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","40","80","35","20","40","35","35","30","40","20","40","80","130","20","40","80","130","80","20","40"]},"It is preferable that the automated software agent  residing on the central intelligence unit  or the one residing on the intelligent clients  and  be capable of determining the most efficient way of delivering a search response . This may be done by estimating search response time and degree of precision when searching using a known search engine versus search response time and degree of precision when searching for results among members of the collaborative search network . In an alternative embodiment, a user may be presented with a choice of searching directly via the internet bypassing the collaborative search network  or to first attempt to obtain results from at least one other intelligent client  within the collaborative search network  and if that is not successful to try a broader internet search, or stop searching altogether.","In another alternative, more than one collaborative searching networks  may be linked together to expand the size and collaborative search capability of the present invention. Depending on scale of a typical network, there may be a need to introduce sub units of central intelligent unit  (not shown) that may be subservient to one or several main central intelligent units  or may be collaborative but independent from each other. Multi-collaborative network architecture may minimize the time it would take to search the entire combined collaborative network by first searching a local circle of intelligent clients  and , and only then expand to other intelligent clients by handing off the request to more centralized central intelligent units , or to collaborating peer central intelligent units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["50","60","52","62","64","50","60","50"]},"The search request  is preferably submitted to the automated software agent  via an API call or an http put statement or any other inter-process communication between the front end browser or user interface utility and the back end processes of the automated software agent .

Such a data search bank  may be stored locally as illustrated in  or may be stored remotely as shown in . Once a prior search and the associated intelligent client identification information is located, the data retrieval process  is performed to obtain the contents of the search. The desired data search result  is then sent as a search result  to the requesting intelligent client .
