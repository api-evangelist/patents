title: Image positioning method and system for tomosynthesis in a digital X-ray radiography system
abstract: The present invention provides a method and system for determining the position of the image of a target object or the position of the x-ray source in digital tomosynthesis, as the x-ray source is moved relative to the object so as to obtain multiple two-dimensional images of the object from multiple angles. At least one marker, characterized by a simple and known image pattern, is disposed between an x-ray source and a detector system. The shift in the image of the object, resulting from the movement of the x-ray source during tomosynthesis, is calculated to a desired resolution using the readily observable shift in the image of the marker. The x-ray source may be translated along a plane parallel to the plane of the detector system, or may be rotated about a fixed center.

No. 60\/316,511, entitled \u201cA Digital X-Ray Radiography System For Tomosynthesis,\u201d filed on Aug. 31, 2001.","The U.S. Government has no interest in or to this patent.","The present invention relates generally to tomosynthesis, and more particularly to an image positioning method and system for digital tomosynthesis.","Standard x-ray radiography allows an x-ray image of a target object to be obtained, by capturing x-rays transmitted through the object onto a film screen. The x-ray image is a projection of the object along the x-ray direction. In the x-ray image, variations in the composition and thickness of the target object in different regions of the object are revealed, as a result of their differential absorption of the x-rays.","Digital radiography allows x-ray images to be captured digitally. Typically, an array of digital detectors and a digital image processor are used. Digital radiography systems allow the radiologist to window the image, i.e. to adjust the image's contrast. In this way, subtle details, which may be missed by the fixed, limited contrast in traditional film-screen radiography, can be detected. Thus, digital x-ray systems produce images having a greatly enhanced contrast, compared to the contrast in the images obtained by traditional film-screen radiography. the resolution of digital x-ray images is also greatly enhanced compared to the resolution of images obtained using other techniques, for example CT scanning.","There is no depth information, however, in the images obtained by stationary two-dimensional arrays of digital detectors, unlike in the images obtained by CT scanning. Digital x-ray systems produce 2-D images of the object, as projected along the x-ray direction and onto a lateral plane parallel to the plane formed by the detectors. These 2-D images have no resolution in the longitudinal dimension parallel to the x-ray beam and orthogonal to the detector plane formed by the detectors.","Digital tomosynthesis enables a three-dimensional (3-D) image of an object to be constructed from a finite set of 2-D projection images of the object, by acquiring multiple 2-D images from multiple angles, and then reconstituting the data. Using digital tomosynthesis, a certain degree of resolution can be produced in the longitudinal dimension. Typically, in digital tomosynthesis systems the x-ray source is rotated during data acquisition, for example in an arc through a limited angular range, and a set of projection radiographs of the object are acquired by a stationary detector at discrete locations of the x-ray source. In many systems, the digital x-ray detector array and the object are maintained in a stationary or fixed position, while the x-ray source is moved to multiple locations in order to obtain a collection of images from different view angles.","The multiple 2-D images are then combined or synthesized, using known digital averaging and filtering techniques. Each synthesized image is focused on a tomography plane, which is parallel to the detector plane, and which is located at a certain depth along the longitudinal direction. In a simplest method, the 2-D projection images are spatially translated with respect to each other, and superimposed in such a way that the images overlap precisely in the tomography plane. Other methods for reconstructing tomographic images may use sophisticated computation techniques similar to those used in computerized tomography (CT) systems. The location of the tomography plane within the object can be varied, and a 2-D image of the object can be obtained for each location of the tomography plane.","One of the drawbacks of digital tomosynthesis is that the relative location of the x-ray source with respect to the detector array must be known with great precision, as the x-ray source is being moved with respect to the object being imaged. In the process of synthesizing the images, it is necessary to align the collected images with a precision equal to, or better than, the lateral resolution. It is difficult, however, to move the x-ray source to multiple positions with the requisite degree of precision. Uncertainties in the position of the x-ray source and\/or the x-ray detector generally contribute to image blurring.","Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a high-precision image positioning method and system for digital tomosynthesis that allows the position of the x-ray source and the object to be determined within a desired resolution, without requiring precise physical positioning of the x-ray source at the desired resolution. Such high-precision image positioning method and system would greatly reduce the mechanical requirement of the imaging system for tomosynthesis.","The present invention features a high-precision image positioning method and system for tomosynthesis, in a digital x-ray radiography system. In the present invention, the image of one or more high-precision markers is used to calculate the required shift in a collection of 2-D images of an object, as the x-ray source is moved in order to generate a plurality of 2-D images from multiple viewing angles. The method and system of the present invention thus allows the necessary shift to be calculated at high precision for each of the plurality of images used in digital tomosynthesis, without requiring the x-ray source to be accurately positioned, each time it is moved.","A high-precision image positioning system in accordance with the present invention includes an x-ray source for generating x-rays directed toward a target object, a digital x-ray detector system disposed in a detector plane, and one or more markers disposed between the x-ray source and the detector system. The markers are configured in accordance with a specific design. The digital detector system detects x-rays transmitted through the object, and generates object image data for an image of the object projected along the detector plane.","Preferably, the marker is configured in a simple and known pattern, on a plane parallel to the detector plane. The position of the marker is fixed with respect to the detector. The detector detects the x-rays transmitted through the marker, and generates marker image on the detector plane. Because of the simple and known image pattern, the marker image data are easily identifiable by a computer program.","A translation of the x-ray source within a lateral plane parallel to the detector plane produces a corresponding shift in the image of the marker. The shift in the image of the object, which results from the displacement of the x-ray source, can be calculated from the readily observable shift in the image of the marker, and from the known distance of the object from the detector plane along a longitudinal direction parallel to the x-rays.","The x-ray source may be moved in both the x- and y-directions within the lateral plane, in order to improve the image quality of the resulting synthesized image. In this case, multiple markers are used, in order to detect the shifts in both the x- and y-directions. Markers may also be used in a tomography system having a rotating x-ray source, in order to detect the rotation angle of the x-ray source.","The present invention features a method and system for aligning the two-dimensional image data in a digital tomosynthesis system. In the present invention, the shift required for each 2-D image used in digital tomosynthesis to synthesize or reconstruct a 3-D image is calculated, using the image of one or more markers having a specifically designed pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","12","14","12","14","18","12","20","20","12","14","20"]},"The x-ray detector system  receives x-rays that have passed through the object , and generates intensity signals related to the intensity of the transmitted x-rays. The detector system  is preferably a planar detector array, and includes a two-dimensional planar array of x-ray detection elements lying in the detector plane . In one form, each of the detection elements may include a scintillator element, responsive to incident x-rays to produce light photons, and a photodiode which produces a digitized signal representation of the x-ray flux incident on the scintillator element. Alternatively, the system  may be a direct digital detector system, in which x-ray signals are converted into digital images at the detection elements themselves, the images being digitized into a matrix of pixels, and each pixel being coded digitally.","The system  may also include a digital image processor [not shown] connected to the detector system  for processing data produced by the detector system  in response to incident x-rays, so that an image of the object projected on the detector plane  can be constructed. The system  may further include a motion controller [not shown] for moving the x-ray source  during tomosynthesis.","Tomosynthesis allows reconstruction of the image of any plane within the target object that is parallel to the detector plane . A finite set of 2-D projection images, which are acquired from multiple viewing angles corresponding to different positions of the x-ray source , are spatially translated with respect to each other. In the simplest reconstruction method, these 2D projection images are superimposed in such a way that the images of the object overlap exactly in a desired tomography plane . Other reconstruction methods require more sophisticated computations, thus also require high precision in the alignment of these 2D projection images. The tomography plane  is parallel to the detector plane . Preferably, the detector plane  is defined by mutually perpendicular x- and y-coordinate axes, as indicated in .","The tomography plane  is located at a certain depth along a longitudinal direction (shown as the z-coordinate in ) orthogonal to the detector plane . In the simplest reconstruction method, the location of the tomosynthesis plane  within the object can be varied along the z-axis by varying the amount of relative translation of the projection images. Each time the tomosynthesis plane  is varied, the image data corresponding to the overlapping structures are superimposed exactly at the new location of the tornosynthesis plane, so that a two-dimensional image of the object, as focused in the desired tomosynthesis plane, can be obtained. A 3-D image of the object is generated from the resulting set of synthesized 2-D images, focused at each desired location of the tomography plane .","In the process of synthesizing images in each tomography plane , it is necessary to align the collected images with a precision equal to, or better than, the lateral resolution of the detector system . Each time the x-ray source  is moved during tomosynthesis, therefore, the relative location of the x-ray source  with respect to the detector array must be known with great precision, in order to correctly align each of the collected images in the tomography plane . Typically, the spacing between adjacent detector elements in the detector array may be about 50 microns, and the corresponding lateral image resolution may be in the order of around 0.1 mm. It is very difficult to move the x-ray source  to multiple positions with a precision corresponding to such orders of magnitude.","The present invention relies on one or more precisely designed markers , placed between the x-ray source  and the detector array , to trace the position of the x-ray source  as the source is moved to multiple locations. In this way, accurate positioning of the x-ray source  is not necessary, and the mechanical requirements of the tomosynthesis system  is greatly reduced. In a preferred embodiment, the marker  is disposed on a lateral plane  parallel to the detector plane , as illustrated in , which shows the relative geometry of the x-ray source , the marker , the object being imaged, and the detector array . Preferably, the locations of the one or more markers  are fixed with respect to the detector array  during collection of multiple images. Preferably, the image of the marker  does not overlap with the image of the target object . Therefore, the marker  is preferably placed near the edge of the field of view.","The marker  is characterized by a simple and known pattern, and can thus be easily identified from the image data. The location of the marker  can thus be accurately calculated from the image data.  illustrates a marker  constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The marker  is preferably constructed from a high-contrast material, and includes a set of stripes or wires in a pre-defined pattern. In the embodiment illustrated in , the marker  consists of four straight and parallel stripes  of high-contrast material, which may include, but is not limited to, metal. The marker  may be fabricated using printed circuit technology, for example. The marker  leaves a signature like a simple barcode in the image data, from which the position of the x-ray source  can be traced. In other words, the easily identifiable image of the marker  is used as a measure of the relative position of the x-ray source .","As the x-ray source is moved laterally (i.e. within a lateral plane parallel to the detector plane) from one position to another, the image of the marker shifts from one location of the detector array to another.  illustrates the correlation between a lateral displacement of the x-ray source  and the resulting shift in the image of the marker . For simplicity, a lateral displacement along the x-direction from a position S(x) to S(x) is shown. As shown in , when the x-ray source  is moved in a lateral direction perpendicular to the stripes on the marker, the image of the marker  is shifted sideways.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["16","20","12","12","14","12","12","12","1","1","2","2","12","12","16","12","12","16","12","16"],"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["Xs=\u0394Xm","Zs\u2212Zm","Zm."]},"As seen from , if P is a point of interest in the object being imaged, the image location of this point P is shifted by\n\n\u0394\/().\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nIn equation (2) above, \u0394Xp represents the shift in the image of the point P within the object , resulting from the displacement of the x-ray source ; and Zp represents the longitudinal distance of the point P, i.e. the distance of the point P from the detector plane along the z-direction. (\u0394Xs and Zs represent the same as discussed in conjunction with equation (1) above). Using equation (1) in equation (2), the shift in the image of P is related to the shift in the image of the marker by\n\n\u0394()*()\/()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nIn equation (3), the distance Zm is greater than Zp. The last factor in Equation (3) is therefore always less than 1.\n","Equation (3) shows that the shift in the image of any point of interest within the object  is correlated by a simple and known relationship to the lateral shift in the image of the marker . This shift is readily identifiable and calculable, as discussed above in paragraph . As seen in Equation (3), the shift in the image of point P within the object can be easily determined from the lateral shift \u0394Xm of the marker , and the longitudinal distances of the point P, the x-ray source , and the marker , respectively, from the detector plane. The shift in the image of point P can thus be determined, without repeatedly having to determine the position of the x-ray source with extreme precision.","As long as the x-ray source  moves within the same lateral plane parallel to the detector array , the shifts \u0394Xm and \u0394Xp are independent of the x- and the y-coordinate location of the x-ray source  within the lateral plane. In this kind of a tomosynthesis system, every pixel of the same image is shifted by the same amount while being synthesizing with other images, thereby simplifying tomosynthesis calculations considerably.","In the present invention, the shift in the image of an object point P can be calculated with a resolution comparable to the lateral resolution of the detector system , by using the marker . If the shift in the image of the marker, \u0394Xm, is calculated with an error of \u0394Xm, the resultant error in the shift of object, \u0394Xp, can be expressed as\n\n\u03b4*()\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThus, for example, if the z-coordinate of the point is half way between the marker  and the detector array , the uncertainty in the object's shift is less than half of the error in the marker's shift.\n","From Equation (4), it appears that as the marker  is placed closer to the x-ray source , the error in determining the shift in the image of the object  is reduced. In practice, this is not necessary true. Because the x-ray source  has a finite size in a focal spot within an anode inside the source, the sharpness of the image diminishes, as the marker  is moved closer to the x-ray source . Consequently, the accuracy in the location of the marker's image is decreased. Also, the shift in the image of the marker  increases, so that the marker's image becomes more likely to overlap with the object's image.","In the lateral dimension, the marker  can be placed anywhere within the field of view and preferably out of the object's region. In the longitudinal dimension, the marker's z-position affects the accuracy of the calculated shift in the object's image. If the error of the marker's z-position is \u03b4(Zm), the error in the object's lateral shift is given by:\n\n\u03b4(\u0394)\u2245*\u03b4()\/\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nIn equation (5) above, an approximate value of 1 is used for the last factor of Equation (3).\n","As seen from equation (5) above, the error in the marker's z-position introduces the same degree of error in the lateral shift in the image of the object . The lateral shift is used to align the image for generating a tomosynthesis image targeted at a tomography plane located at a certain depth (i.e. z-coordinate value) of the object. An error in the lateral shift is equivalent to an error in the targeted depth. If the shift \u0394Xp is used for the tomosynthesis, the error is reflected in the depth by\n\n\u03b4()\u2245\u03b4()*(\u0394).\u2003\u2003(6)\n","As seen from equation (6) above, the error \u03b4(Zp) in the longitudinal distance (along the z-direction) of the point P within the object is independent of the lateral location of the object. As long as the shift of the marker  is calculated accurately from the image data, therefore, all pixels of the image will align accurately with other images in generating a synthesized image. Because of the uncertainty \u03b4(Zm) in the z-position of the marker , however, the depth of the synthesized image is offset by \u03b4(Zp), for all pixels. A small uncertainty in the depth (or z-coordinate) of the synthesized image is not a concern, however. If equal spacing is used in selecting the z-coordinate Zp of the point P, for computing the shift \u0394Xp in the image of the point P, the synthesized images will still have equal spacing in depth. The accuracy of the marker's z-position along the z-direction therefore does not affect the image quality of the tomosynthesis images. The marker  should, however, be maintained in a fixed position relative to the detector array, during the course of taking multiple exposures from the x-ray source at different locations.","The accuracy of the measurement of the shift in the image of the point P in the object depends on the specific image pattern of the marker , and the calculation algorithm. A marker with stripes along the direction of the detector column casts its image on multiple rows of the detector array. Depending on the alignment of the stripe with the column, the shift can be calculated for each row and then averaged from multiple rows, or the image data can be averaged first before calculating the shift. The simplest example of a marker is a single stripe. In that case, the centroid of the marker's image intensity can be calculated from one or more rows of image data to be the location of the marker.","A more complicated pattern consists of multiple stripes, with equal spacing between the stripes.  illustrates a marker  having a plurality of equally spaced stripes, and a resulting image intensity characterized by a periodic pattern. In this case, the image intensity is a periodical function along the direction of a detector row. The phase information in the image intensity function can be used to determine the image location, within a precision that is of the order of a fraction of the detector spacing. As mentioned earlier, the detector spacing may typically be in the order of about 50 microns. In other words, the marker produces a phase-encoded signal on the image. The phase information calculated from the image data provides the details necessary for locating the marker image from the image data, with fine precision.","Depending of the size and positioning of the object, the image of the marker  may occasionally overlap with the outer regions of the image of the object . Because the image pattern of the marker  is known a priori, it is possible to remove the image of the marker  from the image of the object . The removal process is even simpler if the image of the marker is not overlapped with the image of the object.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the x-ray source  is translated along another lateral direction, i.e. the y-direction, in addition to being translated along the x-direction. In this way, additional image data can be acquired for the tomosynthesis process. The same type of marker  is preferably used to measure and calculate the shift required in the other lateral direction (y-direction) for tomosynthesis. When the x-ray source  is translated along the y-direction, the orientation of the marker  is rotated so that the pattern formed by the parallel stripes line up along the y-direction. In this embodiment, one or more markers  are used for measuring the shift of the image of the object  in the x-direction, and one or more separate markers are used for measuring the shift of the object image in the y-direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["16","12","40","42","42","16","40","16"]},"In the embodiment illustrated in , a plurality of markers  are used, in order to measure shifts in both the x- and the y-directions. When moving the x-ray source  during tomosynthesis, the x-ray source  may not translate perfectly along the x-direction. A deviation to the y-direction will cause a misalignment of the images in the y-direction. It is therefore preferable to measure and use shifts in both the x- and the y-directions for tomosynthesis, whether the x-ray source  is translated in one lateral dimension or two.","It is also preferable to use markers at multiple locations, in order to measure the shift in each direction. In this way, redundant data can be obtained so that the image locations can be calculated more accurately. Furthermore, a marker  may get out of the field of view at certain angles of the x-ray. In this case, the other marker at the other end provides a cover. Likewise, a marker may fall into the object region at certain angles and become less accurate in measuring the shift. In this case, the other marker  enhances the accuracy of the measurement.","In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the x-ray source  is rotated, rather than being translated.  illustrates the shifts in the images of a marker  and an object  in a digital tomosynthesis system  that includes a rotating x-ray source . In the system , the x-ray source  is rotated about a fixed rotation center , which is located at a distance R from the x-ray source . The requisite shift in the image of an object  for performing tomosynthesis depends on the rotation angle \u03b8s and radius R. Assuming the radius R is known precisely and held constant all the time, the shift needed for a point P in the object  at a location (Xp, Yp, Zp) depends on the change in rotation angle, \u0394\u03b8s, and on the lateral coordinate Xp. But, unlike in the case of planar translation (represented by equation (3) in paragraph 35), the shift also depends slightly on the lateral coordinate Yp and the longitudinal coordinate Zp. Qualitatively, it can be expressed as a function g of these variables as\n\n\u0394(\u0394\u03b8)\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nThe change in the rotation angle can be derived from the shift in the marker's image by a function \u0192, namely,\n\n\u0394\u03b8(\u0394)\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nAccordingly, the shift in the image of the point P within the object can be obtained from the shift of the marker's image according to a function h as follows:\n\n\u0394(\u0394)\u2003\u2003(9)\n","In equations (8) and (9) above, the lateral coordinates (i.e., Xp, Yp, Xm, and Ym) are measured against the center of the rotation. Also, in Equation (8) \u0394\u03b8s depends on Xm, Ym, and Zm. Although the x-, y-, and z-coordinates are held constant throughout the multiple exposures at different rotation angles, the error in setting these constants in Equation (9) will introduce a corresponding error in \u0394Xp. Unlike the case in which the x-ray source  is translated within a lateral plane, such an error depends on Xp and Yp. As the result, the effect of focusing at a targeted depth varies across the lateral dimension. In other words, the focusing is not as sharp and uniform as in the case of a planar translation of the x-ray source . In addition, the focused region is deviated from a plane.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the marker's image is used to measure the rotation angle with high precision. The rotation angles for multiple exposures do not have to be precise. However, the location of the detector and the location of the marker with respect to the center of rotation must be known fairly accurately, and must be held constant.","In sum, the present invention features a method and system for aligning image data for tomosynthesis in a digital radiography system. The method and system of the present invention does not require precise and reproducible positioning of the x-ray source during tomosynthesis. The image of one or more precisely designed markers are used as traces to calculate the amount of lateral shift required for each of the collection of images used to generate a synthesized image. While the marker's location need not be known with precision, it is important that the marker be maintained at a same location with respect to the detector array, during multiple exposures of the x-rays from different locations of the x-ray source.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
