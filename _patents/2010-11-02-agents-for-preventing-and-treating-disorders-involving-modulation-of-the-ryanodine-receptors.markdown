The contents of each application mentioned above are expressly incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under grant number ARMY W911NF-05-1-0462 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to compounds and their use to treat and prevent disorders and diseases associated with the ryanodine receptors that regulate calcium channel functioning in cells. More particularly, the invention discloses compounds that are related to 1,4-benzothiazepines and are useful to treat cardiac diseases and disorders, skeletal muscle diseases and disorders, as well as diseases, disorders and conditions affecting the nervous system, such as neuropathies, seizures, and disorders affecting cognitive functioning. The invention also discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and articles of manufacture comprising the pharmaceutical compositions.","The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) functions, among other things, as a specialized intracellular calcium (Ca) store. Channels in the SR called ryanodine receptors (RyRs) open and close to regulate the release of Ca from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm of the cell. Release of Ca into the cytoplasm from the SR increases cytoplasmic Caconcentration. Open probability (Po) of the RyR receptor refers to the likelihood that the RyR channel is open at any given moment, and therefore capable of releasing Ca into the cytoplasm from the SR.","There are three types of ryanodine receptors, all of which are Ca channels: RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3. RyR1 is found predominantly in skeletal muscle as well as other tissues, RyR2 is found predominantly in the heart as well as other tissues, and RyR3 is found in the brain as well as other tissues. The RyR channels are formed by four RyR polypeptides in association with four FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), specifically FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Calstabin1 binds to RyR1, calstabin2 binds to RyR2, and calstabin1 binds to RyR3. The FKBP proteins (calstabin1 and calstabin2) bind to the RyR channel (one molecule per RyR subunit), stabilize RyR-channel functioning, and facilitate coupled gating between neighboring RyR channels, thereby preventing abnormal activation of the channel during the channel's closed state.","Protein kinase A (PKA) binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the RyR receptors. PKA phosphorylation of the RyR receptors causes partial dissociation of calstabins from RyRs. Dissociation of calstabin from RyR causes increased open probability of RyR, and therefore increased Ca release from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm.","Ca release from the SR in skeletal muscle cells and heart cells is a key physiological mechanism that controls muscle performance, because increased concentration of Ca in the intracellular cytoplasm causes contraction of the muscle.","Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles involves electrical depolarization of the plasma membrane in the transverse tubule (T-tubule), which activates voltage-gated L-type Ca channels (LTCCs). LTCCs trigger Ca release from the SR through physical interaction with RyR1. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic Ca concentration induces actin-myosin interaction and muscle contraction. To enable relaxation, intracellular Ca is pumped back into the SR via SR Ca-ATPase pumps (SERCAs), which is regulated by phospholamban (PLB) depending on the muscle fiber type.","It has been shown that disease forms that result in sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma catecholamine levels cause maladaptive activation of intracellular stress pathways resulting in destabilization of the RyR1 channel closed state and intracellular Ca leak. SR Ca leak via RyR1 channels was found to deplete intracellular SR calcium stores, to increase compensatory energy consumption, and to result in significant acceleration of muscle fatigue. The stress-induced muscle defect permanently reduces isolated muscle and in vivo performance particularly in situations of increased demand.","It also has been shown that destabilization of the RyR1 closed state occurs under pathologic conditions of increased sympathetic activation and involves depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 (FKBP12) channel subunit. Proof-of-principle experiments have shown that PKA activation as an end effector of the sympathetic nervous systems increases RyR1 PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2843 which decreases the binding affinity of calstabin1 to RyR1 and increases channel open probability.","In cardiac striated muscle, RyR2 is the major Ca-release channel required for EC coupling and muscle contraction. During EC coupling, depolarization of the cardiac-muscle cell membrane during phase zero of the action potential activates voltage-gated Ca channels. Ca influx through the open voltage-gated channels in turn initiates Ca release from the SR via RyR2. This process is known as Ca-induced Ca release. The RyR2-mediated, Ca-induced Ca release then activates the contractile proteins in the cardiac cell, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction.","Phosphorylation of cardiac RyR2 by PKA is an important part of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response that increases cardiac EC coupling gain by augmenting the amount of Ca released for a given trigger. This signaling pathway provides a mechanism by which activation of the sympathetic nervous system, in response to stress, results in increased cardiac output. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 increases the open probability of the channel by dissociating calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the channel complex. This, in turn, increases the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca-dependent activation.","Despite advances in treatment, heart failure remains an important cause of mortality in Western countries. An important hallmark of heart failure is reduced myocardial contractility. In heart failure, contractile abnormalities result, in part, from alterations in the signaling pathway that allows the cardiac action potential to trigger Ca release via RyR2 channels and muscle contraction. In particular, in failing hearts, the amplitude of the whole-cell Ca transient is decreased and the duration prolonged.","Cardiac arrhythmia, a common feature of heart failure, results in many of the deaths associated with the disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in humans, and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Structural and electrical remodeling\u2014including shortening of atrial refractoriness, loss of rate-related adaptation of refractoriness, and shortening of the wavelength of re-entrant wavelets\u2014accompany sustained tachycardia. This remodeling is likely important in the development, maintenance and progression of atrial fibrillation. Studies suggest that calcium handling plays a role in electrical remodeling in atrial fibrillation.","Approximately 50% of all patients with heart disease die from fatal cardiac arrhythmias. In some cases, a ventricular arrhythmia in the heart is rapidly fatal\u2014a phenomenon referred to as \u201csudden cardiac death\u201d (SCD). Fatal ventricular arrhythmias and SCD also occur in young, otherwise-healthy individuals who are not known to have structural heart disease. In fact, ventricular arrhythmia is the most common cause of sudden death in otherwise-healthy individuals.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally normal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia\u2014a lethal arrhythmia that causes SCD. In subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and\/or stress induce bidirectional and\/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to SCD even in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. CPVT is predominantly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest. Studies have identified mutations in the human RyR2 gene, on chromosome 1q42-q43, in individuals with CPVT.","Failing hearts (e.g., in patients with heart failure and in animal models of heart failure) are characterized by a maladaptive response that includes chronic hyperadrenergic stimulation. In heart failure, chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation is associated with the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which, through coupling with G-proteins, activate adenylyl cyclase and thereby increase intracellular cAMP concentration. CAMP activates cAMP-dependent PKA, which has been shown to induce hyperphosphorylation of RyR2. Thus, chronic heart failure is a chronic hyperadrenergic state that results in several pathologic consequences, including PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2.","The PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 has been proposed as a factor contributing to depressed contractile function and arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. Consistent with this hypothesis, PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts has been demonstrated, in vivo, both in animal models and in patients with heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation.","In failing hearts, the hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA induces the dissociation of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) from the RyR2 channel. This causes marked changes in the biophysical properties of the RyR2 channel, including increased open probability (Po) due to an increased sensitivity to Ca-dependent activation; destabilization of the channel, resulting in subconductance states; and impaired coupled gating of the channels, resulting in defective EC coupling and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, PKA-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 is very sensitive to low-level Ca stimulation, and this manifests itself as a diastolic SR Ca leak through the PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR2 channel.","The maladaptive response to stress in heart failure results in depletion of FKBP12.6 from the channel macromolecular complex. This leads to a shift to the left in the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca-induced Ca release, resulting in channels that are more active at low-to-moderate Ca concentrations. Over time, the increased \u201cleak\u201d through RyR2 results in resetting of the SR Ca content to a lower level, which in turn reduces EC coupling gain and contributes to impaired systolic contractility.","Additionally, a subpopulation of RyR2 that are particularly \u201cleaky\u201d can release SR Ca during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle, diastole. This results in depolarizations of the cardiomyocyte membrane known as delayed after-depolarizations (DADs), which are known to trigger fatal ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.","In patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts, a similar phenomenon is at work. Specifically, it is known that exercise and stress induce the release of catecholamines that activate beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors leads to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 channels. Evidence also suggests that the PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 resulting from beta-adrenergic-receptor activation renders mutated RyR2 channels more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias.","Cardiac arrhythmias are known to be associated with diastolic SR Ca leaks in patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts. In these cases, the most common mechanism for induction and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia is abnormal automaticity. One form of abnormal automaticity, known as triggered arrhythmia, is associated with aberrant release of SR Ca, which initiates DADs. DADs are abnormal depolarizations in cardiomyocytes that occur after repolarization of a cardiac action potential. The molecular basis for the abnormal SR Ca release that results in DADs has not been fully elucidated. However, DADs are known to be blocked by ryanodine, providing evidence that RyR2 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this aberrant Ca release.","It has been shown that exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death (in patients with CPVT) result from a reduced affinity of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) for RyR2. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that exercise activates RyR2 as a result of phosphorylation by adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Mutant RyR2 channels, which had normal function in planar lipid bilayers under basal conditions, were more sensitive to activation by PKA phosphorylation\u2014exhibiting increased activity (open probability) and prolonged open states, as compared with wild-type channels. In addition, PKA-phosphorylated mutant RyR2 channels were resistant to inhibition by Mg, a physiological inhibitor of the channel, and showed reduced binding to FKBP12.6 (aka calstabin2, which stabilizes the channel in the closed state). These findings indicate that, during exercise, when the RyR2 are PKA-phosphorylated, the mutant CPVT channels are more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle (diastole), increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias triggered by SR Ca leak.","Fatigue is the process whereby skeletal muscles become weaker with repeated or intense use such as exercise, or as a result of an illness, disorder or disease. Fatigue can result in task failure and it can be a pronounced symptom in a variety of medical conditions including heart failure, renal failure, cancer, and various muscular dystrophies. Over the past decade, it has become evident that the two dominant classical explanations of muscle fatigue, namely, accumulation of lactic acid and intracellular acidosis, do not cause fatigue. In fact, both may be protective mechanisms during high intensity exercise to prevent fatigue (Allen and Westerblad 2004; Pedersen, Nielsen et al. 2004).","Muscle contraction depends on the efficient coupling of electrical stimulation of the muscle surface to Ca release via the ryanodine receptor, the SR Ca release channel, to the generation of actinmyosin cross bridges. It is evident, then, that a defect in excitation-contraction coupling that resulted in a reduction in the amplitude of the Ca transient would, among other effects, result in impaired contraction and force generation through ineffective myosin cross bridge formation. Eberstein and Sandow suggested inhibition of Ca release as a likely factor in the fatigue process (Eberstein and Sandow 1963). Reductions in the amplitude of Ca release evoked during fatiguing stimulation have been reported in multiple muscle preparations (Allen, Lee et al. 1989; Westerblad and Allen 1991; Allen and Westerblad 2001). The time course of recovery from fatigue parallels the time course over which prolonged depression of Ca release is observed (Westerblad, Bruton et al. 2000).","SR Ca leak was documented in myofibers following intense exercise and in a model of muscular dystrophy (Wang, Weisleder et al. 2005), possibly due to defective skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1s). Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the context of heart failure promotes intrinsic skeletal muscle fatigue due to depletion of the phosphodiesterease PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at Serine 2844, calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex, and a gain-of-function channel defect (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1 dysfunction in the skeletal muscle leads to altered local subcellular Ca release events and impaired global calcium transients (Ward, Reiken et al. 2003). JTV-519, (4-[3-(4-benzylpiperidin-1-yl)propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride-a 1,4-benzothiazepine has been shown to be a modulator of RyR calcium-ion channels), given in the context of a murine model of heart failure, was able to improve skeletal muscle function, as assessed by an ex vivo isolated muscle fatiguing protocol, five weeks after left coronary artery ligation. JTV-519's beneficial effect on muscle fatigue was not solely due to cardiac improvement, as a beneficial effect was still seen when the drug was given to calstabin2 deficient mice which derive no cardiac benefit from treatment with JTV-519. Thus, it has been postulated that JTV-519 directly affects muscle function (Wehrens, Lehnart et al. 2005). In the context of chronic exercise, identical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex, namely depletion of PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at Serine 2844, and calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex are related in a time-dependent and activity-dependent manner with repeated intense exercise in a mouse model. These biochemical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex regulation and function are stable following prolonged exercise and recover slowly over days to weeks. It has therefore been proposed that RyR1 Ca leak limits peak muscle performance and mediates muscle damage during prolonged, stressful exercise.","The contraction of striated muscle is initiated when calcium (Ca) is released from tubules within the muscle cell known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Calcium release channels, called ryanodine receptors (RyR), on the SR are required for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is found in the heart, while the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is found in skeletal muscle. The RyR1 receptor is a tetramer comprised of four 565,000 dalton RyR1 polypeptides and four 12,000 dalton FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP12). FKBP12s are regulatory subunits that stabilize RyR channel function (Brillantes et al., 1994) and facilitate coupled gating between neighboring RyR channels (Marx et al., 1998); the latter are packed into dense arrays in specialized SR regions that release intracellular stores of Ca, thereby triggering muscle contraction. In addition to FKBP12, the RyR1 macromolecular complex also includes the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA, and the phosphatase PP1 (Marx et al., 2001).","One FKBP12 molecule is bound to each RyR1 subunit. Dissociation of FKBP12 significantly alters the biophysical properties of the channels, resulting in the appearance of subconductance states, and increased open probability (P) of the channels (Brillantes et al., 1994; Gaburjakova et al., 2001). In addition, dissociation of FKBP12 from RyR1 channels inhibits coupled gating resulting in channels that gate stochastically rather than as an ensemble (Marx et al., 1998). Coupled gating of arrays of RyR channels is thought to be important for efficient EC coupling that regulates muscle contraction (Marx et al., 1998). FKBPs are cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that are widely expressed and subserve a variety of cellular functions (Marks, 1996). FKBP12s are tightly bound to and regulate the function of the skeletal (RyR1) (Brillantes et al., 1994; Jayaraman et al., 1992) and cardiac (RyR2) (Kaftan et al., 1996) muscle Ca release channels, as well as a related intracellular Ca release channel known as the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R1) (Cameron et al., 1997), and the type I transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) receptor (T\u03b2RI) (Chen et al., 1997).","U.S. Pat. No. 7,312,044, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, discloses methods of treating defective skeletal muscle function during heart failure by administering an agent which inhibits dissociation of FKB12 binding protein from RyR1 receptor.","Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

More particularly, a need remains to identify new compounds that can be used to treat RyR associated disorders by, for example, repairing the leak in RyR channels, and enhancing binding of FKBP proteins (calstabin1 and calstabin2) to PKA-phosphorylated RyR, and to mutant RyRs that otherwise have reduced affinity for, or do not bind to, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6.

During chronic exercise the RyR1 channel is PKA hyperphosphorylated at Ser2844 (Ser2843 in human). The PKA hyperphosphorylation is associated with depletion of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex. Furthermore, PKA hyperphosphorylation contribute to depletion of the RyR1 stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel macromolecular complex resulting in \u201cleaky\u201d channels (increased open probability under conditions when normal channels are not active). The degree of PKA phosphorylation, and depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 are correlated with the intensity and duration of exercise and progressive fatigue. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific calstabin1 deficiency and PDE4D deficient mice both exhibited significantly impaired exercise capacity. A small molecule, S107, that specifically causes rebinding of calstabin1 to the RyR1 channel improved exercise capacity and force generation of isolated muscle during a 21 day exercise protocol. S107 treated muscle fibers exhibited reduced fatigue, as determined by measurement of intracellular calcium during repeated tetanic contractions. Furthermore, S107 treated chronically exercised mice exhibited reduced levels of plasma creatine kinase, and calcium-dependent neutral protease calpain activity in muscle homogenates. This demonstrates the existence of a mechanism of muscle fatigue, during chronic or high-intensity exercise, where SR calcium leak due calstabin1 depleted RyR1 channels leads to defective calcium signaling and skeletal muscle damage. In one aspect, the invention provides use of RyCal compounds which target molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue, muscle conditions and disorders, and provide treatments treatment thereof.","Calcium release channel stabilizing drugs prevent muscle fatigue by preventing ryanodine receptor calcium leak during sustained or strenuous exercise. Repeated and strenuous activity of skeletal muscle may cause 1) weakness with intense use (also referred to as fatigue), 2) feeling of sore and weak muscles (referred to as perception), and 3) different degrees of muscle degeneration (referred to as dystrophic remodeling). A dominant theory of muscle fatigue has been that accumulation of intracellular lactic acid resulting in intracellular acidosis directly inhibits force production by the myofibrillar proteins (Hill et al., 1929). Indeed, at lower than physiologic temperatures (20\u00b0 C.), acidotic changes of intracellular pH were found to accelerate fatigability of skeletal muscles (Hill at al., 1929). However, more recent studies have challenged the significance of acidosis for muscle fatigue by showing that repeated short tetanic contractions which induce fatigue do not result in significant intracellular pH changes under more physiologic conditions at 37\u00b0 C. (Westerblad at al., 1997) where acidosis does not significantly effect force production. These findings are consistent with lactic acid which is produced during fatiguing contractions being extruded at a substantial rate by lactate transporters. However, during very intense athletic training lactic acid resulting from anaerobic breakdown of glycogen remains an important limiting factor. Importantly, intracellular acidosis was found to preserve muscle excitability and relaxation of the myofilaments during sustained increases of intracellular Ca during repeated or sustained tetanic contractions, and thus protects from muscle fatigue (Pedersen at al. 2004).","Given that changes in intracellular pH may not represent a major fatigue mechanism, it is likely that alterations in EC coupling contribute to fatigue. Intracellular Ca release via RyR1 channels initiates muscle contraction. Now classic physiologic experiments suggested in 1963, that reversible alterations in contractile activation may play an important role in muscle fatigue (Eberstein et al., 1963). During progressive development of fatigue resulting from repeated tetanic contractions, elevations in intracellular Ca concentrations decline which explains reduced force production (Allen et al., 2001). However, caffeine and other compounds, which maximally activate RyR1 channels and cause sudden SR Ca release, can briefly normalize tetanic Ca concentrations (Allen at al., 2001). Thus alterations of RyR1-dependent SR Ca release mechanisms are likely to be involved in fatigue development.","Measurements of SR Ca load have demonstrated a decreased pool of releasable Ca during skeletal muscle fatigue, which may be one of the causes of reduced SR Ca release during fatigue. (Cooke at al. 1985). Another theory involves increased intracellular inorganic phosphate concentrations ([P]) precipitating Ca in the SR storage organelle (Allen, 2001; Cooke, 1985). However, [P]increases occur during the early phase of fatigue resulting from rapid ATP breakdown whereas the decline of tetanic [Ca]occurs late in fatigue (phase iii). Moreover, after repeated, stretched contractions resting [Ca]was found elevated while stimulated, tetanic [Ca]decreased (Warren et al. 1993; Balnave et al. 1995). The increased resting [Ca]may initiate chronic impairment of EC coupling for example by activating proteases that can damage the SR Ca release channel (Lamb et al., 1995; Chin et al., 1996; Bruton et al., 1996).","Fatigue from chronically sustained exercise may be caused by SR Ca leak resulting from defective closure of the RyR1 channel and partial depletion of the SR Ca store contributing to diminished force production and increased resting [Ca]interfering with muscle relaxation and when sustained causing muscle degeneration. Recent data shows that an evolutionary conserved stress pathway, the fight-or-flight response, specifically controls RyR1 Ca release in skeletal muscle (Gaburjakova et al., 2001; Marx et al., 2001) and that abnormal, chronic activation of this stress pathway causes SR Ca leak contributing to muscle fatigue (Reiken et al., 2003).","RyR1\/calcium release channels become PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing protein calstabin1 during exercise. RyCal compounds of the invention increase the binding affinity of calstabin1 to PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1. These compounds are called \u201ccalcium channel stabilizers\u201d or \u201cRyCals\u201d and are in a class of 1,4-benzothiazepines and related structures. In a non-limiting example, treatment with a RyCal compound improves exercise performance of mice running on a treadmill. Furthermore, there is evidence that a calcium leak via PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1 channels causes muscle damage due to activation of calcium-dependent proteases and RyCals prevent the calcium leak and inhibit muscle damage during chronic exercise. In certain embodiments, RyCal compound can be used to treat, prevent or improve muscle fatigue in chronic diseases including but not limited to heart failure, AIDS, cancer, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, asthma, hyperthyroidism, chronic muscle fatigue. In other embodiments, RyCal compound can be used to treat or improve muscular dystrophies. In other embodiments, treatment with RyCal compound can prevent or reduce muscle fatigue which can improve exercise performance in individuals who are exposed to sustained chronic stress and\/or physical exercise. In other embodiments, treatment with RyCals can prevent or reduce muscle fatigue which can improve exercise performance in individuals who are exposed to strenuous physical exercise.","Skeletal muscles become weaker with intense use also referred to as fatigue. Moreover, repeated stretch-dependent contractures can result in additional muscle damage and degeneration. Although fatigue is recognized as an important mechanism of limited peak performance and task failure during stress, the mechanisms that promote fatigue or muscle fiber damage are incompletely characterized. Moreover, defining molecular fatigue mechanisms may enable targeted interventions that could help prevent fatigue and muscle tissue damage (Wehrens, 2005). A key physiologic mechanism that controls skeletal muscle performance is intracellular calcium (Ca) release from specialized Ca stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR1) Ca release channels. In skeletal muscle, plasma membrane depolarization activates voltage-gated L-type Ca channels (LTCCs; Ca1.1) which in turn activate RyR1s on the SR mediated by direct contact between both ion channels.","Opening of RyR1 channels results in bulk SR Ca release which activates the myofilaments and muscle contraction. Also, disease forms associated with sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma catecholamine levels cause maladaptive activation of intracellular stress pathways resulting in destabilization of the RyR1 channel closed state and intracellular Ca leak (Reiken et al. 2003; Brillantes et al. 1994). SR Ca leak via RyR1 channels was found to deplete intracellular SR calcium stores, to increase compensatory energy consumption, and to result in significant acceleration of muscle fatigue. The stress-induced muscle defect limits peak performance and contributes to pathologic forms of muscle fatigue that permanently reduce performance. Also, destabilization of the RyR1 closed state involves depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 (FKBP12) channel subunit (Reiken et al. 2003; Brillantes et al. 1994). Experiments demonstrate that increasing the binding affinity of calstabin to RyR rescues channel function (Wehrens, 2003).","Skeletal muscle contraction is activated by SR Ca release via the type 1 skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Depolarization of the T-tubule membrane activates the dihydropyridine receptor voltage sensor (Cav1.1) which in turn activates RyR1 channels via a direct protein-protein interaction causing the release of SR Ca stores. Ca binds to troponin C allowing actin-myosin cross-bridging to occur and sarcomere shortening. Ca release channels comprise macromolecular complexes consisting of a homotetramer of 560 kDa RyR1 subunits that form scaffolds for proteins that regulate channel function including: protein kinase A and the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3, both of which are targeted to the channel via the anchoring protein mAKAP, PP1 (targeted via spinophilin), and calstabin1 (FKBP12) (Jayaraman, Brillantes et al. 1992; Brillantes, Ondrias et al. 1994; Marx, Reiken et al. 2000; Marx, Reiken et al. 2001).","A defect in ECC that resulted in a reduction in the amplitude of SR Ca release would impair contraction and force generation. Eberstein and Sandow proposed impaired SR Ca release as a likely contributor to muscle fatigue (Eberstein and Sandow 1963). Reductions in the amplitude of SR Ca release evoked during fatiguing stimulation have been reported (Allen, Lee et al. 1989; Westerblad and Allen 1991; Allen and Westerblad 2001). In addition, it has been shown that Ca stores decline during intense and repeated contractions (Kabbara & Allen, 1999), and that the time course of recovery from fatigue parallels the time course over which prolonged depression of SR Ca release is observed (Westerblad, Bruton et al. 2000). Furthermore, reduction of free SR Ca, due to inorganic calcium phosphate salt precipitation during fatigue, has been proposed (Allen and Westerblad 2001).","Evidence of defective SR Ca release in fatigued muscle prompted examination of the role of RyR1 mediated SR Ca release in skeletal muscle fatigue. The binding of calstabin1 (FKBP12) to RyR1 stabilizes the closed state of the channel and facilitates coupled gating between neighboring channels (Brillantes, Ondrias et al. 1994; Marx, Ondrias et al. 1998). Pharmacologic depletion of calstabin1 from RyR1 (with rapamycin or FK506 both of which bind to calstabin1 and dissociate it from the RyR1 macromolecular complex) promotes subconductance states and, in intact skeletal muscle, can cause a rapid loss of depolarization-induced contraction (Lamb and Stephenson 1996). Mutation of RyR1 resulting in the loss of calstabin1 binding causes impaired ECC with reduced maximal voltage-gated SR Ca release without affecting the SR Ca store content (Avila, Lee et al. 2003). Genetic deletion of FKBP12 (calstabin1) induced no gross histological or developmental defect in skeletal muscle, though severe developmental cardiac defects were observed which precluded detailed assessment of skeletal muscle function (Shou, Aghdasi et al. 1998). Whereas skeletal muscle-specific knock-out of FKBP12 (calstabin1) resulted in reduced voltage-gated SR Ca release and increased L-type channel currents in isolated myotubes (Tang, Ingalls et al. 2004). In extensor digitalis longus (EDL), but not soleus or diaphragm, reduced maximal tetanic force and a rightward shift in force-frequency relationships were observed (Tang, Ingalls et al. 2004). These data indicated that calstabin1 modulates the gain of ECC in skeletal muscle.","The binding of calstabin1 to RyR1 is regulated by PKA phosphorylation at RyR1-S2843 (position S2844 in the mouse RyR1 sequence) (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). Phosphorylation at RyR1-S2843 increases the mean open probability of RyR1 in the lipid bilayer (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1-S2843A mutant channels could not be PKA phosphorylated and did not show the same PKA-dependent increase in open probability. An RyR1-S2843D mutation mimicked PKA phosphorylation with an increased open probability and destabilized open and closed states (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). The role of PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 is still under investigation as other groups have found little or no effect on channel function (Stange, Xu et al. 2003). Other post-translational modifications of RyR1 which might modulate calstabin1 binding to RyR1 have been suggested, including oxidation, and glutathionylation of the up to 50 free (reduced) thiols on each RyR monomer.","SR Ca leak has been documented as aberrant calcium sparks in myofibers following intense exercise and in a model of muscular dystrophy (Wang, Weisleder et al. 2005), possibly due to defective RyR1 function. Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during heart failure is associated with early skeletal muscle fatigue and PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 at Ser2844 (meaning that on average 3-4 of the four PKA sites in each homotetrameric channel are PKA phosphorylated in heart failure skeletal muscle), calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex, and a gain-of-function channel defect (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1 dysfunction in skeletal muscle leads to altered local subcellular Ca release events (Ward, Reiken et al. 2003).","Modifications in the RyR1 complex could alter and are likely to limit peak muscle performance, increase muscle fatigue, and contribute to muscle damage during prolonged or high intensity exercise. In certain aspects the invention provides use of a mouse model of chronic, high-intensity, forced exercise to assess the role of the RyR1 channel in skeletal muscle fatigue. As described herein, the RyR1 channel macromolecular complex undergoes remodeling during exercise such that it is progressively PKA hyperphosphorylated, and depleted of PDE4D3 and calstabin1. Functionally, this remodeling is associated with \u201cleaky\u201d channels (increased open probability) and activation of the calcium-activated protease calpain, and leakage of creatine kinase (CPK) into the plasma, which is consistent with muscle damage. These changes are further associated with decreased force production in isolated muscles and impaired exercise capacity and are exacerbated in mice with PDE4D deficiency or muscle specific calstabin1 deficiency. Preventing the RyR1 channel leak with a calcium channel stabilizer S107, which enhances binding of calstabin1 to RyR1, inhibits calpain activation, CPK leak and improves exercise performance. Therefore, remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex that causes leaky channels, activation of the calcium-activated protease calpain, and leakage of creatine kinase (CPK) into the plasma, is a mechanism involved in muscle fatigue during chronic or high intensity exercise.","Confocal imaging studies of intracellular Ca release (Ca sparks) in muscle cells after mild and strenuous treadmill exercise, showing that abnormal Ca spark activity is induced by fatiguing exercise (Wang et al. 2005). Moreover, myofibers with abnormal Ca spark activity resulting form strenuous exercise show histological signs of degeneration from toxic Ca effects also known as \u2018dystrophic remodeling\u2019 (Wang et al. 2005). It is likely that sustained exercise over weeks and months results in RyR1 dysfunction, intracellular Ca leak, depressed muscle performance, and dystrophic muscle remodeling. Furthermore, 1,4-benzothiazepine based drugs enhance peak muscle performance and prevent dystrophic remodeling by fixing stress-induced intracellular Ca leak.","Animal models can establish, in vivo and at the level of isolated skeletal muscle cell, and single RyR1 channel, that defects in RyR1 function cause muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling. Use of these animal models of fatigue and the characterized muscle, cells, and channel techniques allows tests of therapeutic approaches based on fixing the leak in RyR1 which will result in improved skeletal muscle performance, decreased muscle fatigue, and reduced dystrophic remodeling during chronic forms of exercise.","Muscular Dystrophy","Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common muscular dystrophy in adults (1 in 7,400 live births), is a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene which causes progressive muscle weakness, inherited muscle hyperexitability (myotonia), cardiac conduction defect, cataract, and insulin resistance (Bachinski L L, Udd B, Meola G, et al. Confirmation of the type 2 myotonic dystrophy (CCTG)n expansion mutation in patients with proximal myotonic myopathy\/proximal myotonic dystrophy of different European origins: a single shared haplotype indicates an ancestral founder effect. . October 2003; 73(4):835-848; Hamshere M G, Harley H, Harper P, et al. Myotonic dystrophy: the correlation of (CTG) repeat length in leucocytes with age at onset is significant only for patients with small expansions. . January 1999; 36(1):59-61; Liguori C L, Ricker K, Moseley M L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 caused by a CCTG expansion in intron 1 of ZNF9. . Aug. 3, 2001; 293(5531):864-867). The mutant DMPK messenger RNA (mRNA) containing an expanded CUG repeat is retained in the nucleus and protein levels are reduced (Mankodi A, Logigian E, Callahan L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat. . Sep. 8, 2000; 289(5485):1769-1773). The RNA repeat expansion changes the chromatin structure, silences the expression of the flanking SIX5 gene which codes for a transcription factors, and disrupts regulation of gene expression during development and exercise (Ebralidze A, Wang Y, Petkova V, et al. RNA leaching of transcription factors disrupts transcription in myotonic dystrophy. . Jan. 16, 2004; 303(5656):383-387).","The cause of the most severe symptoms including muscle weakness and progressive muscle wasting appear to be caused by elevated intracellular Ca concentrations and subsequent myofiber degeneration in DM1 (Jacobs A E, Benders A A, Oosterhof A, et al. The calcium homeostasis and the membrane potential of cultured muscle cells from patients with myotonic dystrophy. . Nov. 14, 1990; 1096(1):14-19). Moreover, a recent study has linked disturbed Ca cycling in DM1 to aberrant splicing of RyR1 and SR Ca ATPase (SERCA1) mRNAs (Kimura T, Nakamori M, Lueck J D, et al. Altered mRNA Splicing of the Skeletal Muscle Ryanodine Receptor and Sarcoplasmic\/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1. . Jun. 22, 2005). A muscle-specific genetic mouse model HSAof DM1 exists in which expanded CUG repeat expression results in a DM-like phenotype (Mankodi A, Logigian E, Callahan L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat. . Sep. 8, 2000; 289(5485):1769-1773). HSAhave a myotonic phenotype in the absence of muscle fiber necrosis and the short-versus long-repeat expressing mouse lines show relatively less or more histopathological signs of muscle regeneration and repair, respectively (Mankodi A, Logigian E, Callahan L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat. . Sep. 8, 2000; 289(5485):1769-1773). Since HSAmice with short- or long repeat expression show no signs of muscle weakness and since RyR1 alterations have been linked to DM1, the HSAmice provide a model to study the effects of exercise and activation of the sympathetic nervous system in these mice. After characterizing RyR1 channel composition, phosphorylation status, and function, the HSAmice can be challenge with sustained exercise tests and treated with RyCal compounds. Since the mechanism by which transcripts with expanded CUG repeats cause myotonia and muscle degeneration in DM1 is not known, this would provide 1) study of a genetic animal model of severe fatigue, 2) elucidation of the key molecular mechanism of DM1, and 3) developing a therapeutic rationale for the most common muscular dystrophy in adults.","Stress Pathways and Muscle Fatigue","Sustained activation of intracellular stress pathways such as occurring during strenuous physical exercise, for example but not limited to combat, can result in reduced muscle performance and tissue damage. A major determinant of muscle damage may occur due to toxicity of continuously high catecholamine levels resulting in intracellular Ca leak. This concept is supported by: 1) physiologic (non-combat) exercise or stress was reported to induce muscle weakness, cramps, and tissue atrophy in susceptible individuals (stress-induced rhabdomyolysis) (Wappler et al., 2001); 2) strenuous but not mild treadmill exercise induces a significantly elevated Ca spark frequency in muscle cells indicating intracellular Ca leak (Wang et al., 2005); 3) excess catecholamine levels were found in malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) contributing to uncontrolled intracellular Ca release (Monnier et al. 2000; MacLennan et al. 1995); 4) a majority of MH\/CCD were linked to RyR1 missense mutations (Loke et al., 2003); 5) a hyperadrenergic state as occurring in heart failure causes RyR1 hyperphosphorylation, Ca leak, and skeletal muscle fatigue (Reiken et al. 2003); and 6) excess plasma catecholamine levels by activating \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, intracellular cAMP synthesis and protein kinase A phosphorylation results in muscle damage (Goldspink et al., 2004; Tan et al. 2003). Stress-dependent muscle damage and dysfunction occurs at the interface between intracellular catecholamine effectors (protein kinase A, PKA) and intracellular Ca release. Skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) Ca release channels constitute intracellular scaffolds that integrate PKA-mediated stress signaling and regulation of intracellular Ca release and therefore determine the gain of EC coupling and muscle function. Importantly, chronically increased PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 occurring from a chronic hyperadrenergic state in vivo depletes the stabilizing calstabin1 subunits resulting in SR Ca leak and muscle fatigue. Moreover, these observations extend to an in vivo animal model of fatigue. Therefore, sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system during continued muscle performance contributes to increased fatigue development and dystrophic skeletal muscle damage. Since skeletal RyR1 Ca release channel is PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit after 21 days of intense exercise, wherein similar alterations result in intracellular Ca leak in animals with heart failure, it is likely that chronic (>1 week) forms of exercise result in adverse intracellular Ca leak from defective RyR1 channels.","In one aspect, the invention establishes molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue occurring from chronically sustained muscle performance. In another aspect the invention provides methods for treating or preventing detrimental intracellular Ca leak and muscle damage by administering novel 1,4-benzothiazepine derivatives. The skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) channel is comprised of 4 RyR1 subunits and associated proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the channel forming a macromolecular signaling complex. Certain aspects of the invention examine mechanisms by which allosteric modulators regulate RyR1 function. Two specific forms of allosteric modulation are examined: 1) regulation of the channel by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) that potently activates channel gating; 2) depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel during chronically increased PKA phosphorylation resulting from chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system by strenuous, sustained exercise.","Dysregulation of RyR1 by PKA during sustained exercise causes intracellular Ca leak and may be a mechanism of increased muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling. In certain aspects, the invention determines the effects of fatiguing exercise on 1) RyR1 PKA phosphorylation; 2) RyR1 channel function examined using RyR1 channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers; 3) Calstabin1 binding to RyR1; 4) intracellular Ca sparks in isolated myofibers; 5) isolated skeletal muscle function; 6) mitochondrial integrity, 7) in vivo exercise performance, 8) skeletal muscle histology, fiber type composition and oxidative capacity, 9) creatine kinase (CK) plasma levels, 10) RyR1 PKA phosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion in leukocytes. Calstabin1 depletion during chronically sustained exercise and PKA hyperphosphorylation causes RyR1 hyperactivity, intracellular Ca leak, depletion of SR Ca stores, accelerated fatigue and dystrophic muscle remodeling.","In certain embodiments, treatment with any RyCal compound normalizes RyR dysfunction and intracellular Ca leak. RyR1, which are protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylated and \u201cleaky\u201d in heart failure models and during strenuous exercise, can rebind calstabin1 after RyCal compound treatment, which normalizes single channel and improves muscle performance in heart failure. It is likely that RyCals in vivo and in cells treated with RyCals prevent intracellular Ca leak and normalize RyR1 channel function during sustained exercise.","By preventing RyR1 Ca leak, RyCal compounds improves skeletal muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling during strenuous exercise as occurs in combat. By using two animal models of muscle fatigue (swimming and running on a treadmill) in mice and rats, certain aspects of the invention show that treatment with RyCal compounds prevents depletion of calstabin1 from RyR1, which decreases muscle fatigue, improves performance, and inhibits dystrophic muscle remodeling.","Certain aspects of the invention identify molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue in myotonic dystrophy (DM1). In certain embodiments, by preventing RyR1 Ca leak, RyCal compounds improve skeletal muscle fatigue times and dystrophic remodeling in mouse models of myotonic dystrophy.","Other aspects of the invention characterize molecular fatigue mechanisms in genetic mouse models. In certain embodiments, calstabin1 and PDE4D3 knockout mice can be used to further explore molecular fatigue mechanisms and dysregulation during sustained exercise states that contribute to intracellular Ca leak. In other aspects, the compounds of the invention reduce calpain activity. In other aspects, the compounds of the invention reduce plasma creatine kinase activity.","Other aspects of the invention, characterize mechanisms that destabilize the closed state of intracellular calcium (Ca) release channels during chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system as occurs during sustained exercise and\/or in combat. There are two allosteric modulators of skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1s), one is PKA and the other one is a stabilizing protein subunit of the channel (calstabin1) (Wehrens et al., 2004). Other aspects of the invention disclose therapeutic and preventive measures wherein a drug molecule that rebinds calstabin1 may prevent skeletal muscle fatigue by normalizing the skeletal (RyR1) ryanodine receptor gating. Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 during chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system was shown to result in SR Ca leak as a cause of fatigue (Reiken et al., 2003) which was reversed by JTV-519 (Wehrens et al., 2005). In certain aspects, the invention provides, thorough characterization of the effects of strenuous exercise on RyR1 Ca leak, in vivo and ex vivo muscle performance and energetic metabolism, methods for the use of RyCal compounds to overcome muscle fatigue and to prevent muscle damage and\/or fatigue during strenuous, and\/or sustained exercise, and muscle damage and\/or fatigue associated with defective skeletal muscle function, or any disease condition.","Certain aspects of the invention characterize mechanisms that destabilize the closed state of intracellular calcium (Ca) release channels which is a prerequisite for muscle relaxation to occur and prevents damage of myofibers from uncontrolled intracellular SR Ca leak. Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system during forced and sustained exercise caused RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation, calstabin1 depletion, and a defective channel closed state are consistent with SR Ca leak. Since stress and physical performance in combat are considered significantly more severe compared to the animal use protocols, it can be extrapolated that muscle fatigue and dystrophic degeneration from RyR1 Ca leak represents a more severe phenotype in warfighters. The focus is on two allosteric modulators of skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1s), one PKA as a key stress pathway and the other one a stabilizing protein subunit of the channel (calstabin1).","Certain aspects of the invention address potential therapeutic and preventive measures in that a drug molecule rebinding calstabin1 may prevent skeletal muscle fatigue by normalizing the skeletal (RyR1) ryanodine receptor channel gating. Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 during chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system was shown to result in SR Ca leak as a cause of fatigue (Wehrens X H, Lehnart S E, Reiken S, et al. Enhancing calstabin binding to ryanodine receptors improves cardiac and skeletal muscle function in heart failure. . Jul. 5, 2005; 102(27):9607-9612; Ward C W, Reiken S, Marks A R, et al. Defects in ryanodine receptor calcium release in skeletal muscle from post-myocardial infarct rats. . August 2003; 17(11):1517-1519). Certain aspects of the invention are directed to thorough characterization of the effects of strenuous exercise on RyR1 Ca leak, in vivo and ex vivo muscle performance and energetic metabolism, and the use of RyCal compounds to improve muscle fatigue times, to increase exercise capacity, and to prevent muscle damage during and\/or after strenuous, sustained exercise.","Life quality and prognosis in heart failure patients is decreased due to skeletal muscle dysfunction (e.g., shortness of breath due to diaphragmatic weakness, and exercise intolerance due to limb skeletal muscle fatigue) (Harrington et al. 1997). Recent studies have identified dysregulation of intracellular Ca release from the SR as a pathogenic mechanism underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction in heart failure (Reiken S, Lacampagne A, Zhou H, et al. PKA phosphorylation activates the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) in skeletal muscle: defective regulation in heart failure. . Mar. 17, 2003; 160(6):919-928; Ward, 2003; Perreault C L, Gonzalez-Serratos H, Litwin S E, et al. Alterations in contractility and intracellular Ca2+ transients in isolated bundles of skeletal muscle fibers from rats with chronic heart failure. . August 1993; 73(2):405-412). Heart failure in animals with myocardial infarcts causes significantly accelerated fatigue which is intrinsic to skeletal muscle as measured by the time for the tetanic force to fall below 50% of the maximal contraction (Reiken, 2003).","Skeletal RyR1 are PKA Hyperphosphorylated and Depleted of Calstabin1","Previous studies have suggested that skeletal muscle RyR1 channels are PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of calstabin1 in a pacing-induced canine model of heart failure and a rat post-myocardial infarct model (Reiken et al., 2003; Ward et al., 2003). Furthermore, in a mouse model of post-myocardial infarction heart failure, RyR1 in soleus muscle is PKA-hyperphosphorylated. In certain embodiments, treatment with a RyCal compound, allows rebinding of calstabin1 to RyR1 despite intense chronic exercise.","Beta-adrenergic stimulation increases the gain of the EC coupling when enhanced muscle performance is required during exercise or stress (fight-or-flight response). Binding of catecholamines to \u03b2-adrenoceptors activates a G-protein coupled intracellular signaling cascade, which leads to increased intracellular cAMP concentrations and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is targeted to RyR1 via mAKAP forming a signaling complex with the skeletal Ca release channel (Reiken et al. 2003). RyR1 phosphorylation by PKA increases the channel open probability and SR Ca release (Reiken et al., 2003; Wehrens et al., 2004).","Data from skeletal myofibers have confirmed intracellular Ca leak from enhanced RyR1 activity after strenuous exercise consistent with an increased maximal rate of SR Ca release. PKA-hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 results in depletion of calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel complex due to a reduced binding affinity for calstabin1. Chronic depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel complex relieves an intrinsic inhibition of the channel and induces uncontrolled intracellular Ca leak and reduced fatigue resistance during a sustained hyperadrenergic state. Skeletal muscle fatigue is increased in heart failure patients and in animal models of heart failure (Reiken et al., 2003; Harrington et al., 1997; Perreault et al., 1993; Lunde et al. 2001; Lunde et al. 1998). In both patients and animals with heart failure the skeletal RyR1 channel isoform was found PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunits (Reiken et al., 2003; Wehrens et al., 2004). Increased fatigue and RyR1 hyperphosphorylation are associated with an increased Ca spark frequency and a decreased Ca spark amplitude in skeletal myofibers in heart failure animals consistent with intracellular Ca leak and decreased SR Ca concentrations (Reiken et al., 2003). Therefore, most likely increased muscle fatigue results from a chronic hyperadrenergic state causing an intracellular Ca leak via defective RyR1 channels (Reiken et al., 2003).","However, it is important to conceptualize that the role of external Ca ions in mammalian skeletal muscle contraction is not completely understood. The LTCC and RyR isoforms in skeletal and cardiac muscles are different, with skeletal muscle expressing the LTCC \u03b11subunit (Tanabe et al., 1988) and RyR1 (Marks et al., 1989), and cardiac muscle expressing the LTCC \u03b11subunit (Mikami et al., 1989) and RyR2 (Nakai et al., 1990). RyR1 in skeletal muscle does not depend on Ca influx via LTCC \u03b11to activate SR Ca release as evidenced by continuous EC coupling in skeletal muscle cells when external Ca is removed or when Ca channel blockers are present (Armstrong et al., 1972; Dulhunty et al., 1988; Gonzalez-Serratos et al., 1982). Later experimental findings support RyR1 activation by physical coupling with LTCC \u03b11(Rios et al., 1987; Tanabe et al., 1990). RyR1 Ca leak likely increases the cellular energy demands by compensatory SR Ca ATPase uptake consuming more ATP which may contribute to earlier skeletal muscle fatigue. From direct oxygen measurements on the surface of contracting muscle preparations, it is estimated that total ATP consumption by SR Ca ATPases is significantly elevated in heart failure (Meyer et al., 1998) likely resulting from intracellular Ca leak. In agreement with decreased SR Ca concentrations due to RyR1 Ca leak, muscle-specific calstabin1 knockout increases LTCC Ca influx and reduces maximal voltage-gated intracellular Ca release (Tang et al., 2004).","Recent studies have demonstrated defective function of RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle during heart failure, which were analogous to those found in RyR2 channels in failing myocardium: PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 and depletion of calstabin1 (Marx et al., 2000; Reiken et al., 2003; Wehrens et al., 2005). These findings suggest that defects in RyR1 function alter intracellular Ca handling, thereby contributing to early fatigue in skeletal muscles. Depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 macromolecular complex may also uncouple channels from one another and allow stochastic as opposed to coupled gating (Marx et al., 1998), thus providing an attractive hypothesis for explaining the altered Ca spark behaviour in skeletal muscle with reduced fatigue resistance (Ward et al., 2003). Thus, alterations in RyR1 could play a significant role in the skeletal muscle specific force decrements and reduced exercise-tolerance seen in models of increased muscle fatigue.","Methods","Aerobic exercise can be defined as a form of physical exercise that increases the heart rate and enhances oxygen intake to improve performance. Examples of aerobic exercise are running, cycling, and swimming. In certain embodiments, mice were challenged by aerobic exercise (forced swimming) for 90 mins twice daily. The animals were accustomed to swimming in preliminary training sessions: day \u22123 twice 30 mins, day \u22122 twice 45 mins, day \u22121 twice 60 mins, day 0 and following twice 90 mins. Mice were then exercised for 1, 7, or 21 additional, consecutive days for 90 mins twice daily. Between swimming sessions separated by a 4 hour rest period the mice are kept warm and given food and water. An adjustable-current water pool was used to exercise mice by swimming. An acrylic pool (90 cm long\u00d745 cm wide\u00d745 cm deep) was filled with water to a depth of 25 cm. A current in the pool was generated with a pump. The current speed during the swimming session was at a constant speed of 1 l\/min flow rate. The water temperature was maintained at 34\u00b0 C. with an electric heater. Age- and weight-matched mice are used to exclude differences in buoyancy from body fat.","Using forced swimming as an efficient protocol to increase skeletal muscle aerobic capacity in mice (Evangelista et al., 2003), the composition and phosphorylation status of the skeletal RyR1 channel complex was investigated. Unexpectedly, after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily, C57B16 wild-type mice showed significantly increased RyR2 phosphorylation by PKA while CaMKII phosphorylation was not changed. RyR1 protein expression was stable, however, RyR1 channels were depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12). RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion are consistent with leaky RyR1 channels that cause intracellular Ca leak.","To investigate the influence of the duration of sustained exercise on the RyR1 Ca release channel defect, mice were exposed to swimming for 1, 7, or 21 days followed by immediate sacrifice. Longer exposure to sustained exercise shows a significant increase of RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation beginning at 7 days and saturating at 21 days.","Moreover, a mouse model of muscular dystrophy which is known to result in intracellular Ca leak and dystrophic muscle changes was investigated. Surprisingly, soleus muscles of the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse show calstabin1 depletion in the absence of increased RyR1-Ser2844 phosphorylation. These results identify RyR1-Ser2844 PKA hyperphosphorylation as a specific event in exercise-induced RyR1 dysfunction.","Additionally, the histological changes in the fast-twitch muscles of mice exposed to 3 weeks of exercise by swimming were characterized. Cross-sections of the mouse M. extensor digitorum longus (EDL) showed histological changes consistent with myofiber degeneration from intracellular Ca overload from defective RyR1 channel. Therefore sustained exercise for 90 mins twice daily triggers a distrophic phenotype in EDL muscles of normal C57B16 mice.","Up-regulation of intracellular SR Ca release by cAMP-dependent signaling pathways augments the gain of excitation-contraction coupling during peak muscle performance. (Reiken, 2003) Therefore transient PKA phosphorylation of skeletal RyR1 Ca release channels represents a key mechanism of the fight-or-flight response. Studies have established that dysregulation of RyR1 Ca release channels occurs during strenuous fatiguing exercise. Mice which underwent rigorous exercise for 3 weeks showed significantly increased levels of RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, increased RyR1 channel activity, and dystrophic histological changes. Chronic RyR1 hyperphosphorylation results in depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1, functional channel defects, suggesting intracellular Ca leak. At the level of the muscle cell, this model was recently confirmed by a report that increased Ca spark frequency after fatiguing exercise in mouse skeletal muscle (Wang et al., 2005). Moreover, it was shown that intracellular Ca leak from chronic exercise acts as dystrophic signal in mammalian skeletal muscle (Wang, 2005). This confirms previous observations in cardiac muscle, where hormonal and structural changes contribute to intracellular Ca leak causing defective excitation-contraction coupling (Gomez, 1997). From these studies (Wehrens et al., 2005; Reiken et al., 2003) and the Ca spark data in fatiguing muscle (Wang et al., 2005) it is likely that intracellular Ca leak represents a key pathology that accelerates muscle fatigue and causes dystrophic remodeling of muscles. Accordingly, extended investigation of fatigue models at the in vivo, isolated muscle, muscle cell, mitochondria, and single RyR1 channel level will characterize detrimental effects during peak performance on muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling.","1,4-benzothiazepine derivatives prevent muscle dysfunction from intracellular Ca leak under conditions of sustained sympathetic nervous system activation occurring from heart failure (Wehrens et al., 2005). In certain aspects, the invention provides RyCal compounds and their use to enhance skeletal muscle performance and to reduce muscle dysfunction during sustained stress as occurs under combat conditions. Defects in the RyR1 Ca release channel due to dysregulation by PKA allow rationalizing of a therapeutic concept: intracellular SR Ca leak and muscle dysfunction can be prevented by a drug that increases binding of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit to the RyR1 channel complex and thereby inhibits SR Ca leak and dystrophic muscle remodeling from sustained stress or exercise. Applying a drug to prevent SR Ca leak can therefore enhance a variety of important physiologic skills which are prone to stress-induced dysfunction. In certain aspects, the invention provides that enhanced binding of calstabin1 to RyR1 by RyCal compounds prevents muscle fatigue. Using animal models of physiologic (swimming and running on a treadmill) and\/or pharmacologic activation \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonists) of the sympathetic nervous system combined with different degrees of exercise exposure, it can be tested whether RyCal compounds improve skeletal muscle function and prevent dystrophic muscle degeneration. This may lead to a pharmacologic approach based on allosteric modulation of RyR1 that can result in improved human performance during sustained stress and prevent adverse tissue damage thereby shortening recovery times. In other aspects, the invention provides pharmacologic approaches based on allosteric modulation of RyR1 that can result in improved human performance during sustained stress and prevent adverse tissue damage and shorten recovery times.","RyR1 PKA phosphorylation: quantification of skeletal RyR1 channel phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks using two independent techniques (RyR1 PKA phospho-epitope detection by specific antibody; incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate by backphosphorylation essay).\n\nRyR1 CaMKII phosphorylation: quantification of skeletal RyR1 channel phosphorylation by Ca-calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks using RyR1 CaMKII phospho-epitope detection by specific antibody essay developed in our laboratory. This will allow characterizing specific defects resulting from chronic PKA phosphorylation and\/or secondary activation of CaMKII signaling by intracellular Ca leak mechanisms.\n\nCalstabin1 depletion in the RyR1 complex: quantification of depletion of the channel stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the RyR1 channel complex by immunoprecipitation techniques following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks. Calstabin1 depletion occurs from Ser2844 phosphorylation by PKA.\n\nRyR1 functional defects\u2014in vivo development of \u201cleaky\u201d RyR1 channels: electrophysiologic characterization of RyR1 single-channel activity and open probability following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks. This allows for a comprehensive and sensitive assessment of SR Ca release channel defects and leak mechanisms that are known to contribute to muscle fatigue. Moreover, these data will allow developing a rationale for preventive treatment of RyR1 Ca leak using a small lead RyCal compounds.\n\nImprovement of fatigue from sustained exercise: quantification of in vivo fatigue using two independent exercise performance tests: swimming and running on a treadmill. The treadmill test will be combined with electrocardiogram telemetry in a subgroup of animals to allow for objective correlation of increased heart rates during exercise with fatigue symptoms. Moreover, plasma and muscle catecholamine levels will be determined to verify sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Three weeks of maximal fatiguing swimming exercise induces progressive RyR1 dysfunction and dystrophic skeletal muscle changes during a low flow rate of 1 l\/min (baseline condition which prevents mice from floating passively). To objectively quantify fatigue times during swimming exercise, video tracking system can be used (San Diego Instruments Incorporated) which automatically tracks and digitizes spatio-temporal movements of 8 mice. Improvement of fatigue will be assessed by time to fatigue (defined as significant increase in 2D distance or activity over time).\n\nImprovement of maximal exercise capacity: To determine maximal endurance exercise capacity (i.e., time to exhaustion), the maximum swim times are measured at a flow rate of 7 l\/min in repeated measurements three times a week. To reduce the inherent variation in swimming capacity, mice whose mean maximum swim times vary by more than 40% than the average swim time will be excluded. A mouse is qualified as fatigued when it fails to rise to the water surface to breathe and will be rescued at this point. To verify the systemic exhaustion after swimming, plasma lactate and pH will be determined in heparinized arterial blood samples. To objectively quantify fatigue times during forced swimming exercise, we will use a video tracking system (San Diego Instruments Incorporated) which automatically tracks and digitizes spatio-temporal movements of 8 mice in a 2D plane.\n\nIsolated skeletal muscle function: ex vivo characterization of intrinsic muscle resistance to fatigue stimulation or single-twitch contraction protocols following sustained exercise with placebo or a RyCal compound treatment for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks. Two different forms of isolated skeletal muscles will be tested: extensor digitorum longus for a fast-twitch muscle and soleus muscle for a slow-twitch muscle. This test can determine the effect of RyCal compounds on skeletal muscle under fatiguing exercise, or disease conditions. Skeletal muscle contraction and relaxation is critically dependent on intracellular Ca metabolism and RyR1 function and therefore a highly sensitive test.\n\nIntracellular Ca leak and SR Ca content in isolated skeletal myofibers: assessment of isolated skeletal muscle myofibers loaded with fluo-4 Ca indicators for resting SR Ca leak using intracellular Ca sparks. SR Ca content will be assessed by caffeine pulse protocols which result in complete release of the free SR Ca pool. Previous studies have documented calcium leak resulting from a chronic hyperadrenergic state in myofibers of rats with heart failure (Reiken 2003; Ward 2003; Gomez 2001; Cheng 1996).\n\nChanges in mitochondrial integrity from SR Ca leak: mitochondria in mouse skeletal muscle take up Ca which under conditions of strong physiologic muscle stimulation result in continuously elevated mitochondrial Ca levels which stimulates mitochondrial metabolism (Rudolf et al., 2004). However, myotubes from dystrophic mdx mice showed significantly elevated Ca uptake. (Robert V, Massimino M L, Tosello V, et al. Alteration in calcium handling at the subcellular level in mdx myotubes. . Feb. 16, 2001; 276(7):4647-4651.) Cytosolic Ca overload is a highly toxic event that represents a common final pathway of cell death. Mitochondria are key players in cell death, and the spatial proximity of RyR1 Ca release and mitochondrial Ca uptake suggest, that SR Ca leak during strenuous exercise can cause mitochondrial Ca overload which impacts on mitochondrial structure and function and may trigger cell death. Caspase-12 is localized in the SR, is regulated by Ca, and participates in the SR stress-induced apoptosis pathway (Yoneda et al., 2001). In certain aspects the invention characterizes the effects of fatiguing exercise on mitochondrial membrane potential by rhodamine 123 uptake, mitochondrial swelling indicating mitochondrial permeability transition by 520 nm spectrophotometry and light scatter, the amount of intra-mitochondrial Ca by organelle incubation with Ca followed by radioactivity quantification with a liquid scintillation counter, measurement of cytochrome c from release mitochondria coactivating caspases, and staining of muscle preparations for TUNEL-positive cell nuclei. The in vivo effects of RyCal compounds treatment on mitochondrial integrity and function will be assessed.\n\nActivation of intracellular proteases fragments RyR1: A direct link exists between the cytosolic Ca elevations and the proteolysis of intracellular targets through the activation of Ca-dependent proteases, including calpains and caspases. Calpain activation is part of the apoptosis machinery. Increased activation of the ubiquitous calpains has been found in the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), but null mutations of muscle specific calpain causes limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A) (Tidball et al., 2000). These findings indicate that dysregulation of calpain activity contributes to progression of muscle disease by disrupting normal regulatory mechanisms and by a generalized, nonspecific increase of proteolytic capacity. RyR1 and other components of the Ca cycling machinery are targets of and cleaved by caspases and calpains (Johnson et al., 2004; Shevchenko at al., 1998). We will therefore investigate if Ca dependent protease and\/or caspase activation result in RyR1 cleavage following strenuous exercise and if JTV-519 by inhibiting SR Ca leak can prevent activation of unspecific proteolysis.\n\nHistologic changes of skeletal muscle from strenuous, fatiguing exercise: Dystrophic changes from sustained exercise may result in muscle fiber necrosis and progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Histological analysis of skeletal muscles will include analysis for eosinophilic hypercontracted muscle fibers, necrotic fibers, ongoing muscle regeneration, and the proliferation of fibroblasts within muscle tissue since the replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue (fibrosis) is a major cause of permanent muscle weakness. Accordingly, RyCal compounds can be tested for inhibition of these changes. Conventional histology techniques will allow to assess variability in fiber size, split fibers, and centralized nuclei.\n\nFiber typing by histochemistry in skeletal muscles: Historically, the most widely used classification of fiber types is based on the mATPase (myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase) activity by histochemistry which distinguishes between type I (low activity) and type II (high activity) fibers (Brooke et al., 1970). By characterizing the pH lability of the mATPase, type II fibers were further subdivided into IIA and IIB fibers. Additional fiber type characterization with physiologic, histochemical, and ultrastructural methods has revealed: type I, intermediate slow-twitch oxidative; type HA, red fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic; and type IIB, white fast-twitch glycolytic fibers. Quantitative histochemistry can be used to determine mATPase, succinate dehydrogenase, and \u03b1-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and cross-sectional areas in MHC-based fiber type changes in oxidative and glycolytic capacities resulting from sustained exercise and\/or RyCal compound treatment. To determine myofiber ATPase activity, a protocol using 10 \u03bcm thick frozen sections which are preincubated for 5 mins under acidic or 12 mins under alkaline conditions can be used. Succinate dehydrogenase staining will allow characterizing activity and distinction between muscle fibers. Changes in oxidative muscle fiber types and improvement after treatment for myotonia have been reported in mice previously (Reininghaus et al., 1988).\n\nFiber typing by immunocytochemistry in skeletal muscles: To quantitate changes in myonuclear number and location and to distinguish from nuclei of interstitial cells, morphometry by fluorescence microscopy using stains for nuclei (DAPI) and basement membrane (anti-laminin) will be applied. This technique will be particularly important to precisely determine cross-sectional area and number of nuclei in muscle fibers. Moreover, the technique allows for combined immunocytochemistry with the following affinity-purified antibodies: C-terminal RyR2-5029, phospho-epitope-specific RyR1-p2844 (Wehrens et al., 2004), calstabin1 (FKBP12) (Jayaraman et al., 1992), isoform-specific myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibodies (Rivero et al. 1999), and \u03b1-actinin (Ruehr et al., 2003) using a previously established protocol with 10 \u03bcm thick cryostat sections of EDL or soleus muscles (Moschella et al., 1995). This approach will allow us to classify myofibers and phenotypic changes according to MHC content, metabolic activity, fiber size, RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, and calstabin1 binding occurring from sustained exercise and\/or RyCal compound treatment. Further, the fiber type and immunocytochemistry data will be correlated to isolated skeletal muscle function, general histologic data, histochemistry, RyR1 single-channel function, and mitochondria data. Using immunohistochemical staining, fiber type-specific improvement of calstabin1 binding to RyR1 and RyR1 PKA phosphorylation can be determined in the presence or absence, or after RyCal compound treatment in \u03b1-actinin positive compartments (Z-disk), and for increased calpain expression in the myofibrillar area (Z disks; compartment containing RyR1 channels) of muscle fibers.\n\nSkeletal muscle oxidative capacity: Muscle oxidative activity correlates with skeletal muscle adoption to aerobic exercise. As a general test, fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle oxidative enzyme activity will be assessed by spectrophotometric assessment of the citric acid cycle and citrate synthase activity in muscle homogenates. Activity as determined as the complex from coenzyme A and oxaloacetate is expected to be increased as reported by a group using a similar protocol (Evangelista et al., 2003). This test will be used to confirm changes in oxidative capacity seen by histochemistry.\n\nImprovement of creatine kinase (CK) plasma levels: Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) plasma concentrations (Santos et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2004), can be determined as indicators or muscle damage and inflammation after exhaustive exercise and to determine effect due to RyCal compound treatment.\n\nRyR1 composition and function in white blood cells: RyR1 in immune cells functions as a Ca release channel during B- or T-cell receptor-stimulated activation (Sei et al., 2002; Kraev et al., 2003). For functional analysis, peripheral white blood cells are isolated from mouse blood samples by centrifugation. Leukocytes (10\/ml) are loaded with 1 \u03bcm acetoxy-methyl ester of fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) by incubation for 30 mins at 25\u00b0 C. and caffeine sensitivity of intracellular Ca release is tested. Composition and PKA phosphorylation of the RyR1 channel complex will be characterized. Investigating RyR1 in white blood cells will allow monitoring temporal changes during sustained exercise and RyCal compound treatment in vivo.\n\nGenetically Modified Mice\n","The RyR1 macromolecular signaling complex plays a key role in modulating activation of the channel and excitation-contraction coupling by the sympathetic nervous system. In the RyR1 complex mAKAP targets PKA and the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 to the channel and the phosphatase PP1 is targeted to the channel by the targeting protein spinophilin. This signaling module controls PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser2843 as part of the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d stress response. During normal exercise 2-3 of the four Ser2843 PKA phosphorylation sites in each tetrameric RyR1 channel are transiently PKA phosphorylated resulting in increased activity of the RyR1 channel.","Activation of the RyR1 due to PKA phosphorylation occurs because PKA phosphorylation decreases the binding affinity of the stabilizing protein calstabin1 (FKBP12) for the channel resulting in increased sensitivity of the channel to Ca-dependent activation. PDE4D3 in the RyR1 macromolecular signaling complex plays a protective role against PKA hyperphosphorylation and forms a negative feedback loop during PKA activation. The phosphodiesterases in the RyR1 complex by rapidly degrading local cAMP and thereby terminating channel activation by PKA. Mice that are deficient in PDE4D3 or calstabin1 in the RyR1 complex will be tested for accelerated muscle fatigue. Thus, both calstabin1 and PDE4D3 in the RyR2 complex can be thought of as being \u201cprotective\u201d against muscle dysfunction during excessive exercise or stress. Thus additional components of the RyR1 macromolecular complex are protective against fatigue as these molecules could potentially be novel therapeutic targets and\/or identify adverse pharmaceutical agents for preventing fatigue during intense stress in warfighters.","The muscle-specific genetic mouse model HSAof myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has a DM-like phenotype. Importantly, the HSAmyotonic phenotype includes variable degrees of histopathological signs of muscle degeneration and repair, which correspond to the expression of more toxic, long or less, toxic short repeat variants. In addition to wild-type mice, susceptibility to muscle fatigue will be investigated using swimming and treadmill running protocols. In a subgroup of mice, implantable telemetry devices will be implanted two weeks before the mice are subjected to an exercise-stress protocol as described. Upon completion of the experiment, mice will be sacrificed and muscles will be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or further processed for histological assays. Specific muscle types are carefully dissected under stereoscope vision and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or examined by histology and immunohistochemistry. In all tissue samples, RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, levels of the components of the RyR2 macromolecular complex including calstabin1, PKA, RII, mAKAP, PP1, spinophilin, PDE4D3, CaMKII, and single channel properties will be examined. The following properties are determined: Ca sensitivity of activation and inhibition, Mg inhibition, and changes from in vivo RyCal treatment. At conclusion of each single channel experiment ryanodine will be applied to the channel to confirm RyR identity. The HSAmouse will allow to test beneficial effects of RyCal compounds in an extreme model of genetic muscle fatigue and dystrophy.","Susceptibility to muscle fatigue can be investigated using swimming and treadmill running protocols. Implantable telemetry devices can be implanted two weeks before the mice are subjected to an exercise-stress protocol. Upon completion of the experiment, mice are sacrificed and muscles are flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Upon completion of each experiment, muscles can be dissected and will also be examined by histology and Western blotting. In all tissue samples, RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, levels of the components of the RyR2 macromolecular complex including calstabin1, PKA, RII, mAKAP, PP1, spinophilin, PDE4D3, CaMKII, and single channel properties can be examined. The following properties can be determined: Ca sensitivity of activation and inhibition, Mg inhibition, response to PKA phosphorylation. At conclusion of each single channel experiment ryanodine is applied to the channel to confirm RyR identity.","RyCal Compounds Prevent Muscle Fatigue and Muscle Degeneration","In certain aspects, the invention provides that RyCal compounds can restore normal function to hyperphosphorylated RyR1. Furthermore, use of PDE4D knockout and FKBP12 haploinsufficient mice allows determination whether RyCal compound prevent muscle fatigue.","The foregoing discussion established two animal models (mouse and rat) of muscle dysfunction and fatiguing, which result from sustained forms of exercise. The models can provide important clues if chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system resulting from sustained exercise and stress cause a critical defect in the RyR1 Ca release channel. Previous experiments in a heart failure model that results in chronic sympathetic hyperactivity have established a critical defect in RyR1 contributing to accelerated muscle fatigue. RyCal compounds have beneficial effects to inhibit muscle fatigue during sustained exercise capacity, and isolated slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscle function in the investigated fatigue models. Catecholamine-induced muscle fatigue has been established in rat and mouse hearts failure models earlier and therefore we will be able to apply similar techniques to test for muscle fatigue following sustained animal exercise protocols.","Maintenance of muscle performance during sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system, for example but not limited to combat, requires a maximal rate of intracellular SR Ca cycling. Chronic maximal stress results in permanent activation of the sympathetic nervous system potentially causing RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and intracellular Ca leak. In skeletal muscles, intracellular Ca leak gradually causes a myopathy characterized by significantly reduced duration and maximal power of peak performance as well as accelerated fatigue by additional ATP consumption of SR Ca ATPase pumps that compensate for uncontrolled SR Ca leak. SR Ca leak is unique since it is a direct cause of muscle fatigue intrinsic to myofibers which is not reversible in the acute setting. A drug like any RyCal compound which fixes the SR Ca leak by binding calstabin1 to the channel and stabilizing the closed state even during stress therefore helps to prevent accelerated fatigue development and promotes longer performance despite sustained stress (Wehrens, 2005). The pharmacotherapy is unique since it targets a central fatigue mechanism and potentially prevents toxic effects of intracellular Ca leak. Moreover the molecular mechanism of this pharmocotherapy is unique, since it treats a specific defect contributing to muscle fatigue and since the mechanism of RyCal action is stabilization of normal RyR1 channel closure by increasing the calstabin1 binding affinity, which is distinct from historical approaches that block ion channel function.","More recently, SR Ca leak was documented in myofibers following intense exercise and in a model of muscular dystrophy, (Wang et al., 2005), possibly due to defective skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1 s). Also, chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the context of heart failure promotes intrinsic skeletal muscle (SM) fatigue due to depletion of the phosphodiesterease PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at Serine 2844, calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex, and a gain-of-function channel defect (Reiken et al., 2003). RyR1 dysfunction in the skeletal muscle leads to altered local subcellular Ca release events and impaired global calcium transients (Ward et al., 2003). In the context of chronic exercise, there is evidence indicating that changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex, namely depletion of PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at Serine 2844, and calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex are related in a time-dependent and activity-dependent manner with repeated intense exercise in a mouse model. These biochemical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex regulation and function are stable following prolonged exercise and recover slowly over days to weeks. Thus RyR1 Ca leak limits peak muscle performance and mediates muscle damage during prolonged, stressful exercise.","Molecular Mechanisms of Muscle Fatigue","The hypotheses that muscle fatigue is due to lactic acid accumulation in the cytoplasm and potassium ion accumulation in T-tubules have largely been set aside and attention has shifted to the study of metabolic and mitochondrial regulation and signaling pathways during chronic exercise (Lin, Wu et al. 2002; Wu, Kanatous et al. 2002; Wang, Zhang et al. 2004). These alternative explanations, while important, are unlikely to directly address the underlying abnormalities in ECC observed in fatigued muscle (Berchtold, Brinkmeier et al. 2000). Described herein is the regulation of the skeletal calcium release channel, RyR1, during chronic or high intensity exercise. The remodeling of the RyR1 macromolecular complex during chronic exercise, consisting of PKA hyperphosphorylation at Ser2844, PDE4D3 depletion, and calstabin1 depletion, likely plays a role in determining muscle fatigue during chronic exercise.","Exercise promotes numerous positive effects on an organism, from improvement in cardiovascular performance to increased glucose uptake and normalization of fuel metabolism (Goodyear and Kahn 1998; Pollock, Franklin et al. 2000). In heart failure, light exercise training has been shown to improve skeletal muscle strength and reduce fatigue, perhaps through adaptation to more aerobic muscle properties (Minotti, Johnson et al. 1990; Lunde, Sjaastad et al. 2001; Meyer 2006). On the other hand, high intensity exercise, such as that performed by a marathon runner or a long distance cyclist results in significant muscle damage and can impair task performance for days or weeks after a single event (O'Reilly, Warhol et al. 1987; Balnave and Thompson 1993; Komulainen and Vihko 1994).","Described herein is also a mouse model of intense physiological exercise to examine the changes in RyR1 function and ECC experienced by elite athletes, soldiers, or others under intense stressful activity. By combining daily swimming with level treadmill running assays, a physiological exercise regimen was constructed that did not exclusively involve isometric or eccentric contraction of the hind limb. While this resulted in less dramatic evidence of exercise-induced muscle damage than pure eccentric contractions, the data presented are more readily generalized.","Biochemical changes were identified in the RyR1 macromolecular complex consistent with leaky calcium release channels. Single channel bilayer data confirmed a leaky-phenotype of the RyR1 channels from chronically exercised hind limb muscle, with elevated open probabilities in the chronically exercised group at resting calcium levels compared to sedentary controls. In two mouse genetic models replicating aspects of the biochemical changes in the RyR1 complex, namely muscle-specific deficiency of calstabin1 (cal1\u2212\/\u2212) and deficiency of PDE4D3 (PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212), exercise defects were identified. The role of calstabin1 depletion was assessed in another way by pharmacologically rebinding the stabilizing subunit to RyR1 with the Ca channel stabilizer S107. Calstabin1 rebinding to RyR1, induced by S107 resulted in improved exercise capacity, as measured by treadmill failure times, over the same 21 day time course that depleted calstabin1 in the vehicle treated mice. The lack of an effect of S107 on cal1\u2212\/\u2212 mice provides evidence that the molecular mechanism of S107 is indeed through calstabin1 rebinding to RyR1.","In vitro fatigue protocols on intact isolated muscles suffer from the limitation that force declines are largely limited by hypoxia (Zhang, Bruton et al. 2006). Therefore, single FDB muscle fibers were isolated from sedentary and chronically exercised mice with and without S107 for assessment of the decline in tetanic Ca during fatigue. Exercised fibers with calstabin rebound were relatively protected against fatigue (). The effect of S107 did not appear to be due to a shift in the fiber kinetics to slower calcium cycling.","S107 corrected the leak in RyR1 from chronically exercised mice as measured in a lipid bilayer at low resting Ca levels. Ca leak resulting from the overactive skeletal ryanodine receptors was not directly visualized in isolated muscle fibers, as calcium sparks were infrequent under all conditions tested, which is consistent with most reports that sparks in skeletal muscle are rare except under certain highly pathological conditions such as hypoosmotic shock or muscular dystrophy (Isaeva, Shkryl et al. 2005; Rios 2005; Wang, Weisleder et al. 2005).","Numerous hypotheses present themselves for how alterations in RyR1 Ca leak could result in muscle damage. These data do not identify one muscle damage pathway solely responsible for the physiological effects seen, however, they implicate a role for calpain activation during chronic, and\/or high intensity exercise. Several groups have demonstrated that calpain activation is a major mechanism for exercise-induced muscle damage (Belcastro 1993; Spencer and Mellgren 2002). As described herein, calpain activation in isolated EDL muscle was elevated following chronic exercise, but reduced by treatment with S107, suggesting that correction of the leaky RyR1 may protect against calpain activation (). With a potential contribution of other Ca-dependent pathways such as caspases, calmodulin, or calmodulin-dependent kinases to the damage induced by leaky ryanodine receptors, the present data suggest a mechanism by which local elevation of cytosolic Ca could lead to damage. The hypothesis that ryanodine receptor-induced leak can cause muscle damage was further supported by evidence of reduced muscle damage, as measured by serum creatine kinase, in the S107 treated mice (). The data described herein shows that changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex produces a leaky phenotype during chronic, high intensity exercise which impairs exercise performance.","Neuropathies","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of neuropathies. The term \u201cneuropathy\u201d as used herein refers to conditions characterized by damage to the nerves, including, but not limited to, damage caused by infections, inflammatory processes, exposure to toxins, treatment with drugs, nutritional deficiency, trauma, pressure on a nerve, neuronal death, neuronal degeneration, and heritable conditions. Although the term \u201cneuropathy\u201d is most frequently used to refer to conditions characterized damage to the peripheral nerves, i.e. \u201cperipheral neuropathies\u201d, as used herein, the term \u201cneuropathy\u201d includes both peripheral neuropathies and neuropathies affecting nerves of the central nervous system, i.e. \u201ccentral neuropathies.\u201d","There are various sub-classifications of neuropathies. For example, neuropathies may be classified as either peripheral or central, as either acute or chronic, or as either demyelinating or axonal. Neuropathies may also be classified according to the number of nerves that they affect. A neuropathy may involve damage to only a single nerve or nerve group (referred to as mononeuropathies) or may affect multiple nerves (polyneuropathies).","Peripheral neuropathies may be caused by hereditable disorders, systemic or metabolic disorders, dietary deficiencies, exposure to toxic substances, treatment with drugs, infection, inflammatory response, autoimmune diseases, and multiple other factors. Also, many peripheral neuropathies are of unknown etiology.","Examples of hereditable peripheral neuropathies include, but are not limited to, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and Friedreich's ataxia.","Examples of peripheral neuropathies caused by systemic or metabolic disorders include, but are not limited to diabetic neuropathy.","Examples of peripheral neuropathies caused by dietary deficiencies include, but are not limited to neuropathy caused by vitamin B-12 deficiency, and neuropathy caused by thiamine deficiency.","Examples of peripheral neuropathies caused by exposure to toxic substances include, but are not limited to neuropathy caused by excessive alcohol use (\u201calcoholic neuropathy\u201d), neuropathy caused by memia (such as in kidney failure patients), neuropathy caused by arsenic, neuropathy caused by nitrous oxide, neuropathy caused by industrial agents especially solvents, neuropathy caused by heavy metal exposure (such as lead, arsenic, mercury, and the like).","Examples of peripheral neuropathies caused by infectious agents and\/or inflammatory or autoimmune processes include, but are not limited to, neuropathies caused by GullainBarre syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren syndrome, HIV infection, syphhilis infection, herpes infection, hepatitis infection, colorado tick fever infection, diptheria infection, leprosy, Lyme disease, and amyloidosis.","Examples of peripheral neuropathies caused by drugs include, but are not limited to neuropathy caused by amiodarone, hydralazine, perhexyline, chemotherapeutic drugs, vincristine, cisplatin, metronidazole (Flagyl), nitrofurantoin, thalidomide, INH (isoniazid), Dapsone, anticonvulsants, Phenyloin, Disulfuram, zidovudine, retrovir, AZT, didanosine (Videx), stavudine (Zerit), zalcitabine (Hivid), ritonavir (Norvir), amprenavir (Agenerase), lovastatin (Mevacor), indapamid (Lozol), gemfibrozil (Lopid).","Other miscellaneous causes or peripheral neuropathy include, but are not limited to ischemia, prolonged exposure to cold temperature, prolonged pressure on, or compression of a nerve, and trauma.","Peripheral neuropathies are characterized by damage to the either the sensory, motor, or autonomic peripheral nerves. The symptoms and effects of peripheral neuropathies depend on the types of nerves affected. Damage to such nerves can result in one or more of pain (neuropathic pain), loss of sensation, and loss of muscular control, abnormal blood pressure, abnormal heart function, digestion problems, and the like.","Damage to sensory fibers may result in changes in sensation, burning sensations, nerve pain (neuralgia, neuropathic pain), tingling, numbness, inability to determine joint position, and incoordination. Damage to the motor fibers may affect muscle control and can cause weakness, cramps, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of dexterity, paralysis, muscle atrophy, Muscle twitching (fasciculation), difficulty breathing or swallowing, falling. The autonomic nerves control involuntary and semi-voluntary functions, such as control of the internal organs, control of breathing, and blood pressure. Damage to autonomic nerves may cause, inability to regulate blood pressure, respiratory problems, problems of the digestive system (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, early satiety, diarrhea, constipation, unintentional weight loss), problems with the genitourinary system, (such as urinary incontinence, other bladder-function disorders, and male impotence.","Examples of specific nerves that may be affected in peripheral neuropathies include, but are not limited to, the axillary nerve, the brachial plexus, the peroneal nerve, the distal median nerve, the facial nerves palsy, the femoral nerves, the radial nerves, the sciatic nerve, the tibial nerves, and the ulnar nerves.","Examples of central neuropathies include, but are not limited to, vestibular neuropathies, optic neuropathies, optic nerve neuropathies, and retinal neuropathies. Other types of central neuropathy are known to those of skill in the art, and are encompassed by the present invention.","Seizures","The term \u201cseizure\u201d as used herein includes epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizure. Epileptic seizures result from, temporary abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can manifest as an alterations tonic or chronic movements, convulsions, sudden and involuntary contraction of a group of muscles, involuntary changes in body movement or function, numbness, alterations in mental state, alterations in sensation, alterations in awareness, changes in behavior, temporary loss of memory, visual disturbances, and various other symptoms. Symptoms experienced by a person during a seizure depend on where in the brain the disturbance in electrical activity occurs.","There are various different types of seizures, all of which are within the scope of the present invention. For example, seizures may be epileptic or non-epileptic, as described below. Seizures may also be classified according to whether the source of the seizure within the brain is localized (partial or focal onset seizures) or distributed (generalized seizures).","Partial seizures are further divided on the extent to which consciousness is affected. If consciousness is unaffected the seizure is referred to as a simple partial seizure. If consciousness is affected, the seizure is referred to as a complex partial seizure. A partial seizure may also spread within the brain\u2014a process known as secondary generalization.","Generalized seizures are divided according to the effect on the body but all involve loss of consciousness. These include absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic, tonic-clonic, and atonic seizures. In the past, seizures have also been classified as \u201cpetit mal\u201d, \u201cgrand mal\u201d, \u201cJacksonian\u201d, \u201cpsychomotor\u201d, and \u201ctemporal-lobe\u201d seizures.","Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons. Epilepsy may be symptomatic or idiopathic. Symptomatic epilepsies are caused by structural or metabolic abnormality in the brain, which may be the result of factors such as genetic disorders (such as tuberous sclerosis or ring chromosome 20 syndrome), stroke, head injury, bacterial or viral encephalitis, alcohol use. There are several syndromes that associated with epilepsy, including, but not limited to, infantile spasms (West syndrome), benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (or benign rolandic epilepsy), benign childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), temporal lobe epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, occipital lobe epilepsy, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Idiopathic seizures are those for which no specific cause has been identified.","Certain triggers or environmental factors or can lead to an increased likelihood of seizures in subjects with epilepsy. Examples of such triggers include, but are not limited to, sleep, the transition between sleep and wakefulness, tiredness, illness, constipation, menstruation, stress, and alcohol consumption. It should also be noted that, even in epileptic subjects, seizures may be triggered by some of the same specific events that cause \u201cprovoked\u201d seizures in non-epileptic subjects.","Non-epileptic seizures appear outwardly similar to epileptic seizures but do not involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons. Non-epileptic seizures are typically provoked by either physiological or psychological conditions. Seizures caused by psychological conditions are referred to as \u201cpsychogenic\u201d non-epileptic seizures.","Causes of non-epileptic or \u201cprovoked\u201d seizures include, but are not limited to, head injury, intoxication with drugs, drug toxicity (for example aminophylline or local anaesthetic toxicity, drugs that lower the seizure threshold (such as tricyclic antidepressants), infection (such as encephalitis or meningitis), fever leading to febrile convulsions, metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycaemia or hypoxia, withdrawal from drugs (such as anticonvulsants, sedatives, alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines), brain tumors, other brain lesions, eclampsia during pregnancy, photosensitivity, flashing or flickering lights and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It should be noted that the above stimuli may also trigger epileptic seizures.","Cognitive Disorders","In another aspect, the present invention is directed to the treatment and prevention of cognitive disorders, and also to methods and compositions for improvement of cognitive function more generally, even in the absence of a specific cognitive disorder. For example, improvement of cognitive function to combat the normal cognitive decline associated with aging, or to enhance cognitive function for other reasons, is encompassed by the present invention.","The terms \u201ccognitive function\u201d and \u201ccognitive process\u201d as used herein, include the mental processes of attention, learning and memory, perception, language skills, problem solving skills, and other type of cognitive function known to those of skill in the art. The terms \u201ccognitive disorder,\u201d \u201ccognitive disease,\u201d and \u201ccognitive condition,\u201d as used herein, refer to situations in which processes are disrupted or abnormal. The term \u201ccognitive disorder,\u201d as used herein encompasses all of the cognitive disorders described below and also all other cognitive disorders known to those of skill in the art. Types of cognitive disorders that are within the scope of the invention include, but are not limited to, dementias, delirium, amnesias, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress-induced cognitive dysfunction.","The term \u201cdementia\u201d as used herein refers to decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the brain or central nervous system beyond that which might be expected from normal aging. Dementias typically affect cognitive functions such as learning, memory, attention, language skills, and problem solving skills. Types and causes of dementia include, but are not limited to, chronic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia (also known as multi-infarct dementia), Binswanger's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), alcohol-induced persisting dementia, frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD), Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia (or frontal variant FTLD), semantic dementia (or temporal variant FTLD), progressive non-fluent aphasia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and AIDS dementia complex.","Other types of cognitive disorders that may be treated with the methods and compositions of the present invention include the various attention disorders. Attention Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; ADH is also referred to as Attention-deficit syndrome (ADS)) is a neurological disorder initially appearing in childhood which manifests itself with symptoms such as hyperactivity, forgetfulness, poor impulse control, and distractibility. In neurological terms, ADHD is currently considered to be a persistent and chronic syndrome for which no medical cure is available. ADHD is believed to affect between 3-5% of the United States population, including both children and adults. ADHD is sometimes referred to as ADD when only inattentiveness and distractibility are problematic. ADHD can be classified into three subtypes: predominantly inattentive (sometimes referred to as ADD), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. Those presenting impairing symptoms of ADHD who do not fully fit the criteria for any of the three subtypes can be diagnosed with \u201cADHD Not Otherwise Specified.\u201d The symptoms of ADHD are given the name \u201cHyperkinetic disorders\u201d. When a conduct disorder is present, the condition is referred to as \u201cHyperkinetic conduct disorder\u201d. All of the above conditions are within the scope of the present invention.","In one embodiment, the cognitive disorder is not Alzheimer's Disease. In another embodiment, the cognitive disorder is not memory loss. In another embodiment, the cognitive disorder is not age-dependent memory loss.","Prevention and Treatment","In one embodiment, the present invention provides compositions and methods that are useful for treating and\/or preventing conditions affecting the nervous system, such as neuropathies, seizures and cognitive disorders.","In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present invention may be used preventively in subjects who are not yet suffering from neuropathies, seizures or cognitive disorders, but whom exhibit one or more \u201crisk factors\u201d or are otherwise predisposed to the development of neuropathies, seizures or cognitive disorders.","Subjects","In preferred embodiments, the compositions described herein are administered therapeutically or prophylactically to subjects who are suffering from, or at risk of developing a disease, disorder or condition affecting the nervous system, such as a neuropathy, seizures or a cognitive disorder.

For example, protein is isolated and purified from cells of a subject using standard methods known in the art, including, without limitation, extraction from the cells (e.g., with a detergent that solubilizes the protein) where necessary, followed by affinity purification on a column, chromatography (e.g., FTLC and HPLC), immunoprecipitation (with an antibody), and precipitation (e.g., with isopropanol and a reagent such as Trizol). Isolation and purification of the protein is followed by electrophoresis (e.g., on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel). A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject, or the limiting or prevention thereof, is determined by comparing the amount of RyR-bound FKBP detected prior to the administration of a compound of the invention (in accordance with methods described below) with the amount detected a suitable time after administration of the compound.","A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented, for example, by inhibiting dissociation of FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; by increasing binding between FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; or by stabilizing the RyR-FKBP complex in cells of a subject.

For example, it has been shown that RyR2 channels play an important role in EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, it is clear that preventive drugs designed to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells, particularly RyR2-bound FKPB12.6 in cardiac muscle cells, are useful in the regulation of a number of RyR-associated biological events, including EC coupling and contractility. Thus, the one or more compounds of the invention are evaluated for effect on EC coupling and contractility in cells, particularly cardiac muscle cells, and therefore, usefulness for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.","Accordingly, the method of the present invention further comprises the steps of contacting one or more compounds of the invention with a culture of cells containing RyR; and determining if the one or more compounds has an effect on an RyR-associated biological event in the cells.

According to this method of the present invention, the one or more compounds are contacted with one or more cells (such as cardiac muscle cells) in vitro. For example, a culture of the cells is incubated with a preparation containing the one or more compounds of the invention. The compounds' effect on a RyR-associated biological event then is assessed by any biological assays or methods known in the art, including immunoblotting, single-channel recordings and any others disclosed herein.","The present invention is further directed to one or more compounds of the invention, identified by the above-described identification method, as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and\/or diluent.

As used herein, a \u201cRyR-associated condition\u201d is a condition, disease, or disorder in which RyR level or activity has been implicated, and includes an RyR-associated biological event. The RyR-associated condition is treated or prevented in the subject by administering to the subject an amount of the compound effective to treat or prevent the RyR-associated condition in the subject.

The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating an animal containing RyR; (b) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to the animal; (c) exposing the animal to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining the extent the compound limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the animal. The method further comprises the steps of: (e) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to an animal containing RyR; and (f) determining the extent of the effect of the compound on a RyR-associated biological event in the animal.

Compounds that bind to the RyR channel at the FKBP binding site, but do not come off the channel when the channel is phosphorylated by PKA, would also be expected to decrease the activity of the channel in response to PKA activation or other triggers that activate the RyR channel. Such compounds would also result in less calcium release into the cell.","By way of example, the diagnostic assays screen for the release of calcium into cells via the RyR channel, using calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes (e.g., Fluo-3, Fura-2, and the like). Cells are loaded with the fluorescent dye of choice, then stimulated with RyR activators to determine the reduction of the calcium-dependent fluorescent signal (Brillantes, et al., Stabilization of calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) function by FK506-binding protein. 77:513-23, 1994; Gillo, et al., Calcium entry during induced differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. 81:783-92, 1993; Jayaraman, et al., Regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor by tyrosine phosphorylation. 272:1492-94, 1996). Calcium-dependent fluorescent signals are monitored with a photomultiplier tube, and analyzed with appropriate software. This assay can easily be automated to screen the compounds of the invention using multiwell dishes.","To demonstrate that the compounds of inhibit the PKA-dependent activation of RyR-mediated intracellular calcium release, an assay involves the expression of recombinant RyR channels in a heterologous expression system, such as Sf9, HEK293, or CHO cells. RyR could also be co-expressed with beta-adrenergic receptors. This would permit assessment of the effect of compounds of the invention on RyR activation, in response to addition of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.","The level of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 which correlates with the degree of heart failure also is assayed and then used to determine the efficacy of the one or more compounds of the invention to block the PKA phosphorylation of the RyR2 channel. Such an assay is based on the use of antibodies that are specific for the RyR2 protein. For example, the RyR2-channel protein is immunoprecipitated and then back-phosphorylated with PKA and [gammaP]-ATP. The amount of radioactive [P] label that is transferred to the RyR2 protein then is measured using a phosphorimager (Marx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. 101:365-76, 2000).","Another assay of the compounds of the invention involves use of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody that detects RyR1 that is PKA phosphorylated on Ser 2843 or RyR2 that is PKA phosphorylated on Ser 2809. Immunoblotting with such an antibody can be used to assess efficacy of these compounds for therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, RyR2 S2809A and RyR2 S2809D knock-in mice are used to assess efficacy of therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Such mice further provide evidence that PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is a contributing factor in heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias by showing that the RyR2 S2809A mutation inhibits heart failure and arrhythmias, and that the RyR2 S2809D mutation worsens heart failure and arrhythmias.","Therefore, in a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating heart failure, atrial fibrillation or exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound selected from the compounds of the invention.","Intracellular Ca leak is proposed as a principal mediator of depressed muscle performance and dystrophic muscle remodeling. Muscular dystrophies are heterogeneous hereditary diseases characterized by weakness and progressive muscle wasting. Of all forms of muscular dystrophies involving the dystrophin-associated protein complex (referred to as dystrophinopathies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most frequent genetic diseases (X-linked; 1 in 3,500 boys) with death usually occurring before age 30 by respiratory and\/or cardiac failure in high numbers of patients. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) represents a milder form of the disease associated with a reduction in the amount or expression of a truncated form of the dystrophin protein whereas Duchenne patients have been characterized by complete absence or very low levels of dystrophin. Duchenne and Becker's muscular dystrophy (DMD\/BMD) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the 427-kDa cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. However, with increasing age in BMD cardiac symptoms are more common than in DMD patients and do not correlate with skeletal muscle symptoms. Since genetic screening will not eliminative DMD due to a high incidence of sporadic cases, an effective therapy is highly desirable. DMD\/BMD have been consistently associated with disturbed intracellular calcium metabolism. Because alterations of intracellular Ca concentrations in DMD myofibers are believed to represent a central pathogenic mechanism, development of a therapeutic intervention that prevents intracellular Ca abnormalities as a cause of skeletal muscle degeneration is highly desirable.","It is well established that lack of dystrophin expression is the primary genetic defect in DMD and BMD. However, the key mechanism leading to progressive muscle damage is largely unknown. It has been suggested that elevations of intracellular Ca concentrations ([Ca]) under resting conditions directly contributed to toxic muscle cell (myofiber) damage and concurrent activation of Ca-dependent proteases. Since calpain activity is increased in necrotic muscle fibers of mdx mice and calpain dysfunction contributes to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, preventing activation of calcium-dependent proteases by inhibiting intracellular Ca elevations represents a strategy to prevent muscle wasting in DMD. Significant differences in [Ca]between normal and dystrophic muscles have been reported in myotubes and animal models including the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse. Intracellular Ca elevations are prevented by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention.","The present invention also provides a method of diagnosis of a disease or disorder in a subject, said method comprising: obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject; obtaining DNA from the cell or tissue; comparing the DNA from the cell or tissue with a control DNA encoding RyR to determine whether a mutation is present in the DNA from the cell or tissue, the presence of a mutation indicating a disease or disorder.

In embodiment A, PKA phosphorylated RyR2 is generated as follows: cardiac SR membrane preparations (5 \u03bcl, 50 \u03bcg) are added to a total of 100 \u03bcl of kinase buffer (8 mM MgCl, 10 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris-PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 100 \u03bcM MgATP and 40 units of PKA, and incubated at room temperature. Samples are centrifuged at 95,000 g for 10 min and the pellets are washed three times in 0.2 ml imidazole buffer. The final pellets are pooled and resuspended in imidazole buffer (final concentration\u224810 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl). To test for the FKBP12.6 rebinding efficiency of JTV-519, PKA phosphorylated cardiac SR (50 mg) is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the test compounds and 250 nM FKBP12.6 in 10 mM imidizol buffer, pH 7.0.

Provided herein is a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening of other compounds that are capable of modulating calcium ion channel activity.","By way of example, and as shown in Example 5 below, a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening for small molecules is developed by immobilizing FKBP, either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 (e.g., wild-type FKBP12.6 or a fusion protein, such as GST-FKBP12.6) onto a 96-well plate coated with glutathione, using standard procedures. PKA-phosphorylated ryanodine receptor (RyR), specifically RyR1 or RyR3 in the case of FKBP12 and RyR2 in the case of FKBP12.6, is loaded onto the FKBP-coated plate, and incubated with compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. Thereafter, the plate is washed to remove the unbound RyR, and then incubated with anti-RyR antibody (e.g., for 30 min). The plate is washed again to remove unbound anti-RyR antibody, and then treated with florescent-labeled secondary antibody. The plate is read by an automatic fluorescent plate reader for binding activity.","Alternatively, RyR is PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of P-ATP. Radioactive PKA-phosphorylated RyR is loaded onto an FKBP-coated, 96-well plate, in the presence of JTV-519 analogues and other compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. The plate is washed to remove the unbound radiolabeled RyR, and then read by an automatic plate reader. PKA-phosphorylated RyR also is coated to the plate, and incubated with S-labeled FKBP in the presence of the compounds.","The present invention is described in the following Examples, which are set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention and should not be construed to limit in any way the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow thereafter.","Cardiac SR membranes are prepared, as previously described (Marx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. 101:365-76, 2000; Kaftan, et al., Effects of rapamycin on ryanodine receptor\/Ca-release channels from cardiac muscle. 78:990-97, 1996). S-labelled FKBP12.6 was generated using the TNT\u2122 Quick Coupled Transcription\/Translation system from Promega (Madison, Wis.). [H] ryanodine binding is used to quantify RyR2 levels. 100 \u03bcg of microsomes are diluted in 100 \u03bcl of 10-mM imidazole buffer (pH 6.8), incubated with 250-nM (final concentration) [S]-FKBP12.6 at 37\u00b0 C. for 60 min, then quenched with 500 \u03bcl of ice-cold imidazole buffer. Samples are centrifuged at 100,000 g for 10 min and washed three times in imidazole buffer. The amount of bound [S]-FKBP12.6 is determined by liquid scintillation counting of the pellet.","Immunoblotting of microsomes (50 \u03bcg) is performed as described, with anti-FKBP12\/12.6 (1:1,000), anti-RyR-5029 (1:3,000) (Jayaraman, et al., FK506 binding protein associated with the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor). 267:9474-77, 1992), or anti-phosphoRyR2-P2809 (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature (Reiken, et al., Beta-blockers restore calcium release channel function and improve cardiac muscle performance in human heart failure. 107:2459-66, 2003). The P2809-phosphoepitope-specific anti-RyR2 antibody is an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody, custom-made by Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, Calif.) using the peptide, CRTRRI-(pS)-QTSQ, which corresponds to RyR2PKA-phosphorylated at Ser. After incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Ky.), the blots are developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.).","Single-channel recordings of native RyR2 from mouse hearts, or recombinant RyR2, are acquired under voltage-clamp conditions at 0 mV, as previously described (Marx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. 101:365-76, 2000). Symmetric solutions used for channel recordings are: trans compartment\u2014HEPES, 250 mmol\/L; Ba(OH), 53 mmol\/L (in some experiments, Ba(OH)is replaced by Ca(OH)); pH 7.35; and cis compartment\u2014HEPES, 250 mmol\/L; Tris-base, 125 mmol\/L; EGTA, 1.0 mmol\/L; and CaCl, 0.5 mmol\/L; pH 7.35. Unless otherwise indicated, single-channels recordings are made in the presence of 150-nM [Ca] and 1.0-mM [Mg] in the cis compartment. Ryanodine (5 mM) is applied to the cis compartment to confirm identity of all channels. Data is analyzed from digitized current recordings using Fetchan software (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.). All data is expressed as mean\u00b1SE. The unpaired Student's t-testis used for statistical comparison of mean values between experiments. A value of p<0.05 is considered statistically significant.","Assays for screening biologically-active small molecules have been developed. These assays are based on rebinding of FKBP12 protein to RyR.","A highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening for small molecules is developed by immobilization of FKBP12.6 (GST-fusion protein) onto a 96-well plate coated with glutathione. PKA-phosphorylated ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) is loaded onto the FKBP12.6-coated plate, and incubated with JTV-519 analogues at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. Thereafter, the plate is washed to remove the unbound RyR2, and then incubated with anti-RyR2 antibody for 30 min. The plate is again washed to remove unbound anti-RyR2 antibody, and then treated with florescent-labeled secondary antibody. The plate is read by an automatic fluorescent plate reader for binding activity.","In an alternative assay, RyR2 is PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of 32P-ATP. Radioactive PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 is loaded onto an FKBP12.6-coated, 96-well plate, in the presence of JTV-519 analogues at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. The plate is washed to remove the unbound radiolabeled RyR2, and then read by an automatic plate reader.","The effects of the compounds of the invention on hERG currents were studied using cultured human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells which had been stably tranfected with hERG cDNA. HEK 293 cells do not express endogenous hERG. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the hERG cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in the presence of G418. The selection pressure was maintained by continued culture in the presence of G418. Cells were cultures in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium\/Nutreint Mizture F-12 (D-MEM\/F-12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovin serum, 199 U\/ml penicillin G sodium, 10 \u03bcg\/mL streptomycin sulfate and 500 \u03bcg\/mL G418. Cells for use in electrophysiology were cultured in 35 mm dishes.","Electrophysiological recordings (using the whole-cell patch clamp method) were performed at room temperature (18\u00b0 C.-24\u00b0 C.). Each cell acted as its own control. The effect of ARM0036 was evaluated at two concentrations: 10 and 100 \u03bcM. Each concentration was tested in at least three cells (n\u22673). 90 nM Cisapride (commercially available from TOCRIS Bioscience) was used as a positive control for hERG blockade. For recording, cells were transferred to the recording chamber and superfused with vehicle control solution. The patch pipette solution for whole cell recording contained 130 mM potassium aspartate, 5 mM MgCl, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM ATP and 10 mM HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The pipette solution was prepared in batches, aliquoted, and stored frozen. A fresh aliquot was thawed and used each day. Patch pipettes were made from glass capillary tubing using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, Calif.). A commercial patch clamp amplifier was used for whole cell recordings. Before digitization, current records were low-pass filtered at one-fifth of the sampling frequency.","Onset and steady state block of hERG current was measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes (conditioning prepulse: +20 mV for 2 seconds; test pulse: \u221250 mV for 2 seconds) repeated at 10 second intervals, from a holding potential of \u221280 mV. Peak tail current was measured during the 2 second step to \u221250 mV. A steady state was maintained for at least 30 seconds before applying the test compound or the positive control. Peak tail current was monitored until a new steady state was achieved. Test compound concentrations were applied cumulatively in ascending order without washout between applications.","Data acquisition and analysis was performed using the suite of pCLAMP (Vre. 8.2) programs (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.). Steady state was defined by the limiting constant rate of change with time (linear time dependence). The steady state before and after application of the test or control compounds was used to calculate the percentage of current inhibited at each concentration. Concentration-response data were fit to an equation of the form:\n\n% Block={1\u22121\/[Test]\/IC)100\n\nwhere [Test] is the concentration of the test compound, IC(inhibitory concentration 50) is the concentration of the test compound producing half-maximal inhibition, N is the Hill coefficient, and % Block is the percentage of hERG current inhibited at each concentration of the test compound. Nonlinear squares fits were solved with the Solver add-in for Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.). For some compounds it was not possible to determine the ICbecause the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.\n","Multiple compounds of the invention were tested for their effects on hERG currents. The compounds tested were: ARM036-Na, ARM047, ARM048, ARM050, ARM057, ARM064, ARM074, ARM075, ARM076, ARM077, ARM101, ARM102, ARM103, ARM104, ARM106, ARM107 and ARM26. By way of comparison, the effect of JTV-519 (referred to in the figures as \u201cARM00X\u201d) on hERG currents was also tested. Electrophysiological recordings were made using the PatchXpress 7000 A (Molecular Devices) automatic parallel patch clamp system. Each compound was tested at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mM, with each concentration tested in 2 cells (n>2). The duration of exposure to each test concentration was 5 minutes. Other aspects of the experimental protocols were essentially similar to those described in Example 5. For some compounds it was not possible to determine the ICbecause the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.","The RyCal compounds referred to as S36, S107 were synthesized as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0514","num":"0512"},"figref":"FIGS. 36-41"},"Drug Delivery: Eight-week-old, wild-type, weight-matched, C57BL\/6J littermate mice were randomized to either S36 or vehicle treatment.

Mice were allowed to recover for three days prior to the initiation of exercise. Standard food and water were provided ad libitum.","Exercise Protocols: Beginning on day 1, mice were exercised for three weeks by swimming 5 days\/week and by running on a treadmill an additional 1 day\/week.","Swimming Model: The daily swimming protocol consisted of swimming sessions twice-daily separated by one-hour rest periods. After an initial conditioning regimen lasting 5 days during which the swimming sessions were increased in 10 minute increments from 40 minutes each to 80 minutes each, the swimming sessions thereafter lasted 90 minutes each. A 30 cm wide by 30 cm long opaque acrylic tank was filled with tap water to a depth of at least 20 cm. Water was circulated and warmed to 32-34 degrees C. using a separate reservoir with heating element, thermostat, and pump. Compressed room air was bubbled from Tygon tubing with small needle holes placed at the bottom of the tank to agitate the water surface. 4 mice, matched pair-wise with respect to treatment group, swam at any one time in the tank. Littermates who did not exercise were reserved as negative controls.","In order to track the swimming activity of each individually identified mouse, a video tracking system was used (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, Calif.), which includes Sony CCD video recorder, DVD\/Hard Drive, frame grabber card, and custom SMART 2.0 software with Social Behavior package capable of tracking up to 8 mice simultaneously under ideal conditions.) Mice were anesthetized by using 1.5% isoflurane in O, and small, 0.75 cm, Velcro coins were sutured with 5-0 nylon suture to the scalp of each mouse. Plastic 1 cm colored dots, glued to the hook side of the Velcro, could be securely attached to the mouse and used for multiple subject tracking under appropriate lighting conditions. Each resultant mouse track in x,y, and time was analyzed and mean velocities, and distance swam over 2, 5, and 10 minute intervals was obtained.","Treadmill running: A Columbus Instruments (Columbus, Ohio) treadmill (Model: Exer-6M Treadmill with Treadmill Shock Detection Unit) with 6 lanes was used to run the mice. Mice were placed in their respective lanes at the lowest speed (7 meters\/min) with the shocking apparatus turned off and allowed to adjust to the surroundings for 6 minutes. The forward half of the treadmill was covered with aluminum foil to block out light. A desk lamp illuminated the shocking area at the rear of the treadmill. After the adjustment period, the electric current was turned on, and the number of shocks delivered during the next two three minute intervals (training period) were recorded. The shock counter was then reset, the speed was increased to 10 m\/min, and visits to the shocking area and shocks delivered to each mouse were recorded at three-minute intervals until the end of the experiment. At regular intervals, the speed of the treadmill was ramped up from the initial 10 m\/min to as high as 36 m\/min. The speed was increased no more than 2 m\/min every 6 minutes. Consistent treadmill speed increases were used for all mice on a given day, but the protocol increased in difficulty over the course of the 21 day experiment. Task failure was defined when a mouse could not continue running to avoid the shocking area and gave up or when the mouse had received 200 cumulative shocks. In nearly all cases, these two times were very close to identical.","Muscle Isolation: Following the 21and 22day of exercise, mice were swum a final time on a staggered schedule. Following 90 minutes of swimming, each mouse was immediately sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation. Blood was removed by intracardiac aspiration, spun down, and plasma was eluted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were exposed, moistened with Tyrode's solution, and 4-0 silk sutures were tied to the proximal and distal tendons and the muscles were dissected free. The muscles were perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 2.0 mM CaCl, bubbled with 100% O, warmed to 35 C, and hung on isometric force transducers (F-30, Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, Mass.). After equilibration for 10 minutes at a resting tension of 1 cN and a brief potentiation protocol, force-frequency relationships were measured, with 60 second delays between 800 ms stimulations at 40-150 Hz. Fatigue was produced with a protocol of 50 Hz tetani (each 600 ms long) every 2 seconds for 120 seconds. DMC v4.1.6 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to stimulate and record muscle responses, and DMA v3.2 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to analyze the resultant data.","Following stimulation, muscle length was determined at the resting tension, and muscle dry weight was recorded. One EDL muscle was frozen in isopentane (\u221280\u00b0 C.) for histology and the other was frozen in liquid Nfor biochemistry.","In addition, both soleus muscles were dissected and likewise one was frozen in isopentane for histology and one was frozen in liquid Nfor biochemical analysis. The vastus lateralis, heart, and diaphragm were also dissected from each animal and frozen in liquid Nfor biochemical analysis.","Biochemistry: RyR channels were immunoprecipitated from skeletal muscle homogenates with anti-RyR antibody in 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4 0.9% NaCl 5.0 mM NaF 1.0 mM NaVO0.5% Triton X-100+protease inhibitors) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. The samples were incubated with protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia) at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 h, after which the beads were washed three times with buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS PAGE gels (6% for RyR2 and 15% for calstabin2) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight (SemiDry transfer blot, Bio-Rad). After incubation with 5% nonfat milk to prevent non-specific antibody binding and a wash in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies anti-calstabin (1:1,000), anti-RyR (5029; 1:5,000), or anti-phospho-RyR2-pSer2809 (1:5,000), which detects PKA-phosphorylated mouse RyR1-pSer2844 and RyR2-pSer2808.

Mice were allowed to recover for three days prior to the initiation of exercise. Standard food and water were provided ad libitum through the experiment.","Chronic Exercise Model: The daily swimming protocol consisted of twice-daily swimming sessions separated by a one-hour rest period. After an initial conditioning regimen lasting 5 days during which the swimming sessions were increased in 10 minute increments from 40 minutes each to 80 minutes each, the swimming sessions thereafter lasted 90 minutes each. A 30 cm wide by 30 cm long opaque acrylic tank was filled with tap water to a depth of at least 20 cm. Water was circulated and warmed to 32-34\u00b0 C. using a separate reservoir with heating element, thermostat, and pump. 8 mice, balanced pair-wise with respect to genotype and\/or treatment group, swam at any one time in the tank. Littermates who did not exercise were reserved as sedentary controls.","In order to confirm that uniform exercise conditions were achieved, pilot experiments were performed in which the motion of each individually identified mouse was tracked with a video tracking system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, Calif.). Individual recorded tracks over the full 90 minutes of each swim were analyzed for distance swam, mean velocities over time, etc. using the SMART 2.0 software with Social Behavior package (San Diego Instruments). No significant differences in the degree of exercise were noted.","Treadmill performance: A Columbus Instruments (Columbus, Ohio) treadmill (Model: Exer-6M Treadmill with Treadmill Shock Detection Unit) with 6 lanes was used to run the mice. Mice were placed in their respective lanes with the shocking apparatus turned off and allowed to adjust to the surroundings for 10 minutes. The forward half of the treadmill was covered with aluminum foil to block out light and a desk lamp illuminated the shocking area at the rear of the treadmill. After the adjustment period, the treadmill was set to 10 meters\/min, and the mice were trained to run with gentle prodding for 6 minutes. The electric current was then turned on, and the number of shocks delivered during the next two three minute intervals (training period) were recorded. The shock counter was then reset and visits to the shocking area and shocks delivered to each mouse were recorded at three-minute intervals until the end of the experiment. At regular intervals, the speed of the treadmill was ramped up from the initial 10 m\/min to 24 m\/min. The speed was increased no more than 2 m\/min every 6 minutes. Task failure was defined when a mouse could not continue running despite gentle prodding.","Intact muscle preparation: Immediately following a forced exercise session, each mouse was sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation. Blood was removed by intracardiac aspiration, spun down, and plasma was eluted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 4-0 silk sutures were tied to the proximal and distal tendons of intact EDL and soleus muscles and the muscles were dissected free and placed in a modified Ringer's solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.0 mM CaCl, 2 mM MgCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) bubbled with 100% O. Muscles were hung vertically in 50 mL Radnoti jacketed glass chambers with one tendon attached with 4-0 silk suture to an isometric force transducer (F30, Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, Mass.) and the other tendon attached by suture to a stationary arm with built in platinum stimulating plate electrodes. After perfusion with 35C Ringer's and equilibration for 10 minutes at a resting tension of 1 cN and a brief potentiation protocol, force-frequency relationships were measured, with 60 second delays between 800 ms stimulations at 40-150 Hz. DMCv4.1.6 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to stimulate and record muscle responses, and DMA v3.2 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to analyze the resultant data. Following stimulation, muscle length was determined at resting tension, and muscle dry weight was recorded.","Confocal microscopy: Single flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers were enzymatically dissociated by standard methods (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). Briefly, the muscle was dissected from the paw, placed in a modified Ringer's solution, and stripped of all fascia. Type 1 collagenase-(2 mg\/ml, Sigma) in Ringer's solution was prepared fresh, and the muscle was digested for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a incubator shaking at 125 rpm. The muscle was placed in fresh Ringer's and gently triturated. Single fibers were collected and allowed to attach to glass coverslips coated in laminin (Sigma L-2020). The cells were loaded with 2 \u03bcM fluo-4-AM ester (Invitrogen) for 20 minutes, placed on the Zeiss Live 5 microscope stage and superfused for 15 minutes with Ringer's. The fibers were paced at 1 Hz for 10 minutes prior to imaging baseline fiber properties. Linescan images were continuously acquired at 1 ms scan rate during a tetanic sequence consisting of 300 ms stimulation at 100 Hz with a 2 Hz train rate. Images were analyzed in ImageJ, and an F\/F0 ratio was calculated for each fiber.","Human Exercise Protocol: Three weeks prior to test sessions, subjects reported to the Human Performance Laboratory at Appalachian State University for baseline measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition. On three consecutive test session days, subjects ate a standardized breakfast (7-8:00 am) and lunch (completed by 12:30 pm), and then reported to the ASU Human Performance Laboratory at 2:00 pm. Subjects exercised on exercise bikes at 70% VOfrom 3:00-6:00 pm. Test sessions days were Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons. Oxygen consumption and other metabolic parameters were measured using a metabolic cart (with a mouthpiece and noseclip) every 30 minutes, and blood lactate and glucose (via finger stick) every 60 minutes to verify that subjects were adhering to the prescribed exercise workloads. Subjects ingested 0.5-1.0 liters water every hour of exercise while avoiding all forms of ingested energy (e.g., bars, drinks). Resting control subjects sat in the laboratory during the exercise test sessions. Blood, urine, and saliva samples were collected 15-30 minutes before exercise\/sitting, and then within 5-10 minutes post-exercise on each of the 3 test sessions. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained 15-30 minutes before exercise\/sitting, and then within 5-10 minutes post-exercise using a needle biopsy procedure on Days 1 and 3. Four samples were taken (two from each thigh), about 2 inches apart. Biopsies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","Single channel recording and data acquisition: SR vesicles from skeletal muscle of sedentary mice and mice chronically exercised and treated either with vehicle or S107 were prepared as described previously (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1 channels were reconstituted by spontaneous fusion of microsomes into the planar lipid bilayer (a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in a 3:1 ratio, Avanti Polar Lipids). Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 200 \u03bcm aperture in a polysulfonate cup (Warner Instruments, Inc.), which separated two bathing solutions (1 mM EGTA, 250\/125 mM HEPES\/Tris, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl, pH 7.35 as cis solution and 53 mM Ba(OH), 50 mM KCl, 250 mM HEPES, pH 7.35 as trans solution). After incorporation, RyR1 channel activity was recorded continuously for at least 10 minutes. The concentration of free Ca in the cis chamber was calculated with WinMaxC program (version 2.50) (Bers, Patton et al. 1994). Single channel currents were recorded at 0 mV using the Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, USA) in gap-free mode, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Data acquisition was performed using Digidata 1322A and Axoscope 9 software (Axon Instruments, USA). The recordings were analyzed using Clampfit 10.1 (Molecular Devices, USA) and Origin software (ver. 6.0, Microcal Software, Inc., USA).","Analysis of Ryanodine Receptor Complex: 10 mg muscle samples were isotonically lysed. The ryanodine receptor (RyR1) was immunoprecipitated by incubating 250 \u03bcg of homogenate with anti-RyR antibody (2 \u03bcl 5029 Ab) in 0.5 ml of a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 1.0 mM NaVO, 0.5% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. The samples were incubated with protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia) at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 h, after which the beads were washed three times with buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (4-20% gradient) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight (SemiDry transfer blot, Bio-Rad). After incubation with blocking solution (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln Nebr.) to prevent non-specific antibody binding and a wash in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies anti-calstabin (1:2500 in blocking buffer), anti-RyR (5029, 1:5,000), or anti-phospho-RyR2-pSer2809 (1:5000), which detects PKA-phosphorylated mouse RyR1-pSer2844 and RyR2-pSer2808, anti-PDE4D3 (1:1000). After three washes, membranes were incubated with infrared labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution, LICOR Biosystems). Band densities were quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LICOR Biosciences).","Calpain and Creatine Kinase Assays: Tissue calpain activities were measured using a calpain activity assay kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) (). This assay is based on the degradation of the fluorescent peptide substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (Calbiochem). Muscle homogenates were diluted to a final concentration of 600 \u03bcg\/ml and the calpain activity in the homogenate was determined as per manufactures instructions. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity was assayed using the regent kit from Pointe Scientific, Inc. (Canton, Mich.) (). Plasma samples (duplicates, 5 \u03bcl each) were added to 200 \u03bcl of CK reagent and the change in absorbance at 340 nM was recorded over 4 minutes using a plate reader. The average absorbance change per minute was used to determine the CPK levels as per manufacturer's instructions.","Statistics: Data are presented as mean\u00b1SEM. Independent t-test with a significance level of 0.05 was employed to test differences between cal1\u2212\/\u2212 and WT, PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212 and WT, and Ex+veh and Ex+S107, except as noted below. The distributions of treadmill failure data were found in several cases to be asymmetric. As such, Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for all such data comparisons.","High intensity exercise induces RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation, and depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 from the channel complex: Exercise models in the mouse have been grouped into two categories: 1) voluntary exercise including running wheels; and 2) involuntary exercise, including swimming or forced treadmill runs to exhaustion. In order to achieve high intensity exercise, a twice daily swimming protocol was adapted to achieve uniform exercise in mice over days to weeks. This mouse exercise protocol was not designed to be either explicitly eccentric or isometric in character, but rather a physiologic mix of eccentric and isometric exercise. Following forced exercise, RyR1 was immunoprecipitated out of whole muscle homogenates from hind limb muscles, and the RyR1 channel complex was size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for channel complex components. High-intensity exercise in the mouse resulted in progressive phosphorylation of RyR1 at the PKA site Ser2844 (RyR1-pS2844) that saturated by 14 days of twice daily swimming (90 min sessions, e.g. ).","In addition, the RyR1 macromolecular complex from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle underwent remodeling, including depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 from the channel by day 14 (). An identical pattern of biochemical changes was seen in all other hind limb skeletal muscles isolated from the same mice, including soleus, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius. RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation and depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 were dependent on the intensity of the exercise, with only relatively high intensity exercise resulting in significant channel modifications (). Furthermore, the remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex persisted after exercise and recovered only partially following three days of rest after chronic exercise (). PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 was not due to changes in the amount of PKA and PP1 bound the RyR1 complex, as these levels were not affected by exercise conditions (). Calstabin 1 levels in whole muscle homogenate, measured by immunoblot, were not altered during exercise (). Thus, intense daily exercise, over weeks causes remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex manifested by depletion of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 from the channel, PKA hyperphosphorylation, and depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel complex.","RyR1 channel defects occur during human exercise: To assess whether the remodeling of the RyR1 channel macromolecular complex observed in exercised mice is relevant to human physiology, human thigh muscle biopsies were obtained from trained athletes before and after exercise on Days 1 and 3 of a high-intensity exercise protocol (cycling 3 hr\/day at 57% of VOmax) (Nieman, Henson et al. 2006). The human RyR1 macromolecular complex was immunoprecipitated from muscle homogenate, size fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted to assess RyR1 PKA phosphorylation and levels of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 in the RyR1 complex. High intensity exercise resulted in PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 and calstabin1 depletion compared to controls who did not exercise (). Prior to exercise on Day 3, PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 in the trained cyclists was at or near resting levels and no significant calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex was observed, however, PDE4D3 was stably depleted from the RyR1 complex by the beginning of the third day of the high intensity exercise (). Thus, the same remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex observed in chronically exercised mice occurs in highly trained athletes subjected to intense exercise.","Muscle-specific calstabin1\u2212\/\u2212 mice have a high-intensity exercise defect: Muscle-specific deficiency of calstabin1 has been previously shown to be associated with alterations in the force-frequency relationships of isolated muscle preparations and a reduction in Cav1.1 current (Tang, Ingalls et al. 2004). To determine if calstabin1 binding to RyR1 has an effect on exercise performance, we assessed treadmill run to exhaustion times in mice with muscle-specific deficiency of calstabin1 (cal1\u2212\/\u2212). There was a significant defect in the high intensity exercise capacity of cal1\u2212\/\u2212 mice compared to WT littermate controls (). The exercise defect was similar in both males and females (), and despite a small reduction in the body weights of the cal1\u2212\/\u2212 mice (), there was no correlation between failure time and reduced body weight (). The exercise defect was most apparent in high intensity exercise (treadmill speeds equal to or greater than 24 m\/min) or in eccentric exercise such as 14 degree downhill treadmill runs. 0\/2 cal1\u2212\/\u2212 mice were able to complete a 30 min downhill treadmill exercise protocol while 2\/2 WT littermates were able to complete the protocol.","Twenty-four hours following a downhill exercise regimen (as described herein), plasma creatine kinase (CPK), was elevated consistent with increased muscle damage in the cal1\u2212\/\u2212 mice compared to WT littermate controls (). Following several weeks of daily exercise training, the exercise capacity of WT mice approached that of cal1\u2212\/\u2212 presumably because of the progressive depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 complex that occurs with chronic exercise in WT mice () resulting in an exercised-induced depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel complex that is comparable to that observed prior to exercise in the cal1\u2212\/\u2212 mice (). Thus, muscle-specific calstabin1 deficient mice exhibit enhanced fatigue consistent with depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 complex playing a role in muscle fatigue.","PDE4D \u2212\/\u2212 mice exhibit an exercise defect: Global deficiency of PDE4D results in an age-dependent progressive cardiomyopathy (Lehnart, Wehrens et al. 2005). Prior to the age of three months, however, PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212 mice exhibit no cardiac defect as determined by echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization. The exercise capacity of 2 month-old PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212 mice was compared with their WT littermates. A significant reduction in exercise capacity was observed () without any correlation with body weight (FIG. B,C,D). Remarkably, CPK levels were increased, consistent with muscle damage at rest, in PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212 mice relative to WT littermate controls, and there was a significant increase in CPK levels 24 hours following a single episode of eccentric exercise consisting of thirty minutes of downhill treadmill running () in PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212 mice. PDE4D\u2212\/\u2212 mice exhibited an absence of RyR1 bound PDE4D3, a small increase in basal RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, and a significant increase in calstabin1 depletion following only a single day of mild exercise (). These data show that PDE4D3 plays a significant role in the RyR1 complex by regulating the extent of PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 and that depletion of PDE4D3 from the channel complex during exercise promotes PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 which in turn contributes to muscle damage and skeletal muscle fatigue during exercise.","Pharmacologic rebinding of calstabin1 to RyR1 improves chronic exercise performance: Having demonstrated that a deficiency of calstabin1 is associated with an exercise defect and that chronic or high intensity exercise can result in calstabin1 depletion from RyR1, the effect on chronic or high intensity exercise performance of pharmacologic rebinding of calstabin1 to RyR1 was determined. 1,4-benzothiazepine derivatives, RyCal compounds, were screened to identify compounds with increased target activity, improved specificity (absence of activity against other known ion channels) and in vivo efficacy in terms of improved exercise capacity. Compound S107 at a concentration of 500 nM was found not to affect L-type calcium channel current or hERG potassium current.","Age and sex-matched WT mice were randomized to receive osmotic pumps containing either S107 or vehicle. Dosing with S107 at 2.5 ug\/hr or vehicle was initiated four days prior to the beginning of a 21-day forced swimming exercise protocol. Exercise capacity was assessed once a week by a level treadmill run to exhaustion during the nocturnal cycle of the mouse. The mice were not exercised on the same day as treadmill assessments.  shows that calstabin1 rebinding with S107 had no acute effect on WT exercise performance, but that over time the S107 treated WT mice were relatively protected against a decline in treadmill exercise capacity that occurred in vehicle treated mice (p<0.05 Wilcoxon rank test, S107 vs. vehicle at Day 21). These studies are complicated by the training effect of repeated exercise which leads to improved performance due to enhanced musculature. Individual treadmill failure times on Day 21 are shown in . Isometric force production was measured in EDL muscles in a tissue bath during field stimulation.","EDL muscles from S107 treated mice showed increased force production at stimulation frequencies greater than 80 Hz consistent with a left-shift of the force-frequency relationship (). Drug treatment did not result in a change in body weight () or muscle weight. In parallel chronic exercise trials with mice deficient in calstabin1, S107 failed to improve treadmill performance (). The chronic exercise protocol resulted in substantial PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 and calstabin1 depletion from immunoprecipitated RyR1. Calstabin1 depletion from RyR1 was nearly entirely reversed by S107 treatment (). Taken together these data show that preventing the SR Ca leak due to PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1 channel with a drug that enhances calstabin1 binding to the channel can protect against muscle damage, muscle fatigue, enhance muscle function and improve exercise performance during fatigue protocols.","Reduced fatiguability in calstabin1 rebound FDB muscle fibers: Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle fibers were enzymatically dissociated from mice following the chronic exercise protocol and loaded with the calcium indicator fluo-4. Individual muscle fibers were imaged on a Zeiss Live5 confocal microscope during field stimulation at 1 Hz and during a fatiguing protocol consisting of repeated 300 ms long 120 Hz tetani every 2 seconds for 400 seconds. Representative F\/F0 traces during the fatigue protocol are shown for a FDB fiber isolated from a vehicle treated mouse () and a S107 treated mouse (). FDB fibers from S107 treated mice exhibited a delayed decline in peak tetanic calcium transients (). It is known that muscle fibers with slower kinetics of Ca release and reuptake are less prone to fatigue. The kinetics of Ca release and reuptake during single twitches at 1 Hz were assessed. The distribution of 50% reuptake times (tau) showed no significant differences between vehicle and S107 treatment (), indicating no shift in the calcium reuptake kinetics of the FDB fibers. These data indicate that treatment with S107 improves Ca handling in muscle fibers during fatigue protocols.","Chronic exercise results in leaky RyR1 Channels which can be reversed by calstabin1 rebinding: A critical issue is whether the biochemical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex identified during exercise result in changes in RyR1 channel activity. To address this directly, SR microsomes were prepared from the hind limb muscle of sedentary mice, mice chronically exercised and treated with vehicle, and mice chronically exercised and treated with S107. Using standard techniques, vesicles were fused to planar lipid bilayers and the single channel activity of incorporated RyR1 channels was continuously measured for at least 10 minutes at 90 nM [Ca](). In agreement with previously published data (Meissner, 1994, Reiken, 2003), the activity of RyR1 from sedentary mice at resting calcium concentrations was very low resulting in a small number of openings over long period of time (in some experiments as long as 20 min of recording was necessary to calculate an open probability for the channel). In contrast, RyR1 channels from mice chronically exercised and treated with vehicle displayed increased activity with significantly higher open probabilities (p<0.005, Ex+veh, n=9 vs sedentary, n=9) due to an increased frequency of openings (). Administration of S107 caused a significant decrease of RyR1 open probability (p<0.005, Ex+S107, n=12 vs Ex+veh, n=9) to a level comparable to that observed in channels from sedentary mice. Neither chronic exercise nor S107 had any effect on the duration of the channel dwell times meaning that observed changes in open probability were due to changes in the number of opening events (). These data show that RyR1 channels from exercised animals exhibit \u201cleaky\u201d channel behavior (increased open probability) and that channels from animals treated with S107 were not","Reduced calpain activation in muscle tissue and reduced muscle tissue damage due to calstabin1 rebinding: One possible mechanism by which calcium released by leaky RyR1 channels impairs exercise performance is the activation of a member of the calpain family of Ca-dependent neutral proteases, which are known to be responsible for muscle damage in a number of pathophysiological states. (Belcastro 1993; Berchtold, Brinkmeier et al. 2000). Calpain activity in muscle homogenates was assessed by means of the degradation of the synthetic calpain substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC, which fluoresces upon cleavage by calpain. Chronically exercised EDL muscle exhibited elevated calpain activity compared to sedentary controls. Calpain activity was significantly reduced in S107 treated and chronically exercised mice (). Evidence of a protection from muscle damage was further provided by measurement of plasma CPK activity levels which were elevated in the chronically exercised mice, but reduced close to the levels observed in sedentary controls in the S107 treated mice (). Muscle histology showed evidence of muscle hypertrophy with some inflammation and scattered loci of damaged fibers in the chronically exercise mice, without evidence of extensive necrosis in either treatment group.","RyR1 calcium release channels become PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing protein calstabin1 during exercise. The compounds of the invention increase the binding affinity of calstabin1 to PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1. These compounds (referred to as called \u201ccalcium channel stabilizers\u201d or \u201crycal\u201d) are 1,4-benzothiazepines and derivatives thereof. Treatment with these compounds improves exercise performance of mice running on a treadmill. A calcium leak via PKA hyperphoshorylated RyR1 channels causes muscle damage due to activation of calcium-dependent proteases and rycals prevent the calcium leak and inhibit muscle damage during chronic exercise. Rycals can be used to improve muscle fatigue in chronic diseases including heart failure, AIDS, cancer, renal failure, and can also be used to treat muscular dystrophies.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle disease characterized by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Increased calcium-activated calpain proteolysis in the sarcolemma membrane is thought to be a primary mechanism in the pathophysiology of DMD. The mdx mouse, carrying a stop codon inside exon 23 of the dystrophin gene, provides a useful system to study the effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies for the cure of this disease.","A RyCal compound, S107, reduces calpain activity in mdx mice during exercise. , , ,  provide data from these studies. This indicates that RyCals may be useful for treating muscle related diseases, including, but not limited to, muscular dystrophies.","Animal Model: Mdx mice (21 days old) were treated with S107 (0.125 mg\/kg\/h) or vehicle using implantable, osmotic pumps for 28 days. After treatment, the mice were subjected to downhill (14\u00b0 angel) treadmill running for 30 min at 18 m\/min. Immediately after the exercise, the animals were sacrificed and the skeletal muscles were harvested.","Preparation of EDL Homogenates: EDL muscles homogenates were prepared in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mM NaF, 10 mM Tris-maleate, pH7.2+protease inhibitors). Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (CSR) fractions were obtained by centrifuging the homogenates at 50,000\u00d7g for 30 min. Homogenates were centrifuged at 4000\u00d7g for 20 min and the supernatants were centrifuged for 20 min at 10000\u00d7g. Aliquots of the homogenates were assayed for protein concentration and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","Calpain Activity Assay: Calpain activity of EDL homogenates (30 \u03bcg) were measured using a Calpain Activity Assay kit (Calbiochem). The assay utilizes a synthetic calpain substrate, suc-LLVY-AMC. AMC is released upon cleavage with calpain and is measured fluorometrically. Assays are performed with both an activation and an inhibition buffer to determine specific calpain activity in the sample.","Serum Creatine Kinase: Serum (10 \u03bcl) proteins were separated using 4-20% PAGE. After transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose, the immunoblots were developed using an anti-creatine kinase Antibody (Research Diagnostics, 1:1000 dilution). Bands were quantified by densitometry.","Immunoprecipitation of Ryanodine Receptor: The ryanodine receptor (RyR1) was immunoprecipitated from samples by incubating 250 \u03bcg of EDL homogenate with anti-RyR antibody (2 \u03bcl 5029 Ab) in 0.5 ml of as modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 1.0 mM NaVO, 0.5% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors) 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. The samples were incubated with Protein A sepharose beads (Ammersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscatawy, N.J.) at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 hour, after which, the beads were washed three times with RIPA. Samples were heated to 95\u00b0 C. and size fractionated by PAGE.","Western Analysis: Samples (immunoprecipitates or 10 \u03bcg CSR) were heated to 95\u00b0 C. and the proteins were size fractionated on 6% SDS PAGE for RYR and 15% PAGE for calstabin. Immunoblots were developed using antibodies against RyR (5029, 1:5000 dilution), PKA phosphorylated RyR (1:10000), or Calstabin (1:2000). Dilutions are made in 5% milk in TBS-T.","Tissue lysates were prepared by homogenizing the tissue (e.g., brain, cardiac, muscle) with Tissuemiser in 0.7 ml lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM NaVO, 320 mM sucrose, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. For brain homogenates, the supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and the pellet (microsomes) was resuspended in homogenization buffer which was supplemented with 0.9% NaCl. For brain tissue, the resuspended pellet was used for immunoprecipitation of RyR. For cardiac and muscle tissue homogenates, the supernatant of the 10,000\u00d7g spin was used for immunoprecipitation of the RyR. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford protein assay. The sample was frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use.","100 \u03bcg of microsomes were brought to a volume of 500 \u03bcl with modified RIP A buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 1.0 mM NaVO, 0.5% TritonX100, and protease inhibitors). The ryanodine receptor was immunoprecipitated by adding 2 \u03bcl of anti-RyR antibody (5209) and rotating the sample for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. The sample was incubated with 40 \u03bcl of Protein A Sepharose beads and rotated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C.

Immunoblots were developed with anti-FKBP and anti-RyR antibody or anti-phosphorylated FKBP.","Experiments were performed to determine whether the compounds described herein cross the blood brain barrier and enhance binding of cal stab in to ryanodine receptors in the brain.  shows the results of Western blots performed on RyR immunoprecipitated from the tissue samples indicated (i.e. heart, soleus muscle, mid-brain, and cerebellum). As illustrated in , the compound S107 crosses the blood brain barrier and restores in vivo binding of calstabin to RyR in both the mid-brain and the cerebellum, following depletion of calstabin from the RyR complex by treatment of the mice with isoproterenol (\u201cISO\u201d) by chronic infusion for 5 days. RyR was immunoprecipitated using an antibody to RyR, and the presence of calstabin in the immunoprecipitates was detected using an antibody to calstabin. The figure shows that the compound S107 penetrates the brain and restores in vivo binding of calstabin to RyR. Thus, S107 has calstabin rebinding activity in the brain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0561","num":"0559"},"figref":["FIG. 57","FIG. 58"],"sub":"2"},"Two days after initiation of treatment, mice were subject to an exercise regimen for 21 days, and effect of S107 treatment was assayed by the weekly protocol as described below.
