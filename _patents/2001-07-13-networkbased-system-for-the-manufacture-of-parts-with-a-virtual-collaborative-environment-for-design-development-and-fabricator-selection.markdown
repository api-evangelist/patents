No. 09\/410,619, filed Oct. 1, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,513, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/270,007, filed Mar. 16, 1999, entitled \u201cInteractive System for Engineering Design and Manufacture,\u201d now abandoned, U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/311,150, filed May 13, 1999, entitled \u201cNetwork Integrated Concurrent Engineering With Computer Aided Design,\u201d now abandoned, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates generally to a comprehensive, integrated computer-based system and method for undertaking an engineering design and development effort in a virtual collaborative environment, identifying qualified fabricators for manufacturing a part design based on fabricator capability information stored in a global registry database substantially maintained by the fabricators themselves, and conducting a virtual bidding process whereby electronic representations of three dimensional model and specification data are provided by a central server. The central server further supports the bidding process by providing quasi-real time audio, video and graphics, and the contracts negotiation and formalization steps.","The conventional approach to an engineering design and development effort tends to be costly and cumbersome. Typically, a design and development effort begins with an initial idea or concept for a new product, for example, an improved sonobuoy for receiving and transmitting to a surveiling aircraft acoustic data from the ocean.","From this initial idea, an initial design comprising drawings and written specifications is created. The drawings may be paper drawings or \u201cblueprints\u201d or may be three dimensional drawings created using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. The initial design will usually include certain specifications, such as product specifications (defining performance of the item), system specifications (defining performance of a system including the item) and interface design specifications (defining electronic or physical interfaces between the item and other system components). In the case of a sonobuoy, these documents will include a product specification detailing the performance criteria and \u201cform, fit and function\u201d of the sonobuoy; a system specification detailing the performance of the system including the sonobuoy and aircraft avionics; and an interface design specification defining the electronic interface between the sonobuoy and the aircraft receiver and specialized acoustical processors.","These specifications will include various design criteria or performance parameters for the new sonobuoy, such as reliability requirements, mean time between failure, radio frequency (RF) transmission power and range, acoustic gain and performance (e.g., gain in decibels and three dimensional beam patterns) and so on.","As depicted in , this initial idea or concept is translated into an initial design, \u201cDesign 1.\u201d A series of teams, comprising one or more members, are assembled to evaluate the design according to their various engineering, business and management specialties. Typically, there will be a management team whose primary function is to ensure that the development program is \u201con schedule\u201d and \u201con cost.\u201d There will be a business\/accounting team who will analyze the costs of the development program and the expected costs of the product produced in quantity. There will be a series of engineering teams, each of a particular discipline or specialty. In our sonobuoy example, there will be mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, RF engineers, acoustic specialists, reliability engineers, safety engineers, signal processing specialists, production engineers and so on.","Each of these teams will evaluate the design (three dimensional model and associated specifications) to determine conformance with requirements. In a typical development effort, these teams will recommend changes to the design to rectify deficiencies or improve performance. The design will evolve (as depicted in , from Design 1, Design 2, and so on to final Design n) as changes are recommended and implemented.","Because a number of disciplines may be involved, it can be appreciated that the process can be lengthy and costly. When one team implements changes based on its analysis, other teams may have to redo their analysis as a result. For example, when a production engineer recommends (based on cost or manufacturibility considerations) that paper capacitors be employed instead of ceramic capacitors, the reliability engineer will need to reevaluate the design. When an acoustic specialist recommends that improved hydrophones be used or an RF specialist recommends that an improved receiver be used, the mechanical engineer will need to determine if packaging limits are exceeded and the accounting specialists will need to determine if \u201cdesign to cost\u201d parameters are exceeded.","Application of the \u201cconcurrent engineering\u201d principle can improve the process somewhat by assembling the various specialists at the earliest possible time. Thus, manufacturing specialists are consulted from the beginning, rather than simply at the end.","Nevertheless, the sonobuoy example and  illustrate how a complex engineering effort involving multiple disciplines can be a lengthy and costly process as designs are considered and discarded, new designs are evaluated and so forth. When the various specialists are in different geographical locations (\u201cphysical boundaries\u201d), at different business entities (\u201cbusiness boundaries\u201d), or employ different software standards (\u201cformat boundaries\u201d), the problem is only compounded. The disparate locations, business cultures and format standards can be significant impediments. This can be referred to as the \u201cboundaries problem.\u201d Put simply, having specialists of differing disciplines (with often conflicting priorities) attempt to resolve design issues when operating from different locations, or from business entities with differing business practices and cultures, or when using different software formats (e.g., three dimensional model standards) creates significant costs and obstacles. This is a significant drawback.","Once an acceptable design is arrived at (e.g., Design n, FIG. ), the developing concern typically wishes to produce the design in quantity. In today's decentralized economy, where most \u201cstart-up\u201d or even moderately-sized engineering enterprises do not have their own production facilities, this typically requires \u201coutsourcing\u201d of the production. In some respects, the process of locating qualified, performance-proven fabricators can be as daunting as the engineering development effort. The engineering concern may not have established relationships with many\u2014or any\u2014manufacturers. Of the few potential candidates that may be identified through \u201cword of mouth\u201d or a costly search, it can be costly to evaluate whether such candidates meet minimum requirements. Numerous meetings may be required. Even then, it may be difficult to ascertain the quality of past performance and the prospects for the proposed performance. The engineering concern will have to sustain the cost, and risk, of divulging proprietary design and specification data. Because format standards may differ, the costs and risks of (sometimes imperfect) file conversions may be required. These are significant drawbacks.","Even if several acceptable fabricators are located, they may represent but a fraction of the otherwise qualified pool of fabricators. This lessens competition and ultimately, can lead to increased costs and decreased performance. These are significant disadvantages to the engineering concern. With respect to start-up or not-well-known fabricators, this is a significant drawback that prevents them from penetrating new markets and inhibits their growth.","Once a pool (or even a single) of qualified fabricators is identified, the process of negotiating an agreement on performance must occur. This may require numerous phonecalls, teleconference calls, and face-to-face meetings. Three dimensional models and specification documents may have to be divulged so that the fabricator can develop a bid. Despite rigorous concurrent engineering, it is common that minor and not-so-minor redesigns may be required due to producibility concerns. This will require an additional engineering effort between the supplier and the proposed fabricator to discuss and decide on engineering changes to arrive at a mutually acceptable, and producible, design that meets and performance and cost requirements. The time and effort entailed are significant drawbacks.","Engineering issues aside, the negotiation process can be lengthy and costly. Documents, which may be proprietary, are sent to the bidding fabricator. The bidding fabricator must evaluate them, engage in discussions with the prime contractor about the design and specifications, and generate a \u201cbid.\u201d This bid typically includes terms relating to time, cost and performance. Upon receipt of the bid, additional discussions between the parties may be required to address engineering and\/or contractual issues. Typically conducted using a combination of the phone, teleconference and postal service (or the like), these discussions impose additional costs and time in getting a product to market. This is a significant drawback.","Other problems and drawbacks also exist.","For these and like reasons, what is desired is a network-based, interactive system capable of receiving specification and other information so that an engineering design for a product, represented by an electronic three-dimensional model, can be designed, developed and evaluated in a collaborative, virtual environment substantially obviating geographic, business and format boundaries.","Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to overcome one or more of the aforementioned and other limitations of existing systems and methods for undertaking an engineering development effort.","It is another object of the present invention to provide such a network-based system whereby a central server maintains engineering data, such as design documents and three dimensional model data, in a common, neutral format, which is accessible by authorized team members through a graphical user interface that is substantially platform independent to reduce or eliminate the necessity for specialized hardware and software.","It is another object of the present invention for a central server to support a secure multimedia communications capability to include audio, video and graphics, so that participants in an engineering effort can communicate and collaborate in the virtual engineering environment to discuss a design.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a central server with a repository of fabricator capability data which can be searched by a prime contractor to locate qualified fabricators based on general criteria as well as design-specific criteria.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a central server whereby said fabricator capability data is substantially maintained by the fabricators so as to incentivize them to participate in the so-called manufacturer's registry because it provides them a capability management system.","It is another object of the present invention to provide such a searchable manufacturer's registry further supporting the collection of quality assurance data based on fabricator performance, the quality assurance data being provided to the fabricator and to future prime contractors considering that fabricator.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an electronic marketplace and bidding system whereby a prime contractor can solicit proposals or bids in a virtual environment including the provision of specification and three-dimensional model data to prospective fabricators for consideration in developing their proposals.","It is another object of the present invention to provide such an electronic marketplace whereby a prime contractor and prospective fabricators can discuss design and contractual issues in a virtual environment using quasi-real-time audio, video and graphics, including the three-dimensional model representing the part or product.","To achieve these and other objects of the present invention, and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and as broadly described, an embodiment of the present invention comprises an apparatus and method for a network-based interactive system that supports several phases of an engineering effort: the development and evaluation of an engineering design, the identification of potentially qualified fabricators, and the bidding and negotiation process to create an agreement for a qualified fabricator to manufacture a design in quantity.","Accordingly, what is disclosed is a network-based system interfacing multiple user systems which interface through a central server to undertake the design development effort. A baseline design is created and maintained in a neutral or common format by the central server. A governing entity or prime contractor assigns access or authorization data so that parts or the entirety of the three dimensional model and\/or specification data is accessible by other team members in order to perform various analysis and simulations. An integrated product data management (PDM) capability manages access to controlled data and maintains a record of the various manifestations of the design. A current baseline design is maintained so that engineering analysis and simulation team members perform their analysis on the correct design. The system supports quasi-real-time interactive audio, video and graphics so that team members can discuss design issues in the virtual environment without having to cross geographic or format boundaries. The above-described capabilities are provided in a substantially platform independent manner using a graphical user interface (GUI) supported by standard software, such as a \u201cbrowser,\u201d which may further include machine independent applications, such as Java Applets\u2122, or, for certain required tools, a semi-machine-dependent application, to reduce the processing burden on user stations and the need for specialized client-side software. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a so-called \u201ccustom browser\u201d may be provided to user stations so that the interface with the central server system is tailored to the present application. In yet another embodiment, certain graphics-intensive applications may be provided by the central server as client-side applications to be compiled and executed, such as applications coded in Open GL\u2122 by Silicon Graphics\u2122. The so-called common denominator in these embodiments is the goal of retaining the most calculation intensive tasks on the server side of the overall system so as to reduce the need for specialized software and hardware capabilities at the user systems. Additionally, by receiving, converting, and maintaining part design models in a common, neutral format, the central server system provides the important benefit of \u201cdata neutrality\u201d for the participants in a concurrent engineering development project. In short, format boundaries are obviated. This is an important benefit, especially for small enterprises, which might otherwise be eliminated from participation in a project because their software resource do not support a format required by a prime contractor.","A second aspect of the system provides a database of fabricators, a so-called \u201cGlobal Manufacturer's Registry,\u201d which can be searched by a designer or prime contractor to identify qualified fabricators. The database contains various information describing the fabricators, such as location, experience, machinery and process capabilities, certifications, quality assurance\/inspection standards, and so forth. Fabricators are incentivized to enroll in the registry because it provides an incidental benefit as a capability management system they can use to manage and track their resources and capabilities. A prime contractor with a part design model representing a product can conduct a search to identify qualified fabricators based on design-specific and general criteria. The system includes producibility logic to analyze an uploaded part design in order to help identify qualified fabricators. The system allows prime contractors to provide feedback on performance which can be factored into a quality assurance capability provided by the system. As with the NICECAD aspect of the integrated system, the GMR aspect provides data neutrality for users by supporting the upload and conversion of part design models from various format types into a standard neutral format. Therefore, a designer is not precluded from using the GMR system based on the fact that it uses a particular part design model format.","According to a third aspect of the system, an electronic bidding system is provided by an Electronic Trading Community (ETC) to allow virtual discussions and negotiations to take place over the networked system once a pool of qualified fabricators is identified. A request for quote (RFQ) or request for proposal (RFP) with design data is submitted to the system so that fabricators can submit proposals. The virtual computer aided design (CAD) capability allows quasi-real-time discussions, including audio, video and graphics. The graphics capability allows a prime contractor and prospective fabricator to view the three-dimensional part design, including the execution of various manipulations, such as virtual rotations and translations, pan, zoom and \u201cfly throughs.\u201d The stored part design model data may include links to associated specifications, standards and other design specific documents so that the bidding fabricator has a full representation of what it is bidding on. As with the NICECAD and GMR aspects of the integrated system, the ETC provides \u201cdata neutrality\u201d so that format boundaries do not become impediments for either the soliciting prime contractor\/designer or the bidding fabricator.","In general, the above capabilities are provided in a networked, virtual environment that reduces transaction costs and meets engineering challenges as it transcends geographic, business and format boundaries. One or more central servers maintain the part design model in neutral format, such as AP 214 STEP format, well known to those of skill in the art. Substantially platform user independent graphical interfaces, such as browser pages, and server-client interactive applications, such as Java Applets\u2122 make the system substantially user-system independent. In some instances, instead of using Java\u2122 mini-applications or the like to run on a browser's so-called \u201cvirtual machine,\u201d certain graphics-intensive or computation-intensive applications may be compiled and executed at the user systems as semi-machine-dependent applications amenable to operations using a computer system with a standard operating system. Whether specialized applications are supported by miniapplications (e.g., such as those coded in Java\u2122) provided through a browser or by server interface with a semi-machine-dependent application at a user station (e.g., a server-provided application coded in Open GL\u2122 readily executed on a Unix\u2122- or Windows\u2122-based system), the goal is a substantial user platform independent network interface with the server system. Security is provided through encryption and multiple firewalls at the server(s) so as to protect proprietary and sensitive data.","The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. It will become apparent from the drawings and detailed description that other objects, advantages and benefits of the invention also exist. At the outset, it should be observed that the several primary features of the system are depicted as residing on several servers. This is, of course, only for exemplary and illustrative purposes. The features of collaborative engineering, global manufacturer's registry, and electronic bidding, can be provided via one or many servers, which may be co-located or which may reside at different locations connected through a network. Likewise, the data stored by the system could be stored at a single location or amongst multiple locations in a so-called hybrid relational object oriented database architecture. In general, the so-called first aspect of the fully integrated embodiment of the invention, the collaborative engineering feature, is described as the Network Integrated Concurrent Engineering With Computer Aided Design or NICECAD. The second aspect of the invention, the global manufacturer's registry feature, is described as the Global Manufacturer's Registry (GMR) or the Interactive System for Engineering Design and Manufacture (EDM). The so-called third aspect of the invention, the electronic bidding capability feature, is described as the Electronic Trading Community or ETC.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the system and methods, particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","As discussed in the Summary of the Invention, the present invention is directed to providing a networked, virtual, collaborative environment for three aspects of an engineering development: (1) the design and development phase (referred to as the NICECAD or Network Integrated Concurrent Engineering Computer Aided Design); (2) the identification and evaluation of qualified fabricators or manufacturers for a design (referred to as the Global Manufacturer's Registry or GMR system or the Interactive System for Engineering Design and Manufacture (EDM), and (3) the solicitation and evaluation of requests for proposals or quotes from qualified bidders (referred to as the Electronic Trading Community or ETC).","The First Aspect of the Invention: A System and Methods for Undertaking an Engineering Design and Development Effort in a Virtual and Collaborative Environment","In general, the NICECAD server system provides Product Data Management (PDM), CAD functionality, engineering analysis and simulation (EAS), multimedia communications functionality, electronic commerce capability and front-end network interface and system administration support.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"100"},"NICECAD system  incorporates product data management (PDM), computer aided design (CAD), engineering analysis and simulation (EAS), multimedia communications and electronic commerce (EC) so that the entire project, including its engineering and business components, may be carried out in a virtual, collaborative and secure environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","220","230","210","200","260","250","240"]},"Network  may comprise any network that allows communication amongst the components, and may encompass existing or future network technologies, such as the existing \u201cInternet,\u201d \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d Wide Area Network (WAN), Local Area Network (LAN), \u201cInternet Protocol-Next Generation\u201d (sometimes referred to as the coming \u201cSupernet\u201d), and any variation of packet switched networks (or other supporting data packing technologies) for permitting communication amongst user systems and servers. Regarding the Internet and like shared networks, high bandwidth systems have been developed and are becoming increasingly accessible. For example, the Abilene Network developed by University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) and the so-called Internet2 project are two examples of such high-capacity systems. The very high performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) provided by MCI Corporation and used by the National Science Foundation and others is another example of such a high-capacity system.","Prime contractor user systems  may comprise any system capable of interfacing with network . Prime contractor user systems  may comprise \u201cstandard\u201d computer systems that do not require specialized hardware or software to use NICECAD system . Prime contractor user systems  may comprise personal computers, microcomputers, minicomputers, portable electronic devices, a computer network, or any other system operable to interface with network  to send and receive data. Prime contractor user systems  may comprise computers running standard operating systems and supporting \u201cbrowser\u201d technologies for accessing and displaying data over a common network, such as personal computers with Windows NT\u2122 and Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122 5.0 or Netscape Communicator\u2122 4.06, an Apple Macintosh\u2122 running MOSAIC\u2122 web browser software, a Sun SparcStation\u2122 running UNIX and Netscape Cornmunicator\u2122, and a Silicon Graphics\u2122 UNIX-based workstation such as the SGI Octane\u2122 running. Netscape Communicator\u2122. Prime contractor user systems  may comprise computer systems running a so-called \u201ccustom browser\u201d specially-adapted for the present application. In one embodiment, such a custom browser may be provided by the NICECAD provider (e.g., NICECAD server system ) as a downloadable file through a standard browser. As those of skill in the art may appreciate, prime contractor user systems  may comprise future variations of such systems that permit the interaction over a network with a server system.","In one embodiment, prime contractor user system  comprises a personal computer or workstation running a standard operating system such as Windows NT, and using a standard browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122 5.0 capable of interpreting HTML 4.0, XML, VRML, and running Java\u2122 applets or like \u201cminiapplications.\u201d In another embodiment, prime contractor user system  comprises a personal computer running such a standard operating system and using such a standard browser in conjunction with client-side applications which, while being semi-machine-dependent in the sense they are not executed using a browser's so-called \u201cvirtual machine,\u201d are otherwise compiled and executed using a standard operating system. Applications coded in Open GL\u2122 by Silicon Graphics, a language for graphics applications well known to those of skill in the art, and readily supported by UniX\u2122- and Windows\u2122-based systems, would be just one example of such a semi-machine-dependent application running on a prime contractor user system . In yet another embodiment, a server-supplied so-called custom browser application is provided which is specially-adapted for interfacing with NICECAD server system(s)  and any client side semi-machine-dependent applications (or, alternatively, Java\u2122-type or Java\u2122-like miniapplications) it provides. Such semi-machine-dependent applications may be server-provided, for example, as downloadable files through a standard or custom browser. In each manifestation of the invention, the overriding goal is to preserve a substantially platform independent network interface between user systems and the server system (e.g., NICECAD server system ).","Likewise, supplier user systems  may comprise any system that may interact with NICECAD server system  over network . Like prime contractor user systems , supplier user systems  may comprise any computer systems, including any of the systems listed above. In one embodiment, supplier user system  comprises a personal computer or workstation running a standard operating system such as Windows NT\u2122, and using a standard browser such as Microsoft Explorer\u2122 5.0. As with prime contractor user systems , supplier user systems  may comprise a personal computer using a server-provided custom browser adapted for the present application. As with computer systems used by prime contractors, supplier user systems  may comprise a personal computer running semi-machine-dependent applications to be compiled and executed using a standard operating system.","Backup data storage  comprises a system for backing up the data stored by the NICECAD system . Backup data storage  may comprise several backup technologies for redundancy. Backup data storage  may include tape media, CD-ROM, zip drives, optical disks or any other reliable means for backing up the data maintained by NICECAD server system . Generally, backup data storage  may be data that is stored locally with NICECAD server system  or remotely. Furthermore, NICECAD server system , databases  and backup data storage  may comprise part of a distributed database system. In one embodiment, backup data storage  may comprise redundant storage onto high capacity tape and recordable CD-ROM.","Backup server hardware and software  comprises one or more backup servers, including server modules, to reliably support NICECAD server system  to minimize the impact of \u201ccrashes\u201d and other events otherwise interfering with smooth operation. In one embodiment, at least one redundant server may be provided to substitute for NICECAD server system  should it fail. Generally, backup server hardware and software  may reside locally with NICECAD server system  (or a part of NICECAD server system , if it is distributed across several different servers, to be discussed below), although it may be physically remote, and may even be accessible through a different network address (e.g., at a different URL or web site).","Databases  depict the storage media that may be employed to store data maintained by the NICECAD system. Databases  may be one or more physically distinct media, including, but not limited to, hard drives, floppy drives, CD-ROM, and any other existing or future storage technologies supporting ready access. Databases  may store information for a concurrent engineering development project, such as contracts data, engineering data, account data and other project related data (further discussed below in conjunction with FIGS. -). In one embodiment, databases  resides locally with NICECAD server system . In another embodiment, databases  is remotely located from NICECAD server system .","NICECAD server system  comprises a server system supporting the interactive collaborative engineering environment. NICECAD server system  interfaces with prime contractor user systems  and supplier user systems  through network . NICECAD server system  may include the hardware and software to support and interface with prime contractor and supplier user systems on a substantially platform independent basis. This minimizes user systems' requirements for specialized hardware or software capabilities. This substantial platform independence arises from the fact that NICECAD server system  provides certain specialized applications as either client-side machine-independent applications, such as Java\u2122 applets or the like, executable using a standard browser (or by a custom browser supporting such applications), and\/or as client-side semi-machine-dependent applications, such as those coded in Open GL\u2122 or like coding tools, to be executed on a machine with a standard operating system. Ultimately, significant benefits of the invention derive from the fact that the user system interface with NICECAD server system  is substantially platform independent.","Generally, NICECAD server system  includes system administration and network-related software modules, as well as the various specialized software modules for CAD, EAS, multimedia communications and EC. Certain of the software modules may be client-side interactive for supporting specialized concurrent engineering tasks. For example, NICECAD server system  may also include the hardware and software for multimedia operations such as audio, video and graphics, that may be transmitted over the network for presentation to user systems with standard client-side multimedia support.","In one embodiment, NICECAD server system  may be publicly accessible as a web site, but may provide multiple levels of security (e.g., multiple \u201cfirewalls\u201d) to ensure that proprietary project data may be protected. For example, NICECAD server system  may be accessed only by users with a user ID and password. In one embodiment, the data transmitted is compressed and encrypted using encryption at least as reliable as that provided by RSA 1024 bit encryption keys, a technology well known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, NICECAD server system  may comprise a \u201cback end\u201d processing server running UNIX\u2122 for the various database and specialized processing operations, and a \u201cfront end\u201d web server running Windows NT\u2122 and Microsoft's Transaction Server\u2122 for network-related operations.","As illustrated in , the architecture of NICECAD server  may be distributed. In other words, hardware and software for the various NICECAD system functions is not necessarily resident on one server system at one physical location. Thus, in one embodiment, as depicted in , NICECAD server system  comprises several systems for hosting software for various functions, such as PDM server system  for product data management functionality; CAD\/EAS server system  for computer aided design and engineering analysis and simulation; MM\/EC server system  for multimedia communications support and electronic commerce; and network interface\/system administration  for system administration and network related tasks. Moreover, these distributed systems may interface through network , which may comprise any of the network technologies discussed in connection with network . Of course, those of ordinary skill can appreciate that this particular distributed architecture is exemplary, and the particular embodiment of  is intended to express the general principle that all of the NICECAD server system  functionality need not be co-resident. In one embodiment, where the NICECAD system functions are distributed in this fashion, a single network address, such as an Internet address or URL or web site address, is used by the user systems. Access to other parts of the NICECAD system through network  is automated so that the system appears transparent or \u201cseamless\u201d to the user system.","The Database used by the System for Engineering Development",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["210","100","305","320","331","394","335","395"]},"Contracts and agreements data  may comprise information stored by NICECAD server system  relating to contracts or agreements among the various actors. This data may comprise contracts between users and NICECAD system data module  and contracts between prime contractors and suppliers data module , as depicted in FIG. . The former may generally comprise those agreements regarding the terms of usage of the NICECAD system, such as fee structure, security, assignment of liability, and so on. The latter may contain records of contracts or agreements entered into between prime contractors and suppliers, or between suppliers. In one embodiment, such contracts may be prepared over the network by tailoring standard contracts and contract terms provided by the NICECAD system, further discussed in connection with FIG. .","Account data  may comprise information stored by the NICECAD system pertaining to use by prime contractors and suppliers. For example, the information may comprise records reflecting all user transactions, including billing information, so that a complete history associated with a particular project is available. In one embodiment, every concurrent engineering development project is assigned an identifier, such as project number or project name, which may be used to retrieve account records in a relational database arrangement. In one embodiment, account data  may be logically divided into supplier account data module  and prime contractor account data module , as illustrated in FIG. .","Electronic commerce (EC) data  may comprise data related to electronic commerce transactions carried out using NICECAD system . The NICECAD server system  may be configured to allow business transactions pertaining to the engineering development effort to be carried out in the virtual environment, such as negotiations, contracting, and funds transfer. EC data  may be used to store records of such transactions, and may comprise stored standard contracts data module ; stored standard terms and conditions data module ; stored electronic business documents data module ; and stored EC digital signature data module .","Stored standard contracts data module  may comprise a series of contract \u201ctemplates\u201d for prime contractors and suppliers to use as a starting point for creating an agreement. For example, in one embodiment there is a standard form agreement for a fabricator to produce a quantity of prototypes of a design within some timeframe. There may be another standard form contract for an EAS team to perform some specified analysis on a design. Stored standard terms and conditions data module  may comprise various terms and conditions to be used in preparing an agreement including such things as liquidated damages, arbitration clauses, procedures for engineering changes, and the like. Those of ordinary skill can appreciate that module  may be used with or without module , and that said modules could easily be combined.","Stored electronic business documents data module  may comprise documents or records related to all EC transactions. For example, when a prime contractor transfers funds to a supplier, a record may be stored in this module. If standard form contract or standard terms and conditions data is accessed, a record may be stored. If a contract is actually entered into using the NICECAD system , a record may be stored. In general, this module ensures that NICECAD system  provides an electronic \u201cpaper trail\u201d that provides a history of the business transactions carried out using the NICECAD system.","Stored EC digital signature data module  may comprise data of a \u201cdigital signature\u201d required to formalize agreements between users. Analogous to the usual process, an agreement may be considered finalized when the parties provide their digital signature signifying their assent to the terms.","Materials data  may contain information relating to materials that may be used to fabricate a part design model and may be used as a reference tool for designers, analysts and fabricators. Materials data  may contain property data as well as applications data. For example, materials data  may have an entry for a titanium alloy identifying properties such as elastic modulus, tensile strength, hardness, machinability, ductility or other properties. Materials data  might contain applications data for the titanium alloy, such as its limitations when used in a high oxygen environment. As illustrated in , materials data  may be logically subdivided into homogeneous materials data module  for homogeneous materials; heterogeneous materials data module  for heterogeneous materials; and other materials data module  for materials not easily classified. For example, properties and\/or applications data for materials like metals, plastics, ceramics and the like, may be stored in module . Properties and\/or applications data for materials like carbon fiber-epoxy or Kevlar\u2122 composites may be stored in module .","Materials data  may be used as a reference source or it may be used in conjunction with the CAD tools to create a design. For example, materials data  may be used by a design team to assign or associate certain materials with entities of a part design model (such as a 3D solid model). Subsequently, a fabricator team analyzing the 3D solid model (e.g., when analyzing the design to prepare a bid) may ascertain that a particular material is to be used for a particular entity, and then may learn about applications and properties of that material by accessing materials data .","PDM data  may contain the data stored for individual concurrent engineering development projects. Broadly speaking, the concept of PDM is to create an information infrastructure for the entire history of an engineering effort, including technical data (such as the design evolution and analysis\/simulation results), as well as business or management data (such as contracts and budget\/schedule information). Accordingly, PDM data  may include modules with project specific data (such as part design models for particular projects) and non-project specific data (such as reference modules to facilitate creating part design models).","PDM data  may comprise the following modules: stored product data management system electronic document data module ; stored product data and electronic document distribution control module ; stored design and analysis access permission data module ; stored baseline part design model data module ; stored working copy part design model data module ; standard and custom parts library data module ; stored engineering analysis and simulation results data module ; manufacturing standards and specifications data module ; stored standard attributes and attribute values data module ; stored PDM digital signature data module ; stored standard drawing symbols data module ; stored quasi-real time multimedia communications sessions data module ; and other PDM data modules .","Stored product data management system electronic document data module  may comprise non-graphic project documents, such as project specifications, change documents, revision history documents, and budget and schedule documents. Change documents refers to any documents that may be prepared to implement a design change. For example, in Department of Defense applications, such documents are sometimes referred to as \u201cengineering change proposals\u201d or \u201cengineering change orders.\u201d Revision history documents refers to any documents that list or provide a history of design changes.","Stored product data and electronic document distribution control data module  may comprise a module for maintaining \u201ccheck-in\/check-out\u201d records that document when team members access certain documents in NICECAD system . In one embodiment, every time a user accesses or \u201cchecks out\u201d a specification or part design model, a \u201ctime-stamp\u201d and team member identifier is stored in this module (e.g., see , module ). This serves configuration management by providing an electronic \u201cpaper trail.\u201d","Check-in\/check-out controls generally refers to the procedures employed by the NICECAD system to control access to proprietary part design model and specification data. As will be discussed further below, the prime contractor may assign access permissions to part or all of the part design model, project specification, and the EAS processing modules. This ensures that the prime contractor has control over which teams access which data, and which teams run which analysis. Whenever an authorized team member accesses the part design model or specification, the team member is said to have \u201cchecked out\u201d that item. Once the team member completes the task, he\/she may have to \u201ccheck in\u201d the item by informing the NICECAD system that the task is complete. By updating the check-in\/check-out data in stored product data and electronic document distribution control data module , the NICECAD system provides configuration control by maintaining a history of which teams have accessed which part design models and documents.","It is important to appreciate that check-in\/check-out records may still be maintained even if an approval authority does not limit access to the part design model, specifications, or EAS processing modules.","Stored design and analysis access permission data module  may comprise data assigned by the prime contractor determining which teams (or team members) may access the part design model, documents and EAS processing modules. The module may also comprise data determining which teams may access certain project documents, such as specifications. A part design model generally comprises a series of geometric and topological entities. Teams, such as EAS teams, may need access to all or part of a part design model in order to carry out the analysis for their specific discipline. They may need to access specifications or other documents to perform their tasks. Likewise, those teams may need to access one or more EAS processing modules to carry out the analysis. Stored design and analysis access permission data module  allows an approval authority to assign access permissions to limit access to those portions of the part design module, those specifications (or portions thereof), and those EAS processing modules as appropriate. This serves configuration control by limiting access to only those who need it.","Stored baseline part design model data module  may contain the current approved version of the design referred to as the \u201cbaseline.\u201d Each time a design change is approved by the prime contractor, the baseline part design model may change. A part design model may be created using the NICECAD CAD capability, and generally comprises a series of entities (e.g., topological or geometric features) which may be assigned attributes and attribute values. Attributes include such items as tolerance, surface finish, material, special fabrication instructions, etc. In general, stored baseline part design model data module  may contain the part design models, such as 3D solid models, including attributes, for the projects in NICECAD system . In one embodiment, this module may contain the entire history of baseline designs, each of which is assigned a version number for tracking purposes (e.g., Design 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, etc.). The latest version number may be the current baseline design.","Stored working copy part design model data module  may be used by designers and analysts as a virtual \u201cscratch pad\u201d for storing part design models. For example, an EAS team member who checks out the current baseline part design model from module  may not be permitted to \u201ccheck in\u201d that part design model. This is because it may be that only the prime contractor can authorize writing a baseline part design model to module . This provides configuration control and protects the integrity of the current baseline part design model. However, the EAS team member may use stored working copy part design model data module  to store a \u201cworking copy\u201d of the part design model. For example, if a fabricator team analyzing producibility determines that certain design changes should be effected, a proposed revised baseline part design model may be stored in this module. Project team members may also use this module to temporarily store working copies of the baseline part design model while they are completing their analysis. This way the team member does not have to go through the check-out procedures repeatedly while performing the same analysis. In one embodiment, the working copies stored in this module by NICECAD server  are assigned working copy version numbers. In another embodiment, the working copy version numbers are maintained so that there is a complete history of all working copies of the part design model in the NICECAD system.","Standard and custom parts library data module  may comprise a library of \u201cpre-built\u201d standard and custom parts that may be accessed by designers to include in larger part design models. Availability of such data may expedite the design creation and modification process (e.g., see , module ). Standard parts may include such common items as fasteners, gears, bearing sets and the like. Custom parts may include parts previously built by prime contractors or suppliers that are saved for use in later projects. For example, a sonobuoy manufacturer may save a series of custom parts for various configurations of sound-detecting underwater hydrophones.","Stored engineering analysis and simulation results data module  may comprise data stored by the NICECAD system reflecting the results of engineering analysis performed by EAS teams. The EAS analysis may be performed using internal NICECAD processing modules (e.g., see , module ) or external processing modules. Stored engineering analysis and simulation results data module  ensures that the virtual NICECAD collaborative engineering environment includes a record of analysis performed on a part design model. Those of ordinary skill should appreciate that the term \u201cengineering analysis and simulation\u201d is generally descriptive of studies performed by various teams considering a design. The term is not meant to suggest that analysis and simulation are discrete tasks or disciplines. Some studies may involve only analysis of a design; some may involve only simulation of the operation or manufacture of a design; and some studies may require both simulation and analysis.","Manufacturing standards and specifications data module  may comprise fabrication standards, inspection standards and other standards. For example, to support Department of Defense applications, this module may contain various MIL-STD or MIL-SPEC documents defining such things as manufacturing standards, inspection standards, reliability, quality assurance, safety, and so on. This module may be used as a reference source providing users the text of the standards and specifications. This module may be used by designers to associate particular standards with graphical entities of a part design model. In one embodiment, a design team member may associate a standard (e.g., MIL-STD-5556.8) with a particular graphical entity when creating a part design model. When viewing the design using a CAD tool (e.g., see , module ) a fabricator team member may see the standard associated with a particular entity that may be \u201cclicked on\u201d to link to the text of the standard.","Stored standard attributes and attribute values data module  may comprise a series of standard attributes and attribute values for use by a designer in creating a design. As previously mentioned, a part design model may comprise a series of geometrical and topological entities. Each entity may be assigned its own attributes, such as surface finish, material, tolerance, and the like. For some attributes, each attribute is given a value or category. For example, tolerance may be given a tolerance type (e.g., flatness, linear, angular, runout, etc.) and a tolerance range. For surface finish, a surface finish value is assigned. Stored standard attributes and attribute values data module  may be used in connection with a CAD tool (e.g., see , module ) so that a designer may rapidly create an initial design including the assignment of attributes to the part design model entities.","Stored PDM digital signature data module  may comprise digital signatures, well known to those of skill in the art, by the \u201capproving authority\u201d for the part design model. In conventional collaborative engineering environments, the \u201capproving authority\u201d (usually the prime contractor) signifies approval of the baseline part design model and associated specification documents by affixing a written signature. In the virtual NICECAD environment, a digital signature may be associated or included to certify approval of certain items, such as the approved current baseline part design model, the approved final part design model submitted for fabrication, and various supporting specification documents. This digital signature feature aids configuration control by providing a quick and effective way to determine whether a particular electronic file represents an \u201capproved\u201d version or is a mere working copy (or proposed redesign). In one embodiment, design changes require a digital signature by the approving authority, whereby a new design must include the proper digital signature (e.g., a key) before it may be stored in stored baseline part design model data module . In other embodiments, digital signatures may not be required.","Stored standard drawing symbols data module  may comprise a series of standard drawing symbols, such as ASME Y14.5 symbols. These symbols may be used by a designer in creating a part design model using the CAD tool (e.g., see , module ). In one embodiment, where the CAD tool includes a custom design visualization functionality (e.g., see , module , discussed below), stored standard drawing symbols data module  may be automatically accessed by NICECAD server system  to provide the proper drawing symbols for a two-dimensional sectional view of a 3D part design model.","Stored quasi-real time multimedia communications sessions data module  may comprise records data of multimedia communications sessions (e.g., see , module ) between teams members in a concurrent engineering development project. For example, if a design team and EAS team have a multimedia communications session using the NICECAD system to discuss certain design issues, a record may be stored reflecting the session. In one embodiment, data reflecting the actual transactions (such as audio, video and graphics) may be stored for a session. In another embodiment, memory resources are preserved by storing only descriptive information, such as the identity of the parties, duration of the session, part design model version numbers accessed and the like.","Other PDM data modules  may comprise any other data modules in PDM data . Other data modules  may comprise any other data modules in database .","The NICECAD Server System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 9-15"],"b":["200","200"]},"As noted previously, in one embodiment user access to the processing modules of NICECAD server system  is facilitated using a custom browser specially adapted for the present application. Additionally, certain client-side applications are better provided as semi-machine-dependent applications that are compiled and executed using a standard operating system, although not via the \u201cvirtual machine\u201d provided by a standard browser. For example, certain graphics-intensive applications, such as those for supporting the invention's virtual CAD and multimedia video\/audio\/graphics capability, may be provided as Open GL\u2122-coded applications rather than Java 3D\u2122-coded applets.","It bears reiteration that NICECAD Server System , primarily for design development, and GMR Server System  (discussed below), primarily for locating qualified fabricators, and GMR Graphics Server  (discussed below), primarily for the bidding process, may exist at the same location on the same server system. In the preferred embodiment, the overall system provides a comprehensive functionality, hosted on a single system, for the entire product development lifecycle, from initial idea by a prime contractor\/designer to production in quantity by an outsourced fabricator. For illustrative purposes, we describe the various functional components as residing on separate servers, although this architecture is not required, and in the preferred embodiment, the three aspects of the invention are integrated into a substantially \u201cseamless\u201d virtual environment.","As illustrated by , NICECAD server system  may comprise system administration processing module ; PDM processing module ; CAD processing module ; multimedia communications processing module ; electronic commerce processing module ; and engineering analysis and simulation processing module .","System Administrative Processing in the NICECAD System","System administration processing module  generally supports system administrative processing and network related processing, and, as depicted in , may further comprise user logon authentication processing module ; contracts processing module ; account data and other report generation module ; security processing module ; network interface processing module ; data backup and archiving processing module ; and other application modules .","User logon authentication processing module  may comprise a security module for limiting access to the NICECAD system.

In one embodiment, network interface processing module  supports the interface with user systems on a substantially platform independent basis using browser pages or the like. In this manner, user interface with NICECAD server system  is achieved using more or less standard hardware and software. As previously noted, such browser pages may be configured to interface with a so-called standard, commercially available browser (e.g., Netscape\u2122 or Microsoft Explorer\u2122) or a custom browser specially adapted to support the graphics-intensive networked CAD and multimedia communications aspects of the present invention.","Data backup and archiving processing module  may comprise a module supporting periodic backing up and archiving of data (e.g., see , module ).

In general, modules - represent software which is used by design team members during the design and development phase to evaluate a proposed design. Typically, the current baseline part design model (or parts thereof) is the input, and the output is some measure of performance or compliance with applicable specifications. On the other hand, the producibility analysis performed by module  () represents analysis performed by the server for the purposes of generating the second query set (to be discussed below) for purposes of searching the GRM database for qualified fabricators. Therefore, while the results of the producibility analysis may be made available, and while the substantive analysis may involve some of the same computations, the results are used for different applications in the two contexts (NICECAD and GMR searching).","Regarding implementation of the aforementioned modules, in one embodiment the modules may comprise executable files or code that may be accessed by the user for downloading and execution (e.g., the NICECAD system may present a browser page to the user, who could then select from a list of analysis and simulation options).

In another embodiment, the aforementioned modules are made available to users through a platform independent application, such as a Java\u2122 applet, whereby the user may assign the inputs for the analysis (such as the part design model and various analysis or simulation parameters) and the \u201cnumber crunching\u201d is substantially performed by NICECAD server system . In this fashion, the processing demands on the user system are minimized, and little or no specialized hardware or software is required.","It should also be noted that EAS processing module  (or parts thereof) may be integrated or coordinated with CAD processing module  (or parts thereof). For example, an analysis that requires 2D sections of a part design model may include the execution of a module such as part design model visualization and manipulation processing module  (FIG. ).

Those of skill in the art understand that product data management is a rigorous process that may involve strict procedures and significant documentation. In the early phases of the development process (such as during the creation of the initiatial design), the design may change significantly as different approaches are considered and traded off. Consequently, a less rigorous preliminary PDM system may be used during the initial stages (e.g. see from \u201cinitial idea\u201d to \u201cDesign 1,\u201d ) so that the PDM requirements do not overburden the project at the early stage.","Based on authorizations assigned by the prime contractor, teams perform analysis and simulation to evaluate the preliminary baseline part design model according to various disciplines, as in step  (e.g., see , module ; FIG. ).

A revision history of the baseline part design model may be maintained. Strict check-in and check-out procedures may be enforced. Digital signatures may be required for any change to the baseline part design model and associated PDM documents (specifications and the like).","After each round of analysis and simulation, the prime contractor determines whether the baseline part design model is sufficiently mature to begin fabricating prototypes.

Of course, where the first and second aspects of the invention are integrated, then such functions are performed by system administration processing module  (FIG. ).","The GMR Server System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0206"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["1000","1000","2050","2100","2150","2200","2250","2300","2320","2350","2400","2450","2500","2550","2600","2650","2700","2750","2800","2850","2905","2900"]},"User logon authentication module  may comprise a security module for limiting access to the interactive GMR system. Designer service authorization module  may comprise a module that sends designer authorization information including, for example, information to tell the designer requesting a service, such as a search request, that the request may result in a billing action and that proceeding further constitutes final authorization. Contracts processing module  may comprise a module that ensures that before a fabricator registers with the system, and before a designer uses the system, contracts specifying the responsibilities of each party regarding data protection, maintenance and system usage are formalized. Report generation module  may comprise a module that formats and sends reports requested by users that, in one embodiment, may be sent as browser pages or links to downloadable files. Billing information processing and report generation module  may be a module that processes and stores billing information whenever a billable transaction occurs. Billing information processing and report generation module  generally automatically processes transactions as they occur and, in one embodiment, may also process billing summary reports upon user request.","Fabricator update processing module  may be a module that allows fabricators to load their fabricator specific data into the database, as well as update their data when their background or capabilities change (e.g., the manufacturing facility relocates or a new machine is purchased). One of the advantages provided by the GMR capability of the invention is that it not only provides a searchable database for designers\/prime contractors, but it also can function as a capability management system for fabricators. The fabricators can input, update and otherwise maintain an inventory of their capabilities and experience that can be used for capability management and marketing independent of its application for GMR searches. This incidental benefit to the GMR system provides an incentive for fabricators to register in the first instance. It also means that the burden of maintaining the fabricator capability data does not rest on the GMR system provider.","Search initiation module  may be a module that permits a user to initiate a search session. In one embodiment, search initiation module  may present to the user's browser a \u201csearch page\u201d from which particular searches can be launched.","General GMR search query processing module  may be a module that permits a user to conduct a general search of the GMR database for data that may be generally accessible (or nonproprietary). In one embodiment, general GMR search query processing module  supports searches by both designers and fabricators who wish to access general information regarding registered fabricators. Generally, a so-called general search involves search criteria that are not directly related to a design. For example, a general search may query such information as a fabricator's location, shop certifications (e.g., ISO 9000\/9001\/9002), operator certfications (e.g., are CNC milling machine operators factory trained?), and like information.","Interactive designer preference module  may comprise a module that permits a designer to input so-called \u201cpreference\u201d data in order to search the GMR database based on a limited GMR search. For a limited GMR search, the designer is not required to upload a part design model, but may select a series of criteria for qualifying fabricators (such as lead times, material, lot sizes, machinist\/craftsman certifications, etc.) that are considered global. Unlike a general search, the limited search may result in the search of limited access (or proprietary) fabricator data (e.g., see , blocks -) and, consequently, this option may be limited to designers. In one embodiment, the designer may select a set of preferences from a browser interface with GMR server system  that, following confirmation, may be temporarily stored and tagged with owner ID, session ID and time stamp (see , stored designer preference data module ). These preference inputs may then processed to generate a first query set. It should be noted that while a preference query may search proprietary data to identify qualifying fabricators, the underlying proprietary data is generally not provided to a searching designer. The fabricator \u201cowns\u201d the proprietary data maintained on the GMR system, and generally only the owner can view and edit said proprietary data.","Interactive designer part design model processing module  may comprise a module that permits a designer to upload a file representing a product or part to be fabricated (the term part design model used herein generally refers to such a file). According to one embodiment, the part design model may comprise a three-dimensional (3D) solid model. In another embodiment, the part design model may comprise a two-dimensional (2D) model. In one embodiment, interactive designer part design model processing module  sends a page to the designer's browser that provides for the launch of a client-side Java\u2122 applet that may be executed to permit the following operations: browse local memory for the file, select the file format, and upload the file to GMR server system . In one embodiment, interactive designer part design model processing module  may convert the uploaded part design model to a neutral or common format, such as an AP214 STEP file, so that stored models share the same file format. This furthers the data neutrality attribute of the invention previously discussed. In one embodiment, interactive designer part design model processing module  may also provide utilities for the designer, such as for the conversion of solid model files among different file formats, such as between IGES, STEP AP203 and AP214 model formats and other CAD-vendor specific formats, known to those of skill in the art.","Part design model file parsing module  may comprise a module that identifies graphical entities (e.g., geometric and\/or topological features) contained in an uploaded part design model file and converts them to a neutral format before storage. In one embodiment, each entity may be tagged with an owner ID, session ID and time stamp before storage in an object database (e.g., see , module ). If the uploaded file contains non-graphical data such as geometric dimensioning and tolerancing information (known to those of skill in the art as GDT data), these data items may be extracted, converted to a neutral format, and tagged before storage in the object database. Part design model file parsing module  may also perform a check to ensure that no duplicate entities exist.","Interactive designer attribute assignment module  may comprise a module that permits a designer to assign attributes to entities of the stored part design model. A part design model may comprise a series of geometrical and topological entities, each of which may be assigned its own attributes (such as surface finish, material, direction vector, etc.).","In one embodiment, interactive designer attribute assignment module  may provide for the launch of a Java\u2122 applet or like miniapplication at designer user system  for attribute assignment. A textual list and graphical presentation of the model entities may be sent by GMR server system  to designer user system  for presentation. A list of standard attributes (e.g., see , stored standard attributes data module ) may also be sent by GMR server system  to designer user system  to facilitate the process. The list may include such items as feature name (so the designer may name the entity), tolerance type (e.g., flatness, linear, angular, runout, etc.), tolerance range, surface finish value, and fabrication standard (e.g., MILSPEC, ISO, ANSI, ASME, and others known to those of skill in the art). For example, the designer may also input direction vectors for each entity that define the outside surface of the model. By keyboard entry or \u201cpoint and click\u201d use of a mouse (or similar pointing device), the designer may be enabled to select entities and assign attributes and attribute values. Upon completion of attribute assignment, the assigned information may be associated with the entities stored by GMR server system  in the database. It should be noted that, in the case of a \u201ccomplete\u201d solid model (e.g., a STEP AP214 file), sufficient information may exist for an acceptable producibility analysis to be run without further inputs, in which case attribute assignment may be avoided.","User preference first query processing module  may comprise a module that prepares a first query as a result of the designer's preference inputs (see interactive designer preference module  above) which may be run against the database to identify a first results list of qualified fabricators. In the case of a limited search, this may be the end of the designer session. In a limited search, appropriate results (e.g., the identity of all qualified fabricators) may be stored in the designer's account data and appropriate results (e.g., referral results providing basic information about the designer) may be stored in each qualified fabricator's account data. Notice may be then given to the designer and qualified fabricators that results have been posted. For a fill search, on the other hand, the first results list may be combined with the second results list before posting, as described in detail below.","An non-exhaustive list of the types of information in a preference query includes: whether the fabricator is ISO9001 certified; whether the vendor has specified trade association affiliations; whether the vendor is a minority-owned business or meets other requirements or standards under the federal acquisition statutes and regulations; whether the vendor meets the specified GMR quality assurance rating (discussed further below); whether the vendor is within 1000 miles of the designer's location; whether the vendor can support specified transportation modes, such as air, rail, and truck; whether the vendor can operate in a so-called \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory environment; whether the vendor has the ability to process Catia\u2122 CAD\/CAM design data; how many MILSPEC contracts has the vendor completed successfully; and has the vendor breached past contracts or otherwise fail to fully meet past contractual obligations.","For a full search (which may include the upload of a part design model, producibility analysis and a second query, among other steps), producibility analysis second query processing module  performs a producibility analysis of the uploaded, converted and attribute-assigned part design model in order to prepare the second query set for a second results list of qualified fabricators.","One Example of Producibility Analysis Logic","As one of ordinary skill can appreciate, various steps may be performed for the producibility analysis. According to one embodiment, the steps performed ensure that the material from which a part is to be made is compatible with any preferred processes selected by the designer. If no preferred processes are specified, all processes for which the material may be acceptable are identified for inclusion in the second query set.","Each surface entity may be checked for a direction vector defined by the designer; if none exists, the system attempts to define a direction vector for all surfaces in order to permit an interference check. Each surface may be then projected along its direction vector in order to check for interference. If interference exists, then the conflicting surface entities are noted and the designer may be given appropriate notice (e.g., by e-mail) so that the conflict may be resolved (e.g., by modifying the attribute assignment). The results of the interference check may be used to ensure that designer-selected processes are appropriate for the part, particularly to ascertain any machine tool\/die interference in the case of machining, forging, sheet metal and other such processes. For example, a forged part must have surfaces shaped in such a way as to permit a die press (e.g., drop forge) to fall along a straight path when the blank is struck. For example, a complex part may not be machinable, but may be cast and then finished with slurry processing and machining processes. If no processes are specified by the designer, all appropriate fabrication processes identified by this analysis may be included in the second query set.","The system may perform a volume approximation of the part represented by a 3D part design model in order to assess producibility using various processes, such as casting, where volume may be an important consideration.","The part design model may also be evaluated for the existence of passages or voids (e.g., closed channels, holes and other internal features that may require material removal). The size and topology of these passages or voids may be evaluated for producibility using various processes, such as machining, where passage topology may be an important consideration.","The part design model may also be evaluated based on an envelope enclosing the part represented by the model. The dimensions of the envelope may be used to assess which machines may be used to manufacture the part and also what material stock may be used. For example, a cylindrical part will likely be made using a lathe and may require rod stock of a certain size.","The producibility analysis steps may also estimate the part design model thickness to determine if the part may be made of sheet stock, and to what extent specific features or entities may be produced using sheet metal processes.","Each entity assigned a tolerance may be evaluated for whether it may be achieved for the selected processes. If no process is specified, all processes capable of achieving the desired tolerance may be included in the second query set.","The part design model may be evaluated for topological symmetry to estimate the suitability of symmetrical manufacturing processes such as spinning or lathing. Acceptable processes may then be included in the second query set.","For each surface finish specified by the designer, all finishing processes capable of achieving that finish may be identified and included in the second query set. Each specified surface finish, as well as each tolerance, may also be evaluated to ensure compatibility with the overall part design model topology.","As one of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate, there are a multitude of variations of the producibility analysis that do not depart from the spirit of the invention disclosed herein, which is to employ some automated logic to perform part-specific analysis in order to identify fabricators.","Producibility analysis second query processing module  may be a module that uses the results of the producibility analysis to prepare a second query set. The second query set may be compared to databases  to generate a second results list of qualified fabricators. In one embodiment, the raw producibility analysis results, including producibility analysis methodology, may be also be stored and made available to the designer.","When a full search (i.e., using the first query set based on preference data and the second query based on the part design model\/producibility analysis) is conducted, multiple sets of qualified fabricators may be produced. A predetermined number, such as two sets, may be produced, for example, one set corresponding to each query. Query results reconciliation processing module  reconciles the produced fabricators to render a single list of qualifying fabricators (e.g., for two sets of results, those appearing in both result lists). If the results cannot be reconciled (e.g., there are no qualified fabricators appearing in both lists), the results may be analyzed to identify the most likely cause of the reconciliation failure. This information may then be stored in the designer's results report.","GMR designer account processing module  may comprise a module that maintains and updates all account data for each designer. In particular, this module may provide that records are stored for each designer session (a designer session may be one complete cycle of a search), including the search results, as well as all transactions (a designer transaction refers to any time the designer logs onto the system, such as to retrieve results or have a custom report prepared). In one embodiment, GMR designer account processing module  may provide that a designer user ID, session ID, time stamp and descriptive information (including the search results) be stored following each completed session. In one embodiment, GMR designer account processing module  provides that a designer user ID, session ID, and time stamp are stored following each transaction (e.g., if the designer  logs on to have the results from sessions  and  downloaded at 1:30 p.m., then all of this information may be recorded as a transaction).","GMR fabricator account processing module  is similar to GMR designer account processing module , only the former may record account data for each registered fabricator. GMR fabricator account processing module  may store records for each session (a session may be a general search by the fabricator, GMR input\/update of fabricator specific data, or the referral results emanating from a designer search that identified this fabricator as qualified) and each fabricator transaction (a fabricator transaction refers to any time the fabricator logs onto the system, such as to retrieve referral results or have a report generated), or may only store some sessions or transactions. In one embodiment, a fabricator user ID, session ID and time stamp may be recorded for each session and transaction. For example, when a designer search identifies a particular fabricator as qualified, the referral results may be posted in the fabricator's account by this module.","Quality assurance processing module  comprises a module that provides the quality assurance rating capability of the system. Following the performance (or lack thereof) of a fabrication effort by a GMR-registered fabricator, the prime contractor is given an opportunity to provide feedback to the GMR system regarding performance in terms of timeliness, quality, and other relevant considerations. In one embodiment, GMR server system  may be accessed by the prime contractor for browser pages or the like to provide a performance assessment. The quality assurance survey may include a series of questions which can be answered quantitatively (e.g., answered as 1-5, with \u201c5\u201d being \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d and \u201c1\u201d being \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cstrongly disagree\u201dSuch data can be compiled and statistically aggregated into a series, or one overall, quality assurance rating. The quality assurance browser forms may also include questions to be answered in a narrative manner, not necessarily to be compiled, but to be made available to subsequent users of the GMR system. Quality assurance processing module  supports not only the collection and compilation of such data, but also the distribution of the data to system users.","Other server side applications  refers to any other predominately server side applications run by GMR server system  to support the interactive EDM system. For example, this module may include software for system administration, database manipulation, and network-related operations. This module may include software to support multimedia applications such as the transport of voice, video and graphics over the network.","Other client side interactive applications  refers to any other predominantly client side applications that may be supported by GMR server system . For example, if multimedia operations require specialized capabilities exceeding standard user system multimedia support, other client side interactive applications  may provide those capabilities in the form of downloadable executable code. In one embodiment, such client-side capabilities are supported through the use of machine independent Java\u2122 applets supported by standard browsers.","The Global Manufacturer's Registry (GMR) Database","Databases  contains the data used by the GMR system. Internal analysis criteria data module  represents any stored constants and other data used to implement the producibility logic (e.g., see , module ). Stored standard attributes data module  represents attributes, and may also include attribute values, that may be made available to designer user system  to select for attribute assignment (e.g., see , module ). In one embodiment, this data may be transmitted to an applet launched at designer user system  so that the designer may readily assign attributes and values to selected graphical entities. In the integrated embodiment, module  is integrated with module  of FIG. . Stored designer preference data module  may comprise stored preference data that may be input by the designer for the first query set (e.g., see , module ). Stored designer part design model data module  may comprise the stored part design models, including graphical and non-graphical entities and any associated attributes. As noted above, in one embodiment, each entity may be appropriately tagged to facilitate data management.","Account data  may comprise account data maintained by the system for designers and fabricators. In one embodiment, account data  may comprise both session records (such as searches, including search results; referrals, including description of the referring designer; GMR updates; etc.), and transaction records (such as results retrieval, report printouts, etc.). Account data  may be further logically divisible into designer account data module  and fabricator account data module . Where the GMR and NICECAD aspects of the system are part of the integrated embodiment, account data  may be combined with account data  of FIG. .","Quality assurance data module  comprises quality assurance data collected reflecting the performance of fabricators on the GMR system. The module may comprise both the underlying data submitted by designers\/prime contractors using electronic survey forms or the like, as well as the aggregated GMR quality assurance rating that derives therefrom. While  depicts quality assurance data module separate from GMR data module , it should be appreciated the GMR quality assurance rating(s) are searchable by system users. For example, a preference query (to be discussed below) might include criteria regarding quality assurance rating, such as to identify only fabricators with a net rating of \u201c3\u201d or better.","Global Manufacturers Registry (GMR) data module  comprises fabricator specific data stored for registered fabricators. As indicated by the arrows on , the module may contain both general access (non-proprietary) data and limited access (proprietary) data. In one embodiment, limited access data may be directly accessible only by the owner (e.g., the fabricator that submitted the data). In one embodiment, the data owner may also give authorization for particular users to access the owner's proprietary data. In general, the interactive GMR system itself may issue queries that search both types of data to locate qualified fabricators in response to a designer search request. This may be the case even though the results presented to the designer contain no proprietary information.","As those of ordinary skill should appreciate, GMR data module  may contain a multitude of different types of fabricator information that may be used for designer searches, so that the categories depicted below are illustrative only and non-exhaustive.","General information group data module  may contain general information, such as location, certifications and affiliations, transportation modes, CAD capabilities, trade restrictions (import\/export tariffs, technology transfer restrictions, etc.), electronic commerce capability, computer hardware\/software capability, status as federally-recognized minority-owned, small business or other special categories, and other items not related to specific machinery or manufacturing capabilities.","Process machinery group data module  may contain information pertaining to the machinery and processes used by the fabricator. Information such as machine models, stock types and sizes, tolerances associated with the machine, production rates, lead times, set-up costs and times, numerical control systems, and other information may be included. Since different machines may support different processes, the inputs may vary from machine type to machine type. For example, a forging process may have a different input set than a vertical mill. Information about specific process capabilities may be included, such as electro-chemical machining, core casting, investment casting and powdered metal processing. Information pertaining to outsourced processes may also be included.","Tool set group data module  allows a fabricator to catalog standard and custom tools used by machines. In one embodiment, standard machine tool lists (listing such items as end mill cutters, drills, abrasives, etc.) may be provided to limit the amount of information required by the fabricator. In one embodiment, an interactive application in the form of a Java\u2122 applet may be provided to fabricator user system  so that custom tools may be built interactively from a component list (e.g., see , module ).","Personnel operator group data module  may contain information about the machinists, craftsman and operators of machines and processes, including years of experience and any certifications. In one embodiment, privacy may be maintained by limiting input to non-personal data.","Materials group data module  may comprise information regarding those materials the fabricator can work. For example, maximum and minimum stock sizes, stock types (e.g., billet, rod, bar, sheet, powder, etc.) and material types (e.g., steel, aluminum, titanium, etc.) may be specified. In one embodiment, the fabricator may select from a standard list of materials, including material stock types, provided to the fabricator.","Manufacturing standards data module  comprises data regarding those standards to which a fabricator can manufacture a part (e.g., MILSPEC, ISO, ANSI, ASME, and others well known to those of skill in the art).","Inspection\/QA data module  comprises fabricator-specified data regarding inspection processes, equipment and applicable standards. In other words, the fabricator may specify what methods are used to verify that a part has been made to designer specification and under what standards inspections are conducted.","As should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill, a variety of database structures and database management programs may be used for databases . In one embodiment, an object-oriented database structure may be employed combining Oracle 8\u2122 and ObjectStore\u2122 software, well known to those of skill in the art.","A Method for a Search Session using the GMR System","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for a designer search session using the GMR system is described in FIG. . Referring to , the designer first logs onto the interactive system, as in step , by connecting designer user system  to GMR server system  through network . The system is generally preferred to be secure, so that GMR server system  authenticates or verifies that the designer is an authorized user, as in step . GMR server system  may carry out this function through a software component such as user logon authentication module , depicted in FIG. .","Following authentication, the designer selects the scope of services that are requested for the search session. According to one embodiment, the designer may select a general search of non-proprietary data, as in step . The non-proprietary data may be data such as that stored in general information group data module , depicted in FIG. . In one embodiment, the designer makes this selection from a search page presented on a browser at designer user system . This may be performed by a software component such as search initiation module , in FIG. .","If the designer requests a general search, then the designer may select search criteria for the search of non-proprietary data, as in step .

According to this embodiment, the designer may select options such as desired location (e.g. East Coast or Pennsylvania fabricators), certifications\/affiliations and CAD capabilities through the browser at designer user system .","Based on input criteria selected by the designer, GMR server system  prepares a query set appropriate for the general search, as in step , which may then be run against general access fabricator data, as in step , to identify fabricators meeting the criteria set by the designer. Steps  and  may be carried out by a software component such as the general GMR search query processing module  depicted in FIG. . The results of the general search carried out by step  may then be stored in the designer account data, as in step , and sent to the requesting designer, as in step .","In one embodiment, the general search results may be tagged with a user ID, session ID and time stamp before storage in the designer account, such as that depicted as designer account data module  of , so that the designer may later retrieve them when desired. Thus, step  may encompass a subsidiary step of GMR server system  issuing an e-mail to the designer giving notice that the results have been posted. Upon such notice, the designer may log onto the system to retrieve the results by selecting the appropriate session in the designer's account for output as a report, to be discussed later in connection with FIG. .","Once the search has been conducted and the results posted, the designer account data may be updated to reflect completion of the task (including storage of the results), as in step , as well as the corresponding fabricator account data, which may be updated for those fabricators identified as a result of the search, as in step . Steps  and  may be carried out by software components such as those depicted as modules  and , respectively, in FIG. . Finally, any applicable billing information may be generated and sent to the designer, as in step , and to fabricators identified as a result of the search, as in step . These billing processing steps may be carried out by a software component such as module  of , and may be stored in designer account data module  and fabricator account data module  of FIG. .","Returning to the \u201cno\u201d branch of decision block , the designer may desire a search of the entire fabricator database, including proprietary data. As previously mentioned, the preferred embodiment provides that a limited search searches proprietary data to identify qualified fabricators to a searching designer, but the underlying proprietary data is not revealed to the designer. In this case, the designer may select between a limited preference search or full search, according to step . As discussed above in connection with the system of , a limited preference search may result in a first query set, and first query results list, without necessitating a producibility analysis. A full search uses the part design model and the producibility analysis so that a second query set and second query results list may be produced. If the user desires a limited preference search, the method skips to step , to be discussed below.","Otherwise, the designer may upload a part design model to GMR server system , as in step . Interactive designer part design model processing module  may perform step  using a platform independent Java\u2122 applet. Where the NICECAD and GMR aspects of the invention are integrated, the part design model may have been previously created (e.g., using CAD processing module  of ) and stored (e.g., at PDM data  of FIG. ). In that case, step  of uploading the part design model may not be required because it is already stored on the system in a neutral format.","In step , GMR server system  parses the part design model received from a designer into its constituent graphical and non-graphical entities that may be tagged and stored into an object-oriented database, such as the that depicted as stored designer part design model data module  of FIG. . The designer may then assign attributes (and attribute values) which may be associated with the entities stored with the part design model, as in step . The step of attribute assignment may be carried out by a software component such as that depicted as module  of FIG. . As with step , in the integrated embodiment of the invention, the complete, attribute-assigned part design model may already be stored, in which case step  is not necessary.","Once the stored part design model is sufficiently complete, in step , producibility analysis (details of which are provided above in connection with module  of ) may be performed to generate a second query set. As indicated above, the producibility analysis results may be considered intermediate to the extent they are primarily used for generating the second query set; however, the raw results and underlying methodology may be made available for the designer's consideration.","Step  provides for the designer to select preference input criteria in order to conduct a search based on general parameters, as previously discussed. Step  may be performed by a software component such as interactive designer preference module  of , and may include the provision of a Java\u2122 applet to facilitate preference selection. Based on the preference input criteria, a first query set for searching the database may be generated by GMR server system , as in step .","Once these query sets (e.g., the first query set in the case of a limited search and both the first and second query sets in the case of a full search) are generated, those sets are compared to the GMR data, as in step . The query sets may be compared to all of the fabricator data, as depicted as GMR data module  in , or only a subset of such data. In the case of a full search, two sets of results may be obtained, in which case step  may include the application of reconciliation logic to combine the results into a single set (e.g., see , module ). Of course, as should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the need for reconciliation logic may be obviated by simply reporting both sets of results.","In step , the search results for the limited\/full search may be saved into designer account data module  (e.g., reporting qualified fabricators) and fabricator account data module  (e.g., providing a referral describing the designer for which each fabricator has been qualified). Similar to step , step  provides for the query results to be sent to the designer, which may simply encompass an e-mail informing the designer that the results are posted and available for retrieval. Other notification may also be provided. Similarly, step  provides for the referral emanating from the search to be forwarded to qualified fabricators, which may also encompass an e-mail notice.","Steps  and - are repeated substantially as previously described.","A Method for a Designer to Retrieve Reports Using the GMR System","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for a designer to retrieve reports from the interactive GMR system is described in FIG. . Referring to , the designer may log on according to step , and may be authenticated according to step . Next, the designer selects the type of report to be generated, as in step . According to this embodiment, the designer may request a \u201cstandard\u201d report detailing the query results from selected search sessions (\u201cQuery Results\u201d), or a \u201ccustom\u201d report summarizing transactions in which the designer has engaged (\u201cDesigner Custom Report\u201d). In one embodiment, source data for both options may be stored with the designer account data, such as in designer account data module  in FIG. .","If the designer wishes a standard report of query results, the designer selects the desired query results from the designer account, as in step . In one embodiment, one or more browser pages listing past search sessions may be sent to designer user system , along with various report format options, so that the designer may select and transmit the desired options back to GMR server system . According to step , GMR server system  then retrieves the selected data from the designer account and formats the report as requested. According to step , the report may be then transmitted to the designer. In one embodiment, the designer may be given the option of viewing the report directly as browser pages or of linking to a file for download as a standard word processing text document (e.g., in Microsoft Word\u2122, Word Perfect\u2122, etc.). The designer account data may be updated to reflect this transaction, as in step .","If the designer desires a custom report, then the designer selects custom report options according to step , which permits a search of the designer's entire account, including session records, transaction records, and billing records, for example. According to one embodiment, step  may include the use of a Java\u2122 applet sent from GMR server system  to facilitate the custom reporting option, which may include report format options. Based on the custom report options selected by the designer, GMR server system  generates an appropriate query set, according to step , which may then be run against the designer account data, according to step . The results of the query may be retrieved and formatted for the report, according to step . The report may then be transmitted to the designer, pursuant to step , which, in one embodiment, entails browser pages and\/or a link to a downloadable file. As before, the designer account data may be updated, as in step .","A Method for a Fabricator Session Using the GMR System","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for a fabricator session using the interactive EDM system is described in FIG. . Referring to , the fabricator logs on to initiate the session, as in step , and GMR server system  authenticates the fabricator, as in step . The fabricator selects an option, as in step , which may include a \u201cGenerate Report\u201d option, \u201cUpdate Database\u201d option, or \u201cGeneral Search\u201d option.","If the fabricator selects the \u201cGeneral Search\u201d option, the steps performed may be similar to those for a designer's general search (see , steps -). The fabricator selects input criteria for the search of non-proprietary data, according to step ; GMR server system  generates an appropriate query set, according to step ; the query set may then be run against general access fabricator data, according to step ; the search results may be stored in the fabricator account, according to step ; and the search results may be sent to the fabricator, according to step ; and the fabricator account data may be updated to reflect the search session, according to step .","The \u201cUpdate Database\u201d option may be selected if the fabricator wishes to update the fabricator data stored in GMR data module . Accordingly, step  provides for the fabricator to select the database components that are to be updated. For the GMR database allocation depicted as GMR data module  in , the fabricator might select, for example, the process machinery group data stored in module  to reflect the purchase of a new machine. According to step , the fabricator may then update the selected database component with the appropriate information, which may be then sent to back to GMR server system . In one embodiment, GMR server system  may facilitate the update by sending browser pages to the fabricator containing the existing information for that component, which the fabricator may then amend before selecting a send command on the browser page. Step  provides for GMR server system  to save the updated fabricator information to the appropriate location in the database (e.g., see , process machinery group data module ). Once the database has been successfully updated, a confirmation notice may be sent to the fabricator, as in step . Finally, the fabricator account data may be updated to reflect the update session, as in step .","The \u201cGenerate Report\u201d option may be selected if the fabricator wishes to view a report. In this embodiment, three categories of fabricator reports may be supported, as reflected by the three paths emanating from decision block of step . If the fabricator wishes to review stored fabricator information in the database to ensure it is current, then the \u201cFabricator Information Report\u201d option may be selected. Accordingly, GMR server system  retrieves the stored fabricator data (e.g., data for that fabricator ID contained in GMR data module , ) and formats the report, as in step . The report may then be transmitted to the fabricator, as in step , which, in one embodiment, may be accessed either as platform independent browser pages or a link to a formatted text file. Finally, the fabricator account data may be updated to reflect the transaction, as depicted by step .","It is noted that the \u201cGenerate Report\u201d and \u201cUpdate Database\u201d options for a fabricator session represent one embodiment of supporting the so-called \u201ccapability management system\u201d previously mentioned. That is, the stored fabricator data on the GMR database is not only used to facilitate searches by designers hoping to identify qualified fabricators, but it incidentally also provides a ready means for fabricators to manage their resources and information. This provides a substantial benefit to fabricators listed in the GMR registry because it obviates or greatly reduces the need for using internal hardware, software and human resources for capability management. This provides a substantial benefit to the GMR provider and participating designers because it may induce fabricators to \u201cenroll\u201d in the registry in the first instance. Thus, fabricators otherwise not inclined to list with the registry may do so because of the benefit of the substantially cost-free capability management resource they will receive. These are significant benefits. In fact, a preferred embodiment may present options for viewing\/modifying fabricator data explicitly as the \u201cManufacturer Capability Management System,\u201d so as to highlight this beneficial aspect of the GMR system. In presenting it as such, the GMR provider may also highlight the fact that it is network-based (e.g., \u201cInternet Accessible\u201d or \u201cWorld Wide Web Accessible\u201d or the like) and secure (e.g., \u201cAll Proprietary Information Securely Maintained\u201d).","The \u201cFabricator Referrals Report\u201d option may be selected if the fabricator wishes to view referral results saved in the fabricator account data. The fabricator selects the desired referral results from the fabricator account, as in step , which, in one embodiment, may be via browser pages sent from GMR server system  listing all referrals in the account. Based on the fabricator's selection, GMR server system  then retrieves the appropriate referral results and formats the report, as in step . The report may then be sent to the fabricator, as in step . The fabricator account data may then be updated to reflect the transaction, as in step .","The \u201cFabricator Custom Report\u201d option may be selected if the fabricator desires a customized report from the fabricator's account data. This option permits a search of the fabricator's account, similar to that for a designer custom report (discussed above). The fabricator selects the report options, according to step , which, in one embodiment, may be facilitated through a server-supplied Java\u2122 applet. Thereafter, GMR server system  prepares a query set based on the selected options, as in step , which may be run against that fabricator's account, as in step . GMR server system  retrieves the data and formats the report, as in step , transmits the report to the requesting fabricator, as in step , and updates the fabricator account data to reflect the transaction, as in step Q.","A Third Aspect of the Invention: A System and Methods for Providing an Electronic Trading Community for a Part to be Built","The third aspect of the invention provides an electronic trading community (ETC) whereby a prime contractor\/designer with a part design model can electronically solicit bids or proposals by issuing a request for quote (RFQ) or request for proposal (RFP) to fabricators. In the preferred embodiment, the ETC capability of the system is integrated with the first and second aspects of the invention, the NICECAD capability for virtual collaborative engineering, and the GMR capability for identifying qualified fabricators. In that embodiment, a prime contractor may utilize the NICECAD capability to create a part design model, stored at a server in a neutral format, in the virtual engineering environment. The prime contractor may then utilize the GMR capability to identify a pool of qualified fabricators. The prime contractor may then utilize the third aspect of the invention to solicit bids from this pool, or from a subset of the pool if the prime contractor decides to exclude certain fabricators for some reason.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0276","num":"0275"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["2600","2650","2680","2600","2600","2602","2600","2600","2650"]},"GMR user  submits a request for quote to GMR provider , the request comprising design and specification data, such as part design model data, and associated manufacturing specifications, as depicted in block . If the part design model was created and stored using the NICECAD aspect of the system, the part design model and specification data can be provided by giving access permissions to specified fabricators, as discussed previously in connection with stored design and analysis access permission data module  of FIG. . Based on the bids submitted, GMR user  will select one or more winning bidders, as in block . Upon award, GMR user  submits a complete part definition to the winning bidder(s), as in block . We call what is eventually provided a \u201ccomplete\u201d part definition because what is initially provided may be a lower-fidelity data set (e.g., lower resolution graphical data) which is adequate for purposes of the bidding process. Upon completion of the bidding process, complete or high fidelity data is provided to the selected bidder (the \u201cwinner\u201d) who will actually be fabricating the part.","GMR provider  represents the server-based system providing the ETC capability and communicating with GMR user  and manufacturing vendors  through a secure networked interface. GMR provider  supports so-called transaction mediation (block ) between a prime contractor and bidding manufacturer(s) by supporting terms and conditions negotiations , contract formalization  and digital signatures , electronic funds transfer , and multimedia services . Transaction mediation generally occurs after a prime contractor selects one or more winning bidders, and involves the formalization of an agreement corresponding to the selected bid. In this context, multimedia services  refers to communications functionality supporting quasi-real time audio, video, and graphics, including CAD functionality supporting viewing and manipulation of a part design model as previously discussed.","Manufacturing vendors  represents fabricators bidding in response to an RFQ or RFP submitted by GMR user . Manufacturing vendors  may view 3D part design models and associated specifications, as in block . The ETC system may permit a prospective bidder to view the pool of bidders before preparing and submitting (or revising\/updating) a bid, as illustrated by block . For example, in one embodiment a \u201cbidding pool list\u201d identifying the dollar amount of the various bids is available to the bidders. The bidding pool list does not identify the bidders or disclose any detailed information provided by them to GMR user . This list might indicate: \u201cBidder A: $25,000.00; Bidder B: $32,000.00, . . . \u201d and so forth. Ultimately, a successful bidder will product and deliver parts, as in block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0280","num":"0279"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 20","FIG. 13"],"b":["2710","1000","2770","2760","2770","2750","2740","2720","2720","978","932","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0281","num":"0280"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 13"],"b":["978","932","12","2810","2812","2814","2808","2806","2802","2804"]},"Collectively,  illustrate how the networked CAD and multimedia communications features of the first aspect of the invention (NICECAD) can be beneficially applied to support the ETC RFQ and bidding process. In sum, the quasi-real-time \u201cstreaming\u201d of audio, video and graphics through a GMR provider provides a means for the prime contractor and bidder to engage in detailed technical discussions from different locations, in a secure environment, and substantially without the need for specialized hardware and software. It can be appreciated that numerous aspects of the so-called \u201cboundaries\u201d difficulty, previously described, are ameliorated or eliminated.","Continuing with the ETC aspect of the invention, the RFQ may be submitted or \u201cposted\u201d to GMR graphics server  via browser templates completed by GMR user . The RFQ may include such information as a project identifier, narrative description, quantity requirements, schedule requirements, delivery requirements, and the like. The RFQ may include information pertaining to how many \u201crounds\u201d of bids will be considered, or as to whether a given round is a so-called \u201cbest and final\u201d offer round. The RFQ may include information identifying the bidding pool. When the second (GMR) and third (ETC) aspects of the invention are integrated, the RFQ form may include a listing of the qualified fabricators identified by a search. Prime contractor GMR user  may then select from the list so that the RFQ is directed to the selected fabricators. The RFQ may include information identifying the date and time for the bidding round(s), such as indicating the bidding window begins at 8:00 a.m. on November 7 and ending at 4:30 p.m. on November 14. The RFQ may also include information identifying that period when the part design model (and associated) data will be available and\/or when GMR user  will be available for conducting multimedia communications sessions to discuss issues.","As previously mentioned, the bidder may, and usually will, view and examine a graphical representation of the part design model (and associated technical documents or data) before submitting a bid. The bidder may also engage in a multimedia communications session with the soliciting entity to resolve any technical or business issues. A bidder may also view the bidding pool list, previously described, in order to evaluate the current state of the bidding process for the RFQ before submitting or updating a previously-submitted bid.","Bids that are submitted to the GMR provider (e.g., GMR server system , ) are posted, along with any supplemental information provided by bidders. This supplemental information could provide further information about the bidder or qualifying or clarifying the bid. For example, the bidder might say \u201cOur bid is slightly higher than others because XYZ Machine and Tool, Inc. pays its operators a higher wage so as to retain the highest quality personnel\u201d or other such information to be evaluated by the issuer of the RFQ. This bid and supplemental information may be stored by the GMR provider at a location in database  (FIG. ), such as in fabricator account data module . Generally, GMR server system  may tag the bids with timestamp data and data identifying the prime contractor to which the bid is directed. After evaluating the bids, a GMR user selects the vendor(s) best meeting the RFP requirements, and winning bidders are notified.","Once the bidding window is closed, the issuer of the RFP\/RFQ evaluates the bids and supplemental information. Vendors selected for contract negotiation and contract award are notified as a process of contract formalization commences. A collection of standard clauses are stored in a database at one of the NICECAD\/GMR provider's servers. These clauses outline the responsibilities of each party with respect to common aspects of parts procurement. An example might be the specific assignment of responsibility for part inspection and verification. A clause may be provided that assigns this responsibility to the fabricator or to the prime contractor depending on the outcome of contract negotiations. Since many similar situations exist in this type of buying, standard clauses may be used as bases for the formal contract. Such standard contract clauses serve as starting points for negotiation. Through the virtual environment, these contract clauses are modified and included in a \u201cformalized\u201d contract that is custom tailored for the specific manufacturing job. A formalized contract may be thought of as a \u201csignable\u201d contract that has resulted from negotiations over a set of \u201cstandard\u201d starting points. This feature is necessary to accommodate the very dynamic nature of this type of procurement.","The terms and conditions negotiations may use the secure multimedia communications capability previously discussed, whereby a prime contractor and successful bidder can engage in negotiations using the quasi-real-time video and\/or audio. Stored standard form contracts (see, e.g., module , ) and stored standard terms and conditions (see, e.g., module , ) may be employed. The digital signature capability provides a means for both parties to formalize agreements once they are negotiated (see, e.g., module , FIG. ). Once negotiated and formalized, contracts may be stored by the GMR provider, such as at module  of FIG. .","A final aspect to the present invention is that the provider the GMR provider (e.g, GMR server system ) may further provide to the winning fabricator(s) a network-based connection to the prime contractor's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. ERP generally refers to a multi-module software application integrated with a relational database used by a prime contractor to manage important parts of its business, such as product planning, parts purchasing, inventory management, interaction with suppliers, customer service and order tracking. By providing a fabricator (or other supplier) a secure connection (or so-called \u201cportal\u201d) to the prime contractor's ERP system, the fabricator is further integrated with the prime contractor and business boundaries are further diminished. Commercially available ERP applications are available from PeopleSoft, SAP, Oracle, and Baan.","Other embodiments and uses of this invention will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein.
