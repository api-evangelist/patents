No. 09\/608,605, filed Jun. 29, 2000, which is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 09\/454,178, filed Dec. 2, 1999, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,054, issued on Dec. 24, 2002. Application Ser. No. 09\/608,605, application Ser. No. 09\/454,178 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,054 are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties and to which applications we claim priority under 35 USC \u00a7120.","The present invention relates broadly to the remote control of signal recording equipment. Specifically, the present invention relates to the control of remotely located recording equipment via a computer network.","Most consumer video\/audio recording equipment today such as the video cassette recorder (VCR) is equipped with scheduling features. Scheduling features allow users to schedule recording of television programs based on user-specified time and channels. Most equipment can be controlled by remote control. However, for average users the process of scheduling television program recordings can be cumbersome. The user must be present at the location of recording equipment where a remote control unit is situated within an effective operating distance of the recording device. In the case where the remote control unit transmits commands in the form of infrared signals, the remote control unit must also establish line of sight to the recording equipment. Before operating a timer mechanism in conjunction with the recording equipment, the internal clock of video\/audio recording equipment must be set to conform to local time. A user reviews schedule information of television programs to be recorded, such as program date, time and channel. A user typically selects a desired program to be recorded and enters schedule information using the remote control unit into the recording equipment. This step may consist of several key entries on the remote control units, since for every intended consecutive scheduled recording, the user specifies the time to begin recording as well as the time to terminate recording.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,692,214 and 5,988,078 to Levine teach implementations of an electronic schedule stored in memory to allow cursor based programming on a conventional video recorder through use of an associated personal computer. The computer communicates with the video recorder via infrared signals of the type used for remote control of the video recorder. Programming schedule information may be provided to the personal computer from a remote database by telephonic communication, broadcast, or use of disposable memories. A remote transmitter connected to the personal computer is used at the time of the recording to send signals to the video recorder to initiate recording of a preselected program, allowing unattended programming memory of the video recorder to initiate recording of a specific channel at a proper time. The method taught by Levine includes the steps of providing at the viewing location a computerized unit having an operator input and a modem; establishing a connection to a wide area network through the modem; transmitting information to a service provider regarding the geographical location of the particular viewing location; and receiving from the service provider information specific to the type of programming available to the particular viewing location. However, neither of the Levine patents address the problem of trying to operate a video recorder from a remote location.","The present invention addresses the problems identified above and provides an apparatus, method and service model which simplify conventional methods for schedule recordings of television programs and enable users to control recording equipment from any location via the Internet. Entities connected to computer networks such as the Internet and web-browser software can schedule recordings of television programs and\/or operate the recording equipment. In an example scenario, a user who maintains recording equipment at home may utilize the present invention from his or her workplace or vacation place, accesses a service provider website using her\/his user name and password, views the a schedule of television programs provided by a broadcaster or other distributor of programming and selects the television programs to be recorded. The application service provider in turn transmits the selected television program information to a computer connected to a later described remote control unit to execute and operate the recording of selected programs. In this manner, the present invention enables anyone with internet access to remotely operate recording equipment to record television programs.","Another attendant advantage of the present invention is an inexpensive solution to provide global connectivity of the Internet to existing recording equipment. The present invention can be utilized to operate recording equipment such as video cassette recorders, that typically have infrared sensors to receive control commands. Other recording equipment such as DVD recorders, hard drive based video recorders, etc. can also be controlled using the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["10","50","60","10","60","12","16","10","12","18","14","10","20","22","10","60"]},"Although a desktop type of computer is illustrated, it is to be understood that other forms of computers, such as workstations, laptops, palm tops, dumb terminals, or any computer capable of communicating with other computers may be used in connection with embodiments of the present invention.","Computers ,  may communicate over the computer network  via modem and telephone line. An operating system and browser program may also be included in computers ,  so that a user may access the laboratory. However, other media may also be used, such as a direct connection or high speed data line. The computer network , as described above, may be a large and complex system, incorporating a vast number of nodes and components.","Computer  is located at a laboratory where physical processes are to be conducted. For illustrative purposes, the operation of a laser and optical equipment is described herein, but it is to be understood that other types of physical processes may be used in connection with the present invention. An interface  is connected to the processor in computer  that allows a user to control laser . The beam from laser  may be directed through various optical equipment , which may be adjusted on table  by interface . In an embodiment of the present invention, interface  may use a PCI-GPIB board to control and monitor laser . To acquire images of the laser beam that have been processed by optical equipment , a CCD detector that transmits digitized images to a IMAQ PCI-1424 board may be used. The optical equipment  may be mechanically adjusted and aligned by motorized stages on which the equipment is mounted. To display live pictures of the processes and equipment, an IMAQ PCI-1408 board may be used to digitize the analog video signal from camera . Motion of camera  may be controlled by a motion control system available through a software application such as LabView, which may be stored and executed on computer . Camera  is provided with frame grabber  to provide video feedback of the physical process, and are controlled by the video server , which may be executed on the processor of computer . System software on computer  may also include IMAQ Vision for G that provides image processing libraries such as a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) routine to speed up development of live data analysis software.","Directing attention to , the system architecture  integrates hardware and software that facilitate two-way communication between physical processes  to on-line users across computer networks. The system can be divided into several processes based on functionality: physical processes , lab server , connection server , clients , database server . These processes can be implemented as software programs that are executed in computing devices such as computers. As used herein, physical processes  are defined as physical, biological and\/or chemical processes or phenomena that can be detected, measured, quantified and\/or controlled by electronic devices such as detectors, sensors, motors, power source, etc. to various interfaces such as GPIB, RS-232, PCI, USB, ethernet, etc., the electronic devices that monitor and control the physical processes  and communicate with computer  that runs the lab server process .","Data from the physical processes  are collected by the lab server  for purposes of storing into the database via the database server  and\/or distributing to the clients  via the connection server . Prior to sending data, the lab server  can also perform analysis and transformation of the data such as statistics and FFT computation. The lab server  also receives data from the clients  such as control commands through the connection server . After analyzing these commands, the lab server  then passes the commands to the electronic devices or equipment (i.e. laser, motors, detectors, etc.). As shown in , there are multiple physical processes , namely physical process - and physical process -, as well as multiple lab servers -, -.","The connection server  serves as the distributor of data that accepts, verifies and routes information from data sources to appropriate destinations. The connection server  supports full duplex point-to-point and point-to-multipoints data transmissions between the clients , lab server , and database server . Several transmission modes will be discussed below. Additionally, the connection server  also monitors the status of network connections throughout the entire process.","The clients' processes  provide user interfaces (UI) for users' input and output functions. The clients' processes  are implemented as software programs that can be run on clients' computing devices such as desktop computers. The client also establishes two-way communications with the connection server . Data from the connection server  are decoded and displayed according to associated formats such as the video, graph, LED displays, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, communications between the processes above are carried out using a common language, such as Data Network Protocol (DNP). Besides transporting various data types, DNP also carries network and communications related messages between different processes. DNP packet format is also discussed in the later sections.","The lab server  may reside at the location of the physical process  to have direct local control of the physical process. The lab server  is the process that broadcasts data from the physical process  and well as control the physical process  based on requests from clients . The lab server  can be implemented as a multi-threaded software that implements communication functions across computer networks such as the internet . To provide universal and reliable communications, all data can be transported using standard connection based network protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP). Each connection (in this case between the lab server process , connection server process , and clients ) is commonly called socket that consists of a network or IP address and a port number. However, the data itself and other communication messages are encoded in a format called Data Network Protocol (DNP). In the OSI network model, DNP can be considered as an application layer protocol like HTTP and FTP. The unique design of DNP provides a common language between different processes that enables collaborative environments between multiple users across the internet.","DNP is designed to carry various types of digital data such as float, integer, Boolean, video and arrays of data. Data is encoded using DNP into one information entity called a packet that has two main sections: the overhead section  and instruction section . Directing attention to , the DNP packet format is illustrated. The overhead section  may contain the following fixed-size fields:\n\n","The instruction section  may contain a number of instructions. Each instruction can be a specific command or request that contains the following fields.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["112","118","456"]},"Two main functions may be performed by the lab server: broadcast data from the physical processes ; and perform clients' requests and general associated responses. To keep clients  up to date with the current states of the physical processes , the lab server  can broadcast information that is directly collected from the physical processes . Data from the physical processes  that are encoded in the DNP packet are transmitted to connections server  for distribution. The connections server can then look at the overhead section of the transmitted DNP packet and forward the packet to appropriate destinations. Details on the routing algorithm in the connections server are discussed below.","Sensors, detectors and other measurement instruments detect and\/or measure various physical phenomena (i.e. electric fields, electromagnetic radiation, temperature, pressure, etc.), and send this information to the lab server . The lab server  that has established network connection to the connections server  can then put the received information or its computed analysis into the instruction section of the DNP packet. This process can be repeated if more than one instruction is needed to be sent. Once all the instructions have been written in the instruction section of the DNP packet, the corresponding overhead sections can also be constructed. Once the DNP packet is complete, it can then be sent to the connections server .","Directing attention to , the lab server  can broadcast the raw data from physical processes  for calculating results based on computational analysis of the raw data. In some cases, data from the physical process  are analyzed for the purposes of scientific visualization, statistical analysis or data compression. For example, raw video data from the physical process are analyzed for both spatial and temporal redundancy. After performing a compression algorithm, the compressed format of the video data is written to the instruction section of the DNP packet. Video compression that is suitable for this application is described below. For the clients to receive a continuous update of information the entire process in  can be repeated on a periodic basis. The repetition period of this process can be adjusted according to a particular application. At step  the lab server  gets data from the physical process . Control may proceed to optional step , where the lab server  performs computational analysis. Control proceeds to step  where a look-up data type table is constructed. Control proceeds to step  where data is written in the instruction sections of the DNP packet. This may be part of an iterative loop where control returns to step . Control may also proceed from step  to step  where the DNP packet is written to the overhead section. Control continues to step  where the DNP packet is sent to the connections server .","Another function of the lab server  is to process clients' requests and generate associated responses. The lab server  can receive a DNP packet from the connections server  that contains the clients' requests for instructions. It is the responsibility of the lab server  to interpret these instructions, execute the commands and generate responses. This process is described in . Control begins at step  where the lab server  waits for the DNP packet to be received from the connections server . Proceeding to step , the overhead section of the DNP packet is read. Control continues to step , where one instruction in the instructions section of the DNP packet is read. Control proceeds to step , where the lab server  executes the request\/instruction by calling equipment\/instruction drivers. Control proceeds to step , where the lab server  writes response data in the instruction section of the DNP packet. From step , control may return to step  in an iterative loop according to the number of instructions; control may also proceed to step , where the DNP packet is written to the overhead section. Control proceeds to step , where a response DNP packet is sent to the connections server .","Execution of a client's requests may involve calling particular software drivers that send the commands to instruments via the associated computer interface such as GPIB, RS-232, USB, ethernet, etc. The request may also contain instructions for information management such as recording the client's request, storing collected values from instruments, and querying previously collected information. In the case of information management, the lab server  can interact directly with local or remote database servers through standard database drivers such as ODBC or JDCB.","Unlike the broadcasting functions that may continuously send DNP packets to clients, this function of the lab server  only generates responses when client requests are received. When the lab server  is implemented in a software program, this function may be run in a separate thread for parallel processing with other functions.","The connections server  can be run in the same computer where the lab server  resides. For additional reliability, in the preferred embodiment the connections server  may be executed in a separate computer. The connections server  may be implemented using object oriented, network-enable and multi-threaded software development environments such as JAVA or C++. Two of the main functions performed by the connections server  include: monitoring and maintaining reliable network connections with all active clients and lab servers; and routing DNP packets to appropriate destinations.","The connections server  maintains network connections with all the processes, namely: lab server , database server , and clients . A connection handler, which may be a class or object in object-oriented programming terminology, can perform readings from and writing to each of the connections. Each connection handler should be run in a separate thread for parallel processing. Once the connections server  accepts or establishes a connection, it can then pass the connection information (i.e. the socket information that contains remote post address and remote port number) to the connection handler for further processing. The connections server  maintains an array or table of connection handlers, namely the connection table, to perform and monitor network related processes. A connection monitor is another important process included in the connections server  that runs on a periodic basis. The connection monitor may be implemented as a subclass of the connections server  and may be executed in a separate thread. A function of the connection monitor is to monitor and control the network communications of the processes (i.e. clients  and lab server ) connected to the connections server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["550","552","554","120","110","552","556","554","558","560","556","560","112","562","564","112","112","112","110","112","110","112"]},"The connections server serves as the distributor of data that accepts, verifies and routs DNP packets to appropriate destinations. The connections server supports full duplex point-to-point and point-to-multipoints data transmissions based on the destination ID field of the DNP packet. As a result, both clients  and lab server  processes may synchronously receive events that are generated by any processes.  displays several routing modes that may be performed by the connections server.  is an example case of three clients and a lab server connected to the connections server. The maximum number of clients that may be served varies according to the available network bandwidth.","As discussed above, the connection handler is part of the connections server and may perform reading from and writing to each connection. The connections server  listens to any connection request, and passes the network information to the connection handler once a valid connection is established.  shows the flow diagram of the connection handler. Beginning at step , the connection handler receives network information from an accepted connection from the connections server. Control proceeds to step , where the connection handler checks to see if the connection is valid. If the connection is not valid (decision step ), control proceeds to step , where the connection handler closes the connection and control terminates. However, if the connection is valid, control proceeds to step , where the connection handler waits and listens for incoming DNP packets for a certain time-out period. From step , control proceeds to decision step . At decision step , if a DNP packet is received before the time-out, control proceeds to step , where the overhead section of the DNP packet is read. However, if a DNP packet is not received before the time-out, control returns to step . From step , control proceeds to step , where again the connection handler attempts to validate the connection. If the connection is not valid (decision step ), control returns to step . However, if the connection is valid, control proceeds to step , where the rest of the DNP packet is read according to its packet length. Control then proceeds to step , where connection handlers in the connection table are found based on the destination ID in the DNP overhead section. Control then proceeds to step , where all DNP packets are sent to all destinations via the connection handlers found in the connection table. From step  control returns to step . The operations described above are repeated until the connection is no longer valid.","Client processes provide a graphical user interface for the end users of the physical process . The clients may be implemented in any object-oriented and network-enabled software development environment such as C++ or JAVA. The client should contain graphical components that may be used for getting user inputs and\/or display information. Some of the components may include dials, graphs, switches, LED displays, buttons, etc.","The client process  may be executed from any computer that is connected to a TCP\/IP network such as the internet. When the client process is run, it will first attempt to establish network connections to the connections server . User requests\/commands that are received from the UI components are encoded into DNP packets to be sent to the connections server . The client  may also process DNP packets from other remote clients and lab servers  that are received via the connections server . This operation may also be executed in a separate thread for parallel processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["118","110","624","114","626","628","629","629","628"]},"The database server  manages a database containing information that is essential to the operation of other processes. The remote operation of the database server  can be facilitated using database application programming interface standards such as ODDC or JDDC. The database server  manages the following list of information: user information, user physical process data, scheduling information, and event data.","The database server  manages user profiles. A user profile contains user accessed information such as log-in name and password that enables the connections server  to verify connection requests from the clients . In addition, the user profile also includes the client's progress information by tracking the status of accomplished actions\/requests. Data from the physical processes  (i.e. sensor readings, states of equipment, etc.) may also be recorded on behalf of a client's request. This data be time stamped and may be made available to the user via an interactive \u201claboratory notebook\u201d user interface. Using a common gateway interface (CGI) or JAVA servlet program that may interact with the database server , clients may search and retrieve previously recorded physical process data. The search may be based on chronological order, keyword, or other characteristics of the recorded data. Scheduling information ensures that only the appropriate clients are given access to the physical processes  in a certain time period. Every event received by the lab server may also be automatically recorded. This data may be used to analyze clients' behavior and usage patterns in controlling the physical process . The interactive laboratory notebook may also contain lab parameters, \u201cto do\u201d lists, and personal notes.","The interactive laboratory notebook is part of a user interface that may be constructed using Interface Builder or similar software application, and may be accessed by users during the course of an experiment. The interactive laboratory notebook may be implemented to include a database stored on a hard disk or other nonvolatile memory of computer , as well as a user interface to access the database. Where the present invention is utilized for distance learning, the interactive laboratory notebook provides a central repository for information and is an essential tool for instructors to evaluate the progress and performance of students using the online laboratory.","The user interface may include animated switches, dials, buttons, and LED displays rather than traditional browser forms. Online graphing of the real time data along with other customized user interface components allows users to experience a hands-on look and feel. The user interface may closely resemble the front panels of the actual instruments in functionality, layout, and appearance. The live video stream may also be included in the user interface.","Real Time Video Observation","Observing physical processes in real time via the internet is a key feature of the present invention. Returning to , video camera  is used to acquire live images from a system that the user interacts with and whose actions affect the observed video. Video capture (or frame grabber) hardware  is used on a computer to capture images desired to be sent to the user with minimum latency. A video server computer  compresses new image data and forms packets to be transmitted to the user (client) through the computer network . The client, using a standard browser, is able to view the live video and interact with the system. In order to transmit video via the internet in real time, spatial and temporal compression is performed. In spatial compression, the acquired image from frame grabber  is represented as gray-scale or as a color image in terms of hue, saturation, and value (HSV). In both cases values are represented as integers. The image data is divided into square blocks (8\u00d78 pixels or 16\u00d716 pixels, for example). A two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (a standard mathematical operation often abbreviated as DCT) is performed on each block.","To perform temporal compression, the server  subtracts the ideal DCT data from the DCT data that the client currently holds. This difference in DCT data is the information that the client must receive in order to allow its video to be updated to the desired image. This compression uses a single new frame to calculate data to be sent. This sacrifices compression efficiency (i.e. that obtained using the MPEG4 standard) in order to minimize latency. An approximation to this difference is calculated which meets the requirements of the specified fixed packet size (specified in bits). By basing compression on a specified packet size, compressed video matches transmission limitations of the client . The data rate (PACKET_SIZE*PACKETS_PER_SECOND) that is used for a particular client is dynamically determined and updated as video is sent. This allows the quality of video that is sent to a client to vary according to the abilities of each client's internet connection. This also allows the data rate to vary in response to changes in a client's allowable data rate. By having the client intermittently inform the server of the times that it received transmitted packets, the latency and allowable data rate of the client may be calculated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["74","630","634","70","72","636","638","640","642","644","646","648","74","650","74","632"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["652","654","74","656","658","660","662","664","666","654","74"]},"The instructions described above as well as the user interface and interactive laboratory notebook may be implemented in software and stored in the computer  and executed in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.","While the description above explains the operation of a laser and optical equipment, it is to be understood that a wide variety of physical processes may be performed using the present invention, and other forms of data may be recorded such as time, temperature, voltage, current, magnetic field, electromagnetic radiation, and the like. Additional applications of the present invention may extend to entertainment, for example the remote control of toys in an interactive setting, where multiple users may access computer  via the computer network  and play games involving multiple users. The real time video taught by the present invention is an integral part of such an application.","In other applications of the present invention, computer  and camera  may be utilized as a sales or development tool to demonstrate equipment or processes to prospective clients, customers, or developers by providing a demonstration of the equipment or processes in real time and eliminating the expenditure of resources required to travel to a location where the equipment or processes are located.","In embodiments of the present invention where video recording is to be performed in accordance with the present invention, two types of equipment are needed to record audio and video signals transmitted from a programming source: a tuning device capable of tuning\/separating television channels among designated frequency bands, and a recording device capable of storing analog video\/audio signals on recording media such as magnetic tape, magnetic disks or optical disks. Many recording devices such as VCRs are equipped with built-in television tuners. In this case, the process of recording television programs can be accomplished by manipulating a single piece of equipment. For recording devices that do not have built-in television tuners, broadcast television signals must be processed by tuning a particular television channel and converting such channel into video and audio signals prior to recording. Referring to , the process of recording television programs can be accomplished by manipulating both television receiver  and recording device . Most television receivers are equipped with a built-in tuner, however in some cases a set-top box  such as a cable box or satellite receiver is used instead of a conventional tuner not only to tune television channels but also to decode paid programs such as premium channels, pay-per-view channels, etc. Programming is broadcast by a programming provider .","TV receiver , recording device  and set-top box  are often equipped with infrared sensors that allow remote control from infrared transmitting devices operated within effective distance. Most remote control units emit infrared signal with a certain modulation method and carrier frequency to transmit digital commands for operating such devices. The methods used to demodulate such infrared signals vary by manufacturer. Many equipment manufacturers use conventional digital modulation methods such as on-off shift keying, pulse length modulation, etc. with carrier frequencies ranging from 20-60 kHz. By using a diode detector, such signals can be learned and stored in a conventional memory. Video\/audio recording equipment is controlled by transmitting a sequence of stored commands using infrared emitting diode  in the remote control unit .  shows the preferred embodiment of remote control unit used in the present invention. The remote control unit  is connected to a computer  via standard I\/O connection  such as RS-232, USB, etc. Computer  is a conventional computer such as a workstation, desktop or laptop personal computer, or personal digital assistant (PDA), which includes a microprocessor and supporting circuitry, memory, and communications circuitry. Remote control unit  includes a microprocessor  and circuitry to control infrared diode  to emit infrared commands that are stored in memory . The microprocessor can control the transmission of such commands to emulate a particular sequence of commands to record TV programs that is conventionally performed by users operating the recording equipment . Using the computer connection , the microprocessor  also executes the process of downloading information pertaining to user selections to be recorded. Such information may include start time, end time and channel number of selected television programs can be stored in memory . Furthermore, the remote control unit may contain an internal clock . Microprocessor  can monitor and check the selected television programs stored in memory  with the clock  to start and stop the recording process.","In an alternative embodiment of the remote control unit , the clock  and\/or memory  can be excluded. In this case, the transmission of infrared signal from remote control unit  is controlled using microprocessor, memory and clock of computer . In this alternative embodiment the remote control unit  and computer  stay connected during the process of recording television programs.","In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, means for controlling the recording device  and accessing an online-based application service provider  can be built internal to the recording device . In this case, recording device  incorporates microprocessor , memory , clock , modem  and client software  can be controlled through electronics means without any external device such as the remote control unit and computer.","Computer  can include an application program such as Client Software  executed by computer  to receive user-selected TV scheduling information from the Application Service Provider  and transmit such information to remote control unit . As shown in , Computer  is connected to a computer network  such as a wide area network or public, global network such as the Internet. Computer  also includes a modem or network interface unit to facilitate communication via network . During start-up, Client Software  establishes an IP (Internet Protocol) based network connection to Control Server  located at the Application Service Provider  site. It is recommended that Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used to implement such a network connection due to its reliability and connection-based properties. During initialization of the network connection, Client Software  also transmits authentication information such as user id and\/or password to allow Control Server  to identify and verify the designated user account stored in database . Once Control Server  has authenticated and verified the connection request, it checks the user account in database  for the selected TV programs to be transmitted to Client Software . Control server  may indicate the state of network connection to Client Software  or record the status in database . Information Server  can receive new television information updates over the Internet. Information Server  searches database  to find an appropriate Control Server  that maintains a valid connection with a Client Software , and instructs Control Server  to transmit such information to Client Software . After the initialization of the network connection, Client Software  waits for information updates of user selections transmitted by Control Server . Whenever the information updates are received from Control Server , Client Software  transmits such information to remote control unit  to be stored in the memory . Once the selected television programs are stored in the memory  of remote control unit , the microprocessor  then compares the selected television programs with clock  to start and stop the recording process. A certain time delay may also be added before the start of the recording to skip preliminary section of the program. By connecting remote control unit  with a computer  that executes Client Software , audio\/video recording equipment can be operated from a wide area network such as the Internet.","In the case where there is no line of sight between the remote control unit and the recording equipment, such as the case where computer  and remote control device  are located in different rooms, communication between remote control unit  and computer  can be performed using radio frequency (RF) transmitter  and receiver , as shown in .","Commands in the form of digital information can be encoded and modulated using RF frequency, which in turn is received an decoded by an RF receiver to be passed to remote control unit  for controlling the audio\/video recording equipment. A physical connection between the controlling computer (Computer ) to either remote control unit  () or RF transmitter () may be facilitated using a standard computer I\/O connection such as RS-232, USB, and the like.","Internet-Based Service Model","The goals of the service model of the present system are to simplify the process of recording TV programs using existing audio\/video recording equipment through an Internet-based user interface. Using standard web browser programs such as Netscape Navigator\u00ae or Microsoft Internet Explorer\u00ae, users can browse, search and select television programs to be recorded. In turn, the system will automatically obtain information about the selected television programs (such as start times, end times and channel numbers), and send such information to the remote control unit  that operates the audio\/video recording equipment.","Another goal of the service model of the present invention is to provide global access to audio\/video equipment. Users can operate audio\/video equipment from virtually anywhere through the Internet.","Yet another goal of the service model is to guide users in selecting TV programs by providing suggestions based on analysis of user preferences and viewing history.","In the preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in , a user operates Computer  to access the Internet-based Application Service Provider . Computer  is a device that has a central processing unit, memory and communication means to access a wide area network such as the Internet. Computer  can be in the form of desktop, lap top or palm top devices that have the appropriate web browser software  installed in their memories. For widest access and compatibility, it is recommended that both Computer  and Information Server  use a standard and widely adopted network protocol such as TCP\/IP. In the preferred embodiment, the HTTP protocol is chosen to facilitate network communications between Computer  and Information Server . In the preferred embodiment, Information Server  is an HTTP compliant server and Computer  is a conventional computer with a standard web-browser software such as Netscape Navigator\u00ae or Microsoft Internet Explorer\u00ae. Although Computer  and Computer  are two separate computers , as shown in , it is important to realize that the two functions served by Computers , can be accomplished by a single computer having the same components as both Computers ,. The embodiment in  highlights the features in which the recording equipment can be globally accessed and controlled over the Internet.","Database  is connected to Information Server , facilitated by workstation or Local Area Network at the Application Service Provider  site. Database  may serve as a data center to manage information regarding user accounts, television schedule information, and operation of the system. New users are required to register with the Application Service Provider . Using HTML forms, a user from Computer  can submit registration data to be processed by Information Server . Information provided by the user for proper operation of recording equipment includes the authentication information, equipment and connectivity identification, and programming source. Other information about the user such as email, telephone and\/or fax may also be stored in the user account, hence the user may receive information such as selected television programs, reminders and other information regarding television program recordings via email, telephone and\/or fax.","Upon receiving the above registration information from a user, Information Server  stores the registration information in database  on behalf of the user in her\/his individual user account. Once the registration process is complete, the user then selects television programs to be recorded. Information Server  serves HTML pages containing textual and graphical information regarding TV programming schedules stored in database . To serve the HTML-pages, Information Server  executes computer programs in the forms of Java Servlet or Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to search database  and display television programming schedules. A user can view and select television programming schedules that are displayed based on her\/his preferences such as: viewing dates, topics, actors, shown genres, review, etc. Information Server  formats the retrieved television information into HTML pages that allow users to select TV programs to be recorded. The television schedule information may be displayed in spreadsheet forms having the axes time versus channels. For devices that only have a single television tuner, a spreadsheet user interface may be used in the following applications.","Whenever a user select a valid or non-conflicting television program, the interface disables the selection options for all conflicting television programs that are broadcast during the same time period. This method forces the user to deselect the current selection in order to select another program in the same scheduled time period. Whenever a user select a television program, the interface deselects all selected television programs that have conflicting viewing schedules.","Once the user submits his\/her television program selections to Information Sever , the information is stored in her\/his account in database . Also stored in his\/her account is information regarding the status of network connection between Client Software  and Control Server . Whenever a Client Software  establishes or terminates network connection with Control Server , the events are noted in the user account to track the status of the network connection. Upon receiving the user selections, Information Sever  accesses the user-account to check whether a valid network connection has been established between Client Software  and Control Server . If a valid connection is found, Information Server  notifies the appropriate Control Server  via Local Area Network that new user selections have been received and stored in database  on behalf of the user. Upon receiving the notification from Information Server , Control Server  may also access database  via Local Area Network to retrieve user-selected television information that has not been transmitted to Client Software . Control Server  then formats the retrieved information and transmits it to Client Software . Upon receiving the user selections, Client Software  sends them to remote control unit  and updates the television recording schedule information in memory . Once the user selections are stored in memory  of remote control unit , microprocessor  can then compare the selected television programs with clock  to start and stop the recording process.","In the preferred embodiment, Control Server  is an application program executed in a conventional computer that is capable of establishing network communications with other computers using standard network protocol such as the Internet Protocol (IP). Client Software  executed in Computer  as shown in  can establish a persistent network connection with Control Server  through TCP-IP protocol. Control Server  is connected to database  to retrieve user-selected TV program scheduling information. In the proposed system, there are at least two ways for Control Server  to initiate the process of retrieving from database  the user-selected television program information and sending the information to Client Software .","Initiation may be based on notification from the Information Server . When Information Server  obtains user-specified television scheduling information to be recorded, it notifies the Control Server . In turn, if network communication has been established between the Control Server  and Client Software , the Control Server  retrieves the user selections and sends them to the Client Software .","Alternatively, initiation may be based on notification from Client Software . The Client Software  notifies the Control Server  to transmit user selections for recording. This notification would normally be sent when the Client Software  initially establishes network connection with the Control Server . The Control Server  then retrieves user selections and sends them to Client Software .","Information indicating user selections is stored in the database . Such information can convey user preferences, useful in providing targeted advertising, rating of television programs, providing television program guides, suggestions, etc.","Directing attention to , in an alternative embodiment, service provider  can maintain recording equipment at various physical locations -, -, . . . -, where n can be any number. Users can contact the service provider 's website and select programs for recording at the various physical locations . Operating the recording equipment at the locations  as explained above, the service provider can provide localized recordings to its users, either by transmitting audio and video over the computer network  to computers ,, or sending the user a copy of the recording on a portable storage medium such as optical or magnetic storage.","While an apparatus, method, and service model for the remote control of recording devices via a computer network have been described in preferred embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that many modifications maybe made thereto without changing the scope of the claims that follow. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the invention in any way be limited by the above description, but instead be determined by reference to the claims that follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The forgoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent in the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"112"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A-8F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 17"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
