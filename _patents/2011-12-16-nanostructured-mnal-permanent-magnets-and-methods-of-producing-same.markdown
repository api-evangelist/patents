No. 12\/089,876 or PCT Application No. PCT\/US06\/417 90, filed on Oct. 27, 2006, which claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60\/730,697, filed Oct. 27, 2005, which is incorporated by reference herein. This application is also a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/164,495, filed Jun. 20, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under contract number 60NANB2D0120 awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The government has certain rights in the invention.","Magnets may be broadly categorized as temporary or permanent. Temporary (soft) magnets become magnetized or demagnetized as a direct result of the presence or absence of an externally applied magnetic field. Temporary magnets are used, for example, to generate electricity and convert electrical energy into mechanical energy in motors and actuators. Permanent (hard) magnets remain magnetized when they are removed from an external field. Permanent magnets are used in a wide variety of devices including motors, magnetically levitated trains, MRI instruments, and data storage media for computerized devices.","High-performance permanent magnets, such as Sm\u2014Co (coercivity H=10-20 kOe) and Nd\u2014Fe\u2014B (H=9-17.5 kOe), are generally intermetallic alloys made from rare earth elements and transition metals, such as cobalt. However, the high cost of rare earth elements and cobalt makes the widespread use of high-performance magnets commercially impractical. Less expensive magnets are more commonly used, but these magnets generally have lower coercivity H, i.e., their internal magnetization is more susceptible to alteration by nearby fields. For example, ferrites, which are predominantly iron oxides, are the cheapest and most popular magnets, but they have both low coercivities or coercive forces ranging from 1.6 to 3.4 kOe and low values of magnetization. Similarly, aluminum-nickel-cobalt (\u201cAlnico\u201d) alloys which contain large amounts of nickel, cobalt, and iron, and small amounts of aluminum, copper, and titanium, have coercivity in the range of 0.6 to 1.4 kOe, which makes exposure to significant demagnetizing fields undesirable.","More recently, Mn\u2014Al\u2014C alloys have been produced by mechanical alloying processes. D. C. Crew, P. G. McCormick and R. Street, 32(3), p. 315, (1995) and T. Saito, 93(10), p. 8686, (2003) have shown that adding small amounts of carbon (e.g., about 2 atomic % or less) to certain Mn\u2014Al alloys stabilizes the metastable \u03c4 phase and improves magnetic properties and ductility. Crew et al. (1995) produced MnAlweight % and MnAlCweight % alloys by consolidating ball milled powders, annealing at 1050\u00b0 C. and then quenching, after which the materials were no longer nanocrystalline. The resulting alloys had grain sizes of about 300-500 nm and exhibited coercivities, H, of 1.4 kOe and 3.4 kOe, respectively. Saito (2003), produced mechanically alloyed MnAlweight % and MnAlCweight % alloys that had grain sizes of about 40-60 nm and coercivities of 250 Oe and 3.3 kOe, respectively. In this study, the low coercivities reflected the limited formation of the magnetic \u03c4 phase, which was determined to be 10% in MnAland 40% in MAlC. K. Kim, K. Sumiyama and K. Suzuki, 217, p. 48, (1995), produced MnAl alloys that were ball milled, but never annealed. The alloys displayed no hard magnetic properties, with a low Hof 130 Oe. These Mn\u2014Al alloys are made from relatively inexpensive materials, but the low coercivities remain a problem.","The subject matter of the present disclosure advances the art and overcomes the problems outlined above by providing nanostructured Mn\u2014Al alloys and a method for their manufacture. Constituents of these alloys may be mechanically milled and heat-treated to form permanent room temperature magnets with high coercivities and relatively high saturation magnetization values.","In an embodiment, provided herein is an intermetallic composition including a ternary transition metal modified manganese aluminum alloy comprising at least about 80% of a magnetic \u03c4 phase and having permanent magnetic properties. Examples of the transition metals include, but are not limited to, iron, cobalt and nickel. In a particular embodiment, the manganese aluminum alloy has a macroscopic composition of MnAlT, where T is a ternary transition metal selected from a group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel, X ranges from 50 atomic % to 60 atomic %, X+Y+Z=100 atomic %, and Z is equal or less than 10%. The manganese aluminum alloy can have a macroscopic composition of MnAlT, wherein Y ranges from 36-46 atomic %, and Z ranges from 0-10 atomic %. In an embodiment, the alloy includes approximately 54 atomic % manganese, approximately 41 atomic % aluminum, and approximately 5 atomic % ternary transition metal. In another embodiment, the permanent magnetic properties includes a saturation magnetization value of at least 96 emu\/g. In still another embodiment, the alloy comprises approximately 54 atomic % manganese, approximately 36 atomic % aluminum, and approximately 10 atomic % ternary transition metal. The permanent magnetic properties can comprise a saturation magnetization value of at least 105 emu\/g.","In another embodiment, a nanostructured manganese aluminum alloy includes at least about 80% of a magnetic \u03c4 phase and having a macroscopic composition of MnAlT, where T is a ternary transition metal selected from a group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel, X ranges from 50 atomic % to 60 atomic %, X+Y+Z=100 atomic %, and Z is equal or less than 10%. In a particular embodiment, the manganese aluminum alloy has a macroscopic composition of MnAlT, where Y ranges from 36 atomic % to 46 atomic %, and Z ranges from 0 atomic % to 10 atomic %. The alloy can include approximately 54 atomic % manganese, approximately 41 atomic % aluminum, and approximately 5 atomic % ternary transition metal. The permanent magnetic properties can include a saturation magnetization value of at least about 96 emu\/g. The alloy can include approximately 54 atomic % manganese, approximately 36 atomic % aluminum, and approximately 10 atomic % ternary transition metal. The permanent magnetic properties can include a saturation magnetization value of at least about 105 emu\/g.","In an embodiment, a method of producing a ternary transition metal modified manganese aluminum alloy composition is provided. The method includes heating a mixture of Mn, Al and a ternary transition metal selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt, and nickel to provide a substantially homogeneous solution. The method also includes quenching the substantially homogeneous solution to obtain a substantially homogeneous solid and reheating the solid to a diffusion temperature below the melting temperature of manganese. The method can further include quenching the reheated solid, crushing the quenched solid, and milling the crushed solid. The method can also include annealing the milled solid such that the composition is produced. In a particular embodiment, the manganese aluminum alloy has a macroscopic composition of Mn54AlYTZ, Y ranges from 36-46 atomic %, and Z ranges from 0-10 atomic %. The mixture of metals includes approximately 54 atomic % manganese, 41 atomic % aluminum, and 5 atomic % ternary transition metal. The mixture of metals includes approximately 54 atomic % manganese, 36 atomic % aluminum, and 10 atomic % ternary transition metal. The step of reheating includes reheating the solid to a temperature of 1150\u00b0 C. for about 20 hours. The step of annealing includes annealing the milled solid at a temperature ranging from 350\u00b0 C. to 600\u00b0 C. for approximately 10-30 minutes. The ternary transition metal modified manganese aluminum alloy comprises MnAlT, T is the ternary transition metal, X ranges from 50 atomic % to 60 atomic %, X+Y+Z=100 atomic %, and Z is equal or less than 10%.","Additional embodiments and features are set forth in the description that follows, and will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the specification or may be learned by the practice of the invention. A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification.","Methods for producing mechanically milled, nanostructured Mn\u2014Al and Mn\u2014Al\u2014C alloys will now be shown and described. High room temperature coercivities and saturation magnetization values have been achieved for Mn\u2014Al alloys that are produced by the presently described methods, and it has been shown that the addition of small amounts of carbon (e.g., about 3 atomic % or less) to Mn\u2014Al alloys stabilizes the metastable \u03c4 phase and improves magnetic properties. It is also shown that a small amount of ternary transition metal, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), can be added to the metastable \u03c4-MnAl phase to replace a portion of Al to form an alloy with the macroscopic composition of MnAlT. Such a method increases saturation magnetization of the metastable \u03c4-MnAl phase.","The benefits of the nanostructured Mn\u2014Al and Mn\u2014Al\u2014C permanent magnets include high coercivities (about 4.8 kOe and 5.2 kOe, respectively) and high saturation magnetization values. The benefits of the magnets also include relatively low cost and readily available raw material supplies compared to rare earth magnets.","Mechanically milled Mn\u2014Al alloys possessing a nanostructured ferromagnetic \u03c4 phase, with H=4.8 kOe and M=87 emu\/g at room temperature, were obtained by annealing MnAlpowders at 400\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. The coercivity value of this alloy is the highest ever reported for Mn\u2014Al materials. The amount of magnetic \u03c4 phase present in the annealed product is estimated from the saturation magnetization (Mof pure \u03c4 phase is about 110 emu\/g) to be about 80%. In another embodiment, a Mn\u2014Al\u2014C alloy, MnAlC, prepared by the same method displayed a coercivity that is the highest ever reported for Mn\u2014Al\u2014C materials, H=5.2 kOe.","The macroscopic formulas presented herein, e.g., MnAl, pertain to the overall composition, but the materials have nanostructure or microstructure of localized phase variation (e.g., \u03b3, \u03b2, and\/or \u03c4 phases). As used herein, a \u201cnanostructured\u201d material is a bulk solid characterized by localized variation in composition and\/or structure such that the localized variation contributes to the overall properties of the bulk material.","The large coercive forces observed are believed to result from small grains of the magnetic \u03c4 phase (about 30 nm) being magnetically isolated from one another. This lack of magnetic exchange coupling may result from non-magnetic phases (e.g., \u03b2, \u03b3) inhibiting changes in the alloy's internal magnetization when an external magnetic field is applied (i.e., the non-magnetic phase(s) act as magnetic domain wall pinning sites).","The alloys disclosed herein are resistant to corrosion and may, for example, be used in applications currently utilizing known permanent magnets. In one embodiment, small particles or powders of the alloys may be produced in a resin or plastic bonded form according to known methods. The small grain size of the alloys may provide improved ductility relative to materials with larger grains.","To increase saturation magnetization of the metastable \u03c4-MnAl phase, a small amount of ternary transition metal, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), is added to the metastable \u03c4-MnAl phase to replace Al with the ternary transition metal to form the alloy with a macroscopic composition of MnAlT, where T is a ternary transition metal selected from a group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel, X ranges from 50 atomic % to 60 atomic %, X+Y+Z=100 atomic %, Z is equal or less than 10%.","In one embodiment, the manganese aluminum alloy has a macroscopic composition of MnAlT, Y ranges from 36-46 atomic %, and Z ranges from 0-10 atomic %. For example, based upon available phase diagrams, up to 5 atomic % of Fe, Co or Ni can be dissolved in the \u03b5 phase of MnAl. In a particular embodiment, 5 atomic % Al in metastable \u03c4-MnAl phase may be replaced by Fe, Co, or Ni to occupy the Al sublattice, which will increase the saturation magnetization Mby at least 10% for MnAlFe, MnAlCo, or MnAlNifor MnAl. For example, the saturation magnetization may be increased to at least about 96 emu\/g from 87 emu\/g for MnAlThe reason for this increase in Mis that the ternary transition metals Fe, Co, and Ni are magnetic while Al is non-magnetic.","In another embodiment, more Al may be replaced by a ternary transition metal such as Fe, Co, or Ni while still retaining the metastable \u03c4 phase, which would result further increase in M. About 10 atomic % Al may be replaced by Fe, Co, or Ni, which results in at least 20% increase in M. For example, the saturation magnetization may be increased to at least about 105 emu\/g from 87 emu\/g for MnAl.","The limit of solubility of Fe, Co or Ni in the metastable \u03c4-MnAl may depend upon difference of the atomic sizes of Fe, Co and Ni from Al, as Al has a smaller atomic number than Fe, Co or Ni so that it has a smaller atomic size than Fe, Co and Ni. Because Fe, Co and Ni have very close atomic numbers which are 26, 27 and 28, their solubility is expected to be similar.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","102","104","106","108","110","112","114"],"sub":["X","Y","Z"]},"In the case of the metal alloy MnAlT, the alloy may be provided in the form of ingots, powders, ribbons, pellets or the like, and may be heated to melt manganese and aluminum, but the transition metal T (e.g. Fe, Co, or Ni) may still be in solid form. Then, the liquid solution including melted manganese and aluminum and transition metal in solid form is quenched to form a solid solution.","Production of MnAl","MnAlalloy ingots were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometrically balanced quantities of Mn and Al in a water-cooled copper mold (T\u22481250-1350\u00b0 C.). The melted metallic solution was then heated until molten. Quenching was performed by allowing the alloy to rapidly cool in the copper mold to a temperature of about 30\u00b0 C. in approximately 10 minutes. The ingots were flipped and melted a minimum of three times under argon to ensure mixing. The ingots were subsequently heated to and held at 1150\u00b0 C. for 20 hours followed by water quenching to retain the \u03b5 phase. The ingots were then crushed and milled for eight hours in a hardened steel vial using a SPEX 8000 mill containing hardened steels balls with a ball-to-charge weight ratio of 10:1. The vials were sealed under argon to limit oxidation. Both the as-milled powders and the quenched bulk samples were annealed at temperatures from 350-600\u00b0 C. for 10-30 minutes to produce the ferromagnetic \u03c4 phase.","The magnetic properties were measured at a room temperature of about 20\u00b0 C. using a LakeShore 7300 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) under an external magnetic induction field of 15 kOe. Some samples were also measured with an Oxford superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer under a field of 50 kOe. Accuracy of the magnetic measurements is within \u00b12%.

Dopants other than carbon may include boron and the rare earth metals. Generally, it can be noted that because the \u03c4 phase is the only ferromagnetic phase in the Mn\u2014Al or Mn\u2014Al\u2014C systems, the saturation magnetization is proportional to the percentage of the \u03c4 phase in the alloys. When the Mn content is 50 atomic percent or less, little \u03b5 phase can be developed, and therefore only a small amount of \u03c4 phase can be produced. Also, when the Mn content is high, excess Mn is used to stabilize the metastable \u03c4 phase. In this case, some Mn atoms occupy lattice sites where they are coupled antiferromagnetically to other nearby Mn atoms, thereby reducing the magnetization. Thus, the Mn content is preferably between 52 and 58 atomic percent and the alloys may be described according to Formula (1);\n\n","MnAlTalloy ingots are prepared by arc-melting Mn and Al in a water-cooled copper mold (T\u22481250-1350\u00b0 C.).
