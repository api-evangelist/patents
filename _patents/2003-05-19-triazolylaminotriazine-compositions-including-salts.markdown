No. 6,423,844, issued Jul. 23, 2002.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to novel salt forms of fused ring structures useful for providing a platform for novel explosive and pyrotechnic compounds, particularly high nitrogen content, low carbon content energetic compounds, dyes, pharmaceutical and other compositions. The present invention includes triazolyl aminotriazine salts, as triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine salts, and other such chemical structures as detailed herein.","2. Brief Description of the Related Art","Development of specialized chemical compounds requires proper precursor chemical structures. Current methods that purport to synthesize 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine all involve heating dicyandiamide and hydrazine dihydrochloride at elevated temperatures (100\u00b0 C. or higher) for significant amounts of time in order to condense the dicyandiamide. This method was described by Kaiser et al. in a paper published in the journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 18, 1953, page 1610.","Using this synthesis method theoretically provides for two possible isomeric structures of triazolotriazinetriamine (see I and II below). The first structure is the [4,3-a]triazolotriazinetriamine, pictured below as I. The second structure is the [1,5-a]triazolotriazinetriamine, pictured below as II. The product by Kaiser et al., resulting from the method above, was assigned the structure of I based upon degradation\/oxidation studies of the product. However, these types of studies provide for a large degree of uncertainty as to structure. \n\n","Recently, product derived from the above process was tested using X-ray diffraction, an extremely reliable technique, and, rather than the expected product I as originally reported, it was found that the actual structure of the product was that of II. The commercial product based upon the above method, sold under the names 3,5,7-triamino-s-triazolo[4,3-a]-s-triazine or 3,5,7-triamino-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]-1,3,5-triazine, has also been tested via X-ray diffraction and found to be the structure of II. Because of the above error, prior to the present invention, there is, therefore, no known process of synthesizing product I. Additionally, patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 3,939,084 to Sullivan purport to use a 3,5,7-Triamino-s-trizazolo (4,3-a)-s-triazine, as well as articles such as \u201cNew Synthesis of Dyes of the Triazine\u201d, Series II. VAT Dyes of the Triazolo-Triazine Series by A. Titkov and I. D. Pletnev, Scientific Research Institute of Intermediates and Dyes, translated from Zhurnal Obshchel Khimil, Vol. 33, No. 4, pp. 1355-1357, April 1963 (see also Maeda et al. Japan Kokai 74 24,226 and 74 27,287), are apparent mislabelings of the 3,5,7-Triamino-s-triazolo (1,5-a)-s-triazine.","The effects of the structural difference between these two products on the chemical and physical properties are of interest in any application of monotriazolotriazine ring systems. Of particular interest for energetic uses of these products would be the energy release in detonation, which correlates to the density of the materials. An analysis of densities and potential energy releases of the products reveals that the product I has a higher potential energy release value than product II that is significant in defense related energetic systems. The product II has also been investigated for use in the dye industry as a chromophore coupled to anthraquinones and indoles, and, therefore, product I should have similar potential uses. Other aromatic structure systems also are of interest.","Due to the discovery that the chemical sold as product I is actually product II, and the chemical and physical properties of the two products are significant for many uses, it would be desirable to derive product 1, and like compounds, provide for synthesis such compounds, as well as developing compounds from processes using product I and like compounds as a precursor.","The present invention includes a novel salt form of a fused ring structure having the formula: \n\n\n","The present invention includes a process for making a 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-substituted compound, acid salt, particularly 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine, acid salt and a process for neutralizing the acid salt to make a 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-substituted compound, particularly 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine, as well as the product of this process (the 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-substituted compound, including the 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine is referred to herein as the \u201cprecursor\u201d). Because of the reactive properties of the precursor, this precursor is useful in deriving compounds for ingredients in propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics, gas generators, ultraviolet absorbers, pharmaceuticals, colorants, etc. as later described.","The general process involves ring closure of a 2,4-substituted diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine with an acid and a chemical of the general formula RCN where the R comprises a leaving group, and then neutralizing said acid. Because the hydrazine nitrogen atoms that form the triazole ring are already in place on the 2,4-substituted-6-hydrazino-s-triazine, the final product formed is the desired [4,3-a]isomer, rather than the [1,5-a]isomer produced by the conventional dicyandiamide\/hydrazine dihydrochloride methods. The general formulas for the process are set forth below: \n\n\n","More specifically, first, the invention comprises a process for the preparation of 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-substituted compound, acid salt, with an amino group at the 3-position. In order to practice the present invention, one may first obtain or synthesize 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine. One method for synthesizing this chemical is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3,061,605 by D'Alelio. The general method is to effect a reaction between 2,4-diamino-6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine and hydrazine. A specific example is set forth in column 3, lines 60-70 of the above patent and are hereby incorporated by reference. While this particular method of synthesizing 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine is specifically disclosed, any prior art method of synthesis would be appropriate to practice the present invention.","The first step in the present invention comprises dissolving the 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine with an acid. This step is preferably carried out at room temperature with an acid that is of sufficient strength to dissolve the 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine. Many acids can be employed in the present invention, such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid or mixtures of these acids with other solvents such as methanol or ethanol, and may be selected by one skilled in the art. One preferred acid is 1N hydrochloric acid.","The second step comprises mixing the dissolved 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine with a reagent of the formula RCN, wherein R comprises a leaving group. This reaction will provide the amino triazole ring on the product directly. A leaving group, as used in this application, is a group that can be displaced to give ring closure; that is, produces the amino triazole ring. One preferred leaving group comprises bromine wherein the reagent comprises cyanogen bromide. Although the reaction in this step is acid catalyzed, preferred reaction times range from about twenty hours to about thirty hours in order to allow for the maximum formation of acid salt crystals. It is also preferred that the acid salt crystals be removed after the reaction is substantially complete, approximately thirty hours, to prohibit contamination of the final product with impurities. The crystals may be removed by any normal method, such as filtration, and can then be washed and dried in order to obtain the final acid salt product.","The present invention also comprises a process to take the 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine, acid salt synthesized above, and neutralize the acid salt crystals in order to obtain a final product of 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine. This process involves the steps described above as well as the following steps.","First, the acid salt crystals are removed from the solution synthesized above. Then, the acid salt crystals are neutralized by mixing them with a substance more basic than 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine. This step results in the removal of the acid from the above reaction and provides for a final product of 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine. The substance used in this final step may be selected by one skilled in the art based upon the basicity of the substance versus the basicity of 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine. Some examples are potassium carbonate, potassium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium hydroxide. One preferred substance is potassium carbonate. It is also preferred that the reaction take place in solution, so preferably, water or some other solvent may be added to the salt.","Due to the reactive nature of the \u2014NHfrom the five-member ring, derivatives of the precursor, particularly tri-cyclic fused compounds as described below, are useful in a wide range of fields, including for example, pharmaceuticals and treating compositions, such as topical lotions including without limitation sunscreen, creams and\/or therapeutic liquids, over-the-counter and\/or prescription drugs, parental drugs, injectable drugs, food supplements, agricultural compositions, such as without limitation herbicides, pesticides, fungicides and\/or fertilizers; ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers and ultraviolet absorbers, colorants such as dyes, pigments and other color applicants, such as without limitation paints, textile colorants and\/or indicators, including liquid crystal uses and other indicators for computer display screens, explosives, pyrotechnics and gas generators, such as for use in airbags and other like functions; and\/or fluids, such as functional fluids, additives and\/or stabilizers, for use in machinery and\/or other mechanical applications. The precursor may be used to anchor functional groups, such as benzophenones, benzotriazoles, substituted acrylonitriles and phenol-nickel complexes for ultraviolet absorbers, use of the precursor as an additive for a functional fluid (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,939,084 to Sullivan purporting to use a 3,5,7-Triamino-s-trizazolo (4,3-a)-s-triazine as an additive (col. 14, Ins. 60-61) in Table I; which is a mislabeled 3,5,7-Triamino-s-trizazolo (1,5-a)s-triazine), or chromogens as detailed below. For example, triazoles and\/or triazines are known in the fields of agriculture (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,075 to Benko et al., herbicides), pharmaceuticals (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,380,714 to Jones et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,091 to Jaehne et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,932 to Caulkett et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,300 to Bakthavatchalam et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,591 to Kobayashi et al.), colorants (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,758,309 and 3,725,067 to Bailey et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,236,003 to Fletcher, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,621,046 to Sato et al.), and agricultural chemicals, medicines, dyes, paints, and the like, as various resin materials, such as aminoplast molded materials and flame retarding materials (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,538 to Tanaka et al.; see col. 1, Ins. 26-30; see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,218 to Cipolli et al.).","The present invention includes a novel salt form of a fused ring structure having the formula: \n\n\n","As used herein, an \u201celectron donating group\u201d designates a group that will release or donate electrons more than hydrogen would if it occupied the same position in the molecule. See J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3Ed., John Wiley & Sons p. 238 (1985). These types of groups are well known in the art. Examples include lower alkylamino, di-loweralkylamino, amino, halo, aryl, lower alkoxy, lower aralkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, lower alkylthio, and the like, including for example, \u2014O, \u2014COO, \u2014OR, \u2014CR, \u2014OCOR, \u2014NR, SR, where R group is an alkyl group or H. The preferred electron donating groups are amino, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkylamino and di-loweralkylamino. The most preferred electron donating group is amino. Electron donating groups include atoms that can stabilize the developing positive charge in a ring closure by mesomeric effect, such as methoxy groups. Representative electron donating groups may include, without limitation, \u2014NH, \u2014OCH, \u2014NHCH, \u2014N(CH), \u2014NH(CHCH), \u2014N(CHCH), etc.","The present invention includes novel salt forms of triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compounds that are particularly useful in energetic materials, such as explosive, pyrotechnic and\/or gas generator compositions. These triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compounds have special applicability in demolitions, fireworks and airbag inflating compositions. For example, the fireworks compositions of the present invention are characterized as low-smoke compositions and can be formulated to be essentially smoke-free. Low smoke compositions have decreasing amounts of residual smoke after pyrotechnic burn that are operationally and commercially useful. The triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compounds, and their complexes and salts, provide a high-nitrogen content, low-carbon content energetic material as a principal component within the pyrotechnic composition.","The Z component of the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compound preferably comprises a cation. As a salt, the compound may be selected from a large number and\/or variety of cations as suitable for any particular pyrotechnic. Suitable cations of the present invention include those appropriate to provide color displays from combusting fireworks, particularly metals or amine salts. Metals of the present invention may include, without limitation sodium (Na), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), barium (Ba), strontium (Sr), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), magnesium (Mg), antimony (Sb) and the like. Additionally, typical amine salts may include compounds with Z being, without limitation, HNC(NH)NHCONH, C(NHNH), NHNH, NH, HNNHC(NH)NH, (HNNH)C(NH), C(NH), (HONH), and bis(1(2)H-tetrazol-5-yl)-amine (CHN), the monohydrate of bis(1(2)H-tetrazol-5-yl)amine (CHN.H0). Ignition or combustion of Z of the present invention preferably results in a color, however, additional salts and other compositions may be added in combination with the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compounds to form the pyrotechnic compositions, as later described. Use of the metal salts of the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compounds as colorants within the pyrotechnic compositions may generally include the metals conventionally used in pyrotechnic compositions. For example, strontium, barium, copper, and iron salts of triazolo-tetrazino-aminotriazine compounds, and salts thereof, can be expected to yield red, blue, green, yellow, purple, red-purple, and blue-green colorants.","The following structures exemplify non-limiting examples of possible salts for use in the pyrotechnic compositions of the present invention: \n\n\n\n","The triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compound is diazotized from the triazolyl-triaminotriazine precursor, as taught herein, to form the appropriate salt. Diazotization occurs by reacting the triazolyl-triaminotriazine precursor with a diazotization agent, for example nitrite salts, organic nitrites, and the like, such as, without limitation, nitric oxide, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite and the like, with diazotizing agent known to those skilled in the art. The triazolyl-triaminotriazine precursor(s), including the acid salts thereof, are diazotized in an appropriate aqueous acid, such as for example hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, with the nitrite salt to give the ring-closed tetrazine product of the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compound. The use of sodium nitrite (Z\u2550Na) to form the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compound is preferred. This reaction is represented below and in Examples 2 and 3. The triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compound (Z\u2550Na) can be acidified to produce the parent acid of the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compound (i.e., Z\u2550H). Other triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine compounds may be formed by neutralization of the parent acid or by cation exchange reactions with the sodium salt. \n\n","The preparation of triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine salts by neutralization of the parent acid (Method A) occurs by reaction with amine bases or by reaction with metal hydroxides.","Cation exchange with the sodium salt to form the triazolyl-tetrazinyl-aminotriazine salts (Method B) occurs by the process that includes an aqueous solution of the sodium salt being mixed with a solution of barium nitrate, strontium nitrate, calcium nitrate, or other.","Other six and seven membered rings are potentially available using precursors provided in this invention. For example, the precursor, 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine, contains amino groups in positions [on the triazole and the triazine ring] such that these two amino groups can potentially be cyclized with a number of reagents to form new six and seven membered ring structures. Potential reagents useful for making six membered ring structures, include for example without limitation, XCOX, XCSX, wherein X is a leaving group such as Cl, imidazole, etc., RCHO, RRCO, RCN, RC(OCH)and the like. The six membered ring structures from these examples of reagents typically would have Rabsent and a substituted carbon atom at R; typically Z would also be absent and the fused ring would have no charge, i.e., t=0 (see fused ring general formula). Potential reagents useful for making seven membered ring structures, include for example without limitation, ClCOCHCl, HCOCHCl, XCHCHX wherein X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I or tosyl (OTs-toluene sulfonyls), etc., HCOCOH, NCCN, ClCHCN, and the like. A reagent such as NCCN could produce a seven membered ring with a carbon atom bearing an amine (NH) sustituent at both Rand R. This diamine could be neutralized to form a diacid salt, with the dipositively charged fused ring having \u2212t=2 or t=\u22122 (see fused ring structure of the present invention).","The precursor comprises a 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine, acid salt or its neutralized form of 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine. The general process involves ring closure of 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine with an acid and a chemical of the general formula RCN where the R comprises a leaving group, and then neutralizing the acid. \n\n","The structure of the precursor is shown below: \n\n","More specifically, the 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,3,5]triazine-3,5,7-triamine, acid salt is derived first by obtaining or synthesizing 2,4-diamino-6-hydrazino-s-triazine. One method for synthesizing this chemical is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3,061,605 by D'Alelio. The general method is to effect a reaction between 2,4-diamino-6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine and hydrazine.
