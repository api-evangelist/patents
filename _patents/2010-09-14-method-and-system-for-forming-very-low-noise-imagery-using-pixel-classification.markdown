No. 12\/331,888, filed on Dec. 10, 2008, which is incorporated by reference herein, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,796,829.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates broadly to signal processing and in particular to methods and systems for the enhancing and\/or processing images.","Appendix A contains a partial computer program listing adapted for a preferred embodiment of the present invention.","The present invention relates to the generation of images from projection measurements. Examples of images generated from projection measurements include two-dimensional and three-dimensional SAR (synthetic aperture radar) systems. SAR is a form of radar in which the large, highly-directional rotating antenna used by conventional radar is replaced with many low-directivity small stationary antennas scattered over some area near or around the target area. The many echo waveforms received at the different antenna positions are post-processed to resolve the target. SAR can be implemented by moving one or more antennas over relatively immobile targets, by placing multiple stationary antennas over a relatively large area, or combinations thereof. A further example of images generated from projection measurements are ISAR (inverse SAR) systems, which image objects and many features on the ground from satellites, aircraft, vehicles or any other moving platform. SAR and ISAR systems are used in detecting, locating and sometimes identifying ships, ground vehicles, mines, buried pipes, roadway faults, tunnels, leaking buried pipes, etc., as well as discovering and measuring geological features, forest features, mining volumes, etc., and general mapping. For example, as shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,098 to McCorkle, hereby incorporated by reference, an aircraft mounted detector array is utilized to take ground radar measurements. Other examples of systems using projection measurements are fault inspection systems using acoustic imaging, submarine sonar for imaging underwater objects, seismic imaging system for tunnel detection, oil exploration, geological surveys, etc., and medical diagnostic tools such as sonograms, echocardiograms, x-ray CAT (computer-aided tomography) equipment and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) equipment.","Systems which produce images from projection data generally use techniques in the time domain, where a backprojection-type algorithm is used, or frequency domain, where Fourier transforms are used. Since a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique, such as a technique known as the \u201c\u03c9\u2212k\u201d implementation, requires data to be equally spaced, FFT-based techniques produce sub-optimal images when the data source is moving uncontrollably, such as an aircraft buffeted by winds or vehicles in rough terrain. Non-uniform spacing requires a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which increases computation expense relative to a backprojector technique. Also, two-dimensional FFT's are not well suited to multiprocessor-based supercomputers because they face a corner-turn interprocessor communication bottleneck.","While there are many forms of Fourier-based algorithms for SAR processing, they fall into two broad classes known as \u201cstrip-map\u201d mode and \u201cspot light\u201d mode. The most robust technique is the \u03c9\u2212k technique, also known as seismic migration. The advantage of the \u03c9\u2212k algorithm over the backprojection algorithm is speed. The \u03c9\u2212k algorithm is an order Nlog(N) implementation\u2014much faster than Nfor large images and data sets.","Time domain backprojection-based techniques have been used for numerous applications, including x-ray CAT scans, MRI and sonograms. Historically, medical people have preferred backprojection because its artifact levels were lower than those using fast Fourier transform (FFT) approaches. Efforts in the past to speed up the backprojection process have focused on fast index generation. The algorithm form used by the medical industry (e.g., Star Computers) for x-ray CAT scans requires approximately 2Nadds to form an N by N image from N projections\u2014Nadds for indexing operations, and Nadds for accumulating the projections into the image. Seismologists and people using SAR have also used backprojection.","Synthetic aperture radar systems have been used in applications such as area mapping, surveillance, and target detection. The radar is usually mounted on an aircraft or a vehicle configured with transmitting and receiving antennas to transmit and measure the reflected radar signals from areas of interest. Through signal processing, the reflected radar signals along the flight path are combined to form the SAR imaging for side looking or forward looking surveillance.","SAR imaging is complex for a variety of reasons. First, the data is not inputted at equally distant (or known) points. Instead, data may be inputted in a non-uniform manner from an aircraft that is buffeted by the wind or from a ground vehicle that traverses rough ground. Therefore, motion compensation must be introduced in order to produce sharp images. Second, the subject objects need not be point sources but may be dispersive\u2014where energy is stored and \u201cre-radiated\u201d over time. Ground penetrating SAR adds the complication that the media propagation velocity varies which complicates seismic processing. For many SAR applications, especially for high-resolution, ultra-wide-angle (UWA), ultra-wide-bandwidth (UWB) surveillance systems, the task is particularly problematic because the data sets are large, real-time operation is essential, and the aperture geometry is not controlled. For example, small aircraft buffeted by the wind can affect SAR data due to significant off-track motion and velocity changes. As a result, the data is not sampled at equally spaced intervals.","Backprojection techniques provide many advantages; including sharper images. Although prior art backprojector implementations may generate image artifacts; they are constrained to be local to the object generating the artifacts and generally lie within the theoretical sidelobes. Side lobes are the lobes of the radiation pattern that are not the main beam or lobe. In an antenna radiation pattern or beam pattern, the power density in the side lobes is generally much less than that in the main beam. It is generally desirable to minimize the sidelobe level (SLL), commonly measured in decibels relative to the peak of the main beam. The concepts of main and side lobes apply to (but are not limited to) for example, radar and optics (two specific applications of electromagnetics) and sonar. The present invention is directed to techniques which minimize the effects of theoretical sidelobes in order to provide enhanced images.","Backprojector techniques also allow for non-uniform spacing of the projection data. The non-uniform spacing is directly accounted for in the index generation, which is important when compensating for aircraft motion.","Conventional time domain image formation, or backprojection, from SAR data, is accomplished by coherently summing the sampled radar returns for each pixel. In this context, coherent summation can be thought of as time-shifting the signal obtained at each aperture position (to align them to a particular pixel) and adding across all aperture positions to integrate the value at that pixel. This time-align-and-sum sequence is repeated for every pixel in the image.","A method and system for forming images by backprojection is explained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,098 to McCorkle, hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. Specifically, FIG. 2 of the 1998 patent illustrates antennas at positions  along axis  in an array that observe pixels  in the near field of the array. A relative position of each pixel (q,r) with respect to each antenna position j defines a vector . For each pixel (q,r), the disclosed process time-shifts the signals obtained at each aperture position j (to align, or stack, them at a particular pixel location) to correct the signals for propagation time along each vector  and then adds across all aperture positions to integrate to the value at the pixel. Thus, signals propagating from that location are in-phase and reinforced, while signals propagating from other locations are not in phase and integrate toward zero. The image is generated by forming such a sum for each pixel as shown in equation (1A) below.","In equation (1A) below, the pixels of the image area are indexed by (q,r) and the aperture positions are indexed by j, where j=0 . . . L\u22121 and L is the number of elements in the aperture. If s(t) represents the range-compensated (Rpropagation loss corrected, where R is range) voltage received at the japerture position as a function of time (t), zis an aperture weighting to shape the sidelobes, for example, with a Hamming window, or to account for the aperture spacing, and Tis the time shift necessary to align the signal received at sensor position j to the pixel at position (q,r) (a function of the round-trip time from sensor phase center to pixel position), then the value of the focused pixel at image position (q,r) is given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mi":["q","r"],"mo":","}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"L","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["z","i"]},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["s","j"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"+","msub":{"mi":"T","mrow":{"mi":["q","r","j"],"mo":[",",","]}}}}},"mo":"."}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"a"}}}]}}}}},"Here, t describes how the focused signal at location (q,r) varies with time, and is useful for studying late-time target ringing.

Prior art techniques included the following steps:\n\n","The following references give an overview of the state of the art and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties:\n\n","An example of a forward-looking Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) radar that can be vehicle-mounted has been designed and built by the Army Research Lab.

Smith, \u201cThe Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Forward-Looking Radar\u201d, Proceedings of SPIE, Unmanned Systems Technology IX, April 2007, hereby incorporated by reference. The SIRE radar has two transmitters and an array of receiving antennas. The two transmitters alternatively transmit wide bandwidth impulses to illuminate the area in front of the vehicle. An array of receiving antennas measures the returned radar signals. The wide bandwidth of transmitted impulses provides the down-range resolution while the array of receiving antennas provides the cross-range resolution. It has been shown that the configuration with two transmitters located at the end of the array is the optimum configuration to achieve cross-range resolution while minimizing the number of required transmitters.","After data is acquired by the radar hardware, it is transferred to a computer for signal processing and image formation. The signal processing stages include a) self-interference extraction, b) removing radar signature distortion due to moving platform, and c) sub-band filtering. The self-interference processing step to extract the interference components from the returned radar signals and the technique to remove the phase and shape distortion in radar signals due to the motion of the radar platform are described in the publication by Lam Nguyen, entitled \u201cSignal Processing Technique to Remove Signature Distortion in ARL Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Radar,\u201d Army Research Laboratory Technical Report, ARL-TR-4404, March 2008, hereby incorporated by reference.","After all the signal processing steps are applied to the returned radar signals, the processed radar range profiles may be used for forming a SAR image.

There are many sources that cause noise in the resulting image. Noise can be divided into two categories: additive noise and multiplicative noise. System noise, thermal noise, quantization noise, self-interference noise, radio frequency interference (RFI) noise are some examples of the additive noise. Multiplicative noise is much more difficult to deal with since it is data dependent. Some sources that cause multiplicative noise include: timing jitter in data sampling, small aperture size compared to image area, the under-sampling of aperture samples, the non-uniform spacing between aperture samples, errors in position measurement system, etc. Multiplicative noise results in undesired sidelobes that create high noise floor in the image and thus limit the ability to detect targets with smaller amplitudes.","Radar and other imaging systems currently suffer various noise sources that prevent the generation of very high contrast images. As a result, difficult targets (with low amplitudes) are often obscured or even embedded in the noise level of the image background. Moreover, sidelobes from large targets are mistaken as targets of interest. Recently the ARL has designed and built a new ultra-wideband imaging system for the detection of difficult targets.

Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention.

Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features.

The resulting benefits are a) high contrast image with the significant reduction in the noise level, b) detection of targets with very small amplitudes, and c) the reduction in the false alarm rate. Such benefits result in a substantially improved practical system for detecting difficult targets, which is an obstacle that most radar systems are facing today.","Disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,796,826 ('826 patent) is a non-linear imaging algorithm that significantly improves the background noise level of the resulting image () without negatively affecting the focus quality (sharpness) as well as the target amplitudes. In the '826 patent, this technique has been denominated as Recursive Sidelobe Minimization (RSM).","Recursive Sidelobe Minimization (RSM)","As depicted , radar data is collected from a number of positions. For each position, radar data and the positional data are recorded. A \u201cdata point\u201d represents the received signal radar data from each position obtained during an instant or interval in time combined with positional information corresponding to the transmitting and\/or receiving position or location. The data points may be collected by either an array of elements or a single moving element which receives data at points in time, or the combination of both; e.g., a physical array of elements with the elements moving over increments of time. The data collection may be sporadic or at specific intervals of time. As exemplified in , data points are obtained using an array of receiving elements which receive data incrementally. The data points are arranged to form an aperture. As used herein, the term \u201caperture\u201d means the information or data components used to form an image; which may be for example, an array of data points developed from a scanned area, target or scene which can be used to form an image. In the apertures depicted in , each column represents an interval during which the 1\u2212k elements receive data; each data point representing the image data from the signal received combined with the coordinates of the receiving element. After the data points are established in an aperture (or array), as diagrammatically shown in , a substantial portion of data points are removed from the original aperture (array of data points) to form a \u201csubarray.\u201d Conversely, the \u201csubarray\u201d may be formed by the selection of data points within the original aperture. Depending upon the quality of the result desired and the nature of the image being undertaken, the substantial portion of the data points removed or selected may range from as little as one percent to ninety percent. However, one percent removal will result in negligible difference and ninety percent removal will result in drastic reduction of image quality. In general, it is preferred that the percentage of data points subject to removal be within a range of approximately twenty to fifty percent. Using the remaining data points in the aperture, a first preliminary image is formed. During a second interval, the process of removing a different set of twenty to fifty percent of the data points within the original aperture is repeated and a second aperture is formed. In a preferred embodiment, the data points subject to removal are randomly chosen. However, random selection is not necessary to practice the principles of the present invention and some other arbitrary or contrived selection process may be used.","A second preliminary image is formed from the second aperture following the removal of a different set of data points. The first and second preliminary images are then compared. Using the principles of the present invention, the magnitude of the signal at each bit-mapped location of the preliminary images is compared. Any pixel having a greater or equal value is discarded, and only the lesser value is used for each bit-mapped location in the merged image. For each subsequent iteration, approximately twenty to fifty percent of the data points are removed to form an aperture and the preliminary image developed therefrom is compared with the previously merged image. The magnitude of the signal at each pixel or bit mapped location is compared and only the lesser value is retained for each bitmapped location in the combined image. This process is repeated iteratively over a series of iterations, which may be for example ten to several hundred iterations. The result is the substantial elimination of noise from the resulting merged image.","Although the technique is implemented and demonstrated for the ultra wide band forward-looking imaging radar (e.g., ARL SIRE), the technique is suitable for used for other image radar as well. The technique may also be applied for the BoomSAR radar, which is a different radar with different configuration (side-looking). Moreover, this imaging technique is not limited to the formation of radar images as it can be applied to other applications such as CAT scans, magnetic resonance, seismic, sonar, and acoustic imaging.","Use of the Recursive Sidelobe Minimization (RSM) technique results in an improvement of image contrast by reducing system noise by a significant level, significantly improving system performance; and can be adapted for use with existing radar systems. Results include the generation of high contrast images produced by significantly reducing the noise level in the system such that very difficult targets or objects (with low amplitudes) in the image can be detected, which otherwise would be embedded in the system noise.","Generally speaking, in any imaging system, the sidelobes from large objects or noisy spots generated by the system may be mistaken as targets of interest. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the large sidelobes are substantially virtually eliminated, thus reducing the false alarm objects that would be considered as targets of interest.","Possible uses other than radar imaging include magnetic resonance imaging, CAT scan, sonar imaging, and acoustic imaging.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0111"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"Step A\u2014Radar data and its position information is acquired.","Step A\u2014The radar aperture is formed in preparation for image formation. The aperture consists of K elements. Each element in the radar aperture includes the radar receiving position information (x(k), y(k), z(k)), the radar transmitting information (x(k), y(k), z(k)), and the data record s(t) that the radar measures at this location. For side-looking radar, the aperture is usually a linear path with data measured along the path. For the forward-looking radar mentioned above, a 2D radar aperture is generated; formed by the physical antenna array and the forward motion of the radar. Although the terminology \u201c2D\u201d or two dimensional is used to reflect the aperture configuration, the data within the 2D aperture may contain three dimensional information concerning the target area in that the signal data may include the distance at which the target is located relative to the receiving element. In general, the radar aperture may take any of a variety of shapes and those shown are merely examples.","Step A\u2014The imaging grid is formed. In a preferred embodiment a rectangular imaging grid is generated although the imaging grid could be arbitrary defined. Each pixel P, in the imaging grid is located at coordinate (x(i), y(i),z(i)).","Step A\u2014A random compressive aperture is generated using the radar aperture with K elements from step A. The compressive aperture is formed by selecting only L elements from the original aperture for the imaging process. The value for L is\n\n. Where 0<1\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nAccordingly, only a subset of the aperture positions are used for image formation. The remaining K\u2212L aperture positions are simply discarded for this realization. The typical number that we use for our configuration is p=0.8 (i.e., 80% of the aperture is employed and 20% of the aperture is discarded at each iteration). The value of p that can achieve best result should be examined and optimized for each configuration of geometry and radar data set. In a preferred embodiment, the selection of L aperture positions is completely random for each realization. If Arepresents a vector that contains the indices of aperture positions to be included in the image formation process for irealization, then:\n\nA=a,a, . . . , a\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nwhere ais a random number, 1\u2266a\u2266K and a\u2260afor m\u2260n.\u2003\u2003(8)\n","The technique disclosed in the '829 patent may use a random number generator that produces random numbers with certain distribution. Those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that there are many types of distributions. The two distributions that are widely employed in practice are uniform (in which all values from a finite set of possible values are equally probable) and Gaussian (in which all values from a finite set of possible values follow the Gaussian distribution that has the shape of a bell curve). Although any random number distribution could be used to realize (7) and (8), a uniform distribution random number generator may be employed in this preferred embodiment. There are many different implementations for generating a uniformly distributed random numbers for use in conjunction with the present invention; including those random number generator routines that are usually defined and included in general purpose computer programming languages. For example, in C programming: language the two routines srand( ) and rand( ) are used to generate a random number. First, the srand( ) routine is called to initialize the random number generator. Next, the rand( ) routine is called to generate a random number between 0 and a predefined value RAND_MAX.

From , the SAR image is virtually noise-free. All the targets of interest are still preserved in the SAR image that is generated by this preferred embodiment pixel characterization technique. The preferred embodiment provides both amplitude and phase information. A key concept is the classification of each pixel in the image into either a target class (physical objects) or non-target class (noise, sidelobes) based on its statistics from many realizable sparse aperture images. If an image pixel is classified to be associated with a physical object, its value is computed from its statistics. Otherwise, the pixel is assumed to come from a non-physical object (noise source) and its value is simply zero. In general, in the case of noise, fluctuations appear; whereas a physical object exhibits more stability. The value is maximize for stable (physical object) pixels.
