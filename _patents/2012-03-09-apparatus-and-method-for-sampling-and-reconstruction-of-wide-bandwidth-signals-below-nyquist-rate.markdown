Examples of images generated from projection measurements include two-dimensional and three-dimensional SAR (synthetic aperture radar) systems. SAR is a form of radar in which the large, highly-directional rotating antenna used by conventional radar is replaced with many low-directivity small stationary antennas scattered over some area near or around the target area. The many echo waveforms received at the different antenna positions are post-processed to resolve the target. SAR can be implemented by moving one or more antennas over relatively immobile targets, by placing multiple stationary antennas over a relatively large area, or combinations thereof. A further example of images generated from projection measurements are ISAR (inverse SAR) systems, which image objects and many features on the ground from satellites, aircraft, vehicles or any other moving platform. SAR and ISAR systems are used in detecting, locating and sometimes identifying ships, ground vehicles, mines, buried pipes, roadway faults, tunnels, leaking buried pipes, etc., as well as discovering and measuring geological features, forest features, mining volumes, etc., and general mapping. For example, as shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,098 to McCorkle, hereby incorporated by reference, an aircraft mounted detector array is utilized to take ground radar measurements. Other examples of systems using projection measurements are fault inspection systems using acoustic imaging, submarine sonar for imaging underwater objects, seismic imaging system for tunnel detection, oil exploration, geological surveys, etc., and medical diagnostic tools such as sonograms; echocardiograms, x-ray CAT (computer-aided tomography) equipment and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) equipment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","sub":["R","R","R","T","T","T","T","T","T","R","R","R","k","i ","p","p","p","k","k","k"],"sup":["2 ","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"ct","mn":"2"}}}},"br":{},"sup":"8 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"K"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["w","k"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["s","k","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","k"],"mo":","}}}}}}}],"mo":"="},{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2266","\u2266"],"mi":["i","N"]}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"where wis the weight factor and f(i,k) is the delay index to s\u2032(t) necessary to coherently integrate the value for pixel P(i) from the measured data at receiving element k.","The index is computed using the round-trip distance between the transmitting element, the target point forming the image (pixel), and the receiving element.

The imaging center may be located at approximately 20 in from the radar, but for various target resolutions, the imaging centers may be located at various ranges. For simplicity, a fixed range is used for to form imagery and the motion of the vehicle is not shown. In practice, however, imagery is formed using the physical aperture of the antenna array and the synthetic aperture (SAR) generated by the forward motion of the vehicle. This two-dimensional aperture gives not only the crossrange resolution (from physical aperture of the antenna array) but also the height resolution (from the forward motion) and thus results in a 3-dimensional image (see, Nguyen, L. H.; Ton, T. T.; Wong, D. C.; Ressler, M. A. Signal Processing Techniques for Forward Imaging Using Ultrawideband Synthetic Aperture Radar. 5083, 505, (2003), hereby incorporated by reference. This approach also provides integration to achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio in the resulting image.","The following is a description of the platform  in  as it passes four sequential positions , & located at x-coordinates A, B, C & D, respectively. The formation of the first sub-image begins when platform  is at the coordinate A, 20 meters from the block labeled \u201c1sub-image.\u201d As platform  travels in the x direction (as shown in ), signals emitted from platform  illuminates an entire image area to the right of platform , and the reflected signals are received by an array of 16 physical receiving antennas  positioned on the front of the platform . Formation of the first sub-image ends when platform  reaches coordinate C, at approximately 8 m from the block labeled \u201c1sub-image.\u201d Accordingly, the radar signal data for the first (full-resolution) sub-image is received as radar platform  travels a distance of 12 meters (20 m\u22128 m=12 m) from coordinates A to C, for formation of a two dimensional (2D) aperture.","The distance traveled during the formation of the two-dimensional (2-D) aperture is represented by an arrow in  labeled \u201cAperture .\u201d When the platform  reaches coordinate B, a distance of 2 meters from coordinate A in , the formation of the \u201c2sub-image\u201d begins, and as the platform  travels to coordinate D, it uses the received data to form a second 2-D aperture.

Sub-images  and  are formed from the 2-D apertures using the same length of travel (12 meters) of the radar. This process is applied to ensure that image pixels have almost the same (within a specified tolerance) resolution across the entire large area. The sub-images are formed from the radar range profiles using the back-projection algorithm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A"]},"Many applications such as radar and communication systems have been exploiting features that wide-bandwidth signals offer. However, the implementation of front-end receivers to directly digitize these wide-bandwidth signals requires that the analog to digital converter (ADC) digitize the wide-bandwidth signals at a frequency above the minimum Nyquist rate. According to Wikipedia, the Nyquist theorem shows that an analog signal can be perfectly reconstructed from an infinite sequence of samples if the sampling rate exceeds 2B samples per second where B is the highest frequency of the original signal. In the case of time-domain impulse-based Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar, to be above the Nyquist rate the clock speed of the front-end analog-to-digital converter (ADC) must be higher than twice the highest frequency content of the wide-bandwidth signal having a bandwidth from 300 MHz to 3000 MHz. In practice, the received radar data is directly digitized at an equivalent sampling rate of 7.720 Giga-samples\/sec, which is slightly higher than the required Nyquist sampling rate of at least 6 Giga-samples\/sec.","Because of this challenge, state-of-the-art systems employ various time-equivalent sampling techniques that allow the reconstruction of the Wideband-signals from slower sampling rates. These equivalent-time sampling techniques are based on the assumption that a signal waveform is repeatable for many observations. By acquiring the same signal waveform at different phase delays with sub-Nyquist sampling rate, the signal waveform can be reconstructed by interleaving data from individual observations. In other words, these time-equivalent techniques depend on many observations of the same single waveform of interest via interleaving data from individual observations to reconstruct the original information. These techniques do not work if there is only one chance to observe the signal, or the acquired signal is not repeatable from one observation to the next. In addition, since it takes many observations of a signal waveform in order to complete one acquisition cycle (hence the term equivalent time), the effective data acquisition rate is much slower than the real-time data acquisition, which uses analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that operate at above Nyquist rate. The equivalent-time data acquisition results in many disadvantages such as slower data acquisition time, lower pulse repetition rate (PRF), lower average power, etc. In several practical applications, the assumption that a signal is repeatable for many measurements might not be practical or not even realizable.","In the case of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar, which has advantageous penetration capability due to low-frequency contents and the high resolution due to the wide-bandwidth of the transmit signals, a technique referred to as synchronous impulse reconstruction (SIRE) sampling technique has employed an equivalent-time sampling technique that allows the reconstruction of wide-bandwidth signal using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) operating under the Nyquist rate. The ARL SIRE radar system employs an Analog Devices 12-bit ADC to digitize the returned radar signals. However, the ADC is clocked at the system clock rate of 40 MHz. From the well-known sampling theory, it is not possible to reconstruct the Wide Bandwidth signal (300 Mhz to 3000 Mhz) since the clock rate of the ADC is much slower than the required minimum Nyquist sampling rate (in this case 6000 MHz). However, by using the synchronous time-equivalent sampling technique a much higher effective sampling rate is achieved.  provides a graphical representation of the SIRE acquisition technique. Further details are described in Nguyen, L., \u201cSignal and Image Processing Algorithms for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Ultra-wideband (UWB) Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) radar,\u201d Army Research Laboratory Technical Report, ARL. TR-4784, April 2009, hereby incorporated by reference, and Ressler, Marc, et al., \u201cThe Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Forward-Looking Radar,\u201d Proceedings of SPIE, Unmanned Systems Technology IX, Vol. 6561. May 2007, hereby incorporated by reference.","The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling period is \u0394; the value of this parameter in  is 25 ns, which corresponds to the A\/D sampling rate of 40 MHz. The number of samples for each range profile is denoted by N, which is equal to 7 in our current configuration. This value corresponds to a range swath of 26 m. The system pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is 1 MHz. The system pulse repetition interval (PRI)\u2014the inverse of PRF\u2014is 1 ms. Each aliased (sub-Nyquist sampling) radar record is measured M times (1024 in the example of ) and they are integrated to achieve higher signal-to-noise level. After summing M repeated measurements of the same range profile, the first range (fast-time) bin is increased by \u0394. Thus, the next group of M range profiles are digitized with a timing offset of \u0394 with respect to the transmit pulse. The parameter \u0394 represents a time sample spacing that satisfies the Nyquist criterion for the transmitted radar signal. This time sample spacing is 129.53 ps, which corresponds to a sampling rate of 7.72 GHz. This effective sampling rate is sufficient for the wide-bandwidth radar signal (300 MHz-3000 MHz). The number of interleaved samples is",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03ba","mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["\u0394","i"]},"mi":"\u0394"}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"As previously mentioned, the advantage of the equivalent-time sampling technique is that it relieves the clock rate requirements for the ADCs. However, there are two major problems. First, the data acquisition time has been significantly increased. Second, the technique is based on the assumption that the signal is the same from one observation to the next. In this case the radar and all targets in the scene must be stationary during the entire data acquisition cycle. If this condition is met, the received signal will be perfectly reconstructed by interleaving the data from many returned waveforms from many observations. However, this assumption does not often hold in practice since the relative position between the radar and the targets is no longer negligible during the data acquisition cycle due to the motion of the radar platform. This is even worse for the forward-looking radar geometry since the radar in this case moves toward the imaging area. Even with the slow speed of the platform (1 mile per hour), the relative motion between the radar and the targets during the data acquisition cycle results in severe phase and shape distortions in the reconstructed signal. This in turn results in poor focus quality and low signal-to-noise level in SAR imagery. Although some of these artifacts can be corrected by signal processing algorithms, this time-equivalent technique would definitely limit the maximum speed of the radar platform.","The SIRE sampling technique, a modified and enhanced version of the equivalent-time sampling technique used in commercial digital storage oscilloscopes and other radar systems, allows the employment of inexpensive A\/D converters to digitize the wide-bandwidth signals. However, like other equivalent-time sampling techniques, the basic assumption is that the signal is repeatable from one observation to the next. Thus, by acquiring the same waveform with many observations with different phase offsets, the under-sampled data records are then interleaved for the reconstruction of the equivalent over-sampled data record. This results in many side effects that include the distortion of the captured waveform due to the relative motion of the radar and the target during the data acquisition cycle (returned radar waveforms have been changed during the acquisition cycle). In addition, the equivalent-time data acquisition translates to lower average power and lower effective pulse repetition frequency (PRF) for the SAR system. Other state-of-the-art implementations include the use of multiple ADCs in a parallel configuration to increase the effective sampling rate and reduce the data acquisition time. However, the use of parallel ADCs significantly increases the size, weight, power, and cost of the receiver.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a sparse-recovery model-based (SMB) sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction scheme. SMB allows the reconstruction of a wideband signal that is sampled at a much slower rate than Nyquist's in real-time (with a single observation). One advantage of this technique is that the high clock rate of the front-end analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be lowered. By lowering the required clock rate of the ADC, there is significant reduction in the size, weight, power, and cost for the implementation of the receiver. This is important for a system with multiple receiving channels (e.g., the ARL UWB radar system has 16 receiving channels), or a network of sensors. Another advantage of the preferred embodiment technique is that it also offers data compression. This technique allows each receiver to digitize a signal waveform at a much slower rate, reducing the required transmission bandwidth, especially for the implementation of networks of sensors.","The sparsity-driven model-based (SMB) sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique of the preferred embodiment is a real-time sampling technique, not equivalent-time. That means the sampling of the signal is performed using only a single observation at a sampling rate which is much slower than the required sampling rate (Nyquist) via a single slow inexpensive ADC. After this real-time sub-Nyquist sampling is performed, the signal is reconstructed using the preferred embodiment SMB reconstruction technique.","The preferred embodiment sparsity-driven model-based (SMB) sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique allows the wideband signals to be sampled at a much slower rate than the required minimum sampling rate. This preferred embodiment technique is a real-time sampling scheme, not equivalent-time, which means the sampling of the signal is performed using only a single observation, at a sampling rate much slower than the required sampling rate (Nyquist), using a slow inexpensive off-the-shelf ADC. After the real-time sub-Nyquist sampling is performed, the signal is reconstructed using the invented sparsity-driven reconstruction technique.","The first advantage of this technique is that we can lower the requirement of the high clock rate of the front-end ADC. By lowering the required clock rate of the ADC, this would result in the significant reduction in the size, weight, power, and cost for the implementation the receiver. This is even more important for a system with multiple receiving channels (such as the ARL UWB radar system), or a network of sensors. Another advantage is that this technique also naturally offers the data compression feature, allowing each receiver to digitize a signal waveform at a much slower rate which leads to a tremendous reduction in the required transmission bandwidth, especially for the implementation of multiple sensors or networks of sensors. The collected samples can be transmitted directly without any additional compression for bandwidth reduction.","The key innovative concept in the invention is that although much of the information is lost in the receive signal due to the low sampling rate of the receiver, the signal can be modeled as a linear combination of time-shifted versions of the transmitted waveforms. Thus, by constructing a redundant dictionary that composes time-shifted versions of the transmit waveform, the SMB technique solves for a sparse solution of the coefficients that represent the significant components contributing to the received signal. Using simulated data as well as real-world data from the ARL UWB radar, it has been demonstrates that the SMB technique successfully models and synthesizes the radar data from real-life scenes using only a handful of coefficients. The SAR image reconstruction using the SMB reconstruction technique on sub-Nyquist sampling data is well matched with the original over-sampling SAR image, while conventional interpolation techniques, when asked to recover the missing information, may fail.","Although the invention is demonstrated with the application of this technique to radar applications, the sampling and reconstruction technique of the present invention also works with other communication systems, especially ones that employ ultra high-frequency modulation schemes.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

At a given range, the ability to resolve objects or targets in the cross-range direction is known as the cross-range resolution. Similarly, the ability to resolve objects or targets in the down-range direction is known as down-range resolution. The down-range resolution of the SAR system according to the present invention is generally provided by the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse from transmitting elements, having a wide range of frequency. The cross-range resolution is provided by both the array of receiving elements and the radar generated by the moving platform.

To that end, each receiving antenna feeds an analog signal or data to each receiver which in turn converts or processes the analog data or signal in digitized form. The digitized data generated from each receiver of each receiving element is combined and sent to processor, which then performs data processing tasks on the digitized signal (e.g., removal of interference from the digitized backprojection signal, motion compensation, filtering, and forming SAR imagery) using known image processing techniques, as outlined in \u201cSignal and Image Processing Algorithms for the Army Research Lab Ultra-Wideband Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (UWB SIRE) Radar,\u201d Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL-TR-4784 (2009), by Lam Nguyen, which is incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["101","102","103","104","104","105","106","105","106","104","107","108"]},"Compressed Sampling Theory","Part of the Compressed Sampling appeal comes from the implication that a sparse signal can be sampled at a rate much lower than the traditional Nyquist sampling rate. Compressed sensing (CS) is a novel sampling theory, which is based on exploiting sparsity or compressibility when acquiring signals of general interest. Compressed sensing designs non-adaptive sampling techniques that condense the information in a compressible signal into a small amount of data. From the CS framework, certain signals or images can be reconstructed from much fewer samples than the traditional sampling methods, provided that the signals are sparse in certain domains. Although the CS framework offers data compression, it still does not address the drawback described in the Background section; that is, the data acquisition must be operated in equivalent time since many global measurements (obtained from global random projections) are required as depicted by the sensing matrix \u03a6 in the CS framework. Note that in the following, bold face characters denote vectors while bold-faced uppercase characters denote matrices","Sampling Stage",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"sub":"0"},"Let \u03a6 be the \u201csampling\u201d matrix of size M\u00d7 N. The digitized waveform is obtained from\n\n\u2003\u2003(Equation 3A).\n\nwhere y is a vector with M entries containing the measurements (discrete samples of the signal x) and \u03a6 represents an M\u00d7N incoherent sensing matrix, usually constructed from random Gaussian matrices.\n","For the conventional sampling process, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is clocked at above Nyquist rate. In this case \u03a6 is an identity matrix I (where the value of any element along the diagonal line of the matrix is one and the value of any other element of the matrix is zero). This results in the digitized signal y=x with N samples. However, in the preferred embodiment sub-Nyquist sampling process, only M samples (M<<N) are digitized from the input signal. Thus rows of the sampling matrix \u03a6 in this case form a subset of the rows of the identity matrix I. The size of \u03a6 is M\u00d7N, i.e., only M rows from the identity matrix I are selected. The selection of M rows from N rows of the identity matrix could be from randomized selection or from any uniformly-spaced interval. This results in M digitized signal samples stored in the vector y (these samples hence should lie directly on the original analog signal curve x(t)). Note that the generation of the sampling matrix \u03a6 could be initialized once and be used among many records, or it could be changed from one record to the next. The important point is that the same sensing matrix \u03a6 should be used in both stages: signal sampling and signal reconstruction.","The plot from  shows the original received waveform (smooth curve) and the sub-Nyquist samples (diamond sample dots) at the output of the ADC subsystem (). Only 10% of the original samples from the smooth waveform are measured. It is obvious that much of the original information from the received waveform is lost. Without any additional information, the best conventional approach to reconstruct the signal is to use some types of interpolation techniques.  show the reconstructed waveforms (red curves) using the conventional linear and spline interpolation techniques, respectively. It is obvious from  that these conventional techniques fail to reconstruct the original waveform.","Compressed Sensing Framework-Reconstruction","While sampling process is simply a random linear projection, the reconstruction process is highly non-linear\u2014it attempts to find the sparsest signal from the received measurements. More precisely, the reconstruction algorithm is to solve the following sparsity-driven inverse problem\n\n\u03b1*=min|\u03b1|\u2003\u2003(4A)\n\nand the original signal can be recovered as x*=\u03a8\u03b1*. Under some mild assumptions, the compressed sensing theory asserts that x can be faithfully recovered from M=O (K log N) measurements with very high success probability by solving the following optimization problem.\n\nmin\u2225subject to \u2003\u2003Equation (1A)\n\nThe optimization problem above is however an NP-hard problem and is computationally very expensive to solve. The Compressed Sensing (CS) theory addresses that under some mild conditions on sensing matrix \u03a6, the l-norm minimization problem (L-norm is simply its number of significant (non-zero) elements) can be efficiently solved by recasting it as the following l-norm convex optimization.\n\n\u03b1*=min|\u03b1|such that \u2003\u2003(4A)\n\nand the original signal can be recovered as x*=\u03a8\u03b1*. The CS framework asserts that x can be faithfully recovered from only M=O (K log N) measurements y, suggesting a potential of significant cost reduction in data acquisition. The optimization problem above is however an NP-hard problem and is computationally very expensive to solve. The CS theory addresses that under some mild conditions on sensing matrix \u03a6, the l-norm minimization problem can be efficiently solved by recasting it as the following l-norm convex optimization\n\n\u03b1*=min|\u03b1|\u2003\u2003(5A)\n\nAgain, under some mild conditions of the sensing matrix \u03a6, the reconstructed signal x* via the equation y=\u03a6x, which can be roughly regarded as the sparsest (or most compressible) solution from many candidate solutions of the under-determined equation in Equation 1A. In order to faithfully recover the input signal from a few compressed measurements, the sensing matrix \u03a6 needs to be incoherent with the sparsifying matrix \u03a8. In other words, the product matrix A=\u03a6\u03a8 is required to have good Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), i.e. for all vectors \u03b1and for all subset of K=|T| columns of the matrix A (denoted as A), yields:\n\n(1\u2212\u03b4)\u2225\u03b1\u2225\u03b1\u2225\u2266(1+\u03b4)\u2225\u03b1\u2225\n\nwhere \u03b4 is some constant 0<\u03b4<1.\n","The problem consists of designing (a) a stable measurement matrix \u03a6 such that the salient information in any K sparse or compressible signal is not damaged by the dimensionality reduction and (b) a robust reconstruction algorithm to recover the sparse signal x from the measurements y.","From a sensing point-of-view, a direct straightforward implementation of the series of incoherent linear projections in (y=\u03a6x (3A)) does not immediately lead to sub-Nyquist sampling since a very fast analog-digital converter (ADC) is still needed to capture the digital samples in the vector x in the first place. Furthermore, since the randomly generated dense linear operator \u03a6 has no structure, there does not exist fast algorithms and efficient implementations for it. Sparser and more deterministic sensing operators with fast implementations such as structurally random matrices described in Thong T. Do, Trac D. Tran and Lu Gan, \u201cFast compressive sampling using structurally random matrices\u201d, Proc. of 2008, Las Vegas, April, (2008), hereby incorporated by reference, can retain the high performances of random matrices while yielding much lower computational cost. Nevertheless, they still depend on highly accurate digital samples at very fine resolution from the original signal of interest. To realize the true compressed sensing advantage, one has to collect SAR data via analog components with a slower sampling clock. Such technique requires significant modifications to the current ARL UWB SAR system's hardware. It is more desirable to minimize the level of software\/hardware upgrades while applying the Compressed. Sensing (CS) concepts to improve reconstruction image quality while achieving sub-Nyquist sampling rate.","From a recovery point-of-view, in the vector space H=Cof N-dimensional signals, vector x can be represented as x=\u03a8\u03b1, where \u03a8 is called the sparsifying matrix which in other words, the representation through \u03a8 can be (and in many cases, should be) redundant. The sparsifying matrix is said to be complete if its columns span the entire N-dimensional space. The signal x is said to be strictly K-sparse when there are only K non-zero components in \u03b1. When the sorted magnitudes of (\u03b1) decay very quickly and x can be well approximated with only K components, then x is said to be K-compressible. Needless to say, the effectiveness of the recovery algorithm of a class of signal x heavily depends on the sparsest representation of the signal class.","In standard compressed sensing, fixed linear transform bases such as the DCT, FFT and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) or a combination of all three are often employed to obtain sparsity. In the UWB SAR system, the transmitted pulse is a monocycle impulse with an approximated bandwidth range of 300-3000 MHz. Current collected raw data captured in the 8 receivers do not exhibit any common sparse pattern. In other words, a quick spectrum analysis reveals that our raw data is not time-Sparse or frequency sparse or even wavelet sparse. Hence, a na\u00efve direct application of Compressed Sensing (CS) via random projection with Fourier, cosine, or wavelet bases yields disappointing results.","Over-Complete Dictionary or Frame as Sparsifying Matrix","Signals might not always have the sparsest representation in a conventional signal-independent basis found in transform coding. In the case of compressed sensing, since one does not have to communicate the sparsifying transform from the encoder to the decoder, an over-complete dictionary of previously observed signals or other signal-dependent atoms can be a powerful choice. Here, the dictionary is a collection of J\u2267N vectors \u03c6k, 1\u2266k\u2266J. Alternatively, a dictionary can be seen as a fat N\u00d7J matrix \u03a8. For a given signal y\u03b5C, the sparse representation problem consists of finding a representation x=\u03a8\u03b1 where \u03b1\u03b5Cis a sparse vector, i.e. with fewest significant large coefficients and\/or most of its coefficients having small\/negligible magnitudes.","In a preferred embodiment approach, the dictionary is constructed from time shifted versions of the transmitted probing signal s(t). Define (i, j) with 1\u2266i\u2266I, 1\u2266j\u2266J as the pixel location of a reflective target in the recovery area.

Define (i, j) with 1\u2266i\u2266I, 1\u2266j\u2266J as the pixel location of a reflective target in the recovery area. The received signal x(t) is simply the summation of reflections of all targets within the recovery area, i.e., the received signal is composed of a linear combination of delayed and weighted replicas of the transmitted pulse s(t) as follows:\n\n()=\u03a3\u03b1(),11\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere the weighting coefficients \u03b1represent signal attenuation and phase changes caused by different travel distances and reflection angles. In other words, the received signal x(t) is simply the output of an LTI system modeled by the reflection coefficients \u03b1and its sparsity is directly related to the complexity level of the scene. Suppose that the received signal is sampled at the Nyquist rate, the collected digitized data record x can be represented as\n\n\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nwhere N\u00d7l column vector x is a length-N record, N\u00d7(I\u00d7J) matrix S is the redundant matrix whose columns are time-shifted version of the transmitted signal s(t), and (I\u00d7J)\u00d7l column vector \u03b1 is the sparse vector of weighting coefficients. Significant coefficients in \u03b1 indicates the existence of such objects. The position and magnitude value of significant coefficients in \u03b1 reveals the potential position and shape information of significant targets. One can hypothesize that the record x is sparse in the dictionary S in the sense that there should only exist a few significant coefficients in \u03b1 which corresponds to the significant targets or objects within that local neighborhood.

In the latter case, samples are randomly selected of x as measurements y.

Under some mild assumptions, the compressed sensing theory shows that the sparse signal x can be faithfully recovered from M=O(K\u00d7log N) measurements with very high success probability by solving the following optimization problem.\n\nmin\u2225subject to \u2003\u2003Equation (1B)\n\nThe above convex minimization problem can be solved easily via traditional linear programming techniques. In real-life large-scale applications, (1B) can be more efficiently solved using fast algorithms such as gradient projection and iterative shrinkage thresholding. Alternatively, various heuristic greedy algorithms have also been developed; most prominent amongst them is orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).\n","Two issues that often, arise in practice are (i) the space that signal sampling is carried out is often not necessarily sparse (the signal of interest x is most likely sparse in another domain); and (ii) measurements are often contaminated by a certain level of noise, say of variance \u03c3. To address both of these issues, one can attempt to solve the following optimization problem instead\n\nmin\u2225\u03a8\u2225subject to \u2225\u2266\u03c3\u2003\u2003Equation (3B)\n\nwhere the operator \u03a8 can be thought of as the sparsifying transform, or frame, or dictionary for x (here \u03a8 can be chosen as a concatenation of a long list of popular fixed linear transforms such as Fourier, cosine, Gabor, and wavelet). This is commonly referred to as analysis-based CS in the literature, as described further in S. Becker, et al., \u201cNESTA: a Fast and Accurate First-order Method for Sparse Recovery,\u201d 4, 1-39 (2011), hereby incorporated by reference. For the present application and SAR data set, utilizing NESTA and selecting the Fourier transform as \u03a8 and the sensing matrix \u03a6 as a random matrix whose entries being i.i.d. random variables generated from a Gaussian distribution offers the best and most robust recovery performance that CS can offer.\n","From a practical sensing point-of-view, the aforementioned random Gaussian matrix that performs random projections does not immediately lead to lower-cost slower-clock data acquisition unless it is, implemented directly in the analog domain as an analog operator. While there have been numerous efforts in the CS hardware design, it is believed that CS-based A\/D converters only exist in research labs. To realize true sub-Nyquist under-sampling, a radically different approach is taken in relying on currently available off-the-shelf inexpensive A\/D converters with a slower sampling clock to capture SAR data. Therefore, a proposed technique only requires minor modifications to the current ARL UWB SAR system's hardware. To recover raw SAR data records at high rates, instead of relying on the traditional approach of interpolation or the recent CS approach with a certain sparsifying transform, a sparsity-driven optimization approach is chosen based on an appropriate physical model\u2014each radar data record is modeled as a superposition of many backscattered signals from reflective point targets in the scene.","Model-Based SAR Sparse Recovery from Uniformly Under-Sampled Measurements","Using this approach, by hypothesis the optimal sparsifying redundant frame \u03a8 for the receiving SAR signal x(t) is the over-complete dictionary consisting of numerous time-shifted versions of the transmitted probing signal s(t). More specifically, the received signal x(t) is modeled as the summation of all reflections from all targets within the recovery area. The received signal is reconstructed or derived from a linear combination of delayed and weighted replicas of the transmitted pulse s(t) as follows\n\n()=\u03a3\u03b1()\u2003\u2003Equation (6B)\n\nwhere weighting coefficients \u03b1represent signal attenuation and time-shift parameters Tmodel phase changes caused by different physical material properties, travel distances, and reflection angles in the returned signal. In the discrete setting, suppose that the received signal x is already sampled at the Nyquist rate, then x can be compactly represented as\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation (7B)\n\nwhere the N\u00d7l column vectors is the signal of interest, the N\u00d7I matrix S is the redundant dictionary whose I columns are timeshified version of the transmitted signal s(t), and the I\u00d7l column vector \u03b1 is the sparse vector of weighting coefficients. Significant elements in \u03b1 indicate the existence of significant object(s) in the scene. The position and magnitude value of significant coefficients in a reveal the potential position and shape information of those significant targets. The record x is sparse in the dictionary S in the sense that few significant coefficients in a correspond to significant targets or objects within that local neighborhood. Hence, the sparse recovery problem in this case involves solving the following loptimization problem:\n\nmin\u2225subject to \u2003\u2003Equation (8B)\n","Here, the sparsity level K in the sparse recovery process is directly related to the complexity level of the scene. If K is kept fixed throughout all data records, then one is only interested in at most K significant point targets in any particular scene. Numerous recovery techniques in the current CS literature can be employed to solve the optimization problem in Equation (8B), including the lrelaxation approaches. The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) may be chosen due to its simplicity, recovery robustness, and fast computation. OMP is a very simple to set up: the only required parameter is the sparsity level K. Once the sparsest coefficient vector \u03b1 is found, the raw data record is recovered as in Equation (7B). All of the recovered data records are then supplied to the time-domain back-projection image formation algorithm to produce the final SAR image.","Results","Operative sensing schemes include (i) random Gaussian projection which has been proven to offer the best recovery performance for traditional CS; and (ii) uniform sub-sampling with a much slower ADC clock rate. In the former case, elements of the sensing matrix \u03a6 are chosen as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random variables. In the latter case, the sensing matrix is chosen as \u03a6=Iwhere T={kM, k Z]} and M is the sub-sampling factor. This simply yields uniform regular under-sampled which can be easily accomplished with an inexpensive ADC. For signal recovery, three options are explored: (i) analysis CS recovery via NESTA, as described in S. Becker, et al., \u201cNESTA: a Fast and Accurate First-order Method for Sparse Recovery,\u201d 4, 1-39 (2011) (hereby incorporated by reference) where the sparsifying transform \u03a8 is chosen as the DFT matrix; (ii) traditional spline interpolation to attempt to recover high-resolution signal x from low-resolution regular samples y; and (iii) the proposed time-delay model-based redundant dictionary approach as described in E.

The system is a time-domain impulse-based radar that transmits narrow pulses that occupy the frequency spectrum from 300 MHz to 3000 MHz. The radar has two transmitters and an array of 16 receivers to form a physical aperture in the forward-looking mode. The radar range swath is from 8 to 33 m. In-depth details of the radar system are discussed in Ressler, L. Nguyen, F. Koenig, D. Wong, and G. Smith, \u201cThe Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Forward-Looking Radar,\u201d Proc. SPIE, Unmanned Systems Technology IX, Vol. 6561, May 2007, hereby incorporated by reference. After the returned radar signals are captured and digitized by the receivers, a series of signal processing algorithms are performed on the data to mitigate noise and other artifacts. The processed data are then sent to the image formation algorithm to form 2D SAR imagery. ARL has developed the novel RSM technique that integrates with the standard back-projection image formation to achieve significant side-lobe and noise reduction in SAR imagery. The ARL report L.

In this case, the data reconstruction is based on a few measured (projected) samples, which make up 20% of the original data samples. It is important to note here that although this compressed sensing data acquisition scheme results in data bandwidth reduction (reconstruction is based on the number of projected samples rather than the original data samples), the Gaussian projection still requires that each data record is digitized at the original over-sampled rate (7.720 Giga-samples\/sec).  shows the SAR image using the standard compressed sensing framework. From , although a few targets are detectable (with very high false alarm rate), the overall SAR image quality is very poor","Next, the under-sampled data set (1.544 Giga samples\/sec) is considered, which is well under the Nyquist rate. Using the standard interpolation technique for waveform reconstruction, the SAR image is formed from the under-sampled data set.  shows the corresponding SAR image, which has very poor quality. The SAR image is very noisy; none of the targets can be detected.","Finally, the reconstruction of the under-sampled data set was tested using the proposed SMB technique. The reconstruction method performed quite well in this case. Since the probing waveform (the actual transmitted waveform filtered by the overall system transfer function) is not available, this waveform was estimated by generating an analytical wideband signal that covers the same frequency spectrum of the radar transmit pulse.  shows the SAR image reconstruction using the SMB technique. The reconstruction performs very well. All nine small targets are reconstructed with high fidelity. The SAR background noise level is comparable to the original over-sampled data as shown in . There are some small isolated areas where the noise speckles are slightly higher than the original image. Overall, the SAR image reconstruction using the proposed technique achieved excellent performance in this real and challenging scenario using under-sampled data (20%).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIGS. 23A-C","FIG. 22","FIG. 23C","FIGS. 23A and 23B"]},"In summary, the preferred embodiments comprise a novel robust sparse-recovery technique that allows the sub-Nyquist uniform under-sampling of wide-bandwidth radar data in real-lime (single observation). Although much of the information is lost in the received signal due to the low sampling rate, a robust signal recovery is obtained via modeling the received radar waveform as a superposition of many backscattered signals from reflective point targets in the scene. The proposed SMB technique is based on direct sparse recovery via OMP using a special dictionary containing many time-delayed versions of the transmitted probing signal. The technique allows the use of existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and architecture. The algorithm was tested using real radar data from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The sparse-recovery model-based SMB technique successfully models and synthesizes the returned radar data from real scenes using a handful of coefficients and an analytical waveform that models the transmitted signal. SAR image quality from only 20% under-sampled data is essentially the same as the quality obtained from the original over-sampled data.","Possible uses of the invention include remote sensing applications such as target detection, anomaly detection, range detection, imaging radar, other remote sensors, communication systems, medical imaging systems, natural resource management, planning and monitoring. Using the concepts of the present invention, lost information from sub-Nyquist sampling may be recovered using sparsity modeling technique. The present invention allows the use of relatively inexpensive ADCs to capture wide bandwidth signals in real-time (not equivalent time). The preferred embodiment sampling technique affords data compression which facilitates reducing transmission bandwidth, particularly for sensors or networks of sensors. The preferred embodiment SMB technique can be used to extrapolate information. Once the SMB can successfully model data based upon a fraction of available information (sub-Nyquist data) it can further estimate and\/or synthesize other information that might otherwise not exist in the input data.","The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and\/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.","The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and\/or other Signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product.

For example, a sparse matrix is a matrix with enough zeros that it pays to take advantage of them; commonly interpreted from an economics view point in that if one can save time and memory by exploiting the zeros, then a matrix is sparse. The terminology sparsity refers to the selection of a model, within a hierarchy of model classes, that yields a compact representation; i.e. a model that depends on only a few of the observations, selecting a small subset of features for classification or visualization. Selection of an optimal representation which is sufficiently sparse enables efficient computation by optimization techniques and alleviates the extreme difficulty encountered without sufficient sparsity.","As used herein, the terminology \u201ctarget\u201d area means area of interest, which may be, for example, a scene, an animal or human body or portion thereof, face (as in face recognition), object, ground region, field, landscape, aerial environment, or a combination thereof.","The term \u201cnoise\u201d as used herein relates to observation noise. There are many sources that cause noise in the resulting observed signal. Noise can be divided into two categories: additive noise and multiplicative noise. System noise, thermal noise, quantization noise, self-interference noise, radio frequency interference (RFI) noise are some examples of the additive noise. Multiplicative noise is much more difficult to deal with since it is data dependent. Some sources that cause multiplicative noise include: timing jitter in data sampling, small aperture size compared to image area, the under-sampling of aperture samples, the non-uniform spacing between aperture samples, errors in position measurement system, etc. Multiplicative noise results in undesired sidelobes that create high noise floor in the image and thus limit the ability to detect targets.","As used herein, the terminology \u201cdictionary\u201d means an organized listing of data stored in machine-readable form for reference.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments are intended to reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
