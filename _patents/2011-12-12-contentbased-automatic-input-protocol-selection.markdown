{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described herein are not prior art to the claims in the present application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","At present, mobile devices enable a user to input content for various purposes, such as to generate messages, to take notes for classes, or to create business records. The input content may include plain language text, punctuation, symbols (e.g., small images or animation icons), emoticons, or the combination thereof. To input a certain type of content, a user may have to switch from a current input protocol to a suitable input protocol depending on the recipient or the type of content. For example, after a user prepares a message for a Chinese-speaking person on-line and before preparing a message to a Japanese-speaking person, the user may have to switch from a Chinese language generating protocol to a Japanese language generating protocol, especially if the next person is Japanese-speaking only. In addition, in order to make the input content compact or to add some emotional characteristics, a user may have to switch input protocols several times to input special symbols or emoticons. Frequent input protocol switching can sometimes be stressful and can cause inconveniences when using a mobile device, such as a portable computer, smart phone, a tablet, or the like.","Techniques described herein generally relate to automatically selecting an input protocol, which may include a generating protocol and a prediction dictionary protocol, based on an input content.","In one embodiment, a method for selecting an input protocol based on an input content may include: acquiring the input content; analyzing the input content; extracting one or more indivisible individual units from the input content; calculating a similarity between a first frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units and a second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units, wherein the second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units is predetermined with a second value of frequency of occurrence; ranking the similarity; identifying one or more input protocols based on the similarity; and selecting a first ranked input protocol having a highest similarity.","In one embodiment, a system for selecting an input protocol based on an input content may include: a processing module configured to acquire the input content, analyze the input content, and extract one or more indivisible individual units from the input content; a calculating module configured to calculate a similarity between a first frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units and a second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units, wherein the second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units is predetermined with a second value of frequency of occurrence; a selecting module configured to rank the similarity, identify one or more input protocols based on the similarity, and select a first ranked input protocol having a highest similarity; and one or more user interfaces (UI) configured to receive the input content, and suggest the first ranked input protocol. The UI can include a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide visual information to a user, or the UI can include a keyboard, mouse, touch screen or other UI device to receive the input content from a user. A GUI can suggest the first ranked input protocol to the user, such as by displaying information regarding the first ranked input protocol on a display screen.","In one embodiment, a device for selecting an input protocol based on an input content may include: a processing unit configured to acquire the input content, analyze the input content, and extract one or more indivisible individual units from the input content; a calculating unit configured to calculate a similarity between a first frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units and a second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units, wherein the second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units is predetermined with a second value of frequency of occurrence; a selecting unit configured to rank the similarity, identify one or more input protocols based on the similarity, and select a first ranked input protocol having a highest similarity; and one or more user interfaces (UI) configured to receive the input content, and suggest the first ranked input protocol. The UI can include a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide visual information to a user as well as a keyboard, mouse, touch screen or other UI to receive the input content and suggest the first ranked input protocol.","In one embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium can be provided that includes computer-readable instructions stored thereon that are executable by a computing device to perform operations, wherein the computer-readable storage medium is configured to select an input protocol based on an input content. The input content can be input into the computing device through a UI. The operation of the computing device having the storage medium with computer-readable instructions can include: acquiring the input content; analyzing the input content; extracting one or more indivisible individual units from the input content; calculating a similarity between a first frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units and a second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units, wherein the second frequency of occurrence of the one or more indivisible individual units is predetermined with a second value of frequency of occurrence; ranking the similarity; identifying one or more input protocols based on the similarity; and selecting a first ranked input protocol having a highest similarity.","In one embodiment, a method for selecting an input protocol based on an input content may include: analyzing the input content; calculating a similarity between the input content and a database; ranking the similarity; identifying one or more input protocols based on the similarity; and selecting a first ranked input protocol having a highest similarity.","The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","all arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.","Generally, the present disclosure relates to devices, systems, and method for inputting content into a computing device. Such inputting can be facilitated by the device receiving text input from a user, and then processing and analyzing the text in order to generate and provide predicted text to the user. The device can include hardware and software that can analyze the text and predict the text that may be input by the user. The device can use past text input by the user as well as a topic of the text or an intended recipient of the text in order to make a prediction of text that will be input by the user.","The following example provides an embodiment of devices, systems, and methods described herein. When a user inputs information into a computing device to prepare text, the user may need to type each and every character, word, sentence, symbol, punctuation mark, or emoticon of the input content of the text. However, computing devices can be configured with hardware and software to provide a user with recommended input content, such as text, symbols, or emoticons based on the input content that is input into the computing device by the user.","In one embodiment, a computing device can provide recommended input content using one or more input protocols based on the input content provided by the user. The one or more input protocols can each include a generating protocol that generates input content (e.g., generated content) and a prediction dictionary protocol that predicts input content (e.g., predicted content).","In one embodiment, the generating protocol may be used (e.g., by the user) in order to generate, input and edit natural languages, symbols and emoticons, which are included in generated input that is provided to the user as a generated input content. In one embodiment, the prediction dictionary protocol may be used to facilitate prediction of the predicted content that can be used for the input content of the text based on the input content provided by the user. In one embodiment, the generating protocol and prediction dictionary protocol can cooperate in order to provide recommended input content to the user, where the recommended input content can include generated content and predicted content.","In one embodiment, the generating protocol can be used to generate content based on what is actually input into the device by the user. That is, the generating protocol receives input from the user and generates content that is displayed or otherwise provided to the user. The generating protocol can provide generated content that is exactly as input by the user or the generated content can arise from the input, such as be combining or separating characters of the input from the user in order to generate input content (e.g., generated content) that is provided to the user. For example, the generating protocol can generate a \u201csmiley face\u201d from a colon and closing parenthesis (e.g., \u201c:)\u201d).","In one embodiment, the prediction dictionary protocol may include a database of words, sentences, symbols or emoticons frequently used or featured in a topic domain or a relationship that is relevant to the input content. In one embodiment, a topic domain can include a type of topic relevant to the contextual environment of the input content, where examples of different topic domains can include business, school, athletics, activity, calendar, or other types of contextual environments. In another embodiment, the relationship can generally refer to the type of interpersonal connection between a person (e.g., user) creating the text of the input content and an intended receiver of the text of the input content. Some examples of relationships can be business contacts, school contacts, athletic contacts, activity contacts, acquaintances, friends, family, or significant others such as spouses, girlfriends and boyfriends.","In one embodiment, the generating protocol may cooperate with the corresponding prediction dictionary protocol to facilitate generation and prediction of the input content. The prediction and\/or generation of the recommended input content can be based on the topic domain and the relationship parameters relevant to the input content provided by the user. For example, a business prediction dictionary protocol may include a database of words, sentences, symbols or emoticons frequently used in a business related topic domain. When a user uses the generating protocol to generate, input, and edit business related input content, the business prediction dictionary protocol can be used to predict certain input content, such as words or sentences frequently used in the business topic domain.","In one embodiment, the prediction may be conducted through searching the database and suggesting the appropriate words or sentences to the user based on the input content provided by the user. In some instances, a user may have to switch the prediction dictionary protocol during creation of the input content. For example, when the user changes the input content recipient from a business partner to a family member, the user and\/or computing device may have to switch a business prediction dictionary protocol to a family member prediction dictionary protocol. This facilitates preparing text by selecting appropriate text for the intended recipient of the text. Now, the switching of input protocols by the computing device can be automated based at least in part on the topic domain and the relationship with the systems and methods described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","101","102","103","100","101","102","103","101","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["102","102","63","63","640","641","642","103","103"]},"The input content  may contain one or more indivisible individual units . The one or more indivisible individual units  can be in any format depending on the text or characters of the input content . When the input content  includes one or more natural languages , the one or more indivisible individual units  can be the smallest linguistic unit of that natural language, such as a letter or word, a punctuation mark or combination thereof. The words can be common dictionary words or slang for a particular natural language. The smallest linguistic unit is a linguistic unit that can carry certain meanings. The smallest linguistic unit can have different structures depending on different natural languages. For example, when the one or more natural languages  includes Japanese, the one or more indivisible individual units  can be a morphactin because in Japanese, a morphactin is used as the smallest linguistic unit with certain meanings. For instance, \u201cOhayou\u201d is a morphactin in Japanese, which means \u201cGood Morning.\u201d Any individual kana character in the morphactin of \u201cOhayou\u201d such as \u201c0\u201d does not carry any meaning. Therefore, the morphactin of \u201cOhayou\u201d can be treated as the smallest linguistic unit in Japanese, and thus can be included in the one or more indivisible individual units  when the one or more natural languages  includes Japanese. On the other hand, when the one or more natural languages  includes English, the one or more indivisible individual units  can be a single word because in English, a single word is enough to carry certain meanings, and in some instances a single letter or single punctuation mark can carry sufficient meaning. For example, the word \u201csunny\u201d can be one of the one or more indivisible individual units  when the one or more natural languages  includes English. Also, a question mark (e.g., \u201c?\u201d) that represents a question can be one of the one or more individual units . In some instances, single letters or numbers can be an indivisible individual unit or be part of the one or more indivisible individual units , especially in informal texts that use slang or phonetic slang to represent actual words. One or more symbols  can be used as the one or more indivisible individual units , such as a single small image or a single animation icon being a single indivisible individual unit. One or more emoticons  can be used as the one or more indivisible individual units , such that a single emoticon may be formed by one or more character inputs, such as letters, numbers, or punctuation or the like.","The one or more indivisible individual units  may be encoded by one of the computing industry standards. The computing industry standards may include UNICODE, ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-KR, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-TW and Shift_JIS-2004. Therefore, any of the one or more indivisible individual units  of the input content  can be encoded, interpreted and identified with one specific code defined by one of the computing industry standards.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","210","200","100","200","101","102","103","210","101","102","103","210","211","212","213","211","101","101","212","102","102","102","213","103","103","103","211","212"]},"The generating protocol  can be switched among different types of the natural language generating protocol , such as from a Chinese language generating protocol to a Japanese language generating protocol. Also, the generating protocol  can be switched among different types of the symbol generating protocol , such as from a weather symbol generating protocol to a fashion symbol generating protocol. Additionally, the generating protocol  can also be switched among different types of the emoticon generating protocol , such as from a happy mood emoticon generating protocol to a sad mood emoticon generating protocol. In addition, the generating protocol  can be switched among different types of generating protocols, such as from the natural language generating protocol  to the symbol generating protocol , or from the symbol generating protocol  to the emoticon generating protocol . The generating protocol  switching process may depend on the input content  as well as on the topic domain and relationship parameters. For example, a user may want to insert one or more symbols  or one or more emoticons  in to a sentence generated with the one or more natural languages , and may therefore have to switch the generating protocol  several times during such inputting process.","As illustrated in , the input protocol  may also include a prediction dictionary protocol .

The prediction dictionary  can also be created based on some other materials, such as a user's previous communication records regarding a particular topic domain or a particular relationship. The previous communication records can be any records the user has communicated in the past, especially in view of the topic domain and\/or the relationship of the intended recipient of the communication. For example, frequently used or featured words, morphactins, punctuation marks, sentences of the one or more natural languages , the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  can be extracted from a user's (e.g., sender) previous communication records to a certain business partner (e.g., receiver), to create a business topic domain prediction dictionary.

The processing module  may include a searching engine , which can be used to search the words, morphactins, sentences, and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  which match the input content . The processing module  may include a matching module  that may be used to compare the words, morphactins, sentences, and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  with the input content . The processing module  may include a suggesting module  that may be used to suggest the predicted content, such as matched or similar words, morphactins, sentences, and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  with the input content  to a user through displaying the predicted content on a screen to the user. The processing module  may also include a modifying module  that may be used to modify the prediction dictionary . The function of the modifying module  may include: adding the words, morphactins, sentences, and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  which were not previously stored in the prediction dictionary ; correcting the mistakes in the prediction dictionary ; deleting unused words, morphactins, sentences, and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  stored in the prediction dictionary  after a certain period of time; or updating the prediction dictionary  with new types of prediction dictionary after a certain period of time.","The prediction dictionary protocol  can be used to facilitate the prediction of the input content , such as to predict words, morphactins, sentences, and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  based on the input content  provided by the user. The predicted input content can be recommended input content that is recommended to the user based on what was input into the computing device by the user. For example, a user may use the generating protocol  for the English language to generate and input the characters \u201cme.\u201d Here the characters \u201cme\u201d may become part of the input content . Based on the input content , the processing module  of the prediction dictionary protocol  for a business topic domain may search the business topic domain prediction dictionary and suggest the predicted content (e.g., recommended input content), such as a word list including word \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cmeeting\u201d to the user. The user may accept the predicted content through choosing the suggested word \u201cmeeting.\u201d Here the newly chosen word \u201cmeeting\u201d may become part of the input content . Based on the input content , the processing module  may further search the business topic domain prediction dictionary and suggest the predicted content to the user, such as the word \u201cschedule.\u201d The user may accept the predicted content through choosing the suggested word \u201cschedule.\u201d Here the \u201cmeeting schedule\u201d may become part of the input content . Based on the input content , the processing module  may then search the business topic domain prediction dictionary and suggest the predicted content, such as a sentence \u201cwhat is the meeting schedule for tomorrow?\u201d on a screen to the user. The user may accept the predicted content through choosing the suggested sentence \u201cwhat is the meeting schedule for tomorrow?\u201d, which may become part of the input content . The user may not accept the predicted content through not choosing anything in the predicted content.","In another example, the user may not accept the predicted content through not choosing the suggested word \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cmeeting\u201d from the word list, but rather may generate and input the word \u201cmeet.\u201d Here the user generated and inputted word \u201cmeet\u201d may become part of the input content . Based on the input content , the processing module  may further search the business topic domain prediction dictionary and suggest the predicted content to the user, such as the sentence \u201clet's meet in the office today.\u201d The user may not accept the predicted content through not choosing the suggested sentence \u201clet's meet in the office today.\u201d Here the predicted content \u201clet's meet in the office today\u201d may not become part of the input content . The user may not accept the predicted content by simply ignoring the predicted content and continuing to input characters into the computing device. On the other hand, the computing device may present a cancel button to the user, and the user can select the cancel button to cancel the predicted content. The user may further generate and input a sentence such as \u201clet's plan to meet for lunch today.\u201d Here the newly generated and inputted sentence \u201clet's plan to meet for lunch today\u201d may become part of the input content . Of course the user may accept the predicted content \u201clet's meet in the office today\u201d and may then edit the sentence to \u201clet's plan to meet for lunch today.\u201d The word \u201cmeet\u201d and the sentence \u201clet's plan to meet for lunch today\u201d may not previously have been stored in the business topic domain prediction dictionary. The processing module  may then add those newly generated and inputted words and sentences to the business topic domain prediction dictionary, and may therefore search and suggest such words and sentences upon subsequent input of \u201cme\u201d into the computing device with respect to the topic domain and the relationship between the user and the recipient of the input content .","When the input protocol  is changed by a user or a computing device, it can be either the generating protocol  being switched, or the prediction dictionary protocol  being switched, or both. The generating protocol  and the prediction dictionary protocol  can be switched separately. The user or computing device can switch the generating protocol  to a different generating protocol, such as from a natural language generating protocol A to a natural language generating protocol B, or from the symbol generating protocol  to the emoticon generating protocol , while keeping the same prediction dictionary protocol . The user or computing device can also change the prediction dictionary protocol  while keeping the same generating protocol . The generating protocol  and the prediction dictionary protocol  can also be switched simultaneously or correspondingly, under which situation the generating protocol  can be switched at the same time when the prediction dictionary protocol  is switched, either manually or automatically.","For example, a user can switch the prediction dictionary  which only contains words for the Japanese language to the prediction dictionary  which only contains words for the Chinese language when the user switches the generating protocol  from the Japanese language to the Chinese language. On the other hand, the user can keep the same business partner relationship prediction dictionary for both the Chinese language generating protocol and the English language generating protocol because the business partner relationship prediction dictionary can include words, morphactins, sentences and punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages  as well as the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  which may be shared by both languages. The computing device can also be used to determine the relationship between the generating protocol  and the prediction dictionary protocol , and therefore can switch them correspondingly and automatically based on the relationship of the user and the recipient of the input content  generated and inputted by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","301","302","300","101","102","103","301","301","302","302","100","300","104","100","300","300"]},"The profile  can be created based on existing dictionaries, such as a Chinese language dictionary or a Japanese language dictionary or English language dictionary as well as any dictionary of the one or more natural languages .

Similarly, any other type of topic domain profile  can be created and stored on the computing device. Frequently used or featured words, morphactins or punctuation marks of the one or more natural languages , the one or more symbols  or the one or more emoticons  can be extracted from such records to create a business partner relationship profile.

Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","602","600","604","606","608","604","606"]},"Depending on the desired configuration, processor  may be of any type including but not limited to a microprocessor (\u03bcP), a microcontroller (\u03bcC), a digital signal processor (DSP), or any combination thereof.

This described basic configuration  is illustrated in  by those components within the inner dashed line.","Computing device  may have additional features or functionality, and additional interfaces to facilitate communications between basic configuration  and any required devices and interfaces. For example, a bus\/interface controller  may be used to facilitate communications between basic configuration  and one or more data storage devices  via a storage interface bus . Data storage devices  may be removable storage devices , non-removable storage devices , or a combination thereof. Examples of removable storage and non-removable storage devices include magnetic disk devices such as flexible disk drives and hard-disk drives (HDD), optical disk drives such as compact disk (CD) drives or digital versatile disk (DVD) drives, solid state drives (SSD), and tape drives to name a few. Example computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.","System memory , removable storage devices  and non-removable storage devices  are examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which may be used to store the desired information and which may be accessed by computing device .

An example communication device  includes a network controller , which may be arranged to facilitate communications with one or more other computing devices  over a network communication link via one or more communication ports .","The network communication link may be one example of a communication media. Communication media may generally be embodied by computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and may include any information delivery media. A \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d may be a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio frequency (RF), microwave, infrared (IR) and other wireless media.

Computing device  may also be implemented as a personal computer including both laptop computer and non-laptop computer configurations. The computing device  can also be any type of network computing device. The computing device  can also be an automated system as described herein.","The embodiments described herein may include the use of a special purpose or general-purpose computer including various computer hardware or software modules.","Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.

The different components, modules, engines, and services described herein may be implemented as objects or processes that execute on the computing system (e.g., as separate threads). While the system and methods described herein are preferably implemented in software, implementations in hardware or a combination of software and hardware are also possible and contemplated. In this description, a \u201ccomputing entity\u201d may be any computing system as previously defined herein, or any module or combination of modulates running on a computing system.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that, for this and other processes and methods disclosed herein, the functions performed in the processes and methods may be implemented in differing order. Furthermore, the outlined steps and operations are only provided as examples, and some of the steps and operations may be optional, combined into fewer steps and operations, or expanded into additional steps and operations without detracting from the essence of the disclosed embodiments.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described herein, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.","With respect to the use of substantially any plural and\/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and\/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and\/or application. The various singular\/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.","As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible sub ranges and combinations of sub ranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as \u201cup to,\u201d \u201cat least,\u201d and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into sub ranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 cells. Similarly, a group having 1-5 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 cells, and so forth.","From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that various embodiments of the present disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, and that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.
