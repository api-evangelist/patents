{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Governmental Interest\u2014The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a matrix composite systems for ballistic-resistant material systems, which may be useful for military, homeland security, law enforcement and other applications.","More particularly, these systems provide enhanced protection against blast and shockwaves, along with the potential for increased protection against mild traumatic brain injury (mild-TBI), blunt impacts, as well as ballistic impact performance against high energy fragments and small arms threats in accordance with the respective performance specification requirements.","The present invention identifies and discloses matrix composites that are used in a variety of applications such as helmet and armor material systems with enhanced blast mitigation and blunt impact protection, and face shields with enhanced blast mitigation and ballistic impact protection, potentially against traumatic brain injuries, for next generation integrated headgear protective systems. Embodiments of the present invention also can provide transparent lightweight armor with improved ballistic impact protection for vehicle windows shield systems.","Protective helmets and armor have been used for both military and non-military applications to provide personnel protection, and are designed through a number of mechanisms, including elastic-plastic deformation, strain delocalization and shock impedance mismatch. These ballistic-resistant articles are typically formed by combining multi-layers of high strength fibers consolidated in a polymer matrix material. Thermoset resins are commonly used in a fiber reinforced composite structure for ballistic resistance. These include, but are not limited to, butyl rubber toughened phenolics along with aramid fabric reinforcements.","Also, thermoplastic resins are used in both rigid and flexible composites applications. These include elastomers such as styrene-isoprene-styrene and styrene-ethylene\/butylene-styrene block copolymers, as well as polyurethanes. One of the major advantages of these thermoplastic resins is their applicability in the form of aqueous dispersions without the need of organic solvents, thus lessening environmental concerns. These types of thermoplastic resins are often used in conjunction with polyethylene fibers or the hybrid of aramid and polyethylene fibers to achieve the desired ballistic impact performance and stiffness requirements.","While conventional helmets and armor are suitable for protection against small arms fire (e.g., 9 mm hand-gun bullets) and fragmentation, these designs are not capable to divert and dissipate shockwaves from the head and thus are unable to prevent subsequent traumatic brain injury. Protection against blast and shockwaves, however, requires substantial improvement over such helmets due to the significantly increased pressure and energy expelled by the blast and shockwaves. In fact, it has been reported that soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan when encountered shockwaves as a result of air blasts with overpressures in the kPa-1 MPa range often suffered mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is detrimental and can result in long-term medical problems.","Thus, further improvements in protection against blast and shockwaves would be beneficial.","Aspects of the present invention relate to a matrix composite comprising high strain-rate sensitive elastomers in the form of a multi-layer construct, which provides ballistic-resistant material systems with enhanced protection against blast damage as well as ballistic impact. High strain-rate sensitive elastomers, in accordance with this invention, are those with the capability to transition from rubbery-like towards glassy-like deformation response at strain rates, typically in the range of 10-10\/sec, and correspondingly, with potential to exhibit significant enhancement in shockwaves dissipation as well as in mechanical strength in comparison to the low rate loading properties.","According to one embodiment, a matrix composite for impact resistance and blast mitigation formed in a multi-layer configuration may include: (a) one or more outer layers comprising poly(urethane urea) having a strain-rate sensitivity characteristic in the range of 1,000\/sec to 1,000,000\/sec; and (b) one or more inner layers comprising poly(urethane urea) having a strain-rate sensitivity characteristic in the range of 10,000\/sec to 1,000,000\/sec.","The poly(urethane urea) may be formed of 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, diethyltoluenediamine, and poly (tetramethylene oxide), for example. In some embodiments, the poly(urethane urea)s of the one or more outer layers are formed of about 39 wt. % 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, about 13 wt. % diethyltoluenediamine, and about 48 wt. % poly(tetramethylene oxide), with the molecular weight of the poly(tetramethylene oxide) being about 650 g\/mol. Or, in other embodiments, the poly(urethane urea)s of the one or more inner layers are formed of: about 31-34 wt. % 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate; about 10-14 wt. % diethyltoluenediamine; and about 52-59 wt. % poly(tetramethylene oxide), with the molecular weight of poly(tetramethylene oxide) being about 1,000 g\/mol. In some instances, the materials of the outer and inner layers may comprise the same poly(urethane urea) chemistry but have a predominantly phase-mixed microstructure.","The poly(urethane urea)s of the outer and inner layers are generally amorphous. And the poly(urethane urea)s of the outer and inner layers are not covalently cross-linked. In some embodiments, the one or more outer-layers or an intermediate layer can be formed of a prepreg material, with the prepreg materials including fiber reinforcements encapsulated in a poly(urethane urea) matrix.","In some embodiments, one or more outer-layers may include hollow glass microspheres encapsulated in a poly(urethane urea) matrix. The inner and outer layers can have a tensile modulus of at least about 1,320 psi (9.1 MPa) at 100% strain measured at a strain rate about 0.01\/sec. And the one or more inner layers can have a greater tensile strength than those of the one or more outer layers, despite the one or more inner layers and the one or more outer layers having similar tensile modulus values.","The compressive flow stress values of the inner and outer layers at strain rates about 1,000-2,500\/sec may be higher in comparison with the corresponding compressive flow stress values at strain rates about 0.01\/sec. Also, the strain-rate sensitivity of the one or more outer layers may be greater than those of the one or more inner layers at a strain-rates of about 1,000-2,500\/sec. The outer-most of the one or more outer layers may have the greatest strain-rate hardening characteristic of all layers. The segmental relaxation time of the outer-most of the one or more outer layers can be approximately 2\u00d710s at 25\u00b0 C. The values of segmental relaxation time of the one or more inner layers may be approximately 7.5-10.5\u00d710s at 25\u00b0 C. The one or more inner layers may comprise at least two different types of layers as a unit, the unit being repeated one or more times in the matrix composite. In various embodiments, one or more of the poly(urethane urea) layers can be applied as an adhesive, aqueous dispersion, or a film. Also one of the one or more outer layers can comprises a bi-layer that includes a poly(urethane urea) layer and a glass layer in some embodiments.","According to various embodiments, the matrix composites may be incorporated into various ballistic-resistant material systems. These may be configured as a helmet, armor, face shield, or a transparent window element, for instance. In the ballistic-resistant material system, each of the one or more outer layers may be approximately the same thickness; and each of the one or more inner layers may be approximately the same thickness.","High performance elastomers which are capable of visco-elastic rubber-to-glass transition at increasing strain rates have potential for greater energy absorption and dissipation upon impact. This mechanism, as recognized by Bogoslovov R. B., Roland C. M., Gamache R. M., Applied Physics Letters, 90, 221910-12 (2007), is significantly different from a number of other potential mechanisms, including elastic-plastic deformation, strain delocalization and shock impedance mismatch, which have been utilized in design of conventional ballistic- and blast-resistant material systems.","By exploiting high strain-rate sensitive elastomers, a matrix composite formed of a multi-layer construct, is highly effective to dissipate impact energy. The matrix composite provides effective protection for helmets and other armor related systems against blast and shockwaves from explosions and ballistic impacts, in addition to protection against high energy fragments, small arms threats and blunt impacts. This will considerably enhance the safety of military personnel and law enforcement users when confronted with not only dangerous and potentially life-threatening situations such as projectile impact and blast events but also with potentially long-term depression as a result of mild traumatic brain injury from shockwave hazards.","More specifically, a matrix composite formed of a multi-layer construct is a key to providing an ballistic-resistant material system with enhanced energy dissipation and shockwaves damage mitigation capabilities. In addition, a broad range of applications can be derived in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.","For purposes of the invention, a matrix composite comprised of multiple elastomers having high strain-rate hardening characteristics is configured in a multilayer construct to provide ballistic-resistant material system with the potential of enhanced protection against blast and shockwaves, blunt trauma, and mild traumatic brain injuries, in addition to protection against shrapnel, high energy fragments and small arms threats. As used herein, the term \u201cstrain-rate hardening characteristic\u201d means that the elastomers can undergo dynamic strain-rate hardening and stress dissipation by transitioning from a rubbery-like deformation response towards a glassy-like deformation response. More particularly, in the context of the invention, strain rates which the matrix composite in a multilayer construct may be subjected to, typically are expected to be in the range of about 10-10\/second. This range may be of relevance to many ballistic impact and blast events that are anticipated for many armor systems.","In accordance with various embodiments of this invention' elastomers that are capable of providing high strain-rate sensitivity may be utilized to dissipate impact energy. This can be realized as the deformation strain-rate is approaching or even greater than the average segmental mobility of a poly(urethane urea) elastomer, in which the elastomer will have a glassy-like behavior. The average segmental mobility is equivalent to the reciprocal of an average segmental relaxation time of a given polymer. The average segmental relaxation time can be determined, for example, by using broadband dielectric spectroscopy via a control system (such as a Novocontrol Concept system, for instance), whereby measurements of dielectric loss (\u2208\u2033) as a function of frequency are obtained in the frequency range of 10to 10Hz. The segmental relaxation time is typically defined as the reciprocal of (2\u03c0f), where fis the frequency of the peak maximum in the plot of dielectric loss vs. frequency.","Different types of intermolecular hydrogen bonding are present among the family of polyurethane, poly(urethane urea) and polyurea elastomers. The binding energy calculated using quantum mechanics for the hydrogen bonding between the urethane and urethane groups is about 10.3 kcal\/mol, which is weaker than the corresponding binding energy values calculated for the hydrogen bonding between urethane and urea groups (about 13.0 kcal\/mol) as well as for that between urea and urea groups (about 14.2 kcal\/mol). The urethane-urethane hydrogen bonding is predominant in polyurethanes, whereas intermolecular urea-urea, urea-urethane and urethane-urethane hydrogen bonding are all present in poly(urethane urea)s, suggesting poly(urethane urea)s provide better mechanical strength in comparison with the corresponding polyurethanes.","Thus, in accordance with various embodiments of this invention, poly(urethane urea), which may be abbreviated herein simply as PUU, may preferably be used. PUU elastomers are thermoplastic, prepared from reaction of a diisocyanate, a diamine and a polyol. In various embodiments, the diisocyanate may be selected from the group consisting of 4,4\u2032-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, and any mixture thereof, the diamine may be selected from the group consisting of dimethylphenylenediamine, diethyltoluenediamine, 4,4\u2032-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine), and any mixture thereof, and the polyol may be selected from the group consisting of poly(propylene oxide), poly(tetramethylene oxide), polycaprolactone diol, polycarbonate diol, and any mixture thereof.","The PUU elastomers may be formed to be generally amorphous and not chemically cross-linked. For instance, the choice of diisocyanate, diamine and polyol may all have functionality equal to about two, but no more, to ensure no chemical cross-linking reaction occurred during synthesis. Moreover, the choice of diisocyanate, diamine and polyol may be selected to render PUUs amorphous, but not crystalline or semi-crystalline.","According to aspects of the invention, elastomers may be prepared having unique properties. More particularly, the elastomers may have tunable microstructure and viscoelastic relaxation characteristics. In the case of PUU, segmental dynamics derived from the analysis of dielectric relaxation data obtained from dielectric spectroscopy measurements for select model PUU elastomers, can be used to tune the dynamic relaxation over a range of approximately four decades or greater in ambient conditions for energy absorption\/dissipation and shock wave mitigation. The response tuning can vary with respect to their corresponding segmental mobility.","Previously, the influence of molecular mechanisms on microstructure evolution in select model PUUs was demonstrated by Strawhecker K. E., Hsieh A. J., Chantawansri T. L., Kalcioglu Z. I., Van Vliet K. J., in \u201cInfluence of microstructure on micro-\/nano-mechanical measurements of select model transparent poly(urethane urea) elastomers,\u201d Polymer 54 (2013) 901-908, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. PUUs, for instance, comprise a plurality of both hard and soft segments in polymer form\u2014giving rise to a complex microstructure, wherein a broad range of phase formation may occur, including phase-mixed and microphase-separated regions, as well as any mixture thereof, that influence dynamic mechanical strengthening and chemical hardening. The extent of microphase separation which dependent upon the composition can be analyzed by using small-angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Hard segments are formed by reaction of a diisocyanate and a diamine and provide rigidity and stiffness, whereas soft segments are predominantly composed of a long-chain polyol and provide flexibility and toughness, wherein polyol also reacts with a diisocyanate to form covalent bonds linking with hard segments in a polymer chain. The ratio or amount of hard and soft segments in the PUU polymer can be selectively tailored based on its versatile chemistry.","Using the molecular mechanisms previously demonstrated, the overall dynamic mechanical response thus can be optimized for one or more, and preferably each, elastomer layer of a multilayer construct in accordance with embodiments herein. In some cases, energy dissipation within the outermost layer(s) that face impacts may be maximized and energy absorption may be significantly improved throughout the multilayer construct. Molecular dynamic models can be used to study the effects of hard segment content and\/or the molecular weight of the soft segments on local morphology and rate-dependent mechanical behaviors in the ballistic regime to determine a PUU chemistry having a particular strain-rate sensitivity characteristic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"On the other hand, the lamellar segments form through self assembly of hard segments oriented generally perpendicular to the axis of the polymer chain. They form primarily because of the strong bonding strength between hard segments, wherein the binding energy is about 14.2 kcal\/mol, calculated using quantum mechanics for the hydrogen bonding between urea and urea groups. This is higher than the corresponding binding energy values calculated for the hydrogen bonding between urea and urethane groups as well as between urethane and urethane groups in a PUU-based polymer chain.","The degree of each structure present in the PUU elastomer depends on the specific chemistry of the polymer. More particularly, it has been found that the molecular weight of soft segment (i.e., PTMO) plays an important role in the extent of phase mixing and its effect on the corresponding segmental dynamics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"]},"Table 1, below, lists the compositions of three PUU elastomers\u2014PUU A, PUU B and PUU C\u2014along with the corresponding tensile modulus and tensile strength values determined at a strain rate about 0.01\/second.","Tensile modulus refers to a measure of the stiffness of a material, whereas tensile strength refers to a measure of the ultimate capacity of a material to resist a tensile load before failure, although having the same units. In the context of the invention, these are important variables because the preferred PUU elastomers comprising optimized tensile stiffness and tensile strength, particularly in the form of a matrix composite in a multi-layer construct, can provide sufficient and desired mechanical strengthening for protection against ballistic impact. In some cases, PUU elatomers having similar tensile modulus values can possess different tensile strength values. Both the tensile modulus and the tensile strength can be varied by changing the composition of PUU elastomers.","Specifically, PUU A comprises about 31 wt. % 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, about 10 wt. % diethyltoluenediamine, and about 59 wt. % poly(tetramethylene oxide), where the molecular weight of poly(tetramethylene oxide) is 1,000 g\/mol. PUU B comprises about 34 wt. % 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, about 14 wt. % diethyltoluenediamine, and about 52 wt. % poly(tetramethylene oxide), where the molecular weight of poly(tetramethylene oxide) is 1,000 g\/mol. PUU C comprises about 39 wt. % 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, about 13 wt. % diethyltoluenediamine, and about 48 wt. % poly(tetramethylene oxide), where the molecular weight of poly(tetramethylene oxide) is 650 g\/mol.","Microstructure is known to be very complex in thermoplastic elastomers. Typically, engineering thermoplastic elastomers, such as Kraton\u00ae and spandex (or Lycra\u00ae) are microphase-separated. In accordance with various embodiments of this invention, the preferred poly(urethane urea) elastomers that are capable of providing high strain-rate sensitivity comprise a preferred microstructure which is mostly phase-mixed, but predominantly not microphase-separated.","In further accordance of various embodiments of this invention, the extent of phase-mixing is most significant in PUU C of the preferred poly(urethane urea) elastomers based on the atomic force microscopy measurements, for example, as described by Strawhecker K.
