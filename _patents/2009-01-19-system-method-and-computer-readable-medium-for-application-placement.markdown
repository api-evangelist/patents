{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates to multimedia services and applications and in particular to the placement of applications in a multimedia platform such as an Internet Protocol TeleVision (IPTV) service platform.","The state of the art in multimedia platforms focuses on content management and content deployment. For example, AdPoint by Tanberg manages the next generation of video advertising technologies, including Video On Demand (VOD) advertisement placements and targeted ad systems. In this context, application placement such as content and advertisements are implemented within the video streams based on configurable and provisionable methods of procedure.","A problem with existing platforms is that applications are deployed within multimedia services based on pre-configured schedules, preset view lists and hard-coded rules.","What is required is a system, method and computer readable medium that can handle the needs of a dynamic multimedia environment from multiple perspectives, including the need to coordinate in real-time how applications are invoked and how application features interact based on configurable rules.","In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a system comprising a plurality of devices providing service delivery to a user and an application placement system that detects an event, determines an application associated with the event and causes the application to be executed in one or more of the devices.","In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided an application placement system comprising an event adaptor that maps a plurality of trigger events to a plurality of application events and an application placement engine. The application placement engine receives an application event from the event adaptor and invokes an application associated with the application event in one or more end devices.","In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method of placing an application comprising detecting a trigger event, determining an application associated with the trigger event, and invoking the application in an end device.","In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method for invoking an application in a device comprising triggering an application event in a first device and invoking an application associated with the application device in a second device.","In one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a computer readable medium comprising instructions for detecting an application event, determining an application associated with the application event, determining a device associated with the application event and invoking the application in the device.","A service delivery system  is illustrated in . The service delivery system  delivers communications services to end devices  through a plurality of service delivery platforms . Service categories may include voice , data  and media . Voice services may include PSTN, PLMN, Voice over IP (VoIP) and messaging. Data services may include web, internet, data, email and messaging. Media services may include television, IPTV, satellite, cable, and interactive television (iTV). Other services will be apparent to a person skilled in the art. Architectures and platforms for delivery of these services are known to a person skilled in the art and are therefore not detailed here. An orchestrator  may be provided for blending of services across the multiple service delivery platforms , thereby allowing cross-correlation of services as will be described in further detail below. The orchestrator  provides service enablers for the service delivery platforms . The orchestrator is thus used to translate events between service delivery platforms and the access world, coordinate services and applications interactions, federate end-user data across services and re-use functions\/resources of the service delivery platforms  into blended services. Through blending of services, end-to-end services may be provided across hybrid networks (e.g., PSTN Voice network and IPTV network) that leverage common resources transparently from development and deployment perspectives and seamlessly from a usage perspective.","End devices  may include computers ; television devices  such as IPTVs, set-top boxes (STB) and personal video recorders (PVR); fixed line telecommunications devices  such as a PSTN telephone; and mobile telecommunications devices  such as mobile telephones, mobile browsers, personal digital assistants (PDA) and the like. Other end devices will be apparent to a person skilled in the art.","In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the system  includes an application placement system  described in more detail with reference to . The application placement system  has an application placement engine , functioning as a finite state machine, that provides generic\/normalized interfaces between applications , e.g. App , App  . . . App N, and base services  through an application framework adaptor  and a base services framework adaptor  respectively. Base services  generically refers to application programming interfaces (API) for access to service delivery platform services at application and framework layers. Base services shown in  include Federated Data access logic & profile policy management ; Adaptive Multimedia Notification logic ; Security, Login, Authentication logic ; End-device adaptation logic ; Federated functions access logic (Presence, location, contact list, etc) ; and Web portal logic . Other base services will be apparent to the person skilled in the art.","The application placement engine  handles invocation of applications  based on events and logic of the service context. Events are mapped to applications by an event adaptor . Being event driven, the placement of applications is dynamic and can be performed in real-time. In various embodiments, events may include, without limitation, end-user actions; network service events; content provider events; Operation, Administration, Maintenance & Provisioning (OAM&P) events; Operation Support Systems (OSS) events; Basic Service Set (BSS) events; third party events, and other application events that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art. Events may be scheduled, logic-functionality driven, based on subscriber profile, based on service configuration and provisioning, based on network configuration and provisioning, or based on viewing patterns. OSS\/BSS events may be provided from OSS\/BSS systems  via an OSS\/BSS adaptor API . Events may be initiated in other ways apparent to a person skilled in the art.","Once the application placement system  invokes an application, the application placement system  is not involved in the execution of the application. In one embodiment, applications can be invoked simply via forwarding an HTTP request from a set-top box (STB) to an applications web server or sending a message to an application to start action.","In one embodiment, the application placement engine controls application placement for a plurality of users and is thus located in a central area such as operated by a service provider. In one embodiment, the application placement engine may be specific to a user's environment, for example within the user's home, in which case the application placement engine may be located within the user's premises (e.g. residential or business), shared between several premises or at the central location described above.","A method using the application system  of  will now be described with reference to the flowchart  of . At step , a triggered event is detected in the application placement system. The triggered event may be triggered in a manner as described above. At step , the event adaptor  determines an application  associated with the event and invokes the application in an end device  at step . In one embodiment, the event may be triggered in a first end device and the application may be invoked in a second end device.","A specific example will now be described with reference to . This example relates to an incoming call to a user's phone . The application placement system  of  is used to display the caller identity on the user's IPTV  via a Set-Top Box (STB) . The application placement engine  triggers a voice notification process to send a caller ID notification to the viewer. The application placement engine  is responsible for orchestrating all services required to accomplish the task (Federated Data, Security, Access Logic and Notification). A Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) process may be used to describe the orchestration of services. At step  () the application placement engine receives a caller ID trigger event from a voice portal application. The voice portal application uses the event adaptor API  () to map the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message INVITE to an application event type. The application placement engine  then invokes the federated data service  to determine the caller ID (step ). At step , a security service  check is performed and then the access logic service  is used (step ) to determine whether the notification service is currently available to the user. If available, the notification service  is invoked (step ) to the STB  to cause a popup display of the caller ID to be displayed on the user's TV  (step ).","A further example will now be described with reference to . This example relates to placement of a voicemail notification from a mobile phone  to a user's IPTV  via a STB . A voice portal application uses the event adaptor API  () to map the SIP message NOTIFY trigger event to an application event type and provides the application event to the application placement engine  (step ). The application placement engine  triggers a voice notification process to send a voicemail notification to the user. The application placement engine  then invokes the federated data service  to determine the caller ID (step ). At step , a security service  check is performed and then the access logic service  is used (step ) to determine whether the notification service is currently available to the user. If available, the notification service  is invoked (step ) to cause a popup display of a voicemail notification on the user's TV (step ).","As for the previous example, the application placement engine is responsible for orchestrating all services required to accomplish the notification (Federated Data, Security, Access Logic and Notification) using BPEL processes.","A further example will now be described with reference to . This example relates to placement of an email web application to a user's TV  via a STB . At step , the application placement engine  receives an STB Event triggered by a viewer, such as the selection of a configured button, e.g. the \u201cOK\u201d button on a remote control . The STB  sends an http GET command to a web portal service, which is adapted into an application event using the event adaptor API . The http GET command provides information related to the email application and at step , the application placement engine authenticates the viewer by invoking the security service . Next, the web portal service  \u201cuploads\u201d the email web application to the STB  (response to http GET) (step ) and the email application is displayed on the user's TV  (step ).","A further example will now be described with reference to . The example relates to the placement of interactive advertisements on a user's IPTV  via a STB . At step , the application placement engine  receives an STB Event triggered by a viewer, such as the selection of a configured button, e.g. the \u201cOK\u201d button on a remote control . The STB sends an http GET command to a web portal service, which is mapped into an application event using the event adaptor API . The http GET command provides information related to the interactive advertisement application and at step , the application placement engine  identifies the parameters of the destination media and end device (size, color, type) by invoking the end-device adaptation service . Next, the web portal service  \u201cuploads\u201d the interactive advertisement application to the STB  (response to http GET) (step ) and the interactive advertisement is displayed on the user's TV (step ).","In one embodiment, the interactive advertisement may be triggered by the user selecting a video on demand application. The interactive display of the ad may include additional commands, selected through buttons of the remote control , that allow more details of the advertisement to be viewed. For example, links may be provided to the advertiser's website, as well as commands to view the ad again or return to TV viewing. Selection of commands may invoke further applications, such as display of a website. The placement of the interactive advertisement by the application placement engine in response to video on demand viewing allows the timing of the placement of the advertisement to be varied without being limited to a fixed ad placement schedule. Interactive advertisement applications may be placed at other times, such as when a viewer re-starts viewing after pausing.","The Interactive Advertisement service allows the service provider to indicate to a viewer that an Interactive Ad is available by showing a small call-for-action indicator in a corner of the TV screen (e.g., blinking sign, popup). The user may choose to go interactive by selecting a remote control button (e.g., red button, OK button, or \u201cgo interactive\u201d), which may be customizable. The service provider may have the ability to choose the triggering context based on the service (e.g. Live TV program) and time an interactive application is available. For example, an interactive application may be available during a commercial ad airing; during a Live TV program; or before, during, and\/or after a VOD viewing.","Interactive ads may be regular ads or may be targeted ads, similar to dynamic web sites where dedicated ad spaces in a web page are populated with advertisements that match a certain number of criteria (e.g., user profile, viewing context, etc). User profile criteria may include gender, age, viewing profile (e.g., action movie). Where an interactive ad is available for showing, as indicated by a popup notification, the user may ignore the notification (timeout) or choose to see the details by selecting the appropriate remote control button.","In one embodiment, applications may include notification services which allow a service provider to display an unsolicited multimedia message (e.g. scrolling text\/graphic message bar) at a configurable date\/time. The service provider may have the ability to input the multimedia (text\/graphic\/audio) message to be displayed. The multimedia message can be used for promoting an event in a region or can be used as an Emergency Alert System (EAS). The multimedia message can be displayed in the screen regardless of the service being viewed (Live TV, VOD, Interactive Ad). In one embodiment, the viewer may not have control over the multimedia message display (e.g., the remote control cannot terminate the message). The service provider may have the ability to indicate the region where the text message shall be displayed (national, regional, local, per household, per STB).","The embodiments described above give the providers of multimedia services the flexibility to trigger applications without being restricted to hard-coded schedules, preset view lists and rigid rules. Since the application placement engine is a real-time engine, it can accommodate a wide range of configurable operational needs for optimal impact on consumers. The handling of feature interactions provided by one or more of the above described embodiments opens the door to defining new consumer and business oriented multimedia services, thus bringing in new sources of revenue to the service providers, the content providers and the technology suppliers.","In one embodiment described with reference to , the application placement system  may comprise at least one processor  operatively associated with at least one memory . The memory  may store an instruction set that may be executed on the processor . The instructions, when executed allow the application placement system to detect an application event , determine an application associated with the application event , determine a device associated with the application event  and invoke the application in the device .","Although embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanied drawings and described in the foregoing description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims.
