{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for operating a set of devices. In particular this invention relates to receiving a signal produced by a computer program, the signal comprising a game world model, analysing the signal to produce a real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup-language, and operating the devices according to the description.","When playing a computer game, the user's experience of the game consists, in most cases, of the viewing of a simple display device while listening to the associated audio. Since the advent of computer games, it has been desired to augment this user experience. A number of ways of achieving this have been proposed, including head mounted displays, surround screen installations and game peripherals such as rumble pads. The object of these functional improvements has been to increase the user's immersion in the game environment, or game world model. However a number of problems are apparent with the known improvements, including the high cost of any extra devices, the fact that most solutions are proprietary and therefore not transferable between platforms, and that generally each solution adds only a small additional functionality to the game world.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating a set of devices, comprising receiving a signal, analysing said signal to produce a real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language, and operating said devices according to said description.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for operating a set of devices, comprising receiving means for receiving a signal and analysing means for analysing said signal to produce a real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language.","The signal may be a broadcast signal or may be a signal produced by a computer program. The signal may comprise at least part of a game world model. The signal may comprise a video component. Preferably the description is distributed amongst said devices. The analysing can take place in real time, or can be carried out before it is needed, storing the real-world description locally and recalling that description on demand. The real-world description is preferably limited according to the functionality of the devices present in the set of devices.","Owing to the invention, it is possible to provide an enhanced experience of, for example, a computer game. By analysing the content of the signal making up the game and producing from it a real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language, the description can be used to operate a set of devices that will augment the experience.","The method of  illustrates how a user  of a computer game has their experience of the game augmented by the generation of a real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language. This instruction set is used to operate a set of devices that make up a real-world representation system. The markup language is used, in general, to describe the real world elements associated with the virtual world of the computer game that fall outside the part of the visual field available to the user.","The user  views a display  of a PC that displays a video component of the computer game. The display  can be thought of as showing a rendered part  of a game world model . The part  is typically the portion of the game world model  that relates to the particular location that the user is currently experiencing. As the user  \u201cmoves\u201d around the game world, the part that is rendered changes accordingly.","A translator  receives a signal produced by a computer program, which comprises at least part of the game world model , and analyses the signal to produce a real-world description  in the form of an instruction set of a markup language. In this example, the analysing takes place in real time, the signal that the translator  receives being the entire model . The translator  analyses the signal to identify the environment that is presently being rendered on the display , and generates an appropriate real-world description, which is passed to a browser . The real-world description can be updated rapidly, as the game progresses. The browser  is either present on a local server, or is distributed amongst the set of devices.","The translator  could be a plug in unit for the apparatus running the computer program. The unit would comprise receiving means for receiving the signal and analysing means for analysing the signal to produce the real-world description. Additionally distributing means could be included for distributing the description to the devices in the set. Alternatively the translator  could be implemented in software.","The real-world description is provided by a markup language that communicates a description of physical environments and the objects within them, their relationship to the user, each other and to the physical space. Within a location that is enabled to produce a real-world experience, the instruction set of the markup language is interpreted by a device or devices to render the experience. Each device that is enabled contains a component that interprets the instruction set to the best of its capability.","The language contains a wide range of states that can be rendered by the devices in a real-world representation system. Such states relate to:\n\n","Any information that relates to the game world experience can be expressed in this markup language. The browser  is arranged to interpret the description, which is then rendered by the devices in a real-world representation system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","14"]},"In addition to the display device , the walls  and floor  are provided with display functionality. This can be achieved either by the walls  and floor  being composed of fabric display material, or a centred ceiling projector can illuminate the visible portions of the walls  and the floor . It is also feasible to back light the walls  if the environment allows it.","The system of  is shown as being a room with a couch  for a user, the room being part of a private dwelling. However the room could be, for example, part of an entertainment complex or could form part of a public space. The devices making up the real-world representation system are arranged to receive a real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language, the devices being operated according to said description.","In a first embodiment (outlined in the flowchart of ) this description is distributed amongst the devices. Each markup language enabled device operates in principally the same manner. For example, the lighting device  has receiving means for receiving the real-world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language, the receiving means including part of the distributed browser  that interprets the instructions of the instruction set. The portion of the browser  in the receiving means communicates with adjusting means that is arranged to adjust one or more parameters of the lighting device . For example, if the real-world description reads <FOREST>, <SUMMER>, <EVENING> then the part of the browser  in the receiving means interprets this into specific instructions relating to the colour tones and luminance level for the adjusting means to adjust their levels accordingly. In this example the likely colour tone would be a pleasant green and the light level would be low but warm. The browser  interprets instructions of a general type to generate specific parameter adjustments.","The description is received by all of the other parts of the distributed browser  in each of the other devices in the real-world representation system. Each device interprets the instructions and adjusts its parameter configuration accordingly. The greater number of enabled devices that are present in a particular environment the more realistic the end result will be. In particular the operability of the walls  and floor  as display devices will determine how immersed in the real-world representation the user feels.","In a second embodiment (outlined in the flowchart of ) the description is read at a local server, which can be a dedicated device or could be contained within the capability of a device that nominally has a different purpose. In this embodiment a browser  or operating system is present on the local server and interprets the instructions of the real-world description and generates specific parameter adjustments for communicating to the relevant device. In this way devices currently available can be used without the requirement that they be modified or purpose built for use in the real-world representation system.","By using the game world model  to generate a markup language representation of the user's location, it is possible to extend the experience of the virtual location into the real world. This could also include audio, for example, a user could hear a monster creep up behind them. If a rocket just missed a user and hit the wall behind them, the lights at this location will glow yellow and red, and synchronise with the audio stream.","An alternative way of operating the set of devices is to generate the real-world description before it is needed, storing the real-world description locally and recalling the description on demand.","The real-world description, whether generated in real-time or before it is needed can be limited according to the functionality of the devices present in the set of devices. This saves on processing time and resources.","The computer game that the user is playing need not have a video component. For example, the user may be playing an electronic board game and the translator  will use the game world model  associated with the board game to generate a description in markup language. This description is rendered by the browser  to augment the user's experience of the electronic board game.","The method of operating a set of devices can also be utilised when the signal received by the translator  comprises a broadcast signal. The creation of the description from a broadcast signal allows the user to be immersed in an environment that is linked to a broadcast that he is receiving, for example a broadcast television signal. For example, the user may be watching a computer generated animation, that includes in the broadcast stream a signal comprising the model of the content. This signal can be analysed by the translator  to produce a real-world description that is used to operate the devices making up the real-world representation system.","The user can operate a user interface to set limits on the operation of the devices in the system. For example, if the user wishes to set the volume of those devices with an audio capability to a specific range or set an upper limit on the volume then they can do so via the user interface. This prevents experiences becoming unpleasant for the user. The level of the light and the rate of any change in light intensity are also things that the user can control. All of the parameters of the system can be user defined. The user interface can be portable."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"p":["Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
