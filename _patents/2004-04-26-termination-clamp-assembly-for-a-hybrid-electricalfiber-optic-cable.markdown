title: Termination clamp assembly for a hybrid electrical/fiber optic cable
abstract: A device for terminating a hybrid electrical/fiber optic cable at a connector comprising a clamp assembly affecting a swage lock on a k-tube to prevent movement of the k-tube within the connector and resultant damage to the optical fibers. The clamp assembly comprises two clamp halves, at least one of which includes a k-tube groove, one or more optical fiber grooves, a fan out cavity, and means for joining the clamp halves. When the clamp halves are joined, the k-tube grooves form an enclosed k-tube channel that is slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the k-tube, thereby creating a swage lock to prevent movement of the k-tube. Similarly, the optical fiber grooves create a swage lock on protective plastic tubes that are placed over the optical fibers as they exit and fan out from the k-tube in the fan out cavity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to fiber optic cable equipment and, more particularly, to cable terminations for hybrid electrical\/fiber optic cables.","2. Description of the Prior Art","In typical applications where optical fibers are used, these fibers are combined with standard electrical wires to create hybrid electrical\/fiber optic cables. These hybrid cables provide the optical fibers with the benefit of the electrical wires' relatively greater strength, and provide the further advantage that multiple wires are combined into a single, easily handled cable, thus requiring, e.g., fewer cable penetrations through the walls of a building, fewer wire hangers, and fewer man-hours to run the wires throughout the installation site. In the typical installation, the optical fibers are encased within a flexible, stainless steel \u201ck-tube\u201d which provides further support and protection to the fragile fibers. This k-tube is then encased with the electrical wires inside the hybrid cable.","When it is necessary, however, to terminate the hybrid cable, e.g., at a connection, the optical fibers must be separated from each other and from the electrical wires. A termination apparatus is required to \u201cfan out\u201d the optical fibers from the cable. Terminations of this type of hybrid cable typically include a transition where the optical fiber(s) exit the k-tube and enter protective plastic tube(s); the fibers must \u201cfan out\u201d from the k-tube. In previous terminations, this transition (or fan out) was accomplished by means of heat-shrink tubing and adhesive and the transition was potted with polyurethane in a connector shell.","The development of this invention was prompted by a series of failures wherein one or more optical fibers broke within a hybrid cable termination\/connector. The breakage occurred during routine handling of the cable and was caused by movement of the end of the k-tube within the connector. The use of heat shrink tubing and adhesive and potting the termination inside the connector proved inadequate to stabilize the k-tube, which pushed through the potting, thereby causing the optical fibers to break. Before the present invention, there was no effective way to immobilize the k-tube and control the fan out in these hybrid cable terminations.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a simple and convenient means to terminate a hybrid electrical\/fiber optic cable at a connector while further providing a secure and robust transition of the optical fibers from within a k-tube to individual protective plastic tubes.","It is therefore a further object of the present invention to provide a convenient means to manage the electrical wires and support the cable clamp assembly during the process of installing the connector.","The present invention provides a simple and convenient means to terminate a hybrid electrical\/fiber optic cable at a connector while further providing a secure and robust transition of the optical fibers from within a k-tube to individual protective plastic tubes. The end of the k-tube is held firmly in place within the connector and is thereby prevented from damaging or breaking the fragile optical fibers.","Specifically, the k-tube is prevented from damaging or breaking the optical fibers by creating a swage lock on the k-tube between two halves of a clamp assembly. This swage lock prevents the k-tube from moving relative to the optical fibers that emerge from within the k-tube. A fan out chamber is located in the interior of the clamp assembly to allow the optical fibers to fan out from the k-tube. A protective plastic tube is placed over each individual optical fiber as it exits the clamp assembly. The plastic tubes are held in place as they exit the clamp assembly by swage locks created in a similar manner as for the k-tube. The swage locks are accomplished by placing the k-tube and plastic tubes within relatively shallow grooves in the mating surfaces of one or both of the half bodies of the clamp assembly and joining the halves together, thereby slightly compressing the k-tube and plastic tubes within their respective grooves.","A least one of the clamp assembly halves has one or more longitudinal passages through which the electrical wires of the hybrid cable can pass. An advantage of this feature of the invention is that the electrical wires passing through the passages can support the clamp assembly halves while the k-tube and optical fibers are being positioned in the clamp assembly and while the clamp assembly halves are being joined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 1\u20135","b":["10","10"]},"The clamp assembly  comprises two clamp body halves  and  having mating surfaces  and , respectively (see ). Referring to , the k-tube  (not shown in this figure for clarity and for depiction of structure of the clamp) is positioned in a preferably semi-cylindrical k-tube groove  of the clamp body half  so that the end of the k-tube  is within the guide mark region . The guide mark region  provides a visual indication to the assembler that the k-tube  is properly positioned in the k-tube groove . The guide mark region  can be etched or otherwise cut or molded into the surface of clamp body half , as shown in , or it can be marked with ink, paint or equivalent marking means.","As shown in , the clamp body half  has a k-tube groove  and guide mark region  similar to those on the clamp body half . When the clamp body half  is positioned over clamp body half  and the clamp body halves are joined together, the k-tube  is captured within the assembly. This capture occurs because the diameter of a k-tube channel  formed by k-tube grooves  of the two clamp body halves  and , is slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the k-tube  (See ). In typical use, the diameter of each of the k-tube grooves  is 4% to 5% smaller than the diameter of the k-tube . Joining the clamp body halves  and  together creates a swage lock of the clamp assembly  onto the k-tube . Four (4) screws  or similar mechanical fasteners are used to fasten the clamp body halves  and  together. Laboratory tests have demonstrated that the resulting swage lock will sustain a linear force during typical operations.","As shown in , two optical fibers  emerge from the end of the k-tube  within a fan out cavity . These fibers are routed through individual protective plastic tubes  which are placed in separate, preferably semi-cylindrical, fiber grooves  in the clamp body halves  and . The fiber grooves  capture the plastic tubes  in a swage lock during assembly in the same way that the k-tube  is captured by the k-tube grooves  when clamp body halves  and  are joined. Preferably, the fiber grooves  are sized so that the swage lock is tight enough to prevent the plastic tubes  from moving while still allowing the optical fibers  to move within the plastic tubes .  shows the cylindrical fiber channels  formed by the fiber grooves  that capture the individual plastic tubes .","Referring again to ,  and , each clamp body half  and  has a fan out cavity  disposed within the center of its respective mating surface  and . These fan out cavities  are configured so that they form a fan out chamber (not shown) when the clamp body halves  and  are fastened together. Bumpers  are located on the interior wall of each fan out cavity  near the end where the fiber grooves  are located. The bumpers  provide the user with a tactile means to verify that the plastic tubes  are properly and fully positioned within the clamp assembly . They also prevent the plastic tubes  from protruding into the fan out cavity  where the optical fibers  fan out from the end of the k-tube  to the plastic tubes . During assembly, while the screws  are within a turn of being fully tightened, the protective plastic tubes  are loosely positioned within the channels  formed by the fiber grooves . This feature allows the assembler to move the plastic tubes  within the channels  and feel when they hit the bumper .","Threaded holes  are provided in clamp body half  and clearance holes  are provided in clamp body half . The holes  and  are sized to receive the screws  to thereby fasten the two clamp body halves  and  together. As shown in , the clearance holes  and the threaded holes  are located along the edges of the clamp body halves  and  near where the k-tube  is positioned. This location of the holes ensures maximum clamping force of the clamp body halves  and  onto the k-tube  when the screws  are tightened into the holes.","As shown in , a plurality of longitudinal wire passages  provides passage for the electrical wires (not shown) of the hybrid cable. During assembly of the present invention, the clamp body halves  and  are slid onto the electrical wires, which then act together as an assembly aid by supporting the clamp body halves  and  while the k-tube  and plastic tubes  are positioned properly into their respective grooves  and .","An advantageous feature of the preferred embodiment is its ability to prevent a viscous liquid such as a potting material from entering the fan out cavity  and contacting the exposed optical fibers . The compression fit of the clamp assembly  around both the k-tube  and the plastic tubes  is sufficient to prevent a viscous fluid from penetrating into the fan out cavity  along either the k-tube grooves  or the fiber grooves . When the clamp body halves  and  are tightly joined together, the flat mating surfaces  and  also form a mechanical seal that is sufficient to prevent viscous fluids from entering the fan out cavity . This seal is advantageous because it allows the cable clamp assembly , the k-tube  and electrical wires, to be \u201cpotted\u201d within a cable grip using polyurethane or epoxy resin. This potting, when adhered to both the cable grip and the clamp assembly, immobilizes the assembly and, therefore, also the captured k-tube .","In practice, the preferred method of assembling and using the present invention at the termination of a hybrid electrical\/fiber optic cable begins with separating the k-tube  from the electrical wires in the cable. One or more of the electrical wires are passed through the wire passage(s)  in clamp body half  and at least one other electrical wire is passed through a wire passage  in clamp body half . The electrical wires can then support the clamp body halves  and  during the remainder of the clamp assembly process.","The k-tube  is trimmed back so that the ends of the optical fibers  protrude from the end of the k-tube. The k-tube  is then placed in the k-tube groove  of clamp body half  so that the end of the k-tube is adjacent to the guide mark region  on the mating surface  of clamp body half . A protective plastic tube  is slid over the portion of each of the optical fibers  that is outside of the k-tube . Each of the plastic tubes is then placed within a fiber groove  in the clamp body half .","At this point, the clamp body half  is positioned over the clamp body half  so that the mating surfaces  and  of the clamp body halves  and  are flush against each other in parallel contact, the k-tube  is inside k-tube groove  of clamp body half , and each of the plastic tubes  is inside one of the fiber grooves  in clamp body half . The screws  are inserted into clearance holes  and partially screwed into threaded holes  to hold the mating surfaces  and  in close proximity to each other and to loosely clamp the k-tube  and plastic tubes  in place, yet allow the plastic tubes  to be manually moved longitudinally (i.e., along the length of the fiber groove ) within the fiber grooves  by the assembler.","After the screws  are partially screwed into the threaded holes  as described above, each plastic tube  is moved longitudinally until the assembler feels the end of the plastic tube touch one of the bumpers  in the fan out chamber . This indicates to the assembler that the plastic tube  is fully inserted into the clamp assembly. When all of the plastic tubes  are so positioned, the screws  are further tightened as necessary to create a firm swage lock of the clamp body halves  and  onto the k-tube  and plastic tubes . The resultant cable clamp assembly , and the k-tube , optical fibers (in their protective plastic tubes) and electrical wires, are now ready to be potted within a cable grip using polyurethane, epoxy resin, or other viscous potting compound.","In one alternative embodiment of the invention, only one of the clamp body halves  and  has the fiber grooves . In this embodiment, the fiber grooves  in the second clamp body half will necessarily be deeper to accommodate nearly the entire diameter of the plastic tubes , yet remain small enough to provide the swage lock required to hold the plastic tubes  in place.","In yet another alternative embodiment of the invention, one of the clamp body halves  and  has only a flat mating surface, without a k-tube groove, fiber grooves, or a fan out cavity. In that embodiment, the second clamp body half will necessarily have a deeper k-tube groove to accommodate nearly the entire diameter of the k-tube  and deeper fiber grooves to accommodate nearly the entire diameter of the plastic tubes . Again, the grooves will still have to be small enough to provide the swage lock required to hold the k-tube  and plastic tubes  in place.","While the above discussion describes the preferred embodiment of the invention and some alternative embodiments, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example and not limitation. It will become apparent to those skilled in the art that equivalent alternative embodiments and alternative methods are possible. It is intended that all such alternative embodiments and methods shall be covered by the claims set forth herein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims and accompanying drawings where:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
