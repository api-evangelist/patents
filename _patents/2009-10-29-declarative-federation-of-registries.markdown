title: Declarative federation of registries
abstract: A registry helper is configured to facilitate the declarative federation of registries. The registry helper includes a reader module configured to read a declarative description for a target registry to obtain parameters pertaining to mirroring of the target registry in a federated registry. The registry helper also includes a listener registering module configured to register a listener for the target registry that enables external monitoring of the target registry based on the declarative description parameters and a change detecting module configured to detect a modification to the target registry via the listener. The registry helper further includes an updating module configured to update the federated registry in accordance with the detected modification to the target registry such that the federated registry mirrors the services of the target registry.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["One embodiment is directed generally to computer systems, and in particular to registries in computer systems.","Open specifications such as the Open Services Gateway Initiative (\u201cOSGi\u201d) have been developed for the delivery of managed services to networked environments. The OSGi specification defines the OSGi Service Platform, which consists of the OSGi framework and a set of standard service definitions. The OSGi framework includes a services platform and a deployment infrastructure. The services platform includes a service registry that allows service providers to be discovered through queries formulated in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\u201cLDAP\u201d) syntax.","While OSGi discusses \u201ca\u201d service registry, generally, disparate internal service registries exist in an enterprise system. Accordingly, implementations of a single OSGi registry have been created that mirror the entries of more than one internal registry in the OSGi registry. However, in order to mirror entries from an internal in-memory registry in the OSGi service registry, it is generally necessary to use the OSGi Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) pertaining to each registry. In such an implementation, the code is generally tightly coupled since all internal registries to be federated in the OSGi service registry have dependencies on the OSGi API itself. This leads to heavy dependencies in the code and a non-modular system. Further, code mirroring of the internal registries is ad-hoc in nature and generally does not deal with internal service objects of an internal registry being modified or removed.","In an embodiment, a registry helper is configured to facilitate the declarative federation of registries. The registry helper includes a reader module configured to read a declarative description for a target registry to obtain parameters pertaining to mirroring of the target registry in a federated registry. The registry helper also includes a listener registering module configured to register a listener for the target registry that enables external monitoring of the target registry based on the declarative description parameters and a change detecting module configured to detect a modification to the target registry via the listener. The registry helper further includes an updating module configured to update the federated registry in accordance with the detected modification to the target registry such that the federated registry mirrors the services of the target registry.","In some embodiments, a registry helper is configured to facilitate the declarative federation of registries. Individual, monitorable target internal registries are combined into a single federated (i.e., \u201cmirrored\u201d) registry that contains and makes available the services thereof via a common API. The monitorable internal registries are declaratively described in a declarative description that is stored in memory, which may be, for instance, an Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) file contained in a Java Archive (\u201cJAR\u201d) file that houses code for the internal, or local, registry. The registry helper may be implemented as an extender module that uses the declarative description in the JAR file in order to monitor the individual internal (or local) registries and copy entries from these internal registries into the federated registry. The registry helper detects modifications to the internal registry, such as additions of, changes to and deletions of service objects in the target registry. In this manner, a single, federated registry containing up-to-date representations of the services of multiple internal registries may be facilitated in a declarative manner.","While a Java implementation is discussed above, other programming languages, file types and programming constructs may be used. Further, all embodiments are not limited to OSGi. For instance, in some embodiments, a federated registry may be implemented outside of OSGi using class listeners.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","105","110","100","115","110","115","100","120","100"]},"Computer readable media may be any available media that can be accessed by processor  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, and communication media. Communication media may include computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media.","Processor  is further coupled via bus  to a display , such as a Liquid Crystal Display (\u201cLCD\u201d), for displaying information to a user, such as server status information. A keyboard  and a cursor control device , such as a computer mouse, is further coupled to bus  to enable a user to interface with server .","In one embodiment, memory  stores software modules that provide functionality when executed by processor . The modules include an operating system  that provides operating system functionality for server . The modules further include a registry helper  that is configured to facilitate the declarative federation of registries. Server  can be part of a larger system such as a cluster computing system, a distributed computing system, a cloud computing system, a \u201cserver farm\u201d or any other system having multiple servers and\/or computing devices. Server  will typically include one or more additional functional modules  to include additional functionality. In some embodiments, registry helper  may be part of operating system  or part of one or more other functional modules included in other functional modules .","It should be noted that many of the functional features described in this specification have been presented as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very large scale integration (\u201cVLSI\u201d) circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be at least partially implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified unit of executable code in a software module may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations that, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module. Modules may be stored on a computer-readable medium, which may be, for instance, a hard disk drive, a flash device, random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), a tape drive, an optical drive, a compact disk having read-only memory (\u201cCD-ROM\u201d) or a digital video disk having read-only memory (\u201cDVD-ROM\u201d), or any other such medium used to store data. The medium may be read-only or read\/write.","Indeed, a unit of executable code could be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","210","220","222","200","145","100","200","210","220","222","230","232","200","230","240","230","220","232","242","232","222"]},"In some embodiments, each declarative XML file for registry helper  must conform with a particular schema. The OSGi MANIFEST file, which may contain information such as the bundle name, bundle description, bundle version, bundle activator, import package and export package, may have an entry, perhaps named \u201cRegistry-Description\u201d, for example, that takes a comma-separated list of files conforming to the registry helper schema.

The first method in the chain of methods that is called should be a static method. For instance, if the registry-listener-method is \u201cgetInstance.addFooListener\u201d, the method \u201cgetInstance\u201d would be called on the registry-listener-class. Then, the method \u201caddFooListener\u201d would be called on the result from the \u201cgetInstance\u201d method. The last method in the dotted chain of methods should be of the form:","void anyMethodName(com.oracle.core.registryhelper.RegistryListener listener); This method may have the access modifier private, package, protected or public and should not throw any exceptions. The method may return any value that is desired, but the value returned by the method will be ignored by registry helper .","The optional registry-type\/unregister-listener-class string element gives the name of the class that can be used to unregister a listener on the internal registry. If not specified, this field will default to the value of the register-listener-class. This exists for the rare case that the unregister listener method is called on a different class from the register listener method.","The optional registry-type\/unregister-listener-method string element gives the name of the method to be called on the unregister-listener-class in order to remove a listener from the set of listeners listening on an internal registry. The method given here is also a \u201cdotted setter\u201d and follows the same semantics as discussed above with respect to registry-type\/registry-listener-class. If this field is not set, there is no mechanism to remove a listener from the set of listeners listening on an internal registry and registry helper  will not attempt to remove its listeners from that registry, even when shutting down. However, those registered listeners that should have been removed will perform no further actions even in the case that events fire on them.","The optional registry-type\/service-object-method string element gives the method to call on the object returned in the listener in order to get the object that should be placed in federated OSGi service registry . If not specified (or having the value \u201cthis\u201d) then the object returned in the listener is itself the object that should be placed into federated OSGi service registry . The method given is a \u201cdotted getter\u201d and follows similar rules as discussed above with respect to registry-type\/registry-listener-class, except that in this case, the final method in the string is also a getter method as opposed to a setter method.","The optional registry-type\/object-key-method string element gives the method to call on the object returned in the listener in order to get a suitable key for the object. The key returned should be suitable for use in a HashMap. If not specified (or having the value \u201cthis\u201d), then the object returned in the listener is itself suitable to be used as a key to uniquely identify the service object. The optional registry-type\/service-classes stanza gives the list of service classes under which this object should be registered. It will be of type service-classes-type. There will be at most one service-classes stanza in a registry stanza.","The required service-classes-type\/service-class string element gives the name of a fully qualified service class that the service object should be assignable to. There may be multiple service-class elements inside a service-classes stanza. In such as case, the service object should be assignable to all of the classes named.","The optional registry-type\/properties stanza gives information about properties that should be associated with the service object registration. It will be of type properties-type. There will be at most one properties stanza in a registry stanza.","The required properties-type\/property stanza gives information about a specific property that should be associated with the service object registration. It will be of type property-type. There can be multiple property stanzas in a properties stanza.","The property-type\/name string element gives the exact key in a key\/value pairing of a property to be associated with the service object registration. The property-type\/derived-name string element gives the name of the method to call to find the key in a key\/value pairing of a property to be associated with the service object registration. Either one of the \u201cname\u201d element or the \u201cderived-name\u201d element should be present in the property stanza. The name of the method should be a \u201cdotted getter\u201d and should follow the behavior discussed above with respect to the registry-type\/service-object-method.","The property-type\/value string element gives the exact value as a java.langString in a key\/value pairing of a property to be associated with the service object registration. The property-type\/derived-value string element will give the name of the method to call to find the value in a key\/value pairing of a property to be associated with the service object registration. Either one of the \u201cvalue\u201d element or the \u201cderived-value\u201d element should be present in the property stanza. The name of the method should be a \u201cdotted getter\u201d and should follow the behavior discussed above with respect to the registry-type\/service-object-method.","When registry helper  detects a bundle that has one or more registry helper files, registry helper  parses each file and begins monitoring the specified registry or registries that are declared in each file, placing them in federated OSGi service registry  as specified. Any parsing errors that occur may be logged. In this case, declarative XML file  indicates that bundle A  would like to mirror internal registry A  and declarative XML file  indicates that bundle B  would like to mirror internal registry B . The services from internal registries  and  are then mirrored in federated OSGi service registry .","Based on the registry-listener-class and registry-listener-method stanzas of the declarative XML files, registry helper  instantiates registry A listener  and registry B listener , respectively. Both internal registry A  and internal registry B  contain support classes  and  that support the addition of registry listeners. This enables registry helper  to track changes in internal registries  and . When services are added\/changed\/removed in either of internal registries  or , respective support classes  or  notify respective registry listener  or , which detects the event based on the notification. Registry helper  can then update the federated OSGi service registry  to reflect the service changes. In this manner, registry mirroring can be event driven and dynamic, allowing federated OSGi service registry  to mirror the services that are actually offered in monitored registries at any given time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"In some embodiments, the process of  may be performed, for example, by server  of  via registry helper . In , the process flow begins with registry helper  being started at . The computer on which registry helper  is running, such as a server, then awaits detection of a bundle event at . This could be performed iteratively or else be associated with, and triggered by, an event. The bundle events in this embodiment may be the detection of a new bundle or an indication to remove monitoring for an existing bundle, but in other embodiments, other bundle events are possible. If a bundle event is not detected at , registry helper  will proceed to determine whether a service event is detected in a monitored registry at . Since no registries are as of yet being monitored, this will be answered in the negative and if the registry helper has not closed at , registry helper  will continue to await detection of a bundle event at .","If a bundle event is detected at , registry helper  determines whether the bundle event is the addition of a new bundle at . If so, registry helper  checks the new bundle for registry helper files at . If registry helper files are not detected at , registry helper  will proceed to determine whether a service event is detected in a monitored registry at  and continue as discussed above. If registry helper files are detected, registry helper  will parse the files at  and instantiate appropriate registry listeners at . Registry helper  then determines whether a service event is detected in a monitored registry by a listener at . If yes, registry helper  determines the nature of the service change and updates the federated registry accordingly. If the bundle event is not the addition of a new bundle at , in this embodiment, the event must be an indication to remove a monitored bundle. Registry helper  removes the monitored bundle at . The process then iteratively continues in the manner illustrated in .","As disclosed, an embodiment is a registry helper that is configured to facilitate the declarative federation of registries. The registry helper determines whether bundles contain registry helper files and if so, parses the files to obtain the parameters contained therein, including a registry listener class and method. The registry helper mirrors the target registries in a federated service registry. The registry helper then instantiates registry listeners for each target registry indicated in the parsed parameters and begins listening on the target registries, which may be internal registries. When modifications to the target registry, which may include additions of, changes to or deletions of one or more service objects in the target registry, are detected by a registry listener for the associated target registry, the registry helper updates the federated service registry accordingly.","While the term \u201cserver\u201d has been used in the description of some embodiments of the present invention, the invention may be applied to many types of network computing devices.
