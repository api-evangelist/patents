title: Digital intermediate frequency receiver module for use in airborne SAR applications
abstract: A digital IF receiver (DRX) module directly compatible with advanced radar systems such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. The DRX can combine a 1 G-Sample/sec 8-bit ADC with high-speed digital signal processor, such as high gate-count FPGA technology or ASICs to realize a wideband IF receiver. DSP operations implemented in the DRX can include quadrature demodulation and multi-rate, variable-bandwidth IF filtering. Pulse-to-pulse (Doppler domain) filtering can also be implemented in the form of a presummer (accumulator) and an azimuth prefilter. An out of band noise source can be employed to provide a dither signal to the ADC, and later be removed by digital signal processing. Both the range and Doppler domain filtering operations can be implemented using a unique pane architecture which allows on-the-fly selection of the filter decimation factor, and hence, the filter bandwidth. The DRX module can include a standard VME-64 interface for control, status, and programming. An interface can provide phase history data to the real-time image formation processors. A third front-panel data port (FPDP) interface can send wide bandwidth, raw phase histories to a real-time phase history recorder for ground processing.

Therefore, the U.S. Government has rights to use of the present invention.","The present invention is generally related to synthetic aperture radar systems. More particularly, the present invention is related to radar receiver modules. The present invention is also related to digital intermediate frequency receiver modules and their use in radar applications.","Fine-resolution, high-performance synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system having real-time image formation capabilities are currently being developed. For example, a system being developed by Sandia National Laboratories has a 4 GHz first intermediate frequency (IF) receiver. A simplified block diagram of the current generation IF receiver is shown in  which has been labeled as prior art.","The first IF is currently translated into a 500 MHz 2IF , which facilitates the use of surface-acoustic wave (SAW) filters  for band-limiting the IF. The filtered 2IF is then quadrature converted  to base-band video (I and Q channels) prior to analog-to-digital conversion at analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) . IF translations, filtering and analog quadrature demodulation are performed in the receiver module. The digitization and some front-end digital signal processing (DSP) (presumming and high-pass filtering) is performed in the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) modules .","The primary disadvantages of an analog receiver implementation are:\n\n","What is needed is an improved system or module for receiving IF. The present inventors have found a way to overcome the limitations of analog receivers in SAR systems with use of a digital IF receiver.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a wideband SAR IF receiver, employing digital IF filtering and quadrature demodulation. A digital IF receiver upgrade can also be adapted to replace the analog receiver currently found in SAR systems.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a wideband SAR IF receiver, employing digital IF filtering and quadrature demodulation, is provided.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, use of a programmable digital IF receiver (DRX) module enables additional SAR DSP functions, such as Doppler-domain pre-filtering, to be performed prior to image formation.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a DRX module has been designed to be utilized for both a custom VME analog receiver and custom VME ADC module in the chassis of current generation radars. Both IF filtering and quadrature demodulation can be performed digitally using high-throughput DSP functions implemented in digital signal processor such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (e.g., FPGAs such as the Xilinx or Altera FPGAs) or ASICs. Digital implementation of these two critical functions in reconfigurable logic not only can expand the flexibility and parameter space of the radar, but can also improve critical performance metrics such as quadrature image rejection, amplitude flatness, and phase linearity. An additional benefit of digital implementation is that many performance metrics are now scaled to resource usage.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a dither signal is incorporated into the receiver to cause randomization of the quantization error. This dither signal is formed in a manner so that its spectrum does not overlap the desired signal, allowing its easy removal with digital signal processing, thereby enhancing Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) over conventional techniques.","In accordance with unique features of the present invention, a digital receiver (DRX) is described that can include the following components: an intermediate frequency (IF) converter as an analog front end for the digital receiver, said IF converter adapted to translate a first IF into a second IF; an analog-to-digital converter (ADC); a digital signal processor (DSP) including IF domain and Doppler domain filtering; at least one phase history data interface; a high-pass filter, said high pass filter for removal of residual DC at the demodulator output; a 0\/\u03c0 demodulator for removing 0\/\u03c0 modulation introduced by the radar waveform synthesizer and for use in concert with a presummer to remove ADC DC and synchronous spurious signals such as clock leakage; and a presummer, said presummer for summing multiple input vectors to produce a single output vector.","In accordance with the unique operable features of the present invention, the IF converter can creates a second IF operating at about a center frequency that is lower than the first IF, the IF converter can adapt the digital receiver for compatibility with the first IF prior to signal processing through the ADC, and the at least one phase history data interface can move data from the digital receiver to real-time image formation processors via a high-speed switched fabric backplane, and to the phase history recorder via a standard front panel data port.","Additional novel features of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon examination of the following detailed description of the invention or can be learned by practice of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description of the invention and the specific examples presented, while indicating certain embodiments of the present invention, are provided for illustration purposes only because various changes and modifications within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art from the detailed description of the invention and claims that follow.","Referring to , a simplified block diagram of the digital receiver (DRX) module  useful in accordance with the present invention is shown. The DRX, as shown, can be segregated into 4 functional subsystems:\n\n","The primary purpose of the IF converter  is to create a 2IF at a center frequency, e.g., 250 MHz, that is substantially lower than the first IF, prior to the ADC . Other useful IF converter functions, including ADC noise dither, gain adjustment, and receiver blanking, can be included but are not all specifically shown in FIG. . Noise dithering can be introduced using an adder , which will be explained in more detail below. The IF converter  is necessary for compatibility with the existing radar 4 GHz 1IF. Also, the phase history data interfaces \/ are required to get data from the DRX  to the real-time image formation processors via a high-speed switched fabric backplane, and to the phase history recorder via a standard Front Panel Data Port (FPDP).","The general performance parameters and features of an embodiment of the DRX  are summarized in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e1133","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Top-level performance parameters of the DRX module."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","DRX","Comments"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ADC Sample Rate","1 GHz",{}]},{"entry":["Max.

The demo board included a MAX108 ADC directly interfaced to a Xilinx\u2122 XC2V1000 FPGA as the DSP. The board also included a well-known commercially standard Versa-Module Eurocard (VME) interface for control and data interfacing with a PC.","An example Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot  of the ADC output using the demo board for the data acquisition is shown in FIG. . The test tone as shown is a single sine wave at a frequency of 246.22 MHz. The calculated ENOB, less harmonics and clock leakage, is 7.5 bits. The ENOB was found by the present inventors to remain relatively constant over test frequencies, versus input power levels.","There was concern that the ADC will not have sufficient linearity to meet the SAR system requirements for maximum intermodulation spurious levels and total harmonic distortion (THD). A two-tone, third-order intercept (TOI) measurement was performed to determine degradation to the radar receiver intermodulation performance caused by the ADC. It is desirable that a two-tone signal with peak amplitude close to the ADC saturation point (within \u02dc0.5 dB) result in an intermodulation level of <\u221245 to <\u221250 dBc.","A third-order intermodulation measurement of the MAX108 is shown  tested \u221257.9 dBc intermodulation level corresponded to a TOI of +18 dBm, which more than satisfied the linearity requirement.","As for the THD, the PSD plot of  shows a nominal THD of \u221257 dB. Frequency-swept measurements reveal a worse-case THD of \u221253 dB (Table 2), which satisfies the most stringent (<\u221250 dB) requirements.","ADC Noise Dithering","It is well known that the quantization process of the ADC introduces unwanted quantization spurious signals, which for certain IF signals such as single sine wave tones, are correlated with the desired signal. In a coherent radar system, the presence of spurious products, which are correlated with the signal of interest, is a major problem, since the \u201cnoise\u201d correlation does not allow SNR improvement through coherent processing (ex: SAR image formation). The presence of an adequate level of random noise at the ADC input can be beneficial in that the noise tends to randomize the quantization noise. Typically, an SAR can be operated such that its receiver gain is set to maintain a thermal noise level at the ADC input of approximately one Least Significant Bit (LSB) RMS. Prior analysis has shown that this level adequately \u201cdithers\u201d the ADC quantization without adversely affecting the SNR performance of the radar. There are, however, some radar imaging scenarios where close range, high scene reflectivity, and the desire to operate at high transmitter power (jammer immunity), forces the receiver gain to be reduced below that which provides a 1-bit RMS noise level at the ADC input. Under these conditions, the existence of a few bright point targets in the image can cause unwanted quantization spurious in the image product.","Referring back to , to maintain adequate SNR with reduced receiver gain, a band limited noise source  can be implemented via an adder  to ensure that the ADC is properly dithered for all ranges of receiver gain. Since the noise is band limited (low pass filtered), it can essentially be removed by the digital range decimation filter in the form of an adder after the ADC. The result, under the reduced receiver gain scenario, is as much as an 11 dB improvement in attainable system SNR when compared to using in-band (broadband) noise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00069","num":"00069"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","520","530","6","610"]},"The DRX Digital Signal Processor","Referring to , a simplified block diagram  of a DSP that can be utilized for DSP  as shown in , is presented. The DRX DSP used for the present invention can be viewed as necessarily being a high-throughput, high performance, two-dimensional (range and Doppler) prefilter for the SAR.","The output of the Analog Front End (AFE) submodule (IF converter), is input into the MAX108 ADC  operating at a sample rate (f) of 1 GHz. A necessary feature of the MAX108 is the inclusion of a built-in 1 to 2 demultiplexer. The two 8-bit demultiplexed channels, running at 500 MS\/s, can be interfaced directly with the Virtex II FPGA I\/O using a double data rate clock scheme. The data is then further demultiplexed 730 to 8 channels, each at a sample rate of 125 MS\/s. This is the FPGA internal clock rate for the DSP blocks. The 8, 125 MS\/s, 8-bit channels are the data input for the DSP.","As for integration of the 1stage range filter and quadrature demodulator, the first step is to produce quadrature demodulated signal pairs (I and Q) from the 1 GS\/s data, centered at 250 MHz. A diagram of the filter\/demodulator  is shown FIG. . Since the 2F center frequency is at \u00bcof the ADC sample rate, quadrature demodulation can be efficiently implemented. The demodulator can be melded with a decimate-by-4 polyphase filter. The diagram shows two inputs x(n) and x(n), representative of the two 500 MS\/s ADC outputs. Since the FPGA must be operated at a manageable clock frequency of 125 MS\/s, additional parallelization is required to make the filter run at speed. The fully parallel demodulator\/filter generally requires 16 parallel FIR filter blocks , each running at 125 MS\/s, in order to handle the 1 GS\/s aggregate input data rate. After summation , the output data rate of the demodulator\/filter is 250 MS\/s complex (I and Q).","A block diagram  of a fully parallel implementation of the filter\/demodulator , with an input demultiplexer , is shown in FIG. . Each I and Q channel is implemented as two demultiplexed channels operating at the FPGA clock rate of 125 MHz because the output aggregate data rate is 250 MS\/s per I and Q.","A sample output PSD plots of the simulated and hardware implemented demodulator are illustrated in and , respectively. For both Power spectral density (PSD) plots, the demodulator input is a single sine wave tone slightly offset from the 250 MHz IF center frequency. Also present at the input is a 1-bit RMS, band limited noise source. The demodulator output of the simulation  and hardware implementation  show a single tone near DC with a very low quadrature image (<\u221260 dBc). A simulation tool used by the present inventors to obtain the output in and was the Matlab\u2122\/Simulink\u2122 technical computing environment with the Xilinx\u2122 System Generator block set. The parallel filter implementation is equivalent to a 74 tap filter operating at an input data rate of 1 GS\/s. The input signal to the DRX ADC is a single tone slightly offset in frequency from the 2IF center of 250 MHz. In , the presence of clock spurs (marked with \u201cx\u201d), harmonics (marked with \u201co\u201d), and the quadrature image (marked with \u201c*\u201d) in the hardware implemented output can be noted.","A pulsed radar such as SAR, which operates over a wide range of radar-to-target range, must maximize its transmitter pulse width to maximize the on-target average radar energy, in order to maximize the radar SNR. This requires the pulse width to vary as a function of range. In a pulsed radar employing stretch processing (RF to IF bandwidth compression), the necessary IF bandwidth generally must be varied inversely proportional to the pulse width and, hence, the radar range. In the current generation analog receiver (shown in FIG. ), the IF bandwidth is determined by selecting one of three fixed SAW filters. In the DRX, the IF bandwidth can be selected by programming the range filter decimation factor. A high performance, high throughput filter topology will therefore be needed that has a variable decimation factor that can be adjusted \u201con-the-fly.\u201d The solution the present inventors successfully implemented can be referred to as the pane filter.","A simplified block diagram  showing the incorporation of a pane filter \/, as discussed with respect to , is shown in FIG. . The pane filter \/ is a Multiply\/Accumulate (MAC) based FIR filter with a polyphase construct.","A pane filter, such as pane filter \/ shown in , can comprise of Npanes  with each pane utilizing a multiplier  and an accumulator , which together can be referred to as a \u201cMAC\u201d. The data is distributed to each pane input via a tapped variable delay line . The output of each pane is registered then sequentially selected with the output N-to-I multiplexer . The number of panes required depends on the number of effective taps (T) necessary for the desired filter response. For a given number of taps and filter decimation factor D, the minimum number of panes required is simply T\/D. For the DRX, the range pane filter requires 20 panes to meet our requirements for filter form factor and stop-band Integrated Sidelobe Ratio (ISLR). A comparison of the 20 pane FIR filter to a bandwidth equivalent SAW filter is shown in and . Both a wideband  response as well as a detailed filter transition band  are shown.","Referring back to , the block diagram  shows two range pane filters,  and , at different locations in the DSP chain. The two-stage pane filter \/ affords some savings in FPGA resources, primarily in the form of coefficient registers. The location of the 2pane filter  allows the range vector length to be reduced prior to real-time image formation. This is beneficial for radar systems with limited on-board processing capability.","The two stage pane filter \/ allows the selection of one of 38 possible IF bandwidths in the 3.5 to 222 MHz range.  illustrates a plot  of how the IF bandwidth of the DRX is selected as a function of radar range. For illustration purposes, three different range FFT lengths (N)  of the image formation processor are shown. Nis roughly equal to the range vector length in the DRX DSP. A plot of the three SAW filter bandwidths  for the analog receiver is shown for comparison.","The inclusion of a FIR decimation filter in the Doppler or pulse-to-pulse domain is a great asset for many airborne SAR applications. By prefiltering and decimating the SAR azimuth samples, which are essentially vectors of range samples, the phase history data rate can be reduced significantly. Such a filter is dubbed the Azimuth Prefilter or APF. Referring again to , an Azimuth Prefilter  is shown incorporated in the system. Inclusion of an APF  is beneficial to systems where the illuminated Doppler bandwidth of the antenna greatly exceeds the Doppler bandwidth subtended by the final image product. A good example of such a system is the Sandia National Laboratories developed Concealed Target SAR (CTSAR), which operates within the 1 to 4 GHz band. For CTSAR, the APF  will cut the phase history data rate in half without sacrificing image size (along-track scene extent). This is highly desirable, considering the high phase history data rates for the CTSAR system and capabilities of current high speed data recorders.","A sample  of the decimate-by-two (D=2) filter response for a 6 and an 8-pane implementation of the DRX APF  is shown in FIG. . As with the range pane filters \/, the decimation factor is variable. The 6-pane APF for the DRX supports decimation factors from 1 to 8.","The APF  is implemented as a pane architecture similar to the range pane filter, with the exception that the APF filters data vectors as opposed to individual samples. The APF also delays the coefficients distributed to each pane, as opposed to the delayed-data implementation shown in FIG. . Since the accumulators must store accumulated vectors, the APF can consume large amounts of FPGA block RAM. Fortunately, the larger Virtex II FPGAs have been shown to possess ample block RAM to support the APF.","As shown by many test situations conducted by the inventors, it is desirable to inject a test signal at the DRX DSP input without having to connect an analog signal source. A good signal source for testing the DRX DSP chain is a simple sine wave tone. This can easily be implemented in the FPGA as a dual accumulator and sine ROM Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS). As shown in , the location of the data generator  at the filter\/demodulator input requires it to be implemented as 8 parallel channels.","To provide a simulated noise floor, the data generator  includes a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) pseudo-random noise generator (not shown).","Again referring to , a handful of additional DSP blocks are included in the DRX  to facilitate miscellaneous DSP functions and to support various radar modes. The additional functions include a high-pass filter , a 0\/\u03c0 demodulator , and a presummer .","The high-pass filter  serves to remove residual DC at the filter\/demodulator output . In radar employing analog quadrature demodulation, the high-pass filter  primarily removes the unwanted DC bias of the ADCs. For the DRX, the ADC DC bias is practically eliminated by the digital quadrature demodulator . The high-pass filter  is only included in the DRX to eliminate any 250 MHz ADC data clock leakage which would manifest itself as DC at the demodulator output.","The 0\/\u03c0 demodulator  serves to remove 0\/\u03c0 modulation introduced by the radar waveform synthesizer (not shown). 0\/\u03c0 modulation\/demodulation is used routinely, in concert with the presummer , to remove ADC DC and synchronous spurious signals such as clock leakage. The demodulator , shown as a multiplier in  can in reality be nothing more that a 2s compliment negation operation, easily implemented in known hardware.","The presummer  is a vector accumulator which serves to sum multiple input vectors to produce a single output vector. The presummer  is very beneficial for airborne platforms with wide margins between the minimum required Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) and the maximum allowable PRF for non-ambiguous range operation.","DRX Module Implementation","The DRX module can be implemented on a standard 6U (6\u00d79 inch) VME card, although other implementation can be appreciated. The DSP was implemented by the present inventors in two Xilinx\u2122 XC2V6000 FPGAs, each with 6 million gates. The Virtex II\u2122 FPGA includes embedded 18\u00d718 bit hardware multipliers, which are essential for implementing the pane filters. The Virtex II\u2122 FPGA also includes high-speed, dual port block RAM, which can be a valuable resource for the APF accumulators, as well as other data buffers in the DSP.
