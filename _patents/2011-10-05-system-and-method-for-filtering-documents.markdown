More specifically, it relates to methods and systems for automatically separating a set of related documents.","Traditional media sources such as newspaper, television and radio now coexist with non-traditional media sources, such as micro-blogs including Twitter\u2122. The abundance of media sources and content produced by various media sources may be overwhelming to a user. That is, users may find it difficult to sort through such a large volume of documents.","The volume of documents may be particularly large for non-traditional media sources, such as micro-blogs. Since micro-blogs provide a means for laypeople to publish comments, the number of documents which are published on a micro-blog provider system (such as Twitter\u2122) may be extremely large. That is, the large number of potential authors can result in a large number of documents being produced.","Similar reference numerals are used in different figures to denote similar components.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of separating a set of related documents. The method comprises: determining, on a document selection system, quality scores for a plurality of the documents in the set of related documents; obtaining a similarity score for a plurality of pairs of documents in the set of related document; and on a document selection system, obtaining a first subset of related documents which solves an optimization problem, the first subset of related documents being a subset of the set of related documents, the optimization problem being a function of one or more quality scores of the documents assigned to the first subset of related documents and one or more similarity scores of pairs of documents assigned to the first subset of related documents.","In a further aspect, the present disclosure describes a document separation system. The document separation system includes a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory stores processor executable instructions which, when executed by the processor cause the processor to: determine quality scores for a plurality of the documents in the set of related documents; obtain a similarity score for a plurality of pairs of documents in the set of related document; and obtain a first subset of related documents which solves an optimization problem, the first subset of related documents being a subset of the set of related documents, the optimization problem being a function of one or more quality scores of the documents assigned to the first subset of related documents and one or more similarity scores of pairs of documents assigned to the first subset of related documents.","Other aspects and features of the present application will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the application in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Sample Operating Environment","Reference is first made to , which illustrates a system diagram of a possible operating environment  in which embodiments of the present disclosure may operate.","In the embodiment of , a document aggregation system  is configured to obtain a set of related documents . The set of documents  includes a plurality of documents  which are determined, by the document aggregation system , to be related. The documents  may be documents which are associated with one or more document servers . In at least some embodiments, the documents  include one or more primary electronic documents  which may be stored on a primary document server  and\/or one or more comments  which may be stored on a comment server .","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation  is configured to analyze at least a portion of one or more machine readable documents, such as primary electronic documents , and to find comments  which are related to the primary electronic documents . The document aggregation system  may associate one or more primary electronic documents  with comments  which are related to those primary electronic documents . Accordingly, in at least some such embodiments, the set of related documents  may be a set of related comments .","In at least some embodiments, the primary electronic documents  may be stored on one or more primary document server . The primary document server  may be connected to the document aggregation system  via a network , such as the Internet. In some embodiments, the primary document server  may be a publicly and\/or privately accessible web-site which may be identified by a unique Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d).","The network  may be a public or private network, or a combination thereof. The network  may be comprised of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN), a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), or any combination of these network types. Other types of networks are also possible and are contemplated by the present disclosure.","The primary electronic documents  may, for example, be news-related documents such as one or more article or story. The news-related documents may contain information about recent and\/or important events. In at least some embodiments, the primary document server  is operated by a news organization such as a newspaper. Where the primary electronic documents  are new-related documents, the document aggregation system  may be configured to find comments  which are related to the same story as one or more of the primary electronic documents . For example, where the story relates to an event, the document aggregation system  may be configured to locate comments  which are related to the same event. These comments  which are all determined by the document aggregation system to be related may form the set of related documents  illustrated in . Where the documents  which are aggregated by the document aggregation system  are news-related documents, the document aggregation system  may be referred to as a news aggregation system.","The primary electronic documents  (and\/or the comments ) may be text-based documents. That is, the primary electronic documents  may contain data in written form. By way of example and not limitation, the primary electronic documents  (and\/or the comments ) may be formatted in a Hyper-Text Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) format, a plain-text format, a portable document format (\u201cPDF\u201d), or in any other format which is capable of representing text or other content. Other document formats are also possible.","In at least some embodiments, the primary electronic documents  (and\/or the comments ) are not text-based documents. Instead, the primary electronic documents  (and\/or the comments ) may be documents which are capable of being converted to text based documents. Such documents may include, for example, video or audio files. In such embodiments, the document aggregation system , or another system, may include a text extraction module which is configured to convert audible speech into written text. Such text may then be analyzed in order to associate the primary electronic documents  with comments .","The comments  may, in various embodiments, be one or more of micro-blog posts, such as Twitter\u2122 posts, social networking posts including status updates, such as Facebook\u2122 posts and updates and\/or Google\u2122 Buzz\u2122 posts and updates, user-generated comments from web-pages such as, for example, Youtube\u2122 comments, etc. Other types of comments  may also be used.","The comments  are, in at least some example embodiments, restricted length posts. That is, the comments may be short text-based posts. In at least some embodiments, the comments  are less than one thousand (1000) characters. In at least some embodiments, (such as embodiments where the micro-blog posts are Twitter\u2122 posts), the comments  may be up to one hundred and forty (140) characters.","In at least some embodiments, the comments  may be stored on one or more comment server . The comment server  may be accessible through a network , such as the Internet. In some embodiments, the comment server  may be a publicly and\/or privately accessible web-site which may be identified by a unique Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d). The comment server  may receive the comments  from one or more users and may store such comments in a local or remote storage associated with the comment server . In at least some embodiments, the comment server  may be operated or controlled by a comment service provider. The comment service provider may, for example, be Twitter\u2122 (e.g. where the comments  are Twitter\u2122 posts), Google\u2122 (e.g. where the comments  are Google\u2122 Buzz\u2122 posts), Facebook\u2122 (e.g. where the comments  are Facebook\u2122 posts), Youtube\u2122 (e.g. where the comments  are Youtube\u2122 posts). In other embodiments, the comment service provider may be another service provider not specifically listed above.","In at least some embodiments, the comment server  may include a comment application programming interface (API) . The comment API  may be configured to provide comments  associated with the comment server  to other modules and\/or systems, such as the document aggregation system . In at least some embodiments, the comment API  may be configured to receive a request for comments from the document aggregation system  (or another system) and, in response retrieve one or more comments  from storage and provide the retrieved comments  to the document aggregation system  (or other system from which a request was received).","While in some embodiments, the comment server  may be configured to return comments  to a system (such as the document aggregation system ) in response to a request from that system, in other embodiments, the comment server  may provide comments  to a system (such as the document aggregation system ) when other criteria is satisfied. For example, the comment server  may, in at least some embodiments, be configured to periodically provide comments to the document aggregation system . For example, the comment server  may periodically send to the document aggregation system  any comments which have been posted since the comment server  last sent comments to the document aggregation system . In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may store at least some of the received comments  in local memory on the document aggregation system .","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may analyze at least a portion of one or more primary electronic documents  (such as primary electronic documents  received from a primary document server ) and may identify comments  (such as the comments  received from the comment server ) which are related to the same subject matter as the primary electronic documents .","In at least some embodiments, functions or features provided by the document aggregation system  (and\/or a document selection system  which will be discussed in greater detail below) may be accessed by one or more other systems or subsystems via an application programming interface (API)  provided by the document aggregation system  (and\/or the document selection system ). The API  may, for example, receive function calls from other systems. The function calls may, for example, be received from a document server  which provides public or private access to one or more documents  via the network . In some embodiments, the document server  which issues function calls to the API  may be the primary document server . The document server  may, for example, be a news content server which allows computers which are connected to the network  to view news content, such as news articles, through an Internet browser. The document server  may, for example, be configured to send information regarding a primary electronic document  to the document aggregation system . The information regarding the primary electronic document  may, for example, be the complete primary document, a portion thereof (such as the title of the primary electronic document ) and\/or the location of the primary document (in which case the document aggregation system  and\/or the comment association system  may be configured to retrieve the primary electronic document  or a portion thereof). The information regarding the primary document  may be provided as a parameter in the function call to the API .","The API  may be configured to return, to the system or subsystem from which the function call was received (e.g. the document server ), one or more comments  (or identifying information regarding the location where such comments are located) which are determined by the comment association system  to be related to the primary electronic document . In at least some embodiments, a document server  which receives the comments  which are related to a primary electronic document  (or the identifying information regarding the location where the comments are located) may be configured to display at least some of the comments  in a display screen which also includes the primary electronic document , or a portion thereof. For example, the document server  may include both the primary electronic document  (or a portion thereof) and related comments  in a common webpage, which may be viewed on computers connected to the network .","In some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may be configured to retrieve documents  from a plurality of document servers  and to cluster such documents by related subject matter. While a single primary document server  and a single comment server  are illustrated in , in at least some embodiments, the document aggregation server  may cluster documents from a plurality of primary document servers  and\/or a plurality of comment servers . For example, in some embodiments, the document aggregation system  is a new aggregation system which is configured to search for and group together news stories regarding a common event. Such news stories may be obtained by the news aggregation system from a plurality of primary document servers . For example, various news organizations may each operate their own primary document server . The news aggregation system may associate news documents from a plurality of primary document servers  with one another if those news documents are related to a common subject. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system may be of the type described in United States Publication Number 2011\/0093464 A1 which was filed Aug. 17, 2010 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GROUPING MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The document aggregation system  may include a number of systems, functions, subsystems or modules apart from those specifically discussed herein. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  also includes a web-interface subsystem (not shown) for automatically generating web pages which permit access to the primary electronic documents  on the primary document servers  and\/or provide other information about the primary electronic documents . The other information may include a machine-generated summary of the contents of the primary electronic document , and a rank of the subject matter of the primary electronic document  as determined by a ranking system. The web pages which are generated by the web-interface subsystem may display documents in groups determined by the document aggregation system . In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  is configured to generate web pages which relate one or more primary electronic documents  to comments  which are determined by the document aggregation system  to be related to those primary electronic documents . For example, in some embodiments, the document aggregation system  is configured to generate web pages which include both information about one or more related primary electronic documents  and also information about comments  which are related to those primary electronic documents .","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may allow public access to a set of related documents . In some such embodiments, the document aggregation system  provides such access by generating web pages which are accessible through a network  such as the Internet. The web pages may visually represent the relationship of documents by subject matter. For example, the web pages may display related documents, portions of related documents and\/or or links to related documents on a common web page to indicate that such documents are related. Such related documents, portions and\/or links may be displayed in close proximity to one another to visually represent the fact that the documents are related to one another.","As noted above, in some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may provide related documents to other systems which requested related documents through an API . These other systems may then generate web pages which are accessible through a network , such as the Internet. The web pages generated by such other systems may be configured to visually represent the relationship of documents by subject matter. For example, the web pages may display related documents or portions of related documents and\/or links to related documents on a comment web page to indicate that such documents are related.","Accordingly, some embodiments the document aggregation system  is configured to generate web pages which illustrate the fact that documents are related and in other embodiments the document aggregation system  merely aggregates related documents and provides another system with information regarding which documents are related to one another. In either case, in some embodiments, it may be necessary or desirable to limit the number of related documents which are provided. For example, the complete set of related documents  may include too many documents for display; for example, too many comments  such as micro blog posts may be included in the set of related documents .","In at least some embodiments, a document selection system  may be provided to limit the set of related documents . The document selection system  may be configured to separate a set of related documents  into a plurality of subsets of related documents , . The subsets of related documents ,  include a first subset of related documents  and a second subset of related documents . The first subset of related documents  may selected by the document selection system  to include a predetermined number of documents. The first subset of related documents  is selected to include documents which are determined to be of good quality. The first subset of related documents  is also selected to include documents which are diverse. That is, the documents in the first subset of related documents are selected to have a low similarity to one another.","Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, the document selection system  is configured to take, as an input, a set of related documents . In at least some embodiments, the set of related documents  includes only documents of a certain type (such as micro-blog posts). For example, the document aggregation system  may determine that too many micro-blog posts (such as Tweets) are contained in a group of related documents. The document aggregation system  may then provide the micro-blog posts to the document selection system so that the document selection system  may reduce the number of micro-blog posts to a more desirable level. In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  takes the set of input documents (such as the set of related documents ) and divides the documents in that input set into one or more subsets. The subsets may include, for example, a first subset of related documents  which includes related documents which are of high quality and which are diverse. The documents in the first subset of related documents  may, for example, be displayed by the document aggregation system  in a web page of the type discussed above (i.e. a web page which is configured to display related documents). Alternatively, in some embodiments, the documents in the first subset of related documents  may be provided to another system which requested related documents via the API .","In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may also produce a second subset of related documents . The second subset of related documents  may include a group of documents which are collectively of less quality and\/or less diverse than the documents in the first subset of related documents . In some embodiments, the second subset of related documents  may be discarded. In other embodiments, the second subset of related documents may be used if certain criterion is satisfied. For example, in at least some embodiments, access to the documents in the second subset of related documents  is only provided within a web page (which may be generated by the document aggregation system  and\/or a document server ) if a request for more documents is received from a user. For example, the document aggregation system  (or another system) may be configured to generate a web-page which provides direct access to the documents in the first subset of related documents . Such access may be provided by displaying the documents in the first subset of related documents  or a portion thereof or by displaying links to such documents. In some embodiments, the web-page may also include an interface element (such as a selectable icon or text) which specifies that more documents are available for access. When a user selects this interface element, the access to the second subset of related documents  may be provided. For example, a web page may be displayed which displays or lists the documents in the second subset of related documents .","The document selection system  and\/or the document aggregation system  may in various embodiments, include more or less subsystems and\/or functions than are discussed herein. It will also be appreciated that the functions provided by any set of systems or subsystems may be provided by a single system and that these functions are not, necessarily, logically or physically separated into different subsystems. For example, in at least some embodiments, the document selection system  and the document aggregation system  may be a single system which provides both document aggregation capabilities and also document selection capabilities. Such a system may be referred to as a document selection system  or a document aggregation system  since both document selection capabilities and document aggregation capabilities are provided.","Accordingly, the term document selection system  as used herein includes standalone document selection systems which are not, necessarily, part of a larger system, and also document selection systems  which are part of a larger system or which include other systems or subsystems. The term document selection system , therefore, includes any systems in which the document selection methods described herein are included.","Furthermore, while  illustrates one possible operating environment  in which the document selection system  may operate, it will be appreciated that the document selection system  may be employed in any system in which it may be useful to reduce the number of documents in a set.","Example Comment Association System","Referring now to , a block diagram of an example document selection system  is illustrated. The document selection system  includes a controller, comprising one or more processor  which controls the overall operation of the document selection system .","The document selection system  includes a memory  which is connected to the processor  for receiving and sending data to the processor . While the memory  is illustrated as a single component, it will typically be comprised of multiple memory components of various types. For example, the memory  may include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), a Solid State Drive (SSD), Flash Memory, or other types of memory. It will be appreciated that each of the various memory types will be best suited for different purposes and applications.","The processor  may operate under stored program control and may execute software modules  stored on the memory . In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  also functions as a document aggregation system . In such embodiments, the modules  may include a document aggregation module  which is configured to perform the functions of the document aggregation system . The functions of the document aggregation system  are referred to above. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation module  is configured to obtain a set of related documents . The set of related documents  may, for example, include a plurality of comments  (such as micro-blog posts) which are determined by the document aggregation module  to be related to one another. For example, the document aggregation module  may find a plurality of comments which are all related to the same subject matter as a primary electronic document .","Since the number of related documents in a set of related documents  may be large, in at least some embodiments, the document selection system  is configured to pare down the number of related documents. In at least some such embodiments, the document selection system  may include a document selection module . The document selection module  is configured to take a set of related documents  and to produce, from that set, a first subset of related documents . The first subset of related documents  includes fewer documents than the set of related documents . That is, the first subset of related documents  includes some but not all of the documents in the set of related documents . In at least some embodiments, the document selection module  is configured to also produce a second subset of related documents . The second subset of related documents  includes documents from the set of related documents  which were not included in the first subset of related documents .","The document selection module  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may include a document ranking module . The document ranking module  is configured to rank a plurality of documents based on predetermined ranking criteria. In some embodiments, the document ranking module  is configured to rank the documents in the first subset of related documents . In at least some embodiments, the document ranking module  is configured to sort the documents so that higher quality documents are ranked relatively higher than lower quality documents. In at least some embodiments, the ranks are used to determine how prominently a document will be displayed. For example, when the documents in the first subset of related documents  are displayed in a web page, they may be ordered according to their respective ranks. A document with a relatively higher rank may be displayed higher on a web page than a document with a relatively lower rank.","The set of related documents , the first subset of related documents  and\/or the second subset of related documents  may, for example, be stored in a data  area of memory . The set of related documents , the first subset of related documents  and\/or the second subset of related documents  identify related documents. In at least some embodiments, the set of related documents , the first subset of related documents  and\/or the second subset of related documents  may include documents or portions thereof. That is, the documents themselves may be locally stored in the memory  of the document selection system . In other embodiments, the set of related documents , the first subset of related documents  and\/or the second subset of related documents  may include a pointer or link specifying where such documents may be found. For example, in some embodiments, the documents in the set of related documents , the first subset of related documents  and\/or the second subset of related documents  may be stored on a remote server such as the comment server  of  and the set of related documents , the first subset of related documents  and\/or the second subset of related documents  may specify the location of documents (such as the location of the comments on the comment server ).","The memory  may also store other data  not specifically referred to above.","The document selection system  may be comprised of other features, components, or subsystems apart from those specifically discussed herein. By way of example and not limitation, the document selection system  will include a power subsystem which interfaces with a power source, for providing electrical power to the document selection system  and its components. By way of further example, the document selection system  may include a display subsystem for interfacing with a display, such as a computer monitor and, in at least some embodiments, an input subsystem for interfacing with an input device. The input device may, for example, include an alphanumeric input device, such as a computer keyboard and\/or a navigational input device, such as a mouse.","It will also be appreciated that the modules  may be logically or physically organized in a manner that is different from the manner illustrated in . By way of example, in some embodiments, two or more of the functions described with reference to two or more modules may be combined and provided by a single module. In other embodiments, functions which are described with reference to a single module may be provided by a plurality of modules. Thus, the modules  described with reference to  represent one possible assignment of features to software modules. However, such features may be organized in other ways in other embodiments.","Selecting and Ranking Related Documents","Referring now to , a flowchart is illustrated of a method  for selecting and ranking a plurality of related documents.","The method  includes steps or operations which may be performed by the document selection system . In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may include a memory  (or other computer readable storage medium) which stores computer executable instructions which are executable by one or more processor  and which, when executed, cause the processor to perform the method  or a portion thereof. In some example embodiments, these computer executable instructions may be contained in one or more module  such as, for example, the document aggregation module , the document selection module  and\/or the document ranking module . That is, in at least some example embodiments, one or more of these modules  (or other software modules) may contain instructions for causing the processor  to perform the method  of .","The method  may include, at , obtaining a set of related documents . In at least some embodiments, at , the document selection system  identifies a group of documents which are related to one another. In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  identifies a group of documents which are all related to a common subject matter. In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may analyze at least a portion of one or more primary electronic documents  (such as primary electronic documents  received from a primary document server ) and may identify comments  (such as the comments from the comment server ) which are related to the same subject matter as the primary electronic document(s) . The group of comments which are all related to the same subject matter as the primary electronic document(s) may form the set of related documents . In at least some embodiments, a document aggregation module  () may be configured to cause a processor  to perform .","In some embodiments, after a set of related documents is obtained at , the document selection system  may determine (at ) whether the set of related documents contains too many documents. This determination may be made by comparing the number of documents in the set of related documents  to a predetermined threshold. If the number of documents in the set does not exceed the threshold, then the document selection system  may rank the documents in the set of related documents  (at ). In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  is configured to rank the documents in the set relative to one another based on the respective quality of the documents in the set.","The quality of a document may be numerically represented by one or more quality scores. A quality score of a document may, for example, be related to the size of that document. For example, the quality score of a document may be a function of the number of words and\/or characters in that document. In some embodiments, a predetermined optimal size of a document may be specified. By way of example, in some embodiments the predetermined optimal size may be eighty (80) characters. In such embodiments, the document selection system  may determine the size of a document and may reduce the quality score for the document if the size of the document deviates from the predetermined optimal size.","In some embodiments, a quality score of a document may be related to the percentage of words in the document which are dictionary words. That is, the quality score for a document is determined based on the percentage of words in the document which are listed in a dictionary. In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  is configured to determine the percentage of words in the document which are listed in a dictionary by comparing the words in the document with a predetermined dictionary. The dictionary may, for example, be stored in memory  of the document selection system  and the dictionary may include a list of dictionary words. The dictionary may not include definitions for the words. That is, in at least some embodiments, the dictionary lists words which are considered dictionary words but may not provide a definition for these words.","In some embodiments, a quality score of a document may be related to the language quality of the document. In such embodiments, the document selection system  may be configured to determine the language quality of the document and to determine a quality score based on that language quality. To do so, the document selection system  may extract features of the document and correlate such features to language quality. For example, in some embodiments, the language quality of the document may be related to the diversity of the vocabulary used in the document. A more diverse vocabulary may improve the quality score for that document. In at least some embodiments, the language quality of a document may be related to the degree to which the document is compressible. A more compressible document will be assigned a poorer quality score than a less compressible document since the compressibility of the document may be correlated to language diversity. That is, if a document can be compressed to a large degree without losing information, then the document selection system  may determine that the document must have been of a low quality.","In at least some embodiments, a quality score of a document may be related to the number of subscribers associated with a content producer for that document. In some such embodiments, the quality score of a document may be related to the number of followers of the author of the document. For example, where the document is a micro-blog post such as a Twitter\u2122 post, the quality score may be related to the number of users who are following the user who authored the micro-blog post. If the author has a relatively large number of followers, then the document selection system  may determine that the document is of higher quality than it would be if the author had a relatively small number of followers. The document selection system  may, in at least some embodiments, determine the number of followers of the author of the document using an application programming interface, such as the comment API  of . That is, the comment API  may provide the document selection system  with information which specifies the number of followers of the author of a comment. The document selection system  may then determine a quality score for one or more documents written by the author based on the number of followers of the author of the comment. Such a quality score may be referred to as a follower score.","In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may be configured to determine a quality score for a document based on an approval rating of the document. The approval rating of the document may, in some embodiments, be a measure of the number of times the document has been shared. By way of example, in some embodiments, a document server , such as the comment server , is configured to allow users to share documents , such as comments . For example, a comment server  which allows users to post micro-blog posts (such as Tweets\u2122) may allow users to re-post or otherwise share micro-blog posts (for example, by re-Tweeting\u2122). For example, the comment server  may track the number of times a comment  has been shared and may provide this information to the document selection system  via the comment API . The document selection system  may use this received information to determine a quality score for the document.","In at least some embodiments, where a document server  allows documents to be re-posted, the document selection system  may be configured to determine a quality score for a document based on a re-post score for that document. The re-post score may, in at least some embodiments, be a measure of the number of times the document was re-posted. The document selection system  may receive information specifying the number of times a document  was re-posted via an API  such as the comment API  () and also information specifying whether the document  is an original document or whether it is a re-posted document. If the document  is an original document, the document selection system  may assign that document  a better relative re-post score. For example, in at least some embodiments, if the document is an original document (i.e. an originally authored document and not simply a repost), the document selection system  may assign that document a re-post score of zero (0). If, however, the document is a re-posted document, then the document selection system  may assign that document a poorer relative re-post score. For example, in at least some embodiments, if the document is a re-posted document, then the document selection system  may assign the document a re-post score which is related to the number of times that the document has been re-posted.","In some embodiments, a predetermined re-post threshold may be specified. If the number of re-posts of the document is greater than the predetermined re-post threshold, then the re-post score may be assigned a poorer relative re-post score. For example, in at least some embodiments, if the number of re-posts of the document is greater than the predetermined re-post threshold, then the document selection system  may assign that document a repost score of one (1). In at least some embodiments, if the number of re-posts of the document is less than the predetermined re-post threshold and the document is not an original document (i.e. the document is a re-post), then the document selection system  may assign that document a re-post score which is better than if the number of re-posts exceeded the threshold, but which is worse than if the document was an original document. For example, in at least some embodiments, if the number of re-posts of the document is less than the predetermined re-post threshold and the document is not an original document (i.e. the document is a re-post), then the document selection system  may assign that document a re-post score which is equal to the number of re-posts of that document divided by the predetermined re-post threshold.","In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may be configured to determine a quality score for a document based on a relevance score for the document. In such embodiments, the document selection system  may be configured to determine how relevant a document is to a topic. The relevance score for a document could be determined, for example, based on the cosine similarity between vector representations of the document and the topic. The vector representations may, in at least some embodiments, be term-count representations. In at least some embodiments, the vector representations may be term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representations.","Thus, in various embodiments, one or more quality scores for a document may be determined based on one or more of the metrics discussed above. In some embodiments, a combined quality score may be determined based on two or more of these metrics. For example, a combined quality score may be determined as a weighted sum of any two or more of the quality scores discussed above. Weights associated with any two or more of these quality scores may be predetermined.","Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, at , the document selection system  may be configured to rank the document in the set of related documents based on one or more of the quality scores (or combined quality scores) discussed above.","Next, at , the document selection system  may automatically generate one or more webpages based on the set of related documents obtained at . The one or more webpages visually represent the relationship of the set of related documents.

In some embodiments an identifier of each document in the set of related documents may be displayed in a list of the webpage.","The one or more webpages may also visually represent the rankings determined at . For example, the webpages may display an identifier of a first document more prominently than an identifier of a second document if the first document has a higher relative rank than the second document. In at least some embodiments, each document in the set of related documents  may be displayed in a list of the webpage and the list may be ordered according to the ranks determined at .","In some embodiments, the webpages may be automatically generated by the document selection system . In other embodiments, the webpages may be generated by another system. For example, in at least some embodiments, the document selection system  may provide the set of related documents  to another system which requested related documents through at API  associated with the document selection system . That system may then generate the webpages described above.","If, at , the document selection system  determined that there are too many documents in the set of related documents obtained at  (i.e. if the set of related documents exceeds a threshold), then at , the document selection system  may obtain a subset of related documents. This subset of related document may be referred to as a first subset of related documents . The first subset of related documents  includes a portion of the documents in the set of related documents  obtained at . However, the first subset of related documents  obtained at  does not include all of the documents in the set of related documents .","The document selection system  obtains the first subset of related documents  by solving an optimization problem. The optimization problem is a function of one or more quality scores of the documents which are assigned to the first subset of related documents and one or more similarity scores of pairs of documents assigned to the first subset of related documents. Methods of obtaining the first subset of related documents  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","Next, at , the document selection system  ranks the documents in the first subset of related documents . In at least some embodiments, the document selection system  is configured to rank the documents in the first subset of related documents  relative to other documents in the first subset of related documents  based on the respective quality of the documents in the first subset of related documents . For example, as discussed above with reference to , the quality of a document may be numerically represented by one or more quality scores. Specific quality scores and methods of determining quality scores are discussed above with reference to . At , the document selection system  may rank the documents in the first subset of related documents  according to one or more quality scores assigned to those documents.","Next, at , the document selection system  may automatically generate one or more webpages based on the documents in the first subset of related documents .

In some embodiments an identifier of each document in the subset of related documents may be displayed in a list of the webpage.","The one or more webpages may also visually represent the rankings determined at . For example, the webpages may display an identifier of a first document more prominently than an identifier of a second document if the first document has a higher relative rank than the second document.

In some embodiments, a single quality score is determined per document. In other embodiments, a plurality of quality scores is determined for each document. A quality score numerically represents the quality of a document. The quality score may be determined according to any one or more of the methods discussed above with reference to  of . For example, in at least some embodiments, a quality score may be determined based on any one or more of: the size of a document, the percentage of words in a document which are dictionary words, the language quality of a document, the number of subscribers associated with a content producer for a document, an approval rating of the document (such as the number of times the document has been shared), a relevance score for a document and\/or a re-post score for a document.

In at least some embodiments, one or more quality scores are determined for each document in the set of related documents .","At , in at least some embodiments, a similarity score may be obtained by the document selection system  for a plurality of pairs of documents in the set of related documents. The similarity score may be determined for each possible pairing of documents in the set of related documents . The similarity score is a measure of the degree to which the documents in a pair of documents are similar. In at least some embodiments, the similarity score may be determined based on the number of terms which are common to both documents in the pair. For example, the document selection system  may determine the term overlap percentage in a pair of documents and may determine a similarity score for that pair of documents based on the term overlap percentage of terms in the documents.","In at least some embodiments, a similarly score for a pair of documents may be determined from the distance between term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vector representations of documents in the pair of documents. The TF-IDF is a statistical measure which may be used to evaluate how important a word is to a document. It examines the frequency of occurrence of a term in the portion of the document relative to the frequency of that term in a larger set of documents. In at least some embodiments, the distance between the TF-IDF vector representations of documents may be determined as a cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector representations of the documents. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors by measuring the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of the angle between the two vectors determines whether the vectors are pointing in approximately the same direction.","In at least some embodiments, after the quality score(s) and similarity score(s) are determined, a first subset of related documents  may be obtained. The first subset of related documents  includes some, but not all, of the documents in the set of related documents .","The first subset of related documents  may be obtained by solving an optimization problem. The optimization problem is a function of the quality scores of the documents assigned to the first subset of related documents  and the similarity scores of all pairs of documents assigned to the first subset of related documents . That is, documents from the set of related documents  are selectively included in the first subset of related documents  in order to jointly maximize the quality of the documents in the first subset of related documents and the diversity of the documents in the first subset of related documents.
