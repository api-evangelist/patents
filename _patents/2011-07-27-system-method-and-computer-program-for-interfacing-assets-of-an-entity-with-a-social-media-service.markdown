{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to social media services, and more particularly to interfacing social media services with entity assets.","Social media services have become a popular method for communication. For example, as a current channel of choice for consumers, social media services have become a preferred communication and marketing platform. Unfortunately, conventional methods for expanding the functionality of social media services have exhibited various limitations.","For example, current entities may strive to exist and increase their footprint in the social domain in order to obtain benefits of social media service exposure, but they have failed to effectively interface the functionality of social media services with existing assets of the entity. There is thus a need for addressing these and\/or other issues associated with the prior art.","A system, method, and computer program product are provided for interfacing assets of an entity with a social media service. In use, an entity containing one or more assets is identified. Additionally, a social media service is identified. Further, the one or more assets of the entity are interfaced with the social media service, such that actions performed with respect to the one or more assets of the entity are associated with the social media service, and actions performed with respect to the social media service are associated with the one or more assets of the entity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","102","102"]},"Coupled to the network  is a plurality of devices. For example, a server computer  and an end user computer  may be coupled to the network  for communication purposes. Such end user computer  may include a desktop computer, lap-top computer, and\/or any other type of logic. Still yet, various other devices may be coupled to the network  including a personal digital assistant (PDA) device , a mobile phone device , a television , etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","104","200"]},"As shown, a system  is provided including at least one central processor  which is connected to a communication bus . The system  also includes main memory  [e.g. random access memory (RAM), etc.]. The system  also includes a graphics processor  and a display .","The system  may also include a secondary storage . The secondary storage  includes, for example, a hard disk drive and\/or a removable storage drive, representing a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, a compact disk drive, etc. The removable storage drive reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit in a well known manner.","Computer programs, or computer control logic algorithms, may be stored in the main memory , the secondary storage , and\/or any other memory, for that matter. Such computer programs, when executed, enable the system  to perform various functions (to be set forth below, for example). Memory , storage  and\/or any other storage are possible examples of tangible computer-readable media.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1"],"b":["300","300","2","300"]},"As shown in operation , an entity containing one or more assets is identified. In one embodiment, the entity may include a commercial entity. For example, the entity may include a commercial entity such as an enterprise, a brand, a corporation, a manufacturer, a service provider, etc. In another embodiment, the assets of the entity may include one or more products made available by the entity to one or more consumers. For example, the assets of the entity may include one or more tangible goods such as food, clothing, hardware, software, etc.","Additionally, in one embodiment, the assets of the entity may include one or more services provided by the entity to one or more consumers. For example, the assets of the entity may include server space, Internet hosting, pay per view (PPV) movies, digital video recording (DVR) services, network bandwidth, etc. In another embodiment, the assets of the entity may include one or more infrastructure elements of the entity that enable the entity to provide goods and\/or services to consumers. For example, the assets of the entity may include one or more web pages associated with the entity, one or more servers that provide data storage and services, one or more interfaces for receiving consumer input, etc.","Further, as shown in operation , a social media service is identified. In one embodiment, the social media service may include any service through which two or more individuals interact socially. For example, the social media service may include a messaging service (e.g., an electronic mail message service, a short message service (SMS), an instant message service, etc.), a social networking service, a social game (e.g., a video game, a social pyramid game, etc.), an Internet forum, etc. In another embodiment, the social media service may be a public service (e.g., available to the general public, etc.), a private service (e.g., available only to a limited number of users, etc.), etc.","Further still, in one embodiment, the social media service may be associated with the entity. For example, the social media service may be created and\/or provided by the entity. In another embodiment, the social media service may not be associated with the entity. For example, the social media service may be created and\/or provided by another entity other than the identified entity.","Also, as shown in operation , the one or more assets of the entity are interfaced with the social media service, such that actions performed with respect to the one or more assets of the entity are associated with the social media service, and actions performed with respect to the social media service are associated with the one or more assets of the entity. In one embodiment, the interfacing may be performed utilizing an engine. For example, the interfacing may be performed utilizing a hardware engine, a software engine, an engine including hardware and software, etc.","In addition, in one embodiment, the interfacing may be performed by accessing the one or more assets of the entity and accessing the social media service utilizing one or more protocols. For example, the one or more assets of the entity may be accessed utilizing a predefined protocol provided by the entity. In another example, the social media service may be accessed utilizing one or more application programming interfaces (APIs).","Further, in one embodiment, the interfacing may include transmitting data between the one or more assets of the entity and the social media service. For example, data associated with a user of the social media service (e.g., contact information, interests of the user, activities of the user, etc.) may be transmitted to a server associated with the entity. In another example, data associated with the one or more assets of the entity (e.g., customer product and\/or service consumption data, customer location data, etc.) may be transmitted to the social media service.","Further still, in one embodiment, the interfacing may include performing one or more actions utilizing the one or more assets of the entity, in response to one or more actions performed in association with the social media service. In another embodiment, the one or more actions may be performed according to one or more rules, predetermined objectives, services to be provided, etc. For example, the engine may receive a notification that a user has performed a certain task through the social media service (e.g., the user has completed a game within the service, has input information via the service, etc.). Additionally, in response to the notification, the engine may send a request to the entity for a product or service to be made available to the user.","Also, in one embodiment, the interfacing may include performing one or more actions within the social media service, in response to one or more actions performed in association with the one or more assets of the entity. In another embodiment, the one or more actions may be performed according to one or more rules, predetermined objectives, services to be provided, etc. For example, the engine may receive a notification that a customer has purchased or utilized a good or service from the entity, and in response to the notification, the engine may update an element of the social media service associated with the customer (e.g., a customer's profile, status, etc.).","In this way, the one or more assets of the entity may be leveraged in order to enhance the social media service. Additionally, the social media service may be used to improve one or more aspects of the entity (e.g., through brand exposure, advertising, customer service, etc.).","More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional architectures and uses in which the foregoing method may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user. It should be strongly noted that the following information is set forth for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. Any of the following features may be optionally incorporated with or without the exclusion of other features described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["400","400","400"]},"As shown, the architecture  includes a plurality of services A-C in communication with an engine  via one or more communication protocols . In one embodiment, the plurality of services A-C may include assets that exist within an entity (e.g., existing services, legacy services, etc.). For example, the plurality of services A-C may include one or more real world assets (e.g., one or more commercial products, services, etc.).","Additionally, in one embodiment, the one or more communication protocols  may include any protocol that enables communication of data between the plurality of services A-C and the engine . For example, the one or more communication protocols  may include one or more predefined protocols that are implemented by the plurality of services A-C in order to communicate with the engine .","In another embodiment, the one or more communication protocols  may be used by the engine  to perform one or more actions associated with the plurality of services A-C. For example, the one or more communication protocols  may be used by the engine  to determine a status of one or more of the plurality of services A-C. In another example, the one or more communication protocols  may be used by the engine  to provision tasks to one or more of the plurality of services A-C. In yet another example, the one or more communication protocols  may be used by the engine  to redeem a tangible good or service from one or more of the plurality of services A-C.","Also, in another example, the one or more communication protocols  may be used by the engine  to retrieve registration information from one or more of the plurality of services A-C. In yet another example, the one or more communication protocols  may be used by the engine  to retrieve registration information from one or more of the plurality of services A-C.","Further, the engine  is in communication with a social media service  via an application programming interface (API) . In one embodiment, API  may include an existing public social media API that may enable the communication of data between the engine  and the social media service . For example, the engine  may utilize the API  to connect with the social media service  and\/or publish data into the social world and communicate with end users via the social media service . For instance, the engine  may utilize the API  to provide status reports, wall reports, rewards publication, and\/or other information to the social media service . In another example, the engine  may utilize the API  to retrieve link hits (e.g., selection of links, etc.) from the social media service .","Further still, in another embodiment, the engine  may use the one or more communication protocols  as well as the application programming interface (API)  to interface the plurality of services A-C and the social media service . For example, the engine  may utilize the one or more communication protocols  as well as the application programming interface (API)  to implement a social activity (e.g., a game, an objective, etc.) within the social media service  that utilizes assets of the plurality of services A-C.","Also, in one embodiment, the social activity created by the engine  may enable users of the social media service  to perform one or more activities. For example, the social activity created by the engine  may enable users of the social media service  to perform one or more tasks utilizing the social media service , view progress towards one or more goals utilizing the social media service , earn recognition within the social media service , etc.","In another embodiment, the social activity created by the engine  may enable a communication exchange based on a user's existing network and relationships within the social media service . For example, one or more existing profiles within the social media service  that are associated with the user may be used to communicate information associated with the user to the user's network. In yet another embodiment, the social activity created by the engine  may be associated with a theme. For example, the social activity created by the engine  may have a content or plot that dictates actions to be taken by users, desired results of such actions, rules associated with games, etc.","In addition, an activity designer user interface (UI)  is in communication with the engine  via a connection . In one embodiment, the activity designer UI  may be used by an activity designer to create one or more social activities that include activity rules that may control activity flow and may interface services from the plurality of services A-C and the social media service  within the one or more social activities. Further, a database  is in communication with the engine . In one embodiment, the database  may store data associated with one or more social activities created and communicated by the activity designer UI .","In this way, the plurality of services A-C and the social media service  may be manipulated by the engine  to create a social activity that will connect users of the plurality of services A-C as well as the social media service . Additionally, as opposed to the virtual social world, the plurality of services A-C may provide real world assets that may be leveraged to push the social activity forward to increase potential revenue and awareness for entities associated with the plurality of services A-C.","For example, users of the social media service  may redeem virtual and\/or social currency and awards awarded by the social media service  (e.g., an award given by a game within the social media service , etc.) for tangible good and\/or services provided by the plurality of services A-C such as credits for a predetermined amount of free short message service (SMS) messages, increased bandwidth, etc. In another example, customer knowledge (e.g., subscriber information, location, etc.) may be retrieved from the plurality of services A-C and may be used to personalize a social activity provided to the users. For instance, information retrieved by the engine  from the plurality of services A-C may indicate that a user has a family plan and teenage children, and the engine  may use such information to provide a parental control mode for the social activities provided to such user through the social media service .","Furthermore, in one embodiment, the engine  may provide electronic programming guide (EPG)-based social games for cable and digital television (DTV) providers. For example, the plurality of services A-C may include an EPG server, one or more digital video recorders (DVRs), a pay per view (PPV) server, and a provisioning server of a service provider. Additionally, the social media service  may include an application for a social networking service.","Also, in one embodiment, utilizing the engine , the application for the social networking service may have direct access to the service provider's EPG server, and may expose data such as upcoming programs to users of the application. In this way, users of the application may keep an eye on upcoming programs, manage DVR and PPV usage, and get reminders associated with the plurality of services A-C through the application of the social media service .","In addition, in one embodiment, the engine  may expose the way a user is using the EPG to friends of the user within the social media service . For example, viewing preferences of the user obtained by the engine  from the plurality of services A-C may be shared across the application of the social media service , which may allow friends of the user within the social media service  to see what the user is planning to watch within the plurality of services A-C. For instance, when a user updates an EPG setting for their account, a message associated with the user may be published within the application of the social media service  describing the update (e.g., by stating that the user is planning on watching a particular show using a particular service provider, etc.).","Further, in one embodiment, the engine  may notify friends of the user within the social media service  when the user views a program provided by the plurality of services A-C. For example, upon checking in to view a program (e.g., by selecting the program within a DVR, etc.), a message associated with the user may be published within the application of the social media service  describing the program being currently viewed by the user (e.g., by stating that the user is currently watching a particular program, episode, etc. using a particular service provider, etc.). In another embodiment, the message may be published automatically, manually, etc.","In yet another embodiment, additional options may be included within the message associated with the user. For example, the message may contain a link to record the program to a DVR of another user (e.g., in case the other user missed the program), a link to subscribe to a service provided by the service provider (e.g., if the other user does not have DVR services, etc.), etc. In still another embodiment, the user may be able to see preferences associated with their friends, programs currently being viewed by their friends, etc. In yet another embodiment, the user may be able to communicate with their friends through a standard social media infrastructure or over the application.","Further still, in one embodiment, the engine  may account for usage within both the plurality of services A-C and the social media service , and may reward such usage (e.g., through the dissemination of credits, virtual goods, tangible goods, etc. For example, the engine  may distribute points to the user when the user performs activities including one or more of sharing, checking in, contributing, and socializing within one or more of the plurality of services A-C and the social media service . In another example, the engine  may credit the user with virtual points for each activity that the user participates in.","In another embodiment, in addition to virtual point credit, users may earn badges upon fulfilling specific tasks (e.g., recording a predetermined number of shows on a DVR, responding to a publication a predetermined number of times, etc.), where such badges may be shown within the social environment of the user through the social media service . In yet another embodiment, different variations for a user's score collection may be used. For example, a point counter or points associated with a user may be applied to a category, and if a user shares a program, their score in sharing may be increased.","In still another embodiment, virtual credit (e.g., virtual points, etc.) may be used by the user to purchase virtual goods or tangible goods. For example, virtual credit may be used by the user to purchase virtual goods such as special badges that are displayed within the social media service . In another example, virtual credit may be redeemed by the user for tangible assets such as PPV movies, cellular phone minutes, flowers, popcorn, etc. that are provided by one or more entities associated with the plurality of services A-C or by the plurality of services A-C themselves.","Also, in one embodiment, the engine  may incorporate additional functionality associated with the social activity. For example, general purpose calendars, social games, location-based (e.g., global positioning system (GPS)-based, etc.) games, contextual advertisements from television and movie studios, etc. may all be incorporated within or associated with the social activity created by the engine . Further, the engine  may include a light billing platform that may manage redemption of virtual points.","In this way, one or more entities that provide the plurality of services A-C may offer the social activity to their customers. Additionally, stickiness may exist between the availability of the EPG and the social activity provided by the engine . Further, exposure of the social activity through the social media service  may enable a \u201cviral\u201d transmission of data associated with the plurality of services A-C.","Further still, new knowledge about subscribers of the plurality of services A-C may be obtained (e.g., based on their interests within the social media service , etc.). Also, virtual goods earned through the use of the social media service  may be redeemed for tangible partner goods through the plurality of services A-C, and may account for user events obtained through the social media service  (e.g., by offering discounted flowers for mother's day, birthdays, etc.).","Additionally, in one embodiment, the plurality of services A-C may be associated with an existing online store. For example, through the engine , the online store may be converted to incorporate social aspects, such as assigning virtual points to users for recommendations and highly rated reviews. Further, user's purchase and\/or viewing history may be made available to friends of the user through the social media service , group buys may be enabled, and virtual points may be redeemed for coupons. Further still, social media preferences may be synchronized with a purchase history of the user (e.g., by adding a musician whose album was purchased by the user to the user's social profile, etc.). Also, audio messages may be shared with friends by the user, gifts may be purchased by the user for friends, etc.","In addition, in one embodiment, the plurality of services A-C may be associated with a navigation service. For example, through the engine , a social game may be added to the navigation service. Further, a place may be identified within a group of friends utilizing the navigation service. Further still, quests may be created and joined, history trivia may be conducted, points may be earned by a user if a predetermined amount of friends are in the same area as the user or if the user and\/or a predetermined number of friends are in a predetermined location, etc. Also, upon entering a particular store, the navigation service may detect such entry and a message associated with the user may be published within the application of the social media service  describing the store being currently visited by the user.","In this way, an entity may leverage prior investments towards new, trendy activities. Additionally, the entity may position itself as innovative. Further, the entity may create and utilize a revenue and customer service API. Further still, the entity may gain new knowledge about existing subscribers. Also, targeted marketing may be integrated into and\/or from social platforms. In addition, an on-line footprint, as well as profile attributes, may be consolidated with an existing customer profile. Furthermore, total cost of ownership (TCO) may be reduced by leveraging existing assets of the entity.","Further still, in one embodiment, existing assets of an entity may be converted into a social game. For example, web activities, services for users, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, etc. may be converted into awareness and revenue generating social activities. This may increase the footprint of the entity in the social domain in order to achieve viral exposure, stickiness, traffic, outgoing channels, and to gain knowledge about users of the entity.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
