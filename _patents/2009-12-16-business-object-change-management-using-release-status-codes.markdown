title: Business object change management using release status codes
abstract: A computer-implemented system may include a data store to store business data, an application platform, and a business application. The application platform may include a repository to store metadata defining a plurality of business objects, each of the business objects comprising a respective model of data and associated logic, each business object associated with respective business object entities, and a framework in communication with the repository to provide access to the business data. The business application is to access the data via the framework and based on the metadata, wherein the metadata associates a first plurality of the business object entities with a RELEASED release status code, and wherein the metadata associates a second plurality of the business object entities with a DEPRECATED release status code.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Some embodiments relate to enterprise services based on business objects and supported by an application platform. More specifically, some embodiments relate to systems to facilitate the development and maintenance of business applications based on an evolving application platform.","A business object is a software model representing real-world entities involved in business transactions. For example, a business object may represent a business document such as a sales order, a purchase order, or an invoice. A business object may also represent master data objects such as a product, a business partner, or a piece of equipment. Particular documents and master data objects (e.g., SalesOrder SO4711, ACME corporation) are represented by instances of their representing business object, or business object instances.","A business process platform, or application platform, exposes business objects for consumption by business applications. The business objects may model data and associated business logic in any suitable manner. Generally, the business objects may conform to a hierarchical structure consisting of sub-elements, or business object entities.","A business application may access data and logic of business object instances by referring to their associated business object entities. The business applications, in turn, provide data to end-users through user interfaces, reports, etc.","An application platform may evolve over time. For example, a provider of an application platform may add new business objects to the platform, modify existing business objects, and\/or remove previously-provided business objects. Modifications may include the creation, change, or deletion of elements of the business objects, such as data elements, actions, or queries. Accordingly, it may be necessary to modify any business applications which consume thusly-modified or removed business objects.","Systems are desired to facilitate the adaptation of business applications based on current and\/or planned changes to business objects consumed thereby.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","1","2","115","120","110","115","120"]},"Business applications  and  may request and receive data from application platform  based on the structure of business objects BO and BO. As described above, changes to business objects BO and\/or BO (e.g., reflected in a new release of application platform ) may require changes to one or both of business applications  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","210","220","230","240"]},"Data store  may comprise any one or more systems to store business data. Such systems include, but are not limited to, relational database systems, Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database systems, data warehouses, application servers, and spreadsheets. Business applications  and  may leverage services provided by application platform  to access business data of data store .","Application platform  may comprise an SAP application platform based on SAP Netweaver\u00ae, but is not limited thereto. Application platform  includes enterprise services framework (ESF)  and metadata repository . Metadata repository  stores metadata associated with application platform  and defining business objects and business object entities associated with each business object. According to some embodiments, the metadata also associates some or all of the business object entities with a respective release status code. Types of release status codes and their usage will be described in detail below.","In operation, ESF  receives requests from business applications  and  which are associated with one or more business object instances. ESF  accesses metadata repository  to instantiate the business object instances and to populate the instances with associated business data of data store . ESF  may then manipulate the instances (if needed) and provide the requested services\/data to business applications  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"The foregoing is particularly useful in a case that the developer of the application platform and the developer of the business application belong to different organizations (e.g., companies). In such a case, coordination of development activities using intra-organizational measures is unavailable.","Process  may be executed by platform  and\/or by a provider thereof, but embodiments are not limited thereto. In this regard, process  may be executed by any combination of hardware and\/or software. Process  may be embodied in program code stored on a tangible medium and executable by a general-purpose computer processor to provide the functions described herein.","Initially, first metadata associated with an application platform is provided at S. The first metadata defines business object entities such as, for example, the business object entities of structure . Each business object entity is associated with a respective one of a plurality of business objects. According to some embodiments, S comprises providing a software release of application platform , where the first metadata is part of metadata repository .","The first metadata provided at S associates a first plurality of the business object entities with a RELEASED release status code, and also associates a second plurality of the business object entities with a DEPRECATED release status code.","According to some embodiments, the RELEASED release status code indicates that each of the first plurality of the business object entities is supported in the current release of the application platform. The DEPRECATED release status code indicates that each of the second plurality of the business object entities is supported in the current release of the application platform and will not be supported in the next release of the application platform.","The first metadata may include other release status codes according to some embodiments. For example, the first metadata may associate a third plurality of the business object entities with a NOT RELEASED release status code. The NOT RELEASED release status code may indicate that the entity is modeled but not supported. Accordingly, such entities may only be visible to the application platform provides.","According to some embodiments, a particular release status code associated with a business object entity also indicates a set of one or more release status codes which may be associated with the business object entity in a next release of the application platform. These predefined release status code transitions provide additional guidance to developers of business applications consuming application platform .","For example, second metadata associated with the application platform is received at S. The second metadata also defines the business object entities and may be part of a software release of the application platform that immediately succeeds the software release of S. such as, for example, the business object entities of structure . The second metadata associates one or more of the first plurality of the business object entities with a DEPRECATED release status code, and also associates one or more of the second plurality of the business object entities with a DELETED release status code. According to some embodiments, the DELETED release status code indicates that an entity is no longer visible in application platform .","By noting the DEPRECATED release status code associated with the second plurality of the business object entities in the first metadata, a developer of a consuming business application may begin to plan for the unavailability of the second plurality of the business object entities in a next software release. Such changes cannot be directly shipped, since the developer of the business application needs time to react to the changes.","For example, the business application developer may invoke a \u201cwhere used\u201d function to identify components of the business application which utilize any of the second plurality of the business object entities. The business application developer may then change these components to account for the upcoming change or deletion of these business object entities. Similarly, an end user using adaptations of a DEPRECATED data element may have to migrate the adaptations to account for the upcoming change or deletion of the data element. These notifications can be automated by a workflow machine by evaluating the \u201cwhere-used lists\u201d and the corresponding release status code transitions automatically in a software release upgrade (or pre-upgrade), and by generating corresponding tasks for the business application developer.","As noted above, the application platform shipped with the first metadata supports the second plurality of the business object entities associated with the DEPRECATED release status code but, in some embodiments, the application platform may also support changes to one or more of the second plurality of the business object entities which will be reflected in the following release. If the application platform replaces one business object entity by another, then, at least for one release, the deprecated and the new business object entity, are both supported. Such support may further facilitate a business application developer's preparations for the following software release.","Process  describes an implementation in which release status codes associated with business object entities are allowed to transition from RELEASED to DEPRECATED and from DEPRECATED to DELETED. Such an implementation may conform to transition diagram  of . The arrows of transition diagram  indicate release status code transitions that are allowed to occur according to some embodiments. Transitions of current release status codes are not required in a next software release, however. Such predefined allowable release status code transitions may provide business application developers additional guidance in preparing for future software releases. The transitions therefore represent a kind of contract between the developer of the application platform and the developers of the business applications.","As shown in , a business object entity associated with the NOT RELEASED release status code in a current software release may be associated with either the RELEASED WITH RESTRICTIONS or RELEASED release status codes in a next software release. The RELEASED WITH RESTRICTIONS release status code indicates that an associated business object entity is supported in the application platform, and that it may be used only by the application platform provider. As shown, the RELEASED WITH RESTRICTIONS status code may transition to either the RELEASED or DELETED release status codes.","The RELEASED release status code, on the other hand, may only transition to the DEPRECATED release status code. Accordingly, a business object entity remains associated with the RELEASED release status code throughout successive software releases until it is associated with the DEPRECATED release status code.","Process  describes a scenario in which the release status code associated with one or more of a second plurality of the business object entities transitions from DEPRECATED to DELETED. Diagram  shows that, in some embodiments, the DEPRECATED release status code may also transition to the RELEASED or RELEASED WITH RESTRICTIONS release status codes.","Further constraints may be established to codify the types of changes that the application platform may make to business object entities while continuing to associate the RELEASED release status code with those entities. Developers of consuming applications are therefore able to design the consuming applications to adapt to such changes without necessarily receiving any other advance warning thereof from the application platform provider.","In some examples of such constraints associated with the RELEASED release status code, the technical name of a business object entity cannot be changed, but a business object type category can be changed. In addition, some embodiments do not allow changing of the cardinality of a business object node action or of a business object node association while these business object entities are associated with the RELEASED release status code. In a case that one of these constraints is violated in a new release (e.g., the technical name of a query is changed even though the query was associated with the RELEASED release status code in the previous and the current release), some embodiments provide for computer-implemented handling of the violating change. For example, a corresponding flag may be raised in the business application development environment.","According to some embodiments, the release status codes which may be associated with a business object entity are dependent on the release status code associated with an associated parent business object entity. For example, and with respect to structure , a business object node action entity can be associated with the RELEASED release status code only if its parent business object node is associated with the RELEASED release status code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"600"},"Each system and device described herein may be implemented by any number of devices in communication via any number of other public and\/or private networks.
