No. 11\/124,607, filed May 6, 2005, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/568,865, filed May 6, 2004, which applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The receptor tyrosine kinase Met, and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also called scatter factor), have been implicated in promoting invasive growth of many tumor types due to inappropriate activation of Met function (Jankowski et al., 2003; Nardone et al., 2003; Trusolino and Comoglio, 2002; Birchmeier et al., 2003). This activation can arise from a variety of sources, but in each case the Met receptor activates signaling cascades that normally function to organize groups of cells into branching, tubular structures that are present in a variety of organs (Montesano et al., 1992; Sonnenberg et al., 1993; Rosen et al., 1994; Trusolino and Comoglio, 2002; Zhang and Vande Woude, 2003). The Met receptor plays a unique role during development as a master switch, which can stimulate proliferation and motility necessary for the full program of growth and scattering of cells. Its role in the invasiveness of many cancers makes it an attractive target for therapeutics (Ma et al., 2003). However, many questions remain about how the ligand, HGF, binds to Met and induces its tyrosine kinase cascade and thus leads to a biological response.","The Met receptor is part of a larger family of growth factor receptors with identical domain architecture that includes the Ron and Sea receptors (Monsin et al., 1992, Huff et al., 1993). The extracellular portions of Met family members are composed of three domain types. The N-terminal 500 residues fold into a Sema domain, which shares sequence homology with domains found in the Semaphorin and plexin families of neural development proteins (Winburg et al., 1998). As reported recently, Sema domains form a 7-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure (Antipenkov et al., 2003, Love et al., 2003). Met undergoes proteolytic cleavage within the Sema domain during normal processing, although the role for this remains unclear since cells that are unable to cleave Met show normal levels of Met activation upon ligand binding (Komada et al., 1993). A PSI domain, a small domain spanning about 50 residues and containing 4 disulfide bonds, follows the Sema domain. In addition to the Met receptor family, PSI domains are also found in the plexins, Semaphorins and integrins, hence its name (Bork et al., 1999). In Met, the PSI domain is connected via 4 IPT domains to the transmembrane helix and the kinase domain in the intracellular portion of the receptor. IPT domains are related to immunoglobulin-like domains and are named after their presence in plexins and transcription factors (Takagi et al., 1995).","HGF is a large growth factor of 728 residues that is produced as an inactive single-chain precursor which is proteolytically processed to form the biologically active disulfide-linked \u03b1\/\u03b2-heterodimer (Nakamura et al., 1989; Hartmann et al., 1992; Kataoka et al., 2003). The \u03b1-chain folds into an N-terminal domain (N-domain) followed by 4 Kringle domains. The \u03b2-chain starts with residue Val495 and is homologous to the protease domain of chymotrypsin like serine proteases, which, like HGF, are activated by a proteolytic cleavage event (Perona and Craig, 1995; Hedstrom 2002). However, no protease activity has been demonstrated for HGF \u03b2-chain (Lokker et al., 1992) consistent with the absence of the key serine and histidine residues that are part of the \u2018catalytic triad\u2019 Asp[c102]-His[c57]-Ser[c195] ([chymotrypsinogen numbering]) required for catalytic activity in serine proteases.","Comparisons of the biologically active, two-chain HGF, and the inactive single-chain HGF precursor on the Met receptor have shown that both forms of HGF bind Met with similar affinity, but only the cleaved, mature form of HGF is able to activate Met (Lokker et al., 1992). In addition, various C-terminally truncated fragments of the \u03b1-chain (termed NK1, NK2, or NK4 depending on the number of Kringle domains retained) bind Met; in many cases they act as potent antagonists of Met receptor function (Cioce et al., 1996; Chan et al., 1991; Date et al., 1997). Studies involving the cross-linking of Met receptors by a variety of specific antibodies to its extracellular domain have demonstrated that simple dimerization of Met is sufficient for activation (Prat et al., 1998). Based on these characteristics, the fundamental mechanism for Met dimerization remains unclear.","Currently, there is no detailed structural information about HGF \u03b2-chain complexed with Met receptor. A completely solved crystal structure of the HGF \u03b2-chain complexed with Met receptor is needed, for example, for assays for Met-ligand (e.g., HGF \u03b2-chain) interaction and function, modeling the structure-function relationship of Met and other molecules, diagnostic assays for mutation-induced pathologies, and rational design of agents useful in modulating Met or HGF activity or activation.","In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a crystalline form of hepatocyte growth factor beta chain (HGF \u03b2) complexed with Met receptor, and the structural coordinates of the crystal. Coordinates of a crystal structure solved by molecular replacement are listed in Table 2. In some embodiments, HGF \u03b2 comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or conservative substitutions thereof and the Met receptor comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 or conservative substitutions thereof.","In some embodiments, the disclosure provides a crystal structure of HGF \u03b2 complexed with Met receptor, as well as use of the crystal structure to model Met receptor activity when complexed with HGF \u03b2. This use of the structure includes: modeling the interaction of ligands with the Met receptor; activation and inhibition of Met receptor; and the rational design of modulators of Met receptor activity. For example, these modulators include ligands that interact with Met receptor and modulate Met receptor activities, such as cell migration, HGF \u03b2 binding to Met, and Met phosphorylation and signaling.","In other embodiments, the amino acid residues that form the binding site for the Met receptor on HGF \u03b2 are identified and are useful, for example, in methods to model the structure of HGF binding site and to identify agents that can bind or fit into the binding site. In addition, the amino acid positions that form the binding site for HGF \u03b2 on Met have been identified and are useful, for example, in methods to model the structure of the Met ligand binding site and to identify other agents that can bind or fit into the binding site.","A.

In some embodiments, the reference sequence is the extracellular fragment of the Met receptor comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. It will be appreciated that when the amino acid position or sequence is aligned with the reference sequence the numbering of the amino acids may differ from that of the reference sequence or a different numbering system may be utilized.","\u201cHeavy atom derivative\u201d, as used herein, means a derivative produced by chemically modifying a crystal with a heavy atom such as Hg, Au, or a halogen.","\u201cStructural homolog\u201d of Met receptor as used herein refers to a protein that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or rearrangements with respect to the amino acid sequence of Met receptor, but that, when folded into its native conformation, exhibits or is reasonably expected to exhibit at least a portion of the tertiary (three-dimensional) structure of the Met receptor. In some embodiments, a portion of the three dimensional structure refers to structural domains of the Met receptor including the Sema domain, PSI domain, IPT domains, transmembrane domain and\/or intracellular domain, and combinations thereof. For example, structurally homologous molecules of Met receptor include Met receptor variants, preferably variants with one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. In some embodiments, a Met receptor variant has only conservative amino acid substitutions. Homolog tertiary structure can be probed, measured, or confirmed by known analytic or diagnostic methods, for example, X-ray, NMR, circular dichroism, a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize native Met receptor, and like techniques. For example, structurally homologous molecules can have substitutions, deletions or additions of one or more contiguous or noncontiguous amino acids, such as a loop or a domain. Structurally homologous molecules also include \u201cmodified\u201d Met receptor molecules that have been chemically or enzymatically derivatized at one or more constituent amino acid, including side chain modifications, backbone modifications, and N- and C-terminal modifications including acetylation, hydroxylation, methylation, amidation, and the attachment of carbohydrate or lipid moieties, cofactors, and like modifications.","\u201cLigand\u201d, as used herein, refers to an agent and\/or compound that associates with a binding site on a molecule, for example, Met and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding sites, and may be an antagonist or agonist of Met or HGF \u03b2 activity. Ligands include molecules that mimic HGF \u03b2 binding to Met and in some embodiments, are not capable of activating HGF \u03b2\/Met signalling pathway.","\u201cCompound\u201d refers to molecule that associates with the Met or the HGF \u03b2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, prodrug, isomer, or metabolite, thereof. \u201cPharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a formulation of a compound that does not compromise the biological activity and properties of the compound. Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reacting a binding-active compound of the disclosure with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. \u201cProdrug\u201d refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d) to facilitate transport across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group wherein the peptide is metabolized to yield the active moiety.","\u201cMolecular complex\u201d, as used herein, refers to a combination of bound substrate or ligand with polypeptide, such as HGF \u03b2 bound to Met, or a ligand bound to HGF \u03b2 or Met.","\u201cMachine-readable data storage medium\u201d, as used herein, means a data storage material encoded with machine-readable data, wherein a machine programmed with instructions for using such data and is capable of displaying data in the desired format, for example, a graphical three-dimensional representation of molecules or molecular complexes.","\u201cScalable,\u201d as used herein, means the increasing or decreasing of distances between coordinates (configuration of points) by a scalar factor while keeping the angles essentially the same.","\u201cSpace group symmetry\u201d, as used herein, means the whole symmetry of the crystal that combines the translational symmetry of a crystalline lattice with the point group symmetry. A space group is designated by a capital letter identifying the lattice type (P, A, F, etc.) followed by the point group symbol in which the rotation and reflection elements are extended to include screw axes and glide planes. Note that the point group symmetry for a given space group can be determined by removing the cell centering symbol of the space group and replacing all screw axes by similar rotation axes and replacing all glide planes with mirror planes. The point group symmetry for a space group describes the true symmetry of its reciprocal lattice.","\u201cUnit cell\u201d, as used herein, means the atoms in a crystal that are arranged in a regular repeating pattern, in which the smallest repeating unit is called the unit cell. The entire structure can be reconstructed from knowledge of the unit cell, which is characterized by three lengths (a, b and c) and three angles (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3). The quantities a and b are the lengths of the sides of the base of the cell and \u03b3 is the angle between these two sides. The quantity c is the height of the unit cell. The angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 describe the angles between the base and the vertical sides of the unit cell.","\u201cX-ray diffraction pattern\u201d means the pattern obtained from X-ray scattering of the periodic assembly of molecules or atoms in a crystal. X-ray crystallography is a technique that exploits the fact that X-rays are diffracted by crystals. X-rays have the proper wavelength (in the \u212bngstr\u00f6m (\u212b) range, approximately 10cm) to be scattered by the electron cloud of an atom of comparable size. Based on the diffraction pattern obtained from X-ray scattering of the periodic assembly of molecules or atoms in the crystal, the electron density can be reconstructed. Additional phase information can be extracted either from the diffraction data or from supplementing diffraction experiments to complete the reconstruction (the phase problem in crystallography). A model is then progressively built into the experimental electron density, refined against the data to produce an accurate molecular structure.","X-ray structure coordinates define a unique configuration of points in space. Those of skill in the art understand that a set of structure coordinates for a protein or a protein\/ligand complex, or a portion thereof, define a relative set of points that, in turn, define a configuration in three dimensions. A similar or identical configuration can be defined by an entirely different set of coordinates, provided the distances and angles between coordinates remain essentially the same. In addition, a configuration of points can be defined by increasing or decreasing the distances between coordinates by a scalar factor, while keeping the angles essentially the same.","\u201cCrystal structure\u201d generally refers to the three-dimensional or lattice spacing arrangement of repeating atomic or molecular units in a crystalline material. The crystal structure of a crystalline material can be determined by X-ray crystallographic methods, see for example, \u201cPrinciples of Protein X-Ray Crystallography,\u201d by Jan Drenth, Springer Advanced Texts in Chemistry, Springer Verlag; 2nd ed., February 1999, ISBN: 0387985875, and \u201cIntroduction to Macromolecular Crystallography,\u201d by Alexander McPherson, Wiley-Liss, Oct. 18, 2002, ISBN: 0471251224.","C.

Met and HGF \u03b2 Polypeptides, Polynucleotides and Variants Thereof.","The present disclosure includes a description of HGF \u03b2 and an extracellular fragment of Met including the Sema domain of the Met receptor.","The present disclosure includes a description of hepatocyte growth factor and\/or portions thereof. Hepatocyte growth factor comprises a 69 kDa alpha chain and 34 kDa beta chain. HGF is secreted as a single chain precursor form (scHGF). The 69 kDa alpha chain comprise a N terminal finger domain and four kringle domains (K1-K4). A representative amino acid sequence of human HGF \u03b2 chain is shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO: 1). The sequence of Table 4 has one amino acid change from wild type shown in Table 8; the cysteine at amino acid position 604 is changed to a serine. It would be expected that a wild type HGF \u03b2 would have an equivalent crystal structure. The amino acid numbering of the HGF \u03b2 chain is based on the numbering of the single chain precursor form. Numbers in brackets or preceded by a lower case c represent a numbering system based on reference to chymotrypsinogen.","The Met receptor is a tyrosine kinase and is part of a larger family of growth factor receptors with domain architecture similar to the Ron and Sea receptors. The extracellular portion of the Met receptor comprises N-terminal 500 amino acids that fold into a Sema domain. A PSI domain follows the Sema domain and comprises about 50 amino acids and has 4 disulfide bonds. The PSI domain is connected to the transmembrane domain and extracellular kinase domain by 4 IPT domains. IPT domains are immunoglobulin-like domains and are located C terminal to the PSI domain. Met becomes activated upon binding of a ligand, such as HGF \u03b2, the receptor is phosphorylated and cells expressing activated Met are stimulated to migrate, proliferate and\/or differentiate. Crosslinking of Met receptors to form dimers also activates the Met receptor. A representative example of an amino acid sequence of a Met receptor is shown in Table 5 and comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. A representative example of a sequence of an extracellular portion of the Met receptor including the Sema domain and the PSI domain is shown in Table 6 and comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. The extracellular fragment of the Met receptor having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 differs from wild type in that amino acids at positions 304 to 308 have been substituted to include a thrombin cleavage site. Another embodiment of an extracellular fragment of Met is provided in  and comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10. The numbering system of Met receptor is that of the Swiss Prot database as shown in Table 6.","Native or wild-type HGF, HGF\u03b1; HGF \u03b2, or Met receptor polypeptides are those polypeptides that have a sequence of a polypeptide obtained from nature. Native or wild-type polypeptides include naturally occurring variants, secreted or truncated forms. Some domains of HGF and\/or the Met receptor are known. Several isoforms of HGF are known such as isoform 1, isoform 2, isoform 3, isoform 4, and isoform 5. Representative sequences can be found at GenBank Accession Numbers NM000601, NM001010931, NM001010932, NM001010933, NM001010934, and NP000592.","The present disclosure also includes a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a portion or fragment of the Met receptor. The polypeptide fragment includes amino acid residues from any of amino acid 1 to 25 residues to amino acid position 567 or residues corresponding to those positions. In some embodiments, the polypeptide portion has the ability to bind to ligand HGF. The polypeptide portion may also be fused to heterologous polypeptide, such as a peptide tag. Preferably, the fusion polypeptide retains the ability to bind a ligand, such as HGF.","The disclosure also provides a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a portion or fragment of the Met receptor starting at amino acid residue 124 and ending at any one of amino acid residues 230 to 286 or residues corresponding to these residues. This polypeptide includes the amino acid residues that contact the HGF \u03b2 ligand and preferably, the polypeptide has the ability to bind to a ligand such as HGF \u03b2. The polypeptide portion or fragment may be fused to a heterologous polypeptide. Preferably, the fusion protein can bind to a ligand, such as HGF \u03b2.","The present disclosure also includes variants of the Met receptor. Variants include those polypeptides that have amino acid substitutions, deletions, and additions. Amino acid substitutions can be made for example to replace cysteines and eliminate formation of disulfide bonds. Amino acid substitutions can also be made to change proteolytic cleavage sites. The variants also include those polypeptides that have at least one conservative amino acid substitution. In some embodiments a variant only has conservative amino acid substitutions. In some embodiments, the Met receptor variant has about 1-25 conservative amino acid substitutions, more preferably about 1-20 conservative amino acids substitutions, more preferably about 1-10 conservative amino acid substitutions, more preferably about 1-5 conservative amino acid substitutions, and more preferably about 1-2 conservative amino acid substitutions. In some embodiments, a Met receptor variant has at least 90% sequence identity to an extracellular domain fragment of the Met receptor, such as SEQ ID NO:3, and has changes at amino acids other than those associated with the binding site for HGF \u03b2 on Met, preferably the amino acid changes are only conservative substitutions. Other variants can be made at the Met binding site for HGF \u03b2. In other embodiments, the variants of the Met receptor bind HGF \u03b2 bind with the same or higher affinity than the wild type Met receptor.","Fusion Proteins","A Met receptor, variant or structural homolog or portions thereof, may be fused to a heterologous polypeptide or compound. The heterologous polypeptide is a polypeptide that has a different function than that of the Met receptor. Examples of heterologous polypeptide include polypeptides that may act as carriers, may extend half life, may act as epitope tags, may provide ways to detect or purify the fusion protein. Heterologous polypeptides include KLH, albumin, salvage receptor binding epitopes, immunoglobulin constant regions, and peptide tags. Peptide tags useful for detection or purification include FLAG, gD protein, polyhistidine tags, hemaglutinin from influenza virus, T7 tag, S tag, Strep tag, chloramiphenicol acetyl transferase, biotin, glutathione-S transferase, green fluorescent protein and maltose binding protein. Compounds that can be combined with the Met receptor, variants or structural homolog or portions thereof, include radioactive labels, protecting groups, and carbohydrate or lipid moieties.","Polynucleotides, Vectors and Host Cells","Variants of a Met receptor or extracellular fragment thereof can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into DNA encoding Met or the extracellular fragment, or by synthesis of the desired polypeptide variants. HGF \u03b2 chain variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into DNA encoding HGF \u03b2 or by synthesis of the desired polypeptide variants. Variants can be made using standard methods.","Amino acid substitutions, include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. The term \u201cconservative\u201d amino acid substitution as used herein refers to an amino acid substitution which substitutes a functionally equivalent amino acid. Conservative amino acid changes result in silent changes in the amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide. For example, one or more amino acids of a similar polarity act as functional equivalents and result in a silent alteration within the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In general, substitutions within a group can be considered conservative with respect to structure and function. However, the skilled artisan will recognize that the role of a particular residue is determined by its context within the three-dimensional structure of the molecule in which it occurs. For example, Cys residues may occur in the oxidized (disulfide) form, which is less polar than the reduced (thiol) form. The long aliphatic portion of the Arg side chain can constitute a feature of its structural or functional role, and this may be best conserved by substitution of a nonpolar, rather than another basic residue. Also, it will be recognized that side chains containing aromatic groups (Trp, Tyr, and Phe) can participate in ionic-aromatic or \u201ccation-pi\u201d interactions. In these cases, substitution of one of these side chains with a member of the acidic or uncharged polar group may be conservative with respect to structure and function. Residues such as Pro, Gly, and Cys (disulfide form) can have direct effects on the main chain conformation, and often may not be substituted without structural distortions.","Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and\/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements. Examples of conservative substitutions are shown in Table 9. The variation allowed can be determined by systematically making insertions, deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the native sequence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 9"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Original","Exemplary","Preferred"]},{"entry":[{},"Residue","Substitutions","Substitutions"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Ala (A)","Val; Leu; Ile","Val"]},{"entry":[{},"Arg (R)","Lys; Gln; Asn","Lys"]},{"entry":[{},"Asn (N)","Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg","Gln"]},{"entry":[{},"Asp (D)","Glu; Asn","Glu"]},{"entry":[{},"Cys (C)","Ser; Ala","Ser"]},{"entry":[{},"Gln (Q)","Asn; Glu","Asn"]},{"entry":[{},"Glu (E)","Asp; Gln","Asp"]},{"entry":[{},"Gly (G)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":[{},"His (H)","Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg","Arg"]},{"entry":[{},"Ile (I)","Leu; Val; Met; Ala;","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Phe; Norleucine"]},{"entry":[{},"Leu (L)","Norleucine; Ile; Val;","Ile"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met; Ala; Phe"]},{"entry":[{},"Lys (K)","Arg; Gln; Asn","Arg"]},{"entry":[{},"Met (M)","Leu; Phe; Ile","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},"Phe (F)","Trp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr","Tyr"]},{"entry":[{},"Pro (P)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":[{},"Ser (S)","Thr","Thr"]},{"entry":[{},"Thr (T)","Val; Ser","Ser"]},{"entry":[{},"Trp (W)","Tyr; Phe","Tyr"]},{"entry":[{},"Tyr (Y)","Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser","Phe"]},{"entry":[{},"Val (V)","Ile; Leu; Met; Phe;","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Ala; Norleucine"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described herein can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from appropriate source cells. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides or variant polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in a host cell. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication (in particular when the vector is inserted into a prokaryotic cell), a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.","In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences, which are derived from a species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences, which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, is typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins.","In addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example, bacteriophage such as \u03bbGEM\u2122-11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.","Either constitutive or inducible promoters can be used in the present invention, in accordance with the needs of a particular situation, which can be ascertained by one skilled in the art. A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding a polypeptide described herein by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of choice. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and\/or expression of the target genes. However, heterologous promoters are preferred, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.","Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the \u03b2-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the polypeptides or variant polypeptides (Siebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.","In embodiments, each cistron within a recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the polypeptide encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP.","Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing polypeptides include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include (e.g., ), Bacilli (e.g., ), Enterobacteria, species (e.g., ), , or . Preferably, gram-negative cells are used. Preferably the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.","Besides prokaryotic host cells, eukaryotic host cell systems are also well established in the art. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as S2 and Sf9, as well as plants and plant cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS cells. More specific examples include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); Chinese hamster ovary cells\/\u2212DHFR (CHO, Urlaub and Chasin, 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, 23:243-251 (1980)); and mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51).","Polypeptide Production","Host cells are transformed or transfected with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.","Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPOprecipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.","Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol\/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.","Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In preferred embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.","Any necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.","The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth, for example, the preferred temperature ranges from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 39\u00b0 C., more preferably from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C., even more preferably at about 30\u00b0 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. For , the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4, and more preferably about 7.0.","If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. For example, if a PhoA promoter is used for controlling transcription, the transformed host cells may be cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.","Eukaryotic host cells are cultured under conditions suitable for expression of the HGF and\/or Met receptor polypeptides. The host cells used to produce the polypeptides may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in one or more of Ham et al., 197958:44, Barnes et al., 1980102: 255, U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704, 4,657,866, 4,927,762, 4,560,655, or 5,122,469, WO 90\/103430, WO 87\/00195, and U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and\/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES\u2122), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN\u2122), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Other supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.","Polypeptides described herein expressed in a host cell may be secreted into and\/or recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated there from. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; hydrophobic affinity resins, ligand affinity using a suitable antigen immobilized on a matrix and Western blot assay.","Polypeptides that are produced may be purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.","2. Crystals and Crystal Structures","The present disclosure provides crystals of and a crystal structure of HGF \u03b2 chain cocrystallized with a fragment of the Met receptor. In some embodiments, the Met receptor fragment includes the Sema and PSI domain. The crystals were formed by contacting a mixture of purified HGF \u03b2 chain and the Met receptor extracellular fragment with a precipitant in a buffer. In some embodiments, the crystal of a HGF \u03b2 and a Met receptor can be diffracted by X-rays to determine atomic coordinates to a resolution of 5 \u212b or better. In some embodiments, the precipitant was 12-15% polyethylene glycol 10,000. In some embodiments, the crystals are formed from a HGF \u03b2 comprising SEQ ID NO:1 and a Met receptor fragment comprising SEQ ID NO:3.","The resulting crystals diffracted to 3.2 \u212b resolution (Table 1) and have one (1) full complex containing one Met fragment and a single HGF \u03b2-chain in the asymmetric unit. The structure was refined to an R-value of 20.9% (Rfree 27.0%) with good geometry. Of the 628 non-glycine and non-proline residues, 97.6% have their main-chain torsion angles in the \u2018most-favored\u2019 or the \u2018additionally allowed\u2019 regions of the Ramachandran plot (Laskowski et al., 1993). The refined model includes residues 495 to 722 of HGF and residues 40 to 301, 311 to 377, 382 to 400, and 414 to 564 of Met. Although a number of glycosylation sites displayed electron density, none of the sugars were modeled into the structure.","In a specific embodiment, the structure of HGF \u03b2 complexed with a Met receptor extracellular fragment (HGF \u03b2:Met) was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (NAVAZC 1994) using the crystal structure of HGF \u03b2 chain alone as search model (coordinates for HGF \u03b2 can be found in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession code: PDB1UX3). The crystals belonged to space group P2P2P with cell parameters of a=137.1 \u212b, b=186.4 \u212b and c=66.7 \u212b and contained 1 complex of Met: HGF \u03b2 chain in the asymmetric unit.","Each of the constituent amino acids in HGF \u03b2:Met is defined by a set of structural coordinates as set forth in Table 2. The coordinates and structure factors of the present disclosure have been deposited by the RCSB Protein Data Bank under Accession Code: PDB 1SHY.","The term \u201cstructure coordinates\u201d refers to Cartesian coordinates derived from mathematical equations related to the patterns obtained on diffraction of a monochromatic beam of X-rays by the atoms (scattering centers) of a Met receptor or Met: HGF \u03b2 in crystal form. The diffraction data are used to calculate an electron density map of the repeating unit of the crystal. The electron density maps are then used to establish the positions of the individual atoms of the Met receptor or protein ligand complex.","Slight variations in structure coordinates can be generated by mathematically manipulating the Met receptor or Met: HGF \u03b2 complex structure coordinates. For example, the structure coordinates as set forth in Table 2 could be manipulated by crystallographic permutations of the structure coordinates, fractionalization of the structure coordinates, integer additions or subtractions to sets of the structure coordinates, inversion of the structure coordinates, or any combination of the above. Alternatively, modifications in the crystal structure due to mutations, additions, substitutions, deletions, and combinations thereof, of amino acids, or other changes in any of the components that make up the crystal, could also yield variations in structure coordinates. Such slight variations in the individual coordinates will have little effect on overall shape. If such variations are within an acceptable standard error as compared to the original coordinates, the resulting three-dimensional shape is considered to be structurally equivalent. Structural equivalence is described in more detail below.","It should be noted that slight variations in individual structure coordinates of the HGF \u03b2:Met would not be expected to significantly alter the nature of chemical entities such as ligands that could associate with a binding site or other structural features of HGF \u03b2 or Met. In this context, the phrase \u201cassociating with\u201d refers to a condition of proximity between a ligand, or portions thereof, and a HGF \u03b2 or Met molecule or portions thereof. The association may be non-covalent, wherein the juxtaposition is energetically favored by hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and\/or electrostatic interactions, or it may be covalent.","HGF \u03b2 Chain Structure","The \u03b2-chain of HGF shares close to 40% sequence identity with the protease domain of plasmin, a trypsin-like serine protease. Structurally, these enzymes can be described as globular proteins composed of two antiparallel \u03b2-barrel domains (). Both of the \u03b2-barrels share the same general topology and are formed by six antiparallel \u03b2-strands, with the N-terminal four strands folding into a Greek key motif, followed by two strands that form a hairpin. HGF, like serine proteases, is expressed as a zymogen-like precursor. For serine proteases, structural studies have shown that insertion of the N-terminus resulting from the maturation process leads to allosteric rearrangements within the binding site for the protease substrate (Perona and Craig, 1995; Hedstrom 2002). In serine proteases, the newly formed N-terminus forms a salt bridge with a nearby aspartate, which leads to the formation of the oxyanion hole via the backbone NH's of two neighboring residues and the creation of a part of the S1 pocket (). The \u2018activated\u2019 form of the HGF \u03b2-chain, as seen in the structure presented here, is similar to the mature form of serine proteases: superposition with plasmin (pdb-code 1BML) yields an rmsd of about 1.3 \u212b for 212 C pairs. Superposition between HGF \u03b2-chain and plasminogen (pdb-code 1QRZ) reveal differences in their \u2018activation domain\u2019 (Freer et al., 1970) and only 198 C pairs can be aligned well.","As with serine proteases, the N-terminal amine of HGF \u03b2, Val495, is inserted into the core of the C-terminal \u03b2-barrel and forms a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of Asp672, which corresponds to Asp[c194] in plasmin, presumably leading to similar rearrangements, which have been characterized in serine proteases. The region in HGF corresponding to this so-called \u2018activation domain\u2019, i.e., the loops that undergo conformational changes in serine proteases (Freer et al., 1970; Huber and Bode, 1978), form part of the binding surface with Met.","After maturation, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains of HGF remain connected via a disulfide bond. Based on alignments of the kringle domains K1 to K4 of HGF \u03b1 chain and macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), the two cysteine residues responsible for the formation of this disulfide bond were identified as Cys487 on the \u03b1-chain of HGF and Cys604 on the \u03b2-chain (Donate et al., 1994). The crystal structure, however, raises the possibility of an alternative cysteine residue as the anchor for the HGF \u03b1-chain. The HGF \u03b2-chain has two (2) cysteine residues that do not have partners for the formation of disulfide bridges within the \u03b2-chain. Neither is conserved in plasmin or MSP and both are located on the periphery of the protein and are at least partially solvent exposed; either could be potential partners for the formation of a disulfide bond with the \u03b1-chain while the other remains unpaired. The superposition of the plasmin structure that contains part of the \u03b1-chain (), and the HGF \u03b2-chain structure presented here, shows that the distance between the C-terminus of the plasmin \u03b1-chain and Cys604 of the HGF \u03b2-chain is 27 \u212b and thus only slightly shorter than the respective distance between the plasmin \u03b1-chain C-terminus and Cys561 (33 \u212b) (). In addition, the sequence alignment between plasmin, MSP, and HGF () shows that the \u03b1-chain cysteine forming the disulfide bond in plasmin and MSP is 13 and 15 residues away from the cleavage site in those proteins respectively, but there are only 7 residues in HGF to span the distance from Cys487 to the cleavage site. Therefore, due to distance requirements, the C-terminus of the HGF \u03b1-chain cannot follow the same path on the surface of the \u03b2-chain as it does in plasmin or MSP. Regardless of the position of the disulfide bond between the alpha and beta chain, the overall structure or the structural model of the Met receptor or Met: HGF \u03b2 complex is not impacted.","Met Structure","The analysis of crystal structure of the Sema domain of Met shows that it forms 7-bladed \u03b2-propeller with a diameter of a little more than 50 \u212b. The overall shape of the domain resembles a funnel with an inner diameter of about 25 \u212b between main chain atoms at the wide portion and 10 \u212b in the narrowest part (). Generally, in \u03b2-propellers, each of the blades is formed by 4 antiparallel \u03b2-strands with strand A in the center of the propeller followed by strands B and C, and with strand D forming the outermost strand of the blade. The blades are arranged in a circular fashion, with the N-terminal strand forming strand D of the last blade, thus closing the propeller and stabilizing the overall structure (). The AB and CD loops of each blade of the Met Sema domain form the relatively flat \u2018bottom\u2019 face, and the generally longer BC and DA loops form the \u2018top\u2019 face of the propeller (). In Met, the position of the 6th and the 7th blade are off-center, with blade 7 being closer to the center of the barrel and blade 6 more distant. This gives the domain an overall oval shape.","The \u03b2-propeller of the Met Sema domain is structurally most closely related to the recently reported crystal structures of Sema4D (Love et al., 2003) and Sema3A (Antipenkov et al., 2003). With the exception of the D-strands in blades 3 and 5, the core of Sema4D and the Met Sema domain align well () and the superposition of residues 40 to 519 with the Sema domain of Sema4D results in an rmsd of 1.6 \u212b for 303 atom pairs (). The residues that form strand D5 in Sema4A are hydrogen bonded to strand D4 in Met, thus the 4th blade of Met contains an extra strand while blade 5 is missing its strand D. While the core of both proteins align well, the loops contain a number of insertions or deletions and generally adopt very different conformations. For example, the Sema domains of Met and of Sema4D both have an insert of about 20 residues following strand D1. In Met, these residues form a short antiparallel two-stranded \u03b2-sheet, while Sema4D has an \u03b1-helix (). Of the 24 loops that connect the various strands, only 3 have no insertions or deletions when comparing Met with Sema4D or Sema3A (). Interestingly, both the Semaphorins and the Met receptor have their largest insertion between strands C5 and A6; however, these inserts are not related in structure or sequence to each other. In Sema3A, this insert is involved in dimer formation and has been shown to be important for neuropilin binding (Antipenko et al., 2003). In the Met Sema domain, some of the residues within the insert are disordered and not included in our model (see ). The function of the insert in Met is not known but its proximity to the HGF \u03b2-chain binding site, discussed below, suggests that it might be involved in binding to the \u03b1-chain of HGF.","The loop containing the cleavage site between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain of Met connects strand D4 to A5; it is disordered in the electron density. After processing of native Met, the \u03b1-chain, which forms the N-terminal 4 blades of the Sema domain, and the \u03b1-chain remain connected via at least 2 disulfide bonds. One disulfide bond is formed between residues Cys298 on strand D4 and Cys363 on C5, and the second is formed between Cys282 (D3) and Cys409. This last cysteine is positioned in a disordered region of the insert after blade 4. The electron density does not allow tracing of the main chain in this area but there is sufficient density in the area of the S\u03b3 position to suggest that the disulfide bond is at least partially formed. With the exception of the N-terminal Cys26, which is disordered in the presently disclosed crystal structure and has no potential partner in the construct that was used for crystallization, all cysteine residues are engaged in disulfide bonds. It is unclear if Cys26 remains unpaired in the context of full length Met receptor or if it forms a disulfide bond with another cysteine that resides in the IPT domains. Besides the two disulfide bonds that covalently connect the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain of the Sema domain, the domain is stabilized by 5 additional disulfide bridges formed between Cys95-Cys10, Cys98-Cys159, Cys133-Cys141, Cys172-Cys175, and Cys385-Cys397 ().","The surface of the Met Sema domain appears to be mostly negatively charged, especially in the center of the bottom face of the Sema domain (). This surface, which is formed by a 20 residue insertion after strand D in the first blade and includes the rather irregular area of strand D in the third blade, shows clusters of acidic residues. Monomeric, full length Met was shown to bind to heparin (Gherardi et al., 2003). In the presently disclosed structure there are no dominant positively charged patches within the Met Sema domain; however, two arginines are located in the vicinity of the disordered furin-cleavage site. Together with the 6 positively charged residues that reside in this loop, these arginines could constitute a potential heparin binding site.","The last strand of the Sema domain (C7) is followed immediately by the PSI domain. This domain, with dimensions of about 20\u00d715 \u212b, contains four (4) disulfide bridges and is not an integral part of the Sema domain but rather an independent structural module. The small core of the domain is formed by a helix and a short two-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet that are connected via a disulfide bond and sandwich the side-chain of Trp540. Superposition of this domain with the PSI domain of Sema4D results in an rmsd of 1.6 \u212b for 41 C pairs. The relative orientation between the Sema and the PSI domains in the Met and the Sema4D structures, however, is different and requires a rotation of about 40\u00b0 for superposition.","Th Interface Between the HGF \u03b2-Chain and Met","The HGF \u03b2-chain binds to the Sema domain of Met at the bottom face of the propeller, and forms contacts with residues that protrude from blades 2 and 3 (). This is unlike other \u03b2-propeller containing receptors, such as the integrins, which bind their ligands utilizing the top face of the propeller (Xiong et al., 2002). Other Sema domain containing proteins, such as Sema3A and Sema4D, are also postulated to bind ligands using the top face (Antipenko et al., 2003; Love et al., 2003).","The interface between HGF \u03b2-chain and Met buries a total of 1770 \u212bof solvent accessible surface and is dominated by polar or charge-charge interactions. The volume of the cavity of the pocket that is blocked by Met on the surface of HGF \u03b2 is about 380 cubic angstroms as determined by placing a number of atoms at the entrance of the pocket to close the pocket and using the program GRASP (available from Columbia University at honigts@columbia\/edu) to calculate the volume of the resulting cavity.","Of the 20 HGF \u03b2 residues that have more that 10 \u212bburied in the interface, 6 are positively charged, 3 carry negative charges, and 3 are aromatic. The positively charged amino acids include K516, R533, R647, R695, K649, and R702. The negatively charged amino acids include E656, E670, and D578. The aromatic amino acids include Y513, Y673, and Y619. (See Table 3).","Even more dramatic, of the 18 residues contributing more than 10 \u212bof buried surface to the interface on the Met receptor, 6 carry negative charges, 4 are positively charged and 3 are aromatic. The positively charged amino acid residues include H148, R191, R218, and K223. The negatively charged amino acids include D127, D128, E168, E221, and D224. The aromatic amino acids include Y125, Y126, and F192. The combined buried surface of the hydrophobic residues Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met and Phe amounts to a mere 145 \u212b, while the charged residues Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, and His are responsible for more than 1,000 \u212bof buried surface. The resolution of the presently disclosed structure does not permit a detailed discussion of hydrogen bonds; however, the position of the side chains suggest the presence of at least 7 charged interactions between Met and the HGF \u03b2-chain. In some embodiments, variants of HGF beta or Met receptor may be designed to preserve and\/or strengthen these charge interactions. In other embodiments, small molecules may be designed to mimic the charge-charge interaction of either the HGF \u03b2 binding site for Met or the Met binding site for HGF \u03b2. (See Table 3).","On HGF, the residues analogous to those responsible for substrate binding and catalysis in the related serine proteases form most of the interactions with Met. Serine proteases bind linear peptides to their recognition site and form hydrogen bonds to main chain atoms to position a specific peptide bond for proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, the HGF \u03b2-chain binds to a series of protruding polar side chains from Met that comprise amino acid residues from 3 separate loops (). The first of these loops includes residues 124-128 of Met and connects strands A2 and B2 of Met. This loop contains two tyrosines that are in the core of the binding interface and pack against Arg695 of HGF \u03b2. The second loop of Met that contacts HGF \u03b2-chain includes residues Asp190, Arg191, and Phe192 and connects A3 and B3. Asp190 of Met forms charged interactions with Arg533 of HGF. The side chain of Arg191 of Met packs against Val692 and Pro693 of HGF with its hydrophobic portion and in the presently disclosed model is in hydrogen bonding distance to the side chains of Glu656 and Asp578 with its guanidinium group. This Asp578 corresponds to aspartic acid [c102] in the catalytic triad of the related serine proteases. Furthermore, the backbone of this loop forms hydrophilic interactions with Gln534, the residue homologous to the histidine [c57] of the protease catalytic triad.","The third segment contributing to the interface also includes strand D in the third blade of the propeller, an area that deviates from the classical \u2018propeller fold\u2019. Strand D is interrupted and has a short helical insert within its strand. This unusual conformation presents a number of residues towards the surface of the HGF \u03b2-chain. The most prominent interaction formed by this loop involves Glu221 which extends its side chain towards what would be the S1 binding site in serine proteases (). The carboxylate of Glu221 forms an extensive network of polar interactions with the side chain of Tyr673 (corresponding to the serine [c195] of the catalytic triad in proteases), as well as the backbone amides of Gly694 and Gly696 (); however, unlike in serine proteases, where the S1 pocket is filled by the specificity determining P1 residue, it does not penetrate deeply into the S1 pocket. As a result of the exchange of Ser to Tyr in position 673 [c195], the entrance of the S1 pocket is much smaller than in the related proteases. Thus, Glu221 projects towards the entrance of the S1 pocket from a different angle when compared to a complex between trypsin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and does not fill the pocket (). Therefore, a large cavity, presumably filled with a number of water molecules, remains in HGF \u03b2-chain.","Comparison of HGF \u03b2-Chain Unbound and Bound to Met","The structures of the HGF \u03b2-chain bound to Met and HGF \u03b2 in its unbound state, as disclosed in application U.S. Ser. No. 60\/569,301, filed May 6, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference, are very similar and superimpose with an rmsd of less than 0.8 \u212b for 218 C-pairs. The only significant differences between the two structures involve residues that are close to the Met binding interface. The backbone of residues 645 to 651 is disordered in unliganded HGF \u03b2 but well defined in the structure of the complex, where it adopts a conformation that is commonly observed in serine proteases (). The side chains of the basic residues Arg647 and Lys649 are not well defined in the electron density but project towards the Met binding interface and, in presently disclosed model, participate in the formation of the complex. Arg695 also undergoes a change in conformation upon Met binding. This residue, located in the center of the receptor binding interface, packs against Tyr125 of Met, and its backbone forms part of the S1 pocket. In the structure of unliganded HGF \u03b2, the conformation of the backbone in this area is different, and the side chain of Arg695 projects toward the disordered region of the structure. It is conceivable that the binding event alters the position of Arg695, which in turn allows residues 645 to 651 to adopt a more stable conformation. The tunnel or void identified in the crystal structure of HGF \u03b2 is also seen in the cocrystal.","3. Structurally Equivalent Crystal Structures","Various computational analyses can be used to determine whether a molecule or portions of the molecule defining structure features are \u201cstructurally equivalent,\u201d defined in terms of its three-dimensional structure, to all or part of a Met receptor or HGF \u03b2:Met complex or its ligand binding sites. Such analyses may be carried out in current software applications, such as the Molecular Similarity application of QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.), Version 4.1, and as described in the accompanying User's Guide.","The Molecular Similarity application permits comparisons between different structures, different conformations of the same structure, and different parts of the same structure. A procedure used in Molecular Similarity to compare structures comprises: 1) loading the structures to be compared; 2) defining the atom equivalences in these structures; 3) performing a fitting operation; and 4) analyzing the results.","One structure is identified as the target (i.e., the fixed structure); all remaining structures are working structures (i.e., moving structures). Since atom equivalency within QUANTA is defined by user input, for the purpose of this disclosure equivalent atoms are defined as protein backbone atoms (N, C\u03b1, C, and O) for all conserved residues between the two structures being compared. A conserved residue is defined as a residue that is structurally or functionally equivalent. Only rigid fitting operations are considered.","When a rigid fitting method is used, the working structure is translated and rotated to obtain an optimum fit with the target structure. The fitting operation uses an algorithm that computes the optimum translation and rotation to be applied to the moving structure, such that the root mean square difference of the fit over the specified pairs of equivalent atom is an absolute minimum. This number, given in Angstroms, is reported by QUANTA.","Structurally equivalent crystal structures have portions of the two molecules that are substantially identical, within an acceptable margin of error. The margin of error can be calculated by methods known to those of skill in the art In some embodiments, any molecule or molecular complex or any portion thereof, that has a root mean square deviation of conserved residue backbone atoms (N, C\u03b1, C, O) of less than about 0.70 \u212b, preferably 0.5 \u212b. For example, structurally equivalent molecules or molecular complexes are those that are defined by the entire set of structure coordinates listed in Table 2\u00b1a root mean square deviation from the conserved backbone atoms of those amino acids of not more than 0.70 \u212b, preferably 0.5 \u212b. The term \u201croot mean square deviation\u201d means the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations. It is a way to express the deviation or variation from a trend or object. For purposes of this disclosure, the \u201croot mean square deviation\u201d defines the variation in the backbone of a protein from the backbone of HGF \u03b2:Met complex (as defined by the structure coordinates of the complex as described herein) or a defining structural feature thereof.","4. Structurally Homologous Molecules, Molecular Complexes, and Crystal Structures","Structure coordinates can be used to aid in obtaining structural information about another crystallized molecule or molecular complex. The method of the disclosure allows determination of at least a portion of the three-dimensional structure of molecules or molecular complexes that contain one or more structural features that are similar to structural features of at least a portion of Met receptor or HGF \u03b2:Met complex. These molecules are referred to herein as \u201cstructurally homologous\u201d to Met receptor or HGF \u03b2:Met. Similar structural features can include, for example, regions of amino acid identity, conserved active site or binding site motifs, and similarly arranged secondary structural elements (e.g. binding sites for HGF \u03b2, PSI domain, IPT domain, and propellor blades of the Sema domain).","Optionally, structural homology is determined by aligning the residues of the two amino acid sequences to optimize the number of identical amino acids along the lengths of their sequences; gaps in either or both sequences are permitted in making the alignment in order to optimize the number of identical amino acids, although the amino acids in each sequence must nonetheless remain in their proper order. Two amino acid sequences are compared using the BLAST program, version 2.0.9, of the BLAST 2 search algorithm, as described by Tatusova et al. (56), and available at http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/. Preferably, the default values for all BLAST 2 search parameters are used, including matrix BLOSUM62; open gap penalty=11, extension gap penalty=1, gap x_dropoff=50, expect=10, wordsize=3, and filter on. In the comparison of two amino acid sequences using the BLAST search algorithm, structural similarity is referred to as \u201cidentity.\u201d","In some embodiments, a structurally homologous molecule is a protein that has an amino acid sequence sharing at least 80% identity with a native or recombinant amino acid sequence of Met, preferably an extracellular fragment of the Met receptor comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:10. An extracellular fragment of Met receptor comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 has amino acid substitutions at positions 304-308 to insert a thrombin cleavage site. In some embodiments, a Met receptor has a sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 and the structurally homologous molecule is a variant that has a % sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3 of at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% or greater. In some embodiments, the Met receptor variant or structurally homologous molecule has one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, preferably only conservative amino acid substitutions and retains the structure of the binding site for HGF \u03b2. In some embodiments, the Met receptor variant has about 1-25 conservative amino acid substitutions, more preferably about 1-20 conservative amino acids substitutions, more preferably about 1-10 conservative amino acid substitutions, more preferably about 1-5 conservative amino acid substitutions, and more preferably about 1-2 conservative amino acid substitutions. Preferably, the variant retains at least one or more domains such as the binding site for HGF \u03b2. More preferably, a protein that is structurally homologous to Met includes at least one contiguous stretch of at least 50 amino acids that shares at least 80% amino acid sequence identity with the analogous portion of the native or recombinant Met. Methods for generating structural information about the structurally homologous molecule or molecular complex are well known and include, for example, molecular replacement techniques.","Therefore, in another embodiment this disclosure provides a method of utilizing molecular replacement to obtain structural information about a molecule or molecular complex whose structure is unknown comprising:","(a) generating an X-ray diffraction pattern from a crystallized molecule or molecular complex of unknown or incompletely known structure; and\/or (b) applying at least a portion of the structural coordinates of the Met receptor or HGF \u03b2:Met complex to the X-ray diffraction pattern to generate a three-dimensional electron density map of the molecule or molecular complex whose structure is unknown or incompletely known.","By using molecular replacement, all or part of the structure coordinates of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met complex as provided by this disclosure can be used to determine the unsolved structure of a crystallized molecule or molecular complex more quickly and efficiently than attempting to determine such information ab initio. Coordinates of structural features of the Met receptor can be utilized including the Sema domain, PSI domain and the binding site for HGF \u03b2.","Molecular replacement can provide an accurate estimation of the phases for an unknown or incompletely known structure. Phases are one factor in equations that are used to solve crystal structures, and this factor cannot be determined directly. Obtaining accurate values for the phases, by methods other than molecular replacement, can be a time-consuming process that involves iterative cycles of approximations and refinements and greatly hinders the solution of crystal structures. However, when the crystal structure of a protein containing at least a structurally homologous portion has been solved, molecular replacement using the known structure provide a useful estimate of the phases for the unknown or incompletely known structure.","Thus, this method involves generating a preliminary model of a molecule or molecular complex whose structure coordinates are unknown, by orienting and positioning the relevant portion of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met complex within the unit cell of the crystal of the unknown molecule or molecular complex. This orientation or positioning is conducted so as best to account for the observed X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystal of the molecule or molecular complex whose structure is unknown. Phases can then be calculated from this model and combined with the observed X-ray diffraction pattern amplitudes to generate an electron density map of the structure. This map, in turn, can be subjected to established and well-known model building and structure refinement techniques to provide a final, accurate structure of the unknown crystallized molecule or molecular complex (see for example, Lattman, 1985115:55-77).","Structural information about a portion of any crystallized molecule or molecular complex that is sufficiently structurally homologous to a portion of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met can be resolved by this method. In addition to a molecule that shares one or more structural features with the Met receptor, such as the Sema domain, and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met as described above, a molecule that has similar bioactivity, such as the same catalytic activity, substrate specificity or ligand binding activity as the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met, may also be sufficiently structurally homologous to a portion of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met to permit use of the structure coordinates of HGF \u03b2:Met to solve its crystal structure or identify structural features that are similar to those identified in the Met receptor described herein. It will be appreciated that amino acid residues in the structurally homologous molecule identified as corresponding to the Met receptor structural feature may have different amino acid numbering.","In one embodiment of the disclosure, the method of molecular replacement is utilized to obtain structural information about a molecule or molecular complex, wherein the molecule or molecular complex includes at least one HGF \u03b2:Met or Met receptor subunit or homolog. In the context of the present disclosure, a \u201cstructural homolog\u201d of the Met receptor or HGF \u03b2:Met is a protein that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or rearrangements with respect to the amino acid sequence of HGF \u03b2:Met complex or Met receptor, but that, when folded into its native conformation, exhibits or is reasonably expected to exhibit at least a portion of the tertiary (three-dimensional) structure of at least a portion of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met complex. A portion of the Met receptor includes the Sema domain, PSI domain, IPT domains, and binding site for HGF \u03b2 and combinations thereof.","For example, structurally homologous molecules can contain deletions or additions of one or more contiguous or noncontiguous amino acids, such as a loop or a domain. Structurally homologous molecules also include \u201cmodified\u201d extracellular fragment of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met molecules that have been chemically or enzymatically derivatized at one or more constituent amino acid, including side chain modifications, backbone modifications, and N- and C-terminal modifications including acetylation, hydroxylation, methylation, amidation, and the attachment of carbohydrate or lipid moieties, cofactors, and like modifications. It will be appreciated that amino acid residues in the structurally homologous molecule identified as corresponding to extracellular fragment of the Met receptor or other structural feature of the Sema domain of the Met receptor may have different amino acid numbering.","A heavy atom derivative of HGF \u03b2:Met is also included as a HGF \u03b2:Met homolog. The term \u201cheavy atom derivative\u201d refers to derivatives of HGF \u03b2:Met produced by chemically modifying a crystal of HGF \u03b2 or Met or both. In practice, a crystal is soaked in a solution containing heavy metal atom salts, or organometallic compounds, e.g., lead chloride, gold thiomalate, thiomersal or uranyl acetate, which can diffuse through the crystal and bind to the surface of the protein. The location(s) of the bound heavy metal atom(s) can be determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of the soaked crystal. This information, in turn, is used to generate the phase information used to construct three-dimensional structure of the protein (Blundell, et al., 1976, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.).","The structure coordinates of HGF \u03b2:Met provided by this disclosure are particularly useful in solving the structure of Met variants. Variants may be prepared, for example, by expression of Met cDNA previously altered in its coding sequence by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described herein. Variants may also be generated by site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into Met proteins using known biosynthetic methods (Noren, et al., 1989244:182-88). In this method, the codon encoding the amino acid of interest in wild-type Met is replaced by a \u201cblank\u201d nonsense codon, TAG, using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. A suppressor tRNA directed against this codon is then chemically aminoacylated in vitro with the desired unnatural amino acid. The aminoacylated tRNA is then added to an in vitro translation system to yield a mutant Met with the site-specific incorporated unnatural amino acid.","The structure coordinates of HGF \u03b2:Met are also particularly useful to solve or model the structure of crystals of HGF \u03b2, Met, HGF \u03b2 variants, Met variants, or Met homologs or HGF \u03b2 homologs which are co-complexed with a variety of ligands. HGF \u03b2 is an inhibitor of full length HGF and can be used to identify or design other like inhibitors. This approach enables the determination of the optimal sites for interaction between ligand entities, including candidate HGF \u03b2 or Met ligands. Potential sites for modification within the various binding sites of the molecule can also be identified. This information provides an additional tool for determining more efficient binding interactions, for example, increased hydrophobic or polar interactions, between Met and a ligand. For example, high-resolution X-ray diffraction data collected from crystals exposed to different types of solvent allows the determination of where each type of solvent molecule resides. Small molecules that bind tightly to those sites can then be designed and synthesized and tested for their Met affinity, such as inhibition activity.","In another embodiment, homology modeling can be conducted using the structural coordinates of HGF \u03b2 and\/or the Met receptor and a program designed to generate models of structures, such as Protein Explorer, Swiss Model, or RASMOL. The programs can provide a structural model of a homolog or variant of HGF \u03b2 and\/or Met by providing the structural coordinates such as provided in Table 2 and an alignment of the sequences.","All of the complexes referred to above may be studied using well-known X-ray diffraction techniques and may be refined versus 1.5-3.5 \u212b resolution X-ray data to an R-factor of about 0.30 or less using computer software, such as X-PLOR (Yale University, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.)(see for example, Blundell, et al. 1976, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., and , Vol. 114 & 115, H. W. Wyckoff et al., eds., Academic Press (1985)). This information may thus be used to optimize known Met modulators, and more importantly, to design new Met modulators.","The disclosure also includes the unique three-dimensional configuration defined by a set of points defined by the structure coordinates for a molecule or molecular complex structurally homologous to an extracellular fragment of the Met receptor or HGF \u03b2:Met complex as determined using the method of the present disclosure, structurally equivalent configurations, and magnetic storage media including such set of structure coordinates.","4. Homology modeling","Using homology modeling, a computer model of a HGF \u03b2:Met complex or Met receptor homolog can be built or refined without crystallizing the homolog. First, a preliminary model of the homolog is created by sequence alignment with HGF \u03b2:Met or an extracellular fragment of Met, secondary structure prediction, the screening of structural libraries, or any combination of those techniques. Computational software may be used to carry out the sequence alignments and the secondary structure predictions. Programs available for such an analysis include Protein Explorer (eg available at molvissdsc.edu.protexpl.frontdoor.htm), Swiss Model (eg available at swissmodel.expasy.org) and RASMOL.Structural incoherences, e.g., structural fragments around insertions and deletions, can be modeled by screening a structural library for peptides of the desired length and with a suitable conformation. For prediction of the side chain conformation, a side chain rotamer library may be employed. If the homolog has been crystallized, the final homology model can be used to solve the crystal structure of the homolog by molecular replacement, as described above. Next, the preliminary model is subjected to energy minimization to yield an energy-minimized model. The energy-minimized model may contain regions where stereochemistry restraints are violated, in which case such regions are remodeled to obtain a final homology model. The homology model is positioned according to the results of molecular replacement, and subjected to further refinement including molecular dynamics calculations.","6. Methods for Identification of Modulators of HGF \u03b2:Met","Potent and selective ligands that modulate activity (antagonists and agonists) are identified using the three-dimensional model of the Met binding site for HGF \u03b2 and\/or other structural features produced using the coordinates of a cocrystal of HGF \u03b2 with Met or a fragment thereof, such as provided in Table 2. Using this model, ligands that interact with the Met binding site for HGF \u03b2 are identified, and the result of the interactions is modeled. In some embodiments, agents identified as candidate molecules for modulating the activity of HGF, Met and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met can be screened against known bioassays. For example, the ability of an agent to inhibit the anti-apoptotic effects of Met can be measured using assays known in the art, or for example, the assays disclosed in the Examples. Using the modeling information and the assays described, one can identify agents that possess HGF, Met and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met\u2014modulating properties.","The methods of the disclosure also include methods of identifying molecules that mimic HGF \u03b2 binding to a ligand (such as the Met receptor) or Met receptor binding to HGF \u03b2 or both, but do not activate the HGF\/Met signaling pathway. HGF \u03b2 is an inhibitor of full length HGF and can be used to identify or design other like inhibitors. These molecules can be identified using the three-dimensional model of HGF \u03b2:Met complex using the coordinates of Tables 7 and 2.","In another embodiment, a candidate modulator can be identified using a biological assay such as binding to HGF and\/or HGF \u03b2, modulating Met phosphorylation or modulating HGF induced cell migration. The candidate modulator can then serve as a model to design similar agents and\/or to modify the candidate modulator for example, to improve characteristics such as binding to HGF \u03b2 or Met receptor. Design or modification of candidate modulators can be accomplished using the crystal structure coordinates and available software.","Binding Site and Other Structural Features","Applicants' disclosure provides information inter alia about the shape and structure of the structural binding site of Met for HGF \u03b2 in the presence or absence of a modulator. Binding sites are of significant utility in fields such as drug discovery. The association of natural ligands or substrates with the binding sites of their corresponding receptors or enzymes is the basis of many biological mechanisms of action. Similarly, many drugs exert their biological effects through association with the binding sites of receptors and enzymes. Such associations may occur with all or any part of the binding site. An understanding of such associations helps lead to the design of drugs having more favorable associations with their target, and thus improved biological effects. Therefore, this information is valuable in designing potential modulators of HGF, Met and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met binding sites, as discussed in more detail below.","The amino acid constituents of a Met or HGF \u03b2:Met binding site as defined herein are positioned in three dimensions. In one aspect, the structure coordinates defining a binding site of Met or HGF \u03b2:Met include structure coordinates of all atoms in the constituent amino acids; in another aspect, the structure coordinates of a binding site include structure coordinates of just the backbone atoms of the constituent atoms.","In some embodiments, the HGF \u03b2 structural binding site for Met, for example, includes the amino acids highlighted in  as well as those identified in Table 3. In some embodiments, the amino acid residues identified in the HGF \u03b2 binding site for Met comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of at least one or more or all amino acid residue corresponding to residues 513, 516, 533, 534, 537, 578, 619, 647, 649, 656, 669, 670, 673, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 699 or 702 or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the amino acid residues identified in the HGF \u03b2 binding site for Met comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of at least one or more or all amino acid residue corresponding to residues Y513, K516, R533, Q 534, P537, D 578, Y619, R647, K 649, E656, C669, E670, Y673, V692, P693, G694, R695, G 696, C697, I699 or R702 or mixtures thereof, or conservative amino acid substitutions thereof. The cocrystallization studies indicate that amino acids residues 645 to 651 are better ordered in the HGF \u03b2:Met complex and further indicate that K649 contacts the Met receptor. In other embodiments, the amino acid residues identified in the HGF \u03b2 binding site for Met comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of at least one or more or all amino acid residue corresponding to residues Y513, K516, R533, Q534, F536, P537, S538, R539, D578, Y619, R647, K649, E656, P668, C669, E670, Y673, V692, P693, G694, R695, C696, C697, I699, R702 or mixtures thereof or conservative amino acid substitutions thereof. These residues may participate in polar or nonpolar interactions with charged residues on Met.","The term \u201cMet structural binding site\u201d includes all or a portion of a molecule or molecular complex whose shape is sufficiently similar to at least a portion of a binding site of Met for HGF \u03b2 as to be expected to bind HGF \u03b2 or related structural analogs. A structurally equivalent ligand binding site is defined by a root mean square deviation from the structure coordinates of the backbone atoms of the amino acids that make up binding sites in Met of at most about 0.70 \u212b, preferably about 0.5 \u212b. In some embodiments, the Met structural binding site for HGF \u03b2, for example, includes the amino acids highlighted in  as well as those identified in Table 3. In some embodiments, a structural binding site for HGF \u03b2 on the Met receptor comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at least one or more or all amino acid residues corresponding to residues 124-128, 148, 167, 190-192, 218, 220 to 223, 229 to 230, or 286, 414 or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, a structural binding site for HGF \u03b2 on the Met receptor comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at least one or more or all amino acid residue corresponding to residues T124, Y125, Y126, D127, D128, H148, E167, E168, D190, R191, F192, R218, K220, E221, T222, K223, D224, M227, L229, T230, I284, S286, D414, or mixtures thereof or conservative substitutions thereof. These residues may participate in polar interactions with charged residues on HGF \u03b2.","The binding site of HGF \u03b2 or Met may be defined by those amino acids whose backbone atoms are situated within about 5 \u212b of one or more constituent atoms of a bound substrate or ligand. In yet another alternative, the binding site for HGF \u03b2 on Met receptor can be defined by those amino acids whose backbone atoms are situated within a sphere centered on the coordinates representing the alpha carbon atom of amino acid E221 on the Met receptor, the sphere having a radius of about 5-6 \u212b, for example 5.8 \u212b.","Other structural features include the blades of the propellor of the Sema domain of the Met receptor and those that define the void in the center of the propellor, as well as the domains of the Met receptor including PSI and IPT domains. Amino acid residues that form these structural features can be found in .","Rational Drug Design","Computational techniques can be used to screen, identify, select, design ligands, and combinations thereof, capable of associating with Met or structurally homologous molecules. Candidate modulators of HGF, HGF \u03b2 and\/or Met may be identified using functional assays, such as binding to HGF \u03b2 or Met, and novel modulators designed based on the structure of the candidate molecules so identified. Knowledge of the structure coordinates for Met or HGF \u03b2:Met permits, for example, the design, the identification of synthetic compounds, and like processes, and the design, the identification of other molecules and like processes, that have a shape complementary to the conformation of the Met and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding sites. In particular, computational techniques can be used to identify or design ligands, such as agonists and\/or antagonists, that associate with a Met and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site. Antagonists may bind to or interfere with all or a portion of an active site of Met, and can be competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetitive inhibitors. Once identified and screened for biological activity, these agonists, antagonists, and combinations thereof, may be used therapeutically and\/or prophylactically, for example, to block Met activity and thus prevent the onset and\/or further progression of diseases associated with Met activity. Structure-activity data for analogues of ligands that bind to or interfere with Met binding sites and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding sites can also be obtained computationally.","In some embodiments, an antagonist or agonist may be a molecule that mimics either HGF \u03b2 or the Met receptor such that it binds to either the Met receptor or HGF \u03b2 or both. HGF \u03b2 is an inhibitor of full length HGF and can be used to identify or design other like inhibitors. In some embodiments, if the molecule is an antagonist, it binds to either receptor or both but does not activate the Met receptor. As the structural information provided herein indicates that the interaction of the HGF \u03b2 with the Met receptor includes charge-charge interactions, in some embodiments, agonists or antagonists can be designed to include components that preserve and\/or strengthen the charge interactions. Such antagonists or agonists would include components that are able to interact, for example, hydrogen bond with the charged amino acids found in either the HGF \u03b2 or Met receptor binding site or both. In some embodiments, for HGF \u03b2, antagonist or agonist molecules are designed or selected that can interact with at least one or more or all amino acid residues that comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid residues Y513, K516, R533, Y619, R647, R695, K649, R702, E656, E670, Y673, or D578 or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, for the Met receptor, antagonist or agonist molecules are designed or selected that can interact with at least one or more or all amino acid residues that comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid residues Y125, Y126, H148, R191, R218, K223, D127, D128, E168, F192, E221, or D224 or mixtures thereof. In other embodiments, another criteria that may be utilized in the design of modulators is whether the modulator can fit into the binding site cavity on HGF \u03b2 that is blocked by Met. The volume of that cavity is about 380 cubic angstroms. The volume of the cavity can be determined by placing atoms in the entrance of the pocket close to the surface and using a program like GRASP to calculate the volume of those atoms.","Data stored in a machine-readable storage medium that is capable of displaying a graphical three-dimensional representation of the structure of Met or a structurally homologous molecule or molecular complex, as identified herein, or portions thereof may thus be advantageously used for drug discovery. The structure coordinates of the ligand are used to generate a three-dimensional image that can be computationally fit to the three-dimensional image of Met, HGF \u03b2:Met complex, or a structurally homologous molecule. The three-dimensional molecular structure encoded by the data in the data storage medium can then be computationally evaluated for its ability to associate with ligands. When the molecular structures encoded by the data is displayed in a graphical three-dimensional representation on a computer screen, the protein structure can also be visually inspected for potential association with ligands.","One embodiment of the method of drug design involves evaluating the potential association of a candidate ligand with Met, such as HGF \u03b2, or a structurally homologous molecule or homologous complex, particularly with a binding site on the Met receptor. The method of drug design thus includes computationally evaluating the potential of a selected ligand to associate with any of the molecules or molecular complexes set forth above. This method includes the steps of: (a) employing computational means, for example, such as a programmable computer including the appropriate software known in the art or as disclosed herein, to perform a fitting operation between the selected ligand and a ligand binding site or a pocket nearby the ligand binding site of the molecule or molecular complex; and (b) analyzing the results of the fitting operation to quantify the association between the ligand and the ligand binding site. Optionally, the method further comprises analyzing the ability of the selected ligand to interact with charged amino acids in either the HGF \u03b2 and\/or Met receptor binding sites. Other structural features of the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2: Met complex can also be analyzed in the same manner.","In another embodiment, the method of drug design involves computer-assisted design of ligand that associate with Met, HGF \u03b2: Met, its homologs, or portions thereof. Ligands can be designed in a step-wise fashion, one fragment at a time, or may be designed as a whole or de novo. Ligands can be designed based on the structure of molecules that can modulate at least one biological function of HGF \u03b2 or Met.","In some embodiments, to be a viable drug candidate, the ligand identified or designed according to the method must be capable of structurally associating with at least part of a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site, and must be able, sterically and energetically, to assume a conformation that allows it to associate with the Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site. Non-covalent molecular interactions important in this association include hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and\/or electrostatic interactions. In some embodiments, agents may contact at least one amino acid position in the Met binding site for HGF \u03b2. Conformational considerations include the overall three-dimensional structure and orientation of the ligand in relation to the ligand binding site, and the spacing between various functional groups of a ligand that directly interact with the Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site or homologs thereof.","Optionally, the potential binding of a ligand to a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site is analyzed using computer modeling techniques prior to the actual synthesis and testing of the ligand. If these computational experiments suggest insufficient interaction and association between it and the Met binding site, and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site testing of the ligand is obviated. However, if computer modeling indicates a strong interaction, the molecule may then be synthesized and tested for its ability to bind to or interfere with a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site. Binding assays to determine if a compound actually modulates with Met activity can also be performed and are well known in the art.","Several methods can be used to screen ligands or fragments for the ability to associate with a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site. This process may begin by visual inspection of, for example, a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site on the computer screen based on the Met or HGF \u03b2:Met structure coordinates or other coordinates which define a similar shape generated from the machine-readable storage medium. Selected ligands may then be positioned in a variety of orientations, or docked, within the binding site. Docking may be accomplished using software such as QUANTA and SYBYL, followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics force fields, such as CHARMM and AMBER.","Specialized computer programs may also assist in the process of selecting ligands. Examples include GRID (Hubbard, S. 19996:711-4); MCSS (Miranker, et al. 199111:29-34) available from Molecular Simulations, San Diego, Calif.; AUTODOCK (Goodsell, et al. 19908:195-202) available from Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, Calif.; and DOCK (Kuntz, et al. 1982161:269-88) available from University of California, San Francisco, Calif.","For example, an examination of the structure of HGF \u03b2 shows a tunnel or void formed by amino acid residues 634, 660-670, 673, 691 and 693-706. A molecule with an indole ring can fit within this void as determined by manual docking","Met binding ligands can be designed to fit a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site, optionally as defined by the binding of a known modulator or one identified as modulating the activity of HGF \u03b2 or Met. Examples of tyrosine kinase inhibitor compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,463. There are many ligand design methods including, without limitation, LUDI (Bohm, 19926:61-78) available from Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.; LEGEND (Nishibata, Y., and Itai, A. 199336:2921-8) available from Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.; LeapFrog, available from Tripos Associates, St. Louis, Mo.; and SPROUT (Gillet, et al. 19937:127-53) available from the University of Leeds, UK.","Once a compound has been designed or selected by the above methods, the efficiency with which that ligand may bind to or interfere with a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site may be tested and optimized by computational evaluation. For example, an effective Met binding site ligand and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site should preferably demonstrate a relatively small difference in energy between its bound and free states (i.e., a small deformation energy of binding). Thus, an efficient Met binding site ligand should preferably be designed with a deformation energy of binding of not greater than about 10 to about 15 kcal\/mole, such as about 12 kcal\/mole, preferably not greater than about 8 to about 12 kcal\/mole, such as about 10 kcal\/mole, and more preferably not greater than about 5 to about 10 kcal\/mole, such as about 7 kcal\/mole. Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site ligands may interact with the binding site in more than one conformation that is similar in overall binding energy. In those cases, the deformation energy of binding is taken to be the difference between the free energy of the ligand and the average energy of the conformations observed when the ligand binds to the protein.","A ligand designed or selected as binding to or interfering with a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site may be further computationally optimized so that in its bound state it would preferably lack repulsive electrostatic interaction with the target enzyme and with the surrounding water molecules. Such non-complementary electrostatic interactions include repulsive charge-charge, dipole-dipole, and charge-dipole interactions.","Specific computer software is available to evaluate compound deformation energy and electrostatic interactions. Examples of programs designed for such uses include: Gaussian 94, revision C (M. J. Frisch, Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.); AMBER, version 4.1 (P. A. Kollman, University of California at San Francisco); QUANTA\/CHARMM (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, Calif.); Insight II\/Discover (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, Calif.); DelPhi (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, Calif.); and AMSOL (Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange, Indiana University). These programs can be implemented, for instance, using a Silicon Graphics workstation, such as an Indigo2 with IMPACT graphics. Other hardware systems and software packages will be known to those skilled in the art.","Another approach encompassed by this disclosure is the computational screening of small molecule databases for ligands or compounds that can bind in whole, or in part, to a Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site. In this screening, the quality of fit of such ligands to the binding site may be judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy (Meng, et al., 199213:505-24). In addition, these small molecule databases can be screened for the ability to interact with the charged amino acids in the Met binding site and\/or HGF \u03b2 binding site as identified herein.","A compound that is identified or designed as a result of any of these methods can be obtained (or synthesized) and tested for its biological activity, for example, binding and\/or inhibition of HGF and\/or Met activity.","Another method involves assessing agents that are antagonists or agonists of the Met receptor. A method comprises applying at least a portion of the crystallography coordinates of a cocrystal of HGF \u03b2 and Met, such as provided in Tables 7 and\/or 2 to a computer algorithm that generates a three-dimensional model of HGF \u03b2: Met complex or the Met receptor suitable for designing molecules that are antagonists or agonists and searching a molecular structure database to identify potential antagonists or agonists. In some embodiments, a portion of the structural coordinates of a cocrystal of HGF \u03b2 and Met, such as provided in Tables 7 and\/or 2 that define a structural feature, for example, binding site for HGF \u03b2, may be utilized. The method may further comprise synthesizing or obtaining the agonist or antagonist and contacting the agonist or antagonist with the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2 and selecting the antagonist or agonist that modulates the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2 activity compared to a control without the agonist or antagonists and\/or selecting the antagonist or agonist that binds to the Met receptor and\/or HGF \u03b2. Activities of HGF and\/or the Met receptor include phosphorylation of Met, stimulation of cell proliferation, and stimulation of cell migration.","A compound that is identified or designed as a result of any of these methods can be obtained (or synthesized) and tested for its biological activity, for example, binding to HGF \u03b2 and\/or Met receptor and\/or modulation of HGF, HGF \u03b2 and\/or Met activity. Other modulators of the Met receptor include, for example, monoclonal antibodies directed against the Met receptor, peptide(s) that can modulate Met receptor function, or small-molecule compounds, such as organic and inorganic molecules, which can be identified with methods of the present disclosure.","7. Machine-Readable Storage Media","Transformation of the structure coordinates for all or a portion of Met or the HGF \u03b2:Met complex or one of its ligand binding sites, for structurally homologous molecules as defined below, or for the structural equivalents of any of these molecules or molecular complexes as defined above, into three-dimensional graphical representations of the molecule or complex can be conveniently achieved through the use of commercially-available software.","The disclosure thus further provides a machine-readable storage medium including a data storage material encoded with machine-readable data wherein a machine programmed with instructions for using said data displays a graphical three-dimensional representation of any of the molecule or molecular complexes of this disclosure that have been described above. In a preferred embodiment, the machine-readable data storage medium includes a data storage material encoded with machine-readable data wherein a machine programmed with instructions for using the abovementioned data displays a graphical three-dimensional representation of a molecule or molecular complex including all or any parts of a Met, Met ligand binding site, or Met-like ligand binding site, HGF \u03b2, HGF \u03b2 binding site, or HGF\u03b2:Met complex as defined above. In another preferred embodiment, the machine-readable data storage medium includes a data storage material encoded with machine readable data wherein a machine programmed with instructions for using the data displays a graphical three-dimensional representation of a molecule or molecular complex\u00b1a root mean square deviation from the atoms of the amino acids of not more than 0.05 \u212b.","In an alternative embodiment, the machine-readable data storage medium includes a data storage material encoded with a first set of machine readable data which includes the Fourier transform of structure coordinates, and wherein a machine programmed with instructions for using the data is combined with a second set of machine readable data including the X-ray diffraction pattern of a molecule or molecular complex to determine at least a portion of the structure coordinates corresponding to the second set of machine readable data.","For example, a system for reading a data storage medium may include a computer including a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d), a working memory which may be, for example, RAM (random access memory) or \u201ccore\u201d memory, mass storage memory (such as one or more disk drives or CD-ROM drives), one or more display devices (e.g., cathode-ray tube (\u201cCRT\u201d) displays, light emitting diode (\u201cLED\u201d) displays, liquid crystal displays (\u201cLCDs\u201d), electroluminescent displays, vacuum fluorescent displays, field emission displays (\u201cFEDs\u201d), plasma displays, projection panels, etc.), one or more user input devices (e.g., keyboards, microphones, mice, track balls, touch pads, etc.), one or more input lines, and one or more output lines, all of which are interconnected by a conventional bidirectional system bus. The system may be a stand-alone computer, or may be networked (e.g., through local area networks, wide area networks, intranets, extranets, or the internet) to other systems (e.g., computers, hosts, servers, etc.). The system may also include additional computer controlled devices such as consumer electronics and appliances.","Input hardware may be coupled to the computer by input lines and may be implemented in a variety of ways. Machine-readable data of this disclosure may be inputted via the use of a modem or modems connected by a telephone line or dedicated data line. Alternatively or additionally, the input hardware may include CD-ROM drives or disk drives. In conjunction with a display terminal, a keyboard may also be used as an input device.","Output hardware may be coupled to the computer by output lines and may similarly be implemented by conventional devices. By way of example, the output hardware may include a display device for displaying a graphical representation of a binding site of this disclosure using a program such as QUANTA as described herein. Output hardware might also include a printer, so that hard copy output may be produced, or a disk drive, to store system output for later use.","In operation, a CPU coordinates the use of the various input and output devices, coordinates data accesses from mass storage devices, accesses to and from working memory, and determines the sequence of data processing steps. A number of programs may be used to process the machine-readable data of this disclosure. Such programs are discussed in reference to the computational methods of drug discovery as described herein. References to components of the hardware system are included as appropriate throughout the following description of the data storage medium.","Machine-readable storage devices useful in the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, magnetic devices, electrical devices, optical devices, and combinations thereof.

It should be understood that these storage devices include necessary hardware (e.g., drives, controllers, power supplies, etc.) as well as any necessary media (e.g., disks, flash cards, etc.) to enable the storage of data.","8. Therapeutic Use","HGF, Met, and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met complex modulator compounds obtained by methods of the invention are useful in a variety of therapeutic settings. For example, Met antagonists designed or identified using the crystal structure of an extracellular fragment of Met or HGF \u03b2:Met complex can be used to treat disorders or conditions, where inhibition or prevention of Met binding or activity is indicated.","Likewise, Met agonists designed or identified using the crystal structure of the HGF \u03b2:Met complex or an extracellular fragment of Met can be used to treat disorders or conditions, where induction or stimulation of Met activity is indicated.","An indication can be, for example, inhibition or stimulation of Met phosphorylation and the concomitant activation of a complex set of intracellular pathways that lead to cell growth, differentiation, and migration in a variety of cell types. The ability of HGF to stimulate mitogenesis, cell motility, and matrix invasion gives it and the Met receptor a central role in angiogenensis, tumorogenesis and tissue regeneration. Another indication can be, for example, in inhibition or stimulation of embryonic development. Still another indication can be, for example, in inhibition or stimulation of tissue regeneration. Another indication can be, for example, in inhibition of angiogenesis, mitogenesis and\/or vasculogenesis. Expression of HGF has been associated with thyroid cancer, colon cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma. Yet another indication can be, for example, in inhibition or stimulation of the HGF\/Met signaling pathway. Still yet another indication can be, for example, in inhibition of invasive tumor growth and metastasis.","Met and\/or HGF \u03b2:Met complex antagonists are also useful as chemosensitizing agents, useful in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, in particular, drugs that induce apoptosis.

In addition, the cleavage site after residue Arg308, present in the Met receptor family but not in the Sema domain of the Semaphorins or plexins, was replaced with a thrombin cleavable site. This exchange (residues 304 to 308 were exchanged from KRKKR (SEQ ID NO:4) to LVPRG (SEQ ID NO:5)) was introduced since native Met expressed in insect cells was partially cleaved and not homogeneous. Mutation of the cleavage site allowed for the production of homogeneous protein that depending on treatment with thrombin was cleaved or uncleaved. The complex presented here was obtained with the unprocessed, single chain Met.","The HGF \u03b2-chain protein used for crystallization begins with residue Val495 (the N-terminal residue obtained after maturation of single chain HGF), and has one alteration from the natural sequence: in full length, mature HGF, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains are covalently tethered by a disulfide bridge putatively formed between Cys487 and Cys604 (Donate et al., 1994). In order to prevent artificial dimerization of HGF \u03b2-chains during purification and crystallization, Cys604 was replaced with serine. (SEQ ID NO:1) The complex of the HGF \u03b2-chain and the Met fragment was formed in solution, purified using size exclusion chromatography and set up for crystallization trials.","Materials and Methods","The cDNA for the full length Met receptor was kindly provided by D. Wickramasinghe. PCR was carried out on the region encoding residues 25-567 of the Met receptor. A 2-step overlapping PCR scheme was used to introduce the thrombin cleavage site (LVPRG) (SEQ ID NO:5) and remove the native sequence (KRKKR) (SEQ ID NO:4). An N-terminal primer added overlapping sequence with the C-terminus of the insect cell secretion signal present in the pAcGP67A vector (BD Biosciences). A C-terminal primer contained coding sequence for (His)and a NotI restriction site added directly onto the C-terminus. For placement into the pAcGP67A vector, an additional PCR was carried out on the coding region for the insect cell secretion signal, with additional overlapping sequence from the N-terminus of our Met construct. A final PCR was done to directly fuse the C-terminus of the secretion signal to the N-terminus of our Met construct. This PCR product, as well as pAcGP67A, were digested with SpeI and NotI. Insert was combined with vector at a 3:1 ratio, ligated, and transformed into XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene).","Purified plasmid DNA (pAcGP67A plus Met Sema and PSI domain) was transfected into Sf9 insect cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Viral stock was amplified 3 times before use in protein expression. For expression, 1 L of Hi5 insect cells growing in ESF 921 media (Protein Expression, LLC) at a density of 5\u00d710cells\/mL were infected with 10 mL of viral stock from the 3amplification and incubated at 27\u00b0 C. for 72 hours. Cells were then removed from the supernatant by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 minutes. 1 mM of NiCl, 5 mM of CaCl, and 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 were added to the supernatant. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm vacuum filter. Supernatant was applied to a 2 mL Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) by gravity flow, followed by 20 mL of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). Protein was eluted with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole. Fractions containing Met were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and pooled, concentrated to 500 \u03bcL, and loaded onto a Superdex S-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris 8.0, 500 mM NaCl. The final yield for Met (Sema and PSI domain) was approximately 0.25 mg\/L of insect cell supernatant.","The amino acid sequence of an extracellular fragment of Met is shown in Table 6. (SEQ ID NO:3). Another embodiment of an extracellular fragment of Met comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10 and is shown in .","HGF \u03b2 proteins were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus secretion vector pAcGP67 (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.). All constructs contained a Histag at the carboxy terminus and were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by Ni NTA metal chelate and gel filtration chromatography. For wildtype HGF \u03b2, a cDNA fragment encoding the HGF \u03b2-chain from residues Val495 [c16] to Ser728 [c250] was cloned by PCR such that Val495 [c16] was inserted immediately after the secretion signal sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using QuikChange\u2122 (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) with oligonucleotide 5\u2032CCTAATTATGGATCCACAATTCCTG3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:6) to make HGF \u03b2 containing a Cys604 to Ser mutation (HGF \u03b2). The cysteine was not altered in this construct to allow putative disulfide formation between Cys487 and Cys604. Wildtype HGF \u03b2 (SEQ ID NO:14) refers to the native sequence and HGF \u03b2(SEQ ID NO:1) refers to the C604S mutant. Numbering is as follows: full length HGF sequence starting with MWV . . . as numbers 1-3 [chymotrypsinogen numbering is shown in the brackets]. It will be readily apparent that the numbering of amino acids in other isoforms of HGF \u03b2 may be different than that of the HGF \u03b2 numbering disclosed herein. The disclosure provides sequential numbering based on sequence only. In embodiments, an isoform may have structural \u201cdifferences\u201d, for example, if it carries insertion(s) or deletion(s) relative to the HGF \u03b2 reference sequence. The chymotrypsinogen numbering convention may be useful for comparison to workers in the field.","The amino acid sequence of a HGF \u03b2 is shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NO:1) and Table 8 (SEQ ID NO:14).","Baculovirus vectors containing the desired inserts were transfected into (Sf 9) cells on plates in TNM-FH media via the Baculogold\u2122 Expression System according to manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.). After 2-4 rounds of virus amplification, 10 mL of viral stock was used to infect 1 L of High Five\u2122 cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) in suspension at 5\u00d710cells\/mL in TNM-FH media. Cultures were incubated at 27\u00b0 C. for 72 h before harvesting the culture media by centrifugation at 8,000\u00d7g for 15 min. Cell culture media was applied to a 4 mL Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). After washing with 4 column volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, HGF \u03b2 proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. The eluate was pooled and applied to a Superdex\u2122-200 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl. Protein peaks were collected and concentrated using a Centriprep\u2122 YM-10 (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). Fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue.","Met was combined with HGF \u03b2-chain in a 1:1.5 ratio and concentrated for loading onto a Superdex S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris 8.0, 250 mM NaCl. Elution fractions were assayed with SDS-PAGE, and those containing the complex were pooled. Buffer exchange into 10 mM Tris 8.0, 125 mM NaCl was carried out, and the complex was then concentrated to 10 mg\/mL for crystallization trials. Although crystals grew without deglycosylation, diffraction was enhanced after deglycosylating the Met protein. For this, Met, previously purified using Nickel chromatography as described above, was mixed with a combination of PNGase F (Roche) and Endoglycosidase A (Roche) at 1:100 enzyme:Met concentration and incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Met was then combined with HGF \u03b2-chain, concentrated, and loaded onto a gel filtration column as described above for the non-deglycosylated material.","Crystallization, Data Collection and Refinement","Met\/HGF \u03b2-chain crystallized at 19\u00b0 C. in 4 \u03bcL hanging drops in a 1:1 ratio of protein to mother liquor, suspended over mother liquor (12-15% PEG 10,000, Tris pH 8.0). Crystals grew to approximately 100 \u03bcm\u00d7200 \u03bcm\u00d7200 \u03bcm in 3 to 7 days. For data collection, crystals were placed in a solution of mother liquor containing 25% xylitol for 30 seconds, and then flash frozen in liquid N.","Data were collected at CHESS beamline A1 to 3.2 \u212b resolution and processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski et al., 1997). The crystals belonged to space group P222 with cell parameters of a=137.1 \u212b, b=186.4 \u212b, and c=66.7 \u212b and contained 1 complex of Met:HGF \u03b2-chain in the asymmetric unit and thus have a solvent content of about 75%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (Navaza 1994), with the crystal structure of HGF \u03b2-chain alone (structural coordinates available at RCS Protein Databank, Accession No: PDB1UX3) as a search model. Using data from 8 \u212b to 4 \u212b yielded a clear solution in the rotation and translation functions and the best solution was subjected to rigid body refinement in program Refmac (CCP4, 1994). Solvent flattening, which due to the high crystal solvent content led to dramatic improvements in the quality of the phases, yielded maps that were of sufficient quality to recognize the \u03b2-propeller of the Sema domain and allowed for building the Met receptor without the use of any additional models. Subsequent rounds of model building with program 0 (Jones et al., 1991) and further refinement with program Refmac resulted in the final model with an Rfree and Rcryst of 27.0% and 20.9%, respectively, for all data between 30 \u212b and 3.2 \u212b.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0221","num":"0220"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Data Collection and Refinement Statistics for a 1:1 complex of the HGF"},{"entry":"\u03b2-chain with the Sema domain of the Met Receptor."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Data Collection",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Resolution (\u212b)","50-3.2","(3.3-3.2)"]},{"entry":[{},"R","0.058","(0.586)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Number of observations","98,834"]},{"entry":[{},"Unique reflections","28,312"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Completeness (%)","99.4","(100.0)"]},{"entry":[{},"Refinement"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Resolution (\u212b)","30-3.2"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of reflections","26830"]},{"entry":[{},"Final R, R(F > 0)","0.209, 0.270"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of residues","727"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of solvent","0"]},{"entry":[{},"molecules"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of non-H","5728"]},{"entry":[{},"atoms"]},{"entry":[{},"Rmsd bonds (\u212b)","0.013"]},{"entry":[{},"Rmsd angles (\u00b0)","1.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Space Group","P222"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"a"}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"b","sub":"sym "}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"c","sub":["o ","c","o","free "]}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The crystal structure of HGF\u03b2: Met was analyzed to identify amino acid positions involved in binding and\/or activation of the Met receptor by HGF \u03b2.","Structure of HGF \u03b2","The \u03b2-chain of HGF shares close to 40% sequence identity with the protease domain of plasmin, a trypsin-like serine protease. Structurally, these enzymes can be described as globular proteins composed of two antiparallel \u03b2-barrel domains (). Both of the \u03b2-barrels share the same general topology and are formed by six antiparallel \u03b2-strands, with the N-terminal four strands folding into a Greek key motif, followed by two strands that form a hairpin. HGF, like serine proteases, is expressed as a zymogen-like precursor. For serine proteases, structural studies have shown that insertion of the N-terminus resulting from the maturation process leads to allosteric rearrangments within the binding site for the protease substrate (Perona and Craig, 1995; Hedstrom 2002). In serine proteases, the newly formed N-terminus forms a salt bridge with a nearby aspartate, which leads to the formation of the oxyanion hole via the backbone NH's of two neighboring residues and the creation of a part of the S1 pocket (). The \u2018activated\u2019 form of the HGF \u03b2-chain, as seen in the structure presented here, is very similar to the mature form of serine proteases: superposition with plasmin (pdb-code 1BML) yields an rmsd of about 1.3 \u212b for 212 C pairs. Superposition between HGF \u03b2-chain and plasminogen (pdb-code 1QRZ) reveal differences in their \u2018activation domain\u2019 (Freer et al., 1970) and only 198 C pairs can be aligned well.","As with serine proteases, the N-terminal amine of Val495 is inserted into the core of the C-terminal \u03b2-barrel and forms a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of Asp672, which corresponds to Asp194 in plasmin, presumably leading to similar rearrangements, which have been characterized in serine proteases. The region in HGF corresponding to this so-called \u2018activation domain\u2019, i.e., the loops that undergo conformational changes in serine proteases (Freer et al., 1970; Huber and Bode, 1978), forms part of the binding surface with Met, discussed below. Therefore, proper display of the residues that interact with Met requires maturation of HGF.","After maturation, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains of HGF remain connected via a disulfide bond. Based on alignments of the kringle domains K1 to K4 of HGF and macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), the two cysteine residues responsible for the formation of this disulfide bond were identified as Cys487 on the \u03b1-chain of HGF and Cys604 on the \u03b2-chain (Donate et al., 1994). The crystal structure, however, raises the possibility of an alternative cysteine residue as the anchor for the HGF \u03b2-chain. The HGF \u03b2-chain has two (2) cysteine residues that do not have partners for the formation of disulfide bridges within the \u03b2-chain. Neither is conserved in plasmin or MSP and both are located on the periphery of the protein and are at least partially solvent exposed; either could be potential partners for the formation of a disulfide bond with the \u03b1-chain while the other remains unpaired. The superposition of the plasmin structure that contains part of the \u03b1-chain (), and the HGF \u03b2-chain structure presented here, shows that the distance between the C-terminus of the plasmin \u03b1-chain and Cys604 of the HGF \u03b2-chain is 27 \u212b and thus only slightly shorter than the respective distance between the plasmin \u03b1-chain C-terminus and Cys561 (33 \u212b) (). In addition, the sequence alignment between plasmin, MSP, and HGF () shows that the \u03b1-chain cysteine forming the disulfide bond in plasmin and MSP is 13 and 15 residues away from the cleavage site in those proteins respectively, but there are only 7 residues in HGF to span the distance from Cys487 to the cleavage site. Therefore, due to distance requirements, the C-terminus of the HGF \u03b1-chain cannot follow the same path on the surface of the \u03b2-chain as it does in plasmin or MSP. Continuing work seeks to clarify which of the two free cysteine residues in HGF \u03b2 forms the disulfide bond with the \u03b1-chain of HGF.","Met Structure","The Sema domain of Met forms 7-bladed \u03b2-propeller with a diameter of a little more than 50 \u212b. The overall shape of the domain resembles a funnel with an inner diameter of about 25 \u212b between main chain atoms at the wide portion and 10 \u212b in the narrowest part (). Generally, in \u03b2-propellers, each of the blades is formed by 4 antiparallel \u03b2-strands with strand A in the center of the propeller followed by strands B and C, and with strand D forming the outermost strand of the blade. The blades are arranged in a circular fashion, with the N-terminal strand forming strand D of the last blade, thus closing the propeller and stabilizing the overall structure (). The AB and CD loops of each blade of the Met Sema domain form the relatively flat \u2018bottom\u2019 face, and the generally longer BC and DA loops form the \u2018top\u2019 face of the propeller (). In Met, the position of the 6th and the 7th blade are off-center, with blade 7 being closer to the center of the barrel and blade 6 more distant. This gives the domain an overall oval shape.","The \u03b2-propeller of the Met Sema domain is structurally most closely related to the recently reported crystal structures of Sema4D (Love et al., 2003) and Sema3A (Antipenkov et al., 2003). With the exception of the D-strands in blades 3 and 5, the core of Sema4D and the Met Sema domain align well () and the superposition of residues 40 to 519 with the Sema domain of Sema4D results in an mmsd of 1.6 \u212b for 303 atom pairs (). The residues that form strand D5 in Sema4A are hydrogen bonding to strand D4 in Met, thus the 4th blade of Met contains an extra strand while blade 5 is missing its strand D. While the core of both proteins align well, the loops contain a number of insertions or deletions and generally adopt very different conformations. For example, the Sema domains of Met and of Sema4D both have an insert of about 20 residues following strand D1. In Met, these residues form a short antiparallel two-stranded \u03b2-sheet, while Sema4D has an \u03b1-helix (). Of the 24 loops that connect the various strands, only 3 have no insertions or deletions when comparing Met with Sema4D or Sema3A (). Interestingly, both the Semaphorins and the Met receptor have their largest insertion between strands C5 and A6; however, these inserts are not related in structure or sequence to each other. In Sema3A, this insert is involved in dimer formation and has been shown to be important for neuropilin binding (Antipenko et al., 2003). In the Met Sema domain, some of the residues within the insert are disordered and not included in our model (see ). The function of the insert in Met is not known but its proximity to the HGF \u03b2-chain binding site, discussed below, suggests that it might be involved in binding to the \u03b1-chain of HGF.","The loop containing the cleavage site between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain of Met connects strand D4 to A5; it is disordered in the electron density. After processing of native Met, the \u03b1-chain, which forms the N-terminal 4 blades of the Sema domain, and the \u03b2-chain remain connected via at least 2 disulfide bonds. One disulfide bond is formed between residues Cys298 on strand D4 and Cys363 on C5, and the second is formed between Cys282 (D3) and Cys409. This last cysteine is positioned in a disordered region of the insert after blade 4. The electron density does not allow tracing of the main chain in this area but there is sufficient density in the area of the S\u03b3 position to suggest that the disulfide bond is at least partially formed. With the exception of the N-terminal Cys26, which is disordered in the presently disclosed crystal structure and has no potential partner in the construct that was used for crystallization, all cysteine residues are engaged in disulfide bonds. It is unclear if Cys26 remains unpaired in the context of full length Met receptor or if it forms a disulfide bond with another cysteine that resides in the IPT domains. Besides the two disulfide bonds that covalently connect the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain of the Sema domain, the domain is stabilized by 5 additional disulfide bridges formed between Cys95-Cys101, Cys98-Cys159, Cys133-Cys141, Cys172-Cys175, and Cys385-Cys397 ().","The surface of the Met Sema domain appears to be mostly negatively charged, especially in the center of the bottom face of the Sema domain (). This surface, which is formed by a 20 residue insertion after strand D in the first blade and includes the rather irregular area of strand D in the third blade, shows clusters of acidic residues. Monomeric, full length Met was shown to bind to heparin (Gherardi et al., 2003). In presently disclosed structure there are no dominant positively charged patches within the Met Sema domain; however, two arginines are located in the vicinity of the disordered furin-cleavage site. Together with the 6 positively charged residues that reside in this loop, these arginines could constitute a potential heparin binding site.","The last strand of the Sema domain (C7) is followed immediately by the PSI domain. This domain, with dimensions of about 20\u00d715 \u212b, contains four (4) disulfide bridges and is not an integral part of the Sema domain but rather an independent structural module. The small core of the domain is formed by a helix and a short two-stranded antiparallel i-sheet that are connected via a disulfide bond and sandwich the side-chain of Trp540. Superposition of this domain with the PSI domain of Sema4D results in an rmsd of 1.6 \u212b for 41 C pairs. The relative orientation between the Sema and the PSI domains in the Met and the Sema4D structures, however, is different and requires a rotation of about 40\u00b0 for superposition.","The Interface Between the HGF \u03b2-Chain and Met","The HGF \u03b2-chain binds to the Sema domain of Met at the bottom face of the propeller, and forms contacts with residues that protrude from blades 2 and 3 (). This is unlike other \u03b2-propeller containing receptors, such as the integrins, which bind their ligands utilizing the top face of the propeller (Xiong et al., 2002). Other Sema domain containing proteins, such as Sema3A and Sema4D, are also postulated to bind ligands using the top face (Antipenko et al., 2003; Love et al., 2003).","The interface between HGF \u03b2-chain and Met buries a total of 1770 \u212bof solvent accessible surface and is dominated by polar or charge-charge interactions. Of the 20 HGF residues that have more that 10 \u212bburied in the interface, 6 are positively charged, 3 carry negative charges, and 3 are aromatic. Even more dramatic, of the 18 residues contributing more than 10 \u212bof buried surface to the interface on the Met side, 6 carry negative charges, 4 are positively charged and 3 are aromatic. The combined buried surface of the hydrophobic residues Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met and Phe amounts to a mere 145 \u212b, while the charged residues Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, and His are responsible for more than 1,000 \u212bof buried surface. The resolution of the presently disclosed structure does not permit a detailed discussion of hydrogen bonds; however, the position of the side chains suggest the presence of at least 7 charged interactions between Met and the HGF \u03b2-chain. (See Table 3)","On HGF, the residues analogous to those responsible for substrate binding and catalysis in the related serine proteases form most of the interactions with Met. Serine proteases bind linear peptides to their recognition site and form hydrogen bonds to main chain atoms to position a specific peptide bond for proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, the HGF \u03b2-chain binds to a series of protruding polar side chains from Met that originate mainly from 3 separate loops (). The first of these loops includes residues 124-128 and connects strands A2 and B2 of Met. This loop contains two tyrosines that are in the core of the binding interface and pack against Arg695 of HGF. The second loop of Met that contacts HGF \u03b2-chain contains residues Asp190, Arg191, and Phe192 and connects A3 and B3. Asp190 of Met forms charged interactions with Arg533 of HGF. The side chain of Arg191 of Met packs against Val692 and Pro693 of HGF with its hydrophobic portion and in the presently disclosed model is in hydrogen bonding distance to the side chains of Glu656 and Asp578 with its guanidinium group. This Asp578 corresponds to aspartic acid [c102] in the catalytic triad of the related serine proteases. Furthermore, the backbone of this loop forms hydrophilic interactions with Gln534, the residue homologous to the histidine [c57] of the protease catalytic triad.","The third segment contributing to the interface also includes strand D in the third blade of the propeller, an area that deviates from the classical \u2018propeller fold\u2019. Strand D is interrupted and has a short helical insert within its strand. This unusual conformation presents a number of residues towards the surface of the HGF \u03b2-chain. The most prominent interaction formed by this loop involves Glu221 which extends its side chain towards what would be the S1 binding site in serine proteases (). The carboxylate of Glu221 forms an extensive network of polar interactions with the side chain of Tyr673 (corresponding to the serine [c195] of the catalytic triad in proteases), as well as the backbone amides of Gly694 and Gly696 (); however, unlike in serine proteases, where the S1 pocket is filled by the specificity determining P1 residue, it does not penetrate deeply into the S1 pocket. As a result of the exchange of Ser to Tyr in position 673 [c195], the entrance of the S1 pocket is much smaller than in the related proteases. Thus, Glu221 projects towards the entrance of the S1 pocket from a different angle when compared to a complex between trypsin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and does not fill the pocket (). Therefore, a large cavity, presumably filled with a number of water molecules, remains in HGF \u03b2-chain.","Comparison of HGF \u03b2-Chain Unbound and Bound to Met","The structures of the HGF \u03b2-chain bound to Met and in its unbound state, as disclosed in application U.S. Ser. No. 60\/569,301 filed May 6, 2004, which application is hereby incorporated by reference, are very similar and superimpose with an rmsd of less than 0.8 \u212b for 218 C-pairs. The only significant differences between the two structures involve residues that are close to the Met binding interface. The backbone of residues 645 to 651 is disordered in unliganded HGF \u03b2 but well defined in the structure of the complex, where it adopts a conformation that is commonly observed in serine proteases (). The side chains of the basic residues Arg647 and Lys649 are not well defined in the electron density but project towards the Met binding interface and, in presently disclosed model, participate in the formation of the complex. Arg695 also undergoes a change in conformation upon Met binding. This residue, located in the center of the receptor binding interface, packs against Tyr125 of Met, and its backbone forms part of the S1 pocket. In the structure of unliganded HGF \u03b2, the conformation of the backbone in this area is different, and the side chain of Arg695 projects toward the disordered region of the structure. It is conceivable that the binding event alters the position of Arg695, which in turn allows residues 645 to 651 to adopt a more stable conformation.","Models for Receptor Activation","In embodiments, a model for HGF mediated Met receptor activation is provided. Little is known about the signaling complex itself, and details of this interaction, such as the stoichiometry between ligand and receptor, have been elusive.","The presently disclosed structure shows unambiguously how Met binds to the \u03b2-chain of HGF. However, the exact role this interaction might play in Met activation remains uncertain. Two general models of how HGF can lead to Met dimerization have been suggested (Miller and Leonard, 1998). One of these models, follows the growth hormone paradigm (de Vos et al, 1994) where one HGF molecule binds to two different Met receptors with different affinities to form the 2:1 signaling complex. The other model suggests that two 1:1 complexes of Met and HGF are dimerized either via heparin or an alternative mechanism to form stable 2:2 complexes.","In the present disclosure, complexes of HGF \u03b2-chain and the Sema domain of Met were purified from the individual components via size exclusion chromatography. This clearly showed that HGF \u03b2 and the N-terminal 564 residues of Met form a stable 1:1 complex. If Met activation via HGF indeed entails a 2:1 complex, the present disclosure characterizes the low affinity binding interaction between HGF and Met. The high affinity binding interaction involves the \u03b1-chain of HGF, in particular the NK1 domains (Lokker et al., 1992), and a previously uncharacterized binding site on Met. This model is in good agreement with the notion that single chain HGF is able to bind Met via its high affinity binding site which is contained in its N-terminal portion, yet unable to signal. For signaling, maturation of HGF is required. This leads to rearrangements in the activation domain of HGF \u03b2, the formation of the low affinity binding site and possibly allows for a reorientation of the \u03b2-chain of HGF relative to its \u03b1-chain. This model could also be valid for the closely related Ron\/MSP system. Like HGF, single chain MSP can bind to its receptor Ron, but is only able to signal in its matured 2-chain form. Interestingly and in contrast to HGF, the high affinity binding site in MSP is contained within its \u03b2-chain while the low affinity binding site is harbored by its \u03b1-chain (Danilkovitch et al., 1999).","Recent studies employing analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering experiments indicate that mature HGF and the Met ectodomain form 1:1 complexes that can be stabilized with heparin to form a 1:1 complex (Gherardi et al., 2003). However, in those experiments no higher order complexes or aggregates could be detected.","The present disclosure shows that the low affinity interaction between HGF \u03b2 and Met is sufficient for 1:1 complex formation. The absence of 2:1 complexes in Gherardi et al, (2003), suggest two possible scenarios. Firstly, it is possible that the high and low affinity binding sites on the receptor overlap. In this case, at a 1:1 molar ratio of ligand and receptor, all high affinity binding sites on the receptor are occupied and none of the low affinity binding sites available thus preventing the formation of 2:1 complexes. An alternative explanation for the absence of 2:1 complexes is that \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain of a single HGF molecule bind to the same Met receptor and form stable 1:1 complexes. These 1:1 complexes only associate very weakly and require the juxtamembrane or intracellular portion of the receptors or need additional molecules or co-receptors for the assembly of 2:2 or higher order signaling complexes.","Recent crystal structures of dimeric Sema4D and Sema3A have demonstrated how these Sema domains dimerize. Antipenko A, Himanen J P, van Leyen K, Nardi-Dei V, Lesniak J, Barton W A, Rajashankar Kr, Lu M, Hoemme C, Puschel A W, Nikolov D B (2003) Structure of the Semaphorin-3A receptor binding module. 39:589-598 and Love C A, Harlos K, Mavaddat N, Davis S J, Stuart D I, Jones E Y, Esnouf R M (2003). The ligand-binding face of the Semaphorins revealed by the high-resolution crystal structure of Sema4D. 10:843-848.","In Sema4D, dimerization of the Sema domains is mediated by four loops that protrude from the core of the propeller. Three of these loops connect strands B4-C4, D4-A5, and B5-C5, and the fourth is part of the insert that follows the 5th blade of the propeller (). In the present crystal structure the interface observed in the Semaphorin structures is not present. The superposition of the complex described here and the dimer of Sema4D shows that none of the regions relevant for dimerization in Sema4D are conserved in the Met structure (). Thus, it is unlikely that the Met dimerization follows the Semaphorin paradigm. However, since the loop connecting D4-A5 contains the furin cleavage site that was altered in the present construct, the possibility that the dimer seen in Sema4D is similar in the Met receptor system cannot be excluded. A number of characteristics of Met speak against this model. As discussed above, cleavage of Met at the furin cleavage site is not required for signaling. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this loop is involved in crucial interactions in the signaling complex. Furthermore, if Met were to dimerize similarly to the Semaphorins, the \u03b2-chains of HGF would be more than 70 \u212b apart from each other and lie on opposite sides of the Sema domain. Thus, they could not participate in the stabilization of a 2:2 complex, yet it is known that maturation of HGF and the presence of the HGF \u03b2-chain are required for the formation of a signaling complex.","A different model for a 2:2 signaling complex is suggested by the crystal packing of the 1:1 complexes in the disclosed crystal structure where two HGF \u03b2-chains form a symmetric interface with about 1250 \u212bof total buried surface (). This interface is formed via interactions from 3 loops: the strand immediately following the N-terminus, residues 619-630, and residues 662-665. These 3 loops are part of the so-called \u2018activation domain\u2019 in the related serine proteases and rearrange upon zymogen maturation (Huber and Bode, 1978). As the surface engaged in this interface can only be present if full length HGF is properly cleaved and in its matured form, this dimer can only form after maturation which explains the requirement of HGF maturation for proper signaling. In this model, the C-termini of the Met receptor Sema domains are separated by about 110 \u212b, a gap that could be easily spanned by the PSI and the 4 IPT domains of the two receptors that connect the Sema domains to the transmembrane helix. Interestingly, while HGF \u03b2-chain\/\u03b2-chain interactions are clearly weak, no oligomers were detected during size exclusion chromatography of the complex and the HGF \u03b2-chain is monomeric in solution (data not shown), the same interface is also present in crystals containing only the HGF \u03b2-chain and that were derived under different crystallization conditions, see application U.S. Ser. No. 60\/569,301 filed May 6, 2004.","Based on these observations we propose a model in which the \u03b1-chain of HGF provides the initial binding event for HGF to Met (). The large, negatively charged patches in the center of the \u2018bottom\u2019 of the Sema domain propeller may represent a potential binding site for the HGF \u03b2-chain, allowing for interaction with the positively charged surface region of the NK1 domain (Lokker et al., 1992, Ultsch et al., 1998). Before cleavage of single-chain HGF, the protease-like domain of HGF would be unavailable for binding to Met. Once cleavage occurs, the N-terminus of the newly formed \u03b2-chain inserts into the protein and leads to rearrangements in the \u2018activation domain\u2019 creating the Met binding site on HGF \u03b2-chain. Now the HGF \u03b2-chain can bind to Met, which positions the \u03b2-chain dimerization surface for contact with a neighboring HGF\/Met complex. The presence of heparin sulfate proteoglycans may serve to strengthen these interactions.","The 2:2 model is supported by the stoichiometry studies mentioned above which show no dimerization of complexes in solution (Gherardi et al., 2003), indicating that the 2:2 complex formation must be very weak. Also, the fact that the \u03b1-chain alone (NK4) is not able to mediate dimerization, but instead acts as an antagonist in vivo (Date et al., 1997), further highlights the potential role for the HGF \u03b2-chain in dimerization. The disclosed structure of Met lacks the IPT domains, and their role in the signaling of the Met\/HGF complex is still unclear. A crystal structure of the full length Met in complex with full length, activated HGF could further resolve these issues.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0246","num":"0245"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
