{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides, to processes for their preparation, to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","Over the last years, a number of substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly. i.e. without prior release of NO, have been described, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587], and also various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","EP 0 266 890-A1, WO 89\/03833-A1, JP 01258674-A [cf. Chem. Abstr. 112:178986], WO 96\/34866-A1, EP 1 277 754-A1, WO 2006\/015737-A1, WO 2008\/008539-A2, WO 2008\/082490-A2, WO 2008\/134553-A1, WO 2010\/030538-A2 and WO 2011\/113606-A1, inter alia, describe various imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives which can be used for treating disorders.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and, as such, are suitable for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula

Salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical uses but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the compounds according to the invention are also included.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention include acid addition salts of conventional mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids, e.g. salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention also include salts of conventional bases, such as, by way of example and preferably, alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, such as, by way of example and preferably, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanol-amine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","Solvates in the context of the invention are designated as those forms of the compounds according to the invention which form a complex in the solid or liquid state by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of solvates, in which the coordination takes place with water. Hydrates are preferred solvates in the context of the present invention.","The compounds according to the invention can exist in different stereoisomeric forms depending on their structure, i.e. in the form of configuration isomers or optionally also as conformation isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore includes the enantiomers and diastereomers and their particular mixtures. The stereoisomerically uniform constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the compounds according to the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention includes all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by generally used processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the methods described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","The present invention moreover also includes prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here designates compounds which themselves can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents have the following meaning, unless specified otherwise:","Alkyl in the context of the invention represents a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having the number or carbon atoms stated in each case.

Measurement of Blood Pressure on Anaesthetized Rats","Male Wistar rats having a body weight of 300-350 g are anaesthetized with thiopental (100 mg\/kg i.p.). After tracheotomy, a catheter for measuring the blood pressure is introduced into the femoral artery. The substances to be tested are administered as solutions either orally by gavage or intravenously via the femoral vein (Stasch et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 344-355).","B-5. Radiotelemetric Blood Pressure Measurement on Awake, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats","The blood pressure measurement on awake rats described below uses a commercially available telemetry system from the company DATA SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL DSI, USA.","The system consists of 3 main components:\n\n","The telemetry system provides continuous acquisition of blood pressure, heart rate and body movement on awake animals in their usual living space.","Animal Material","The investigations are carried out on adult female, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR Okamoto) with a body weight of >200 g. SHR\/NCrl from Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine, 1963 were crossed from male Wistar Kyoto rats with greatly increased blood pressure and females with slightly raised blood pressure and were delivered in F13 to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.","After transmitter implantation, the experimental animals are kept individually in Makrolon cages, type 3. They have free access to standard feed and water.","The day-night rhythm in the testing laboratory is alternated by the room lighting at 06:00 hours in the morning and at 19:00 hours in the evening.","Transmitter Implantation","The TA11PA-C40 telemetry transmitters used are implanted surgically in the experimental animals under aseptic conditions at least 14 days before the first test. The animals provided with this instrumentation can be used again after the wound has healed and the implant has become incorporated.","For implantation, the fasting animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Sanofi: 50 mg\/kg i.p.) and are shaved and disinfected on a wide area of the abdomen. After opening the abdominal cavity along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted above the bifurcation in the cranial direction into the aorta descendens and secured with tissue adhesive (VetBonD\u2122, 3M). The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally on the abdominal wall musculature and the wound is closed layer by layer.","Postoperatively, an antibiotic is administered to prevent infection (Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml\/kg s.c.)","Substances and Solutions","Unless described otherwise, the test substances are in each case administered orally by stomach tube to a group of animals (n=6). Corresponding to an application volume of 5 ml\/kg body weight, the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5% Tylose.","A group of animals treated with solvents is used as control.","Test Procedure","The present telemetry measuring device is configured for 24 animals. Each test is recorded under a test number (Vtest year month day).","The instrumented rats living in the unit are each assigned their own receiving antenna (1010 Receiver, DSI).","The implanted transmitters can be activated from outside by an in-built magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission at the start of the tests. The signals emitted can be recorded online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for WINDOWS, DSI) and processed appropriately. The data are saved in each case to a folder opened for this, which bears the test number.","In the standard procedure, the following are measured, in each case for 10 seconds:\n\n","Recording of the measured values is repeated at 5-minute intervals under computer control. The source data recorded as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure (Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor; APR-1) and saved in individual data. Further technical details can be found in the extensive documentation of the manufacturer (DSI).","Unless described otherwise, the test substances are administered on the test day at 09.00 hours. Following application, the parameters described above are measured for 24 hours.","Evaluation","After the end of the test, the individual data recorded are sorted with the analysis software (DATAQUEST\u2122 A.R.T.\u2122 ANALYSIS). The 2 hours before application are taken as the blank value here, so that the selected data set comprises the period from 07:00 hours on the test day to 09:00 hours on the next day.","The data are smoothed for a pre-settable time by mean value determination (15-minute average) and transferred as text file to a storage medium. The pre-sorted and compressed measured values are transferred to Excel templates and presented as tables. The data recorded are saved per test day in a specific folder, which bears the test number. Results and test protocols are filed in folders, sorted in paper form by numbers.","Literature","Klaus Witte, Kai Hu, Johanna Swiatek, Claudia M\u00fcssig, Georg Ertl and Bj\u00f6rn Lemmer: Experimental heart failure in rats: effects on cardiovascular circadian rhythms and on myocardial 3-adrenergic signaling.

Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous and Oral Administration","The pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds according to the invention are determined in male CD-1 mice, male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is carried out by means of a species-specific plasma\/DMSO formulation, and in the case of dogs by means of a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. In all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage, based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation.","The taking of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right prior to substance administration. The operation is carried out at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran analgesia and administration of an analgesic (atropin\/Rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 ml s.c.). The blood is taken (generally more than 10 time points) within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. When the blood is taken, it is passed into heparinised tubes. Then the blood plasma is obtained by centrifugation and is optionally stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (which may also be a chemically unrelated substance) is added to the samples of the compounds according to the invention, calibration samples and qualifiers, and there follows protein precipitation by means of excess acetonitrile. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions, and subsequent vortexing, is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by LC-MS\/MS using C18 reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures.","The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(terminal half life), F (Bioavailability), MRT (Mean Residence Time) and CL (Clearance), using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation programme.","Since the substance quantification is carried out in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinised whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (by means of LC-MS\/MS; see above) and determined by calculating the ratio of the C\/Cvalue.","Table B shows data of representative compounds of the present invention following intravenous and peroral administration in rats:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1282","num":"2103"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00025","num":"00025"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE B"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"AUC","CL","t\u00bd","MRT"]},{"entry":["Example","[kg \u00b7 h\/L]","[L\/h\/kg]","[h]","[h]"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["181","2.5","0.56","3.4","3.3"]},{"entry":["187","2.0","0.71","4.6","4.0"]},{"entry":["188","2.3","0.53","1.7","2.5"]},{"entry":["194","2.9","0.44","6.2","8.4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"To determine the metabolic profile of the compounds according to the invention, they are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, liver microsomes or primary fresh heptocytes from various animal species (e.g. rats, dogs), and also of human origin, in order to obtain and to compare information about substantially the complete hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism, and about the enzymes involved in the metabolism.","The compounds according to the invention were incubated at a concentration of about 0.1-10 \u03bcM. To this end, stock solutions of the compounds according to the invention having a concentration of 0.01-1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared, and then pipetted with 1:100 dilution into the incubation mixture. The liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate and 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary heptocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium, likewise at 37\u00b0 C. After an incubation time of 0-4 h, the incubation mixtures were stopped with acetonitrile (final concentration about 30%), and the protein was centrifuged off at about 15 000\u00d7g. The samples thus stopped were either analysed directly or stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis.","The analysis is carried out by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS\/MS). To this end, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18 reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution of 0.05% formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification, structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolites, and for quantitative metabolic assessment of the compound according to the invention in the incubation mixtures.","B-8. Caco-2 Permeability Test","The permeability of a test substance was determined with the aid of the Caco-2 cell line, an established in vitro model for permeability predictions at the gastrointestinal barrier (Artursson, P. and Karlsson, J. (1991) Correlation between oral drug absorption in humans and apparent drug permeability coefficients in human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. Biochem. Biophys. 175 (3), 880-885). The CaCcells (ACC No. 169, DSMZ, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were sown in 24-well plates with insert and cultivated for 14 to 16 days. For the permeability studies, the test substance was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with transport buffer (Hanks Buffered Salt Solution, Gibco\/Invitrogen, with 19.9 mM glucose and 9.8 mM HEPES) to the final test concentration. To determine the permeability from apical to basal lateral (PA-B) of the test substance, the solution comprising the test substance was placed on the apical side of the Caco-2 cell monolayer, and the transport buffer on the basal lateral side. To determine the permeability from basal lateral to apical (PB-A) of the test substance, the solution comprising the test substance was placed on the basal lateral side of the Caco-2 cell monolayer, and the transport buffer on the apical side. At the start of the experiment, samples were taken from the respective donor compartment to ensure mass balance. After a two-hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C., samples were taken from the two compartments. The samples were analysed by LC-MS\/MS, and the apparent permeability coefficients (P) were calculated. For each cell monolayer, the permeability of Lucifer Yellow was determined to ensure cell layer integrity. In each test run, the permeability of atenolol (marker for low permeability) and sulfasalazine (marker for active excretion) was also determined as qualitative control.","C.
