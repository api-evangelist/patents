title: Graphic user interface schemes for supporting speech recognition input systems
abstract: A numbering scheme is disclosed for implementation in the context of an application display. A user is able to select an item on the display by speaking a number corresponding to a desired control item. In some cases, the screen can include so many numbers that the user loses context and is unable to identify which number they want to select. For this reason, in one embodiment, a temporal switching mechanism is implemented wherein periodic switches (e.g., second-long intervals) occur between showing numbered items and showing a non-numbered screen. In one embodiment, an optional secondary confirmation step is implemented wherein the user sees only the item they just selected and has the chance to (a) learn the programmatic name of the item they selected and/or (b) either confirm and proceed with their selection, or cancel. In one embodiment, the optional secondary confirmation step is omitted if the user speaks a number followed by a predetermined command word.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention generally pertains to user interaction with a computing system. More specifically, the present invention pertains to interactions implemented in the context of a speech recognition system.","There is a trend toward implementation of a natural user interface (NUI) as the next generation of user interface. Much attention has been paid to the improvement of related speech recognition technology. However, additional challenges lie in addressing the usability of such an interface, particularly in the context of a visual interface associated with an application or desktop that supports user interactions implemented in the context of a speech recognition system. There remains a need for a system that enables a user to utilize speech recognition to select any visually indicated control (menu, button, hyperlink, text field, etc.) on a display screen in an efficient and controlled manner, and in a way that is not dependent on traditional physically initiated interaction.","One way to configure a speech recognition input system is to enable a user to select an item displayed on a screen by saying the name of that item. For example, \u201cFile\u201d will open the file menu or \u201cOKAY\u201d will initiate action associated with an OK button. One way to implement such functionality is to configure an application to use Accessible Interfaces to programmatically expose GUI controls to assistive technologies, such as speech recognition. For example, the file menu would be exposed by the application declaring that there is an item called \u201cFile\u201d located at coordinates 30, 10 to 70, 35. The speech recognition software then reads which GUI controls are available, and uses this information to construct a list (i.e., a grammar) of user statement expectations. For example, the list might contain \u201cFile\u201d, \u201cEdit\u201d, \u201cView\u201d (menu item buttons), as well as \u201cOpen\u201d, \u201cBold\u201d, \u201cBullets\u201d (tool bar buttons), or \u201cscroll up\u201d, \u201cscroll down\u201d (scroll bar items), and\/or other items. When a user speaks a listed item (e.g., \u201cbold\u201d), the speech recognition software calls the application via the Accessible Interfaces to \u2018click\u2019 the appropriate item (e.g., click the \u201cbold\u201d button) thereby initiating an appropriate response.","The described functionality works well in many cases as an efficient way to manipulate GUI controls by voice, but it breaks down under certain scenarios. In one such scenario, if an application omits a programmatic name for a control, the user cannot use voice to manipulate that control since they have no way to identify it (e.g., a name for a particular text box is omitted).","Another scenario that can present a challenge arises when an application has a mismatched name between what the user expects to say and the actual programmatic name of the control. Under these circumstances, the user will not typically speak the name of the control and thus not be able to manipulate it. For example, if an image in an Internet browser has a name of \u201cFlag\u201d yet the image depicts an emblem with the text \u201cHouse of Windsor\u201d, the user will naturally try and say \u201cHouse of Windsor\u201d and never know that they were meant to say \u201cFlag\u201d. In another example, if a button in a media player application is programmatically called \u201cWnEqBtn1\u201d yet the text on the label reads \u201cEqualizer settings,\u201d the user will never know to say \u201cWnEqBtn1\u201d.","Yet another scenario presenting a challenge arises when an application depicts something graphically yet the user does not know what it is called (even if it is named \u2018appropriately\u2019). In this case, the user will not know how to speak the name of the control to manipulate it. For example, a round button with an arrow therein on an operating system task bar may be called \u201cShow Hidden Icons\u201d but all the user can see is the graphical representation. In another example, an icon is presented on a toolbar presenting a graphical representation indicating a functionality of drawing a border around a table. The majority of users may not know that the icon is called \u201cOutside Border\u201d, even if they do know that it is a button they need to press to draw a border around something.","In all the scenarios discussed above, even users dependent on speech recognition can use voice-enabled keyboard emulation (\u201cComputer Press Tab Tab Tab Enter\u201d) or mouse simulation (\u201cMousegrid 1 3 4 7 Click\u201d) to select the item they want to manipulate. Such methods enable the user to solve each of the challenges associated with the described scenarios, though at a cost of (a) a significant decrease in efficiency and (b) an increased chance of error due to a limited capacity for precision.","One way to overcome the described challenges associated with speech recognition selection would be to draw a static set of numbers over everything on a display. The user could then simply select a number that corresponds to a desired item for selection. A disadvantage associated with this approach is that it is not uncommon for an application display to incorporate so many numbers that a user cannot clearly determine which number corresponds to an item they want to select. One solution for the crowded numbering problem is to incorporate multiple layers of numbering (e.g., choose word processing application, then choose toolbar area, then choose toolbar, then choose a button on the toolbar, wherein each selection incorporates identification from a limited set of numbers). The layers enable a user to step through a GUI to the item they wish to select. This described method of selection is relatively inefficient and attempts to reduce the number of layers can require solving problems having great mathematical complexity.","Embodiments of the present invention pertain to a system that enables a user to utilize speech recognition to select a displayed GUI control. The system constructs a restricted grammar based upon the control items that are available for selection at any given time. Additionally, the user may access items by referring to numbers that the system renders on the display as indicators of location. In one embodiment, the numbers are rendered automatically or in response to a user-initiated command, verbal or otherwise.","Embodiments pertain to a numbering scheme that is layered on top of an application display. A user is able to select an item display on the display by speaking a number corresponding to a desired control item. In some cases, the screen can include so many numbers that the user loses context and is unable to identify which number they want to select. For this reason, in one embodiment, a temporal switching mechanism is implemented wherein periodic switches (e.g., second-long intervals) occur between showing numbered items and showing a non-numbered screen. In one embodiment, an optional secondary confirmation step is implemented wherein the user sees only the item they just selected and has the chance to (a) learn the programmatic name of the item they selected and\/or (b) either confirm and proceed with their selection, or cancel. In one embodiment, the optional secondary confirmation step is omitted if the user speaks a number followed by a predetermined command word.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a user is able to use speech recognition to select any GUI control (menu, button, hyperlink, text field, etc) on the screen in an efficient and controlled manner. In accordance with one embodiment, when a user of the speech recognition selection system wants to select an item on the screen, he or she simply speaks the name of that item. For example, \u201cFile\u201d will open the File menu or \u201cOkay\u201d will activate an OK button. As has been described in the background section of the present description, this method of speech recognition selection is not always adequate.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a numbering scheme is layered on top of the application display to identify items to support an alternate means of speech recognition selection. , in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, is a representation of the screen shot of  with an exemplary numbering scheme implemented thereon. As is illustrated, the numbers themselves are displayed in a darker font than the underlying application information, which is displayed with a lighter appearance in order to provide contrast to emphasize the numbers. In accordance with one embodiment, the underlying application display appears hazy or cloudy. Other means for enhancing contrast could be incorporated without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a user is first presented with a \u201cclean\u201d screen appearance (). The user then speaks a designated command (e.g., \u201cshow numbers\u201d) when he or she desires assistance from an implementation of the numbering scheme. In one embodiment, a different input means such as, but not limited to, a traditional mouse or keyboard is utilized to turn the numbering scheme on or off. In one embodiment, the scheme is automatically turned on or off depending on the occurrence of predetermined events or circumstances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","504"]},"In accordance with block , boxes are numbered such that numbers are visible on top of the corresponding controls. The boxes themselves can either be visibly rendered or be made invisible. In one embodiment, the numbers are consecutively arranged from the top left to the bottom right of the screen. In one embodiment, a consistent font and font size is utilized for all of the numbers. Implementation of a consistent font and\/or font size enables good legibility, but can result in numbers going over the edge of a box, e.g., \u201c88\u201d in a small box.  is a representation of what it may look like when a box is too small to completely enclose its number. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, even if a given number is not itself immediately legible, the numbering scheme of adjacent numbers enables the user to deduce the desired value.  is an example of how the desired value presents itself in an obvious manner.","In accordance with step , a user speaks a number associated with a desired selection item. The spoken number is identified through speech recognition. The system illustratively maintains a listing of which controls correspond to which numbers. Upon recognition of a number, the corresponding control is executed.","In accordance with block , an optional confirmation step can be included to assist the user in selecting the desired control. The confirmation step assists the user in adjusting their command from an initially spoken wrong number to a number that actually does correspond to a desired item of selection. Embodiments of the confirmation process will be described in more detail below.","In summary, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the legibility of the numbering scheme plus the contextual clues provided by adjacent numbering plus the optional confirmation step together enable a user to select a desired item accurately, efficiently and with great control.","Embodiments of the optional confirmation step will now be described in greater detail. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, when a user has verbally spoken a number, an extra interaction with the user is initiated to confirm that the control corresponding to the spoken number is indeed the control that the user desires to select. In one embodiment, the confirmation step includes removing most of the fog and\/or non-selected control boxes from the screen, except with regard to the area around the item that has been initially indicated. This enables the user to easily identify which control they are about to select.","In an additional or alternative embodiment, the control box corresponding to the spoken number is highlighted (e.g., bolded) so that the user can check to see if it is the desired object of selection. In one embodiment, a specialized user interface component (e.g., labeled  and  in , respectively) displays the programmatic name of the control corresponding the spoken number. Through any of these or other means, the user is able to gain an understanding as to whether they are about to select the desired item. A simple subsequent confirmation command (e.g., a spoken command or otherwise) is then utilized to confirm if the indicated item is the desired item (e.g., if it is, they say, \u201cOKAY\u201d, if not, they say \u201cCANCEL\u201d to go back and show all numbers again for an alternate selection). In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, displaying the programmatic name of the control enables user to learn that name so that they can access the corresponding item directly (and thus more efficiently in the future). The optional confirmation process places the user in control, and reduces the odds that a wrong control will be selected.","The numbering of large items (e.g., greater than 50 percent of screen width\/height) can present a challenge as there is no logical place to put a number to cover the entire area. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, five numbers and a cross or X are utilized to indicate such items. For example, see item number  in . Of course, without departing from the scope of the present invention, more or fewer numbers could be located along the cross or X indicator without departing from the scope of the present invention. Of course, other shapes could be utilized to designate larger items as well (e.g., a circle or a rectangle, etc).","In accordance with one embodiment, if the user pauses for more than a predetermined time (e.g., three seconds) on the numbered screen, an automatic switching back and forth occurs at periodic intervals (e.g., one second intervals) between (1) control box indications with no numbers (the boxes may or may not be visibly rendered) and (2) boxes with numbers. This switching enables the user to see the context of the number they want to select, thus alleviating the problem of the numbers obscuring graphical representations of items beneath them. This switching, which may or may not be implemented in combination with a system that also supports the optional confirmation step, enables the user to accurately match the control they wish to select in the number they need to say (NOTE: a given system may incorporate the switching functionality and\/or the optional confirmation step). In accordance with one embodiment, switching occurs between a numbered display and a non-numbered, standard application display. In accordance with one embodiment, the numbers gradually disappear and\/or appear thereby accomplishing a fading affect.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the speech recognition engine listens for any one of the displayed numbers to be spoken. In one embodiment, if the user simply says a number, the optional confirmation step is implemented. For example, the user can say \u201c104\u201d to go to the second step to confirm. In accordance with one embodiment, however, a user can say an immediate confirmation signal to proceed without the optional confirmation step. For example, the user can say \u201c104 OKAY\u201d to immediately select the 104 control without investing time in confirmation.","Utilizing numbers to label controls enables improved speech recognition selection accuracy. Numbers are generally better than letters or names because numbers are less acoustically confusable then other words. However, utilizing letters or names is within the scope of the present invention.","Accordingly, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a numbering scheme is layered on top of an application display to indicate one or more items. The user is then able to speak the number of an item they wish to select. However, simply \u201cblasting\u201d the screen with numbers can result in there being so many numbers that the user loses context of which number they want to select. For this reason, a temporal switching mechanism can be utilized in which switches are conducted at predetermined intervals (e.g., second-long intervals) between showing numbered items and showing the original or modified non-numbered screen. Additionally, an optional secondary confirmation step can be implemented wherein the user sees only the item they just selected in some highlighted manner and thereafter has the opportunity to (a) learn the programmatic name of the item they selected if that name is made available and\/or (b) either proceed with their selection, or cancel if they have chosen an undesired item. The optional confirmation step can be omitted if on the original full screen with numbers, the user speaks the number followed by an immediate confirmation indicator such as \u201cOkay\u201d. This gives the user a choice between greater efficiency (one step selection) or greater control and learning (two step selection).","In accordance with one embodiment, the functionality described above wherein there is a switching between a display with and without indicators occurs automatically following a spoken indication and prior to confirmation (e.g., the user speaks a selection and the indicators disappear to uncover what lies beneath . . . then the user confirms or cancels the indication). For example, the switching functionality would replace a highlighting functionality where all but the selected indicator would disappear. In accordance with one embodiment, a combination of the switching functionality and highlighting functionality are implemented (e.g., first all indicators are removed and then the selected indicator is displayed, or vice versa).","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
