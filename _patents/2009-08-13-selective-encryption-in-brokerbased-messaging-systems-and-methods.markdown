{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Message-oriented middleware is infrastructure that increases the interoperability, portability, and flexibility of software applications by allowing the software applications to communicate one with another by transmitting messages therebetween. Message-oriented middleware reduces the complexity of developing software applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols by insulating application developers from the details of the various operating system and network interfaces. Accordingly, software developers can more easily integrate new software applications with existing software applications.","Typical message-oriented middleware configurations allow messages to be transmitted between software applications as cleartext only. However, it is often desirable to encrypt messages transmitted between software applications. Moreover, it is often desirable to selectively determine at run time of the software applications whether to transmit messages in encrypted form or in cleartext form.","Exemplary methods and systems for selective encryption of messages transmitted in broker-based messaging systems are described herein. As described in more detail below, an originating software application may generate a message to be routed to a recipient software application through a message broker subsystem. In some examples, it may be desirable to encrypt the message before it is transmitted to the message broker subsystem by a software application subsystem configured to execute the originating software application. Additionally or alternatively, it may be desirable for the message broker subsystem to encrypt the message before it is routed to the recipient software application.","To this end, the software application subsystem configured to execute the originating software application may transmit a request to an encryption services subsystem to route the message generated by the originating software application to the recipient software application through the message broker subsystem. The software application subsystem may acquire data representative of a current encryption configuration of the message broker subsystem from the encryption services subsystem in response to the request. The software application subsystem may use the acquired data to determine during a run time of the originating software application whether to encrypt the message before the message is transmitted to the message broker subsystem for routing to the recipient software application.","If the data representative of the current encryption configuration of the message broker subsystem indicates that the message broker subsystem is currently configured to accept encrypted messages, the software application subsystem may encrypt and transmit the message to the message broker subsystem over a secure connection. Alternatively, if the data representative of the current encryption configuration of the message broker subsystem indicates that the message broker subsystem is not currently configured to accept encrypted messages, the software application subsystem may transmit the message to the message broker subsystem as cleartext over a non-secure connection.","Once the message has been transmitted to the message broker subsystem in either encrypted or cleartext form, the message broker subsystem may acquire data representative of a current encryption configuration of the recipient software application from the encryption services subsystem. The message broker subsystem may use the acquired data to determine whether to encrypt the message before the message is routed to the recipient software application.","If the data representative of the current encryption configuration of the recipient software application indicates that the recipient software application is currently configured to accept encrypted messages, the message broker subsystem may encrypt and route the message to the recipient software application over a secure connection. Alternatively, if the data representative of the current encryption configuration of the recipient software application indicates that the recipient software application is not currently configured to accept encrypted messages, the message broker subsystem may route the message to the recipient software application as cleartext over a non-secure connection.","As used herein, the term \u201csoftware application\u201d may refer to any software instance such as, but not limited to, a software product (e.g., a software program), a module within a software product, and\/or any other software component (e.g. an enterprise java bean, a servlet, etc.) as may serve a particular application. As used herein, an \u201coriginating software application\u201d is one that generates a message to be sent to another software application (referred to herein as a \u201crecipient software application\u201d).","A \u201cmessage\u201d generated by a software application may include any data that may be read or otherwise processed by a message broker subsystem and\/or a recipient software application.

For example, system , including software application subsystem , message broker subsystem , and encryption services subsystem , may include computer hardware (e.g., one or more computing devices) configured to perform one or more of the processes described herein. In some examples, system  may be implemented on one physical computing device or may be implemented on more than one physical computing device. Accordingly, system  may include any number of computing devices, and may employ any of a number of computer operating systems.","One or more of the processes described herein may be implemented at least in part as instructions executable by one or more computing devices. In general, a processor (e.g., a microprocessor) receives instructions, from a computer-readable medium, (e.g., a memory, etc.), and executes those instructions, thereby performing one or more processes, including one or more of the processes described herein. Such instructions may be stored and\/or transmitted using any of a variety of known computer-readable media.","A computer-readable medium (also referred to as a processor-readable medium) includes any medium that participates in providing data (e.g., instructions) that may be read by a computer (e.g., by a processor of a computer). Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media and\/or volatile media. Non-volatile media may include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media may include, for example, dynamic random access memory (\u201cDRAM\u201d), which typically constitutes a main memory.

An exemplary secure connection includes, but is not limited to, a secure sockets layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) connection. An exemplary non-secure connection includes, but is not limited to, a non-SSL connection. Additionally or alternatively, as will be explained in more detail below, communication facility  may be configured to facilitate reception of a message by a software application.","Communication facility  may additionally or alternatively be configured to facilitate communication between software application subsystem  and encryption services subsystem . For example, as will be described in more detail below, communication facility  may be configured to transmit a request to encryption services subsystem  to route a message generated by an originating software application to a recipient software application through message broker subsystem .","Messaging facility  may be configured to process a message generated by an originating software application and\/or a message received by a recipient software application.

However, in some instances, as will be described in more detail below, message broker subsystem  may not be currently configured to accept encrypted messages.","Hence, before a message is transmitted, messaging facility  may be configured to determine a current encryption configuration of message broker subsystem  by directing communication facility  to transmit a request to encryption services subsystem  to route the message generated by the originating software application to the recipient software application through message broker subsystem . The request may include a request for data representative of a current encryption configuration of message broker subsystem .
