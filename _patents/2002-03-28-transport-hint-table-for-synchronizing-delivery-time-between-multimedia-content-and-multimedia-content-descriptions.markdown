title: Transport hint table for synchronizing delivery time between multimedia content and multimedia content descriptions
abstract: The content description of multimedia content contains a plurality of descriptor values that pertain to specific events within the media. A Transport Hint Table (THT) provides a set of synchronization events that indicate the relation between timed events in the media and their representation in the content's description data. The THT allows for synchronized delivery of presentation of content description data with the associated events in the media. The THT provides a set of sync events based on the existence of “time” related events obtained from the content description data, which are relevant to particular events in the media. The THT allows the transport layer encoder to use the time-related events to synchronize the scheduled delivery times of media content segments and their associated descriptions. The THT also provides information for fragmenting a description for delivery and for managing resources at the decoder.

Copyright \u00a9 2002, Sony Electronics, Inc., All Rights Reserved.","The present invention relates generally to delivery of multimedia content and multimedia content descriptions, and more particularly to the synchronized delivery of multimedia content and content descriptions.","Digital multimedia information is becoming widely distributed though broadcast transmission, such as digital television signals, and interactive transmission, such as the Internet. The information may be in still images, audio feeds, or video data streams. However, the availability of such a large volume of information has led to difficulties in identifying content that is of particular interest to a user. Various organizations have attempted to deal with the problem by providing a description of the information that can be used to search, filter and\/or browse to locate the particular content. The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has promulgated a Multimedia Content Description Interface standard, commonly referred to as MPEG-7 to standardize the content descriptions for multimedia information. In contrast to preceding MPEG standards such as MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, which define coded representations of audio-visual content, an MPEG-7 content description describes the structure and semantics of the content and not the content itself.","Using a movie as an example, a corresponding MPEG-7 content description would contain \u201cdescriptors\u201d (D), which are components that describe the features of the movie, such as scenes, titles for scenes, shots within scenes, time, color, shape, motion, and audio information for the shots. The content description would also contain one or more \u201cdescription schemes\u201d (DS), which are components that describe relationships among two or more descriptors and\/or description schemes, such as a shot description scheme that relates together the features of a shot. A description scheme can also describe the relationship among other description schemes, and between description schemes and descriptors, such as a scene description scheme that relates the different shots in a scene, and relates the title feature of the scene to the shots.","MPEG-7 uses a Data Definition Language (DDL) that specifies the language for defining the standard set of description tools (DS, D) and for defining new description tools and provides a core set of descriptors and description schemes. The DDL definitions for a set of descriptors and description schemes are organized into \u201cschemas\u201d for different classes of content. The DDL definition for each descriptor in a schema specifies the syntax and semantics of the corresponding feature. The DDL definition for each description scheme in a schema specifies the structure and semantics of the relationships among its children components, the descriptors and description schemes. The DDL may be used to modify and extend the existing description schemes and create new description schemes and descriptors.","The MPEG-7 DDL is based on XML (extensible markup language) and the XML Schema standards. The descriptors, description schemes, semantics, syntax, and structures are represented with XML elements and XML attributes. Some of the XML elements and attributes may be optional.","The MPEG-7 content description for a particular piece of content is defined as an instance of an MPEG-7 schema; that is, it contains data that adheres to the syntax and semantics defined in the schema. The content description is encoded in an \u201cinstance document\u201d that references the appropriate schema. The instance document contains a set of \u201cdescriptor values\u201d for the required elements and attributes defined in the schema, and for any necessary optional elements and\/or attributes. For example, some of the descriptor values for a particular movie might specify that the movie has three scenes, with scene one having six shots, scene two having five shots, and scene three having ten shots. The instance document may be encoded in a textual format using XML, or in a binary format, such as the binary format specified for MPEG-7 data, known as \u201cBiM,\u201d or a mixture of the two formats.","The instance document is transmitted through a communication channel, such as a computer network, to another system that uses the content description data contained in the instance document to search, filter and\/or browse the corresponding content data stream. Typically, the instance document is compressed for faster transmission. An encoder component may both encode and compress the instance document or the functions may be performed by different components. Furthermore, the instance document may be generated by one system and subsequently transmitted by a different system. A corresponding decoder component at the receiving system uses the referenced schema to decode the instance document. The schema may be transmitted to the decoder separately from the instance document, as part of the same transmission, or obtained by the receiving system from another source. Alternatively, certain schemas may be incorporated into the decoder.","The content description may be transmitted prior to, or subsequent to, the content that it describes or may be transmitted along with the content. For example, MPEG-2 provides mechanisms for the inclusion of a content metadata stream with the content video stream. An MPEG-7 content description may be transmitted in this additional data stream. However, some standards may not allow for such an additional stream, and no current standards allow for the synchronization of the descriptive data with its associated content. That is, with current standards, the content descriptions descriptor values and the multimedia content they describe (e.g., scene, shot, frame) are not synchronized for delivery and presentation. For example, the current MPEG-7 standard lacks the necessary tools to map the timed transport of MPEG-7 data onto arbitrary delivery layers such as MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, to achieve synchronization with the multimedia content.","The content description of multimedia content contains a plurality of descriptor and description scheme values that pertain to specific events within the media. A transport hint table provides a set of synchronization events that indicate the relation between timed events in the media and their representation in the content's description data. The transport hint table is created from the events in the content description relevant to specific events in the media. The Transport Hint table allows for synchronized delivery or presentation of content description data with the associated events in the media. Furthermore the invention provides methods for transmission of the transport hint table over various delivery schemes. The Transport Hint table provides information for fragmenting a description for delivery and for managing resources at the decoder.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings, and from the detailed description, that follows below.","Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and apparatuses for creating and providing a transport hint table (THT) for multimedia content descriptions. The THT provides \u201chints\u201d about the existence of time-related events in the content, obtained from the relevant MPEG-7 XML tags contained in the MPEG-7 content description of the multimedia content. The THT allows the transport layer encoder to use the time-related events called sync events to synchronize the scheduled delivery times of media content segments and their associated descriptions.","In the following detailed description, explanation and reference are directed to the creation and use of a THT for an MPEG-7 Content Description. Alternative embodiments of the present invention can have applications to other forms of content descriptions. Additionally, other specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.","Typical MPEG-7 content descriptions are graphically represented as \u201ctree\u201d diagrams wherein the nodes represent content descriptors and descriptor schemes. The descriptors and descriptor schemes are defined by XML tags. Base-level nodes provide low-level descriptors (e.g., color, etc.) or references to media elements. The low-level descriptors are combined to form progressively higher-level description schemes ascending the tree diagram. For example, for video data, the higher-level nodes describe the event, in general (e.g., movie title), while lower-level nodes describe particular scenes, shots, and frames.","The THT contains a number of sync events; a sync event may occur at any time. Each sync event may have a number of elements. For example, in one embodiment a sync event may include reference information, temporal information, and definition information. The reference information identifies the node, or group of nodes, that describes the event in the content description. In one possible embodiment, the reference is a path expression in the XML path language (XPath). An XPath expression consists of a set of steps that specifies the traversal of a path in the tree structure of an XML document starting from a node called the context node, which is often the root node of an XML document. Each step in an XPath expression is relative to a set of context nodes specified by the previous step. The location indicates temporal location in the media, which are the start time and end time of the sync event. Finally, the definition information provides an optional description (e.g., textual description) of the sync event. The THT may include other elements to provide more, or different levels of, details of the MPEG-7 content description.","In one embodiment, the THT is created by parsing the content description of the multimedia content. For example, the MPEG-7 XML tags (e.g., \u201cMediaTime\u201d, \u201cMediaLocator\u201d, \u201cTemporalSegmentLocator\u201d, \u201cImageLocator\u201d, etc.) contained within the description are used to generate a list of sync events. For one embodiment, each sync event has an associated reference, location, and definition. The reference indicates the path, within the content description, to the particular event. The location provides information about the temporal location in the media, which is the start time and duration of the sync event. The definition describes the event, e.g., a textual description of the multimedia content. The THT information may be used to provide synchronization between delivery of segments of multimedia content and their associated descriptions. That is, in one embodiment the description may be made available at the same time as the content (e.g., scene, shot, frame) it describes. The THT may alternatively be used by the decoder for resource management purpose or for resynchronization by the user to access selected content, or by the encoder to determine the access units (AU's) of the content description for transmission based on the sync events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["105","110","105","110"],"sub":["S1 ","S2 "]},"In accordance with one embodiment, THT  is created from the MPEG-7 content description (tree diagram ) and a number of different sync events  are identified from the MPEG-7 content description. The sync event in the resulting THT may be ordered according to the fields in each sync event. In one embodiment, sync events are sorted by the time of the sync event. In an alternative embodiment, sync events may be ordered by a composite key formed by a plurality of (1) the reference, (2) start time and (3) definition.","Each sync event in  contains a content description reference (or key) information, temporal information, and definition information. The reference defines a path, such as an XPath expression, used for traversing the tree diagram . For example the reference \/S\/Sindicates a path from the root node (\u201c\/\u201d indicates the root node), through node S to node S. Typically an MPEG-7 content description tree diagram may have tens or hundreds of levels between the root node and a node of interest. The temporal information specifies the temporal location of the media that is described by the content description indicated by the reference. For example, a temporal location may be indicated by the start time and duration of the sync event. Finally, the definition information provides a textual description of the sync event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","205"]},"At block , the content description is used to create a THT. For one embodiment, the THT may be generated from an MPEG-7 content description using an event parser (simple API for XML(SAX) parser) programmed to generate the time related sync events based on the temporal information provided by the relevant MPEG-7 XML tags in the MPEG-7 content description (e.g., \u201cMediaTime\u201d, \u201cMediaLocator\u201d, \u201cTemporalSegmentLocator\u201d, \u201cImageLocator\u201d, etc). Exemplary pseudo-code for the generation of a THT in accordance with such an embodiment is provided below. The THT may be generated by the encoder of the server processing system, or may be generated by a separate processing system and stored at the server.","At block  the THT is transmitted to a client processing system. For an embodiment in which the THT is generated from an MPEG-7 content description, the THT is transmitted in a similar fashion as the MPEG-7 content description itself. Transmission of the THT for such an embodiment is described below.","At block  the decoder of the client processing system decodes the THT and uses the information to synchronize the presentation of media content and its associated description for a variety of uses.

For example, CPU  or signal processor  may execute code or instructions stored in a machine-readable medium, e.g., main memory .","The machine-readable medium may include a mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and\/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine such as computer or digital processing device. For example, a machine-readable medium may include a read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash memory devices. The code or instructions may be represented by carrier-wave signals, infrared signals, digital signals, and by other like signals.","Transmission of the THT from an encoder at the server to the decoder at the client may be accomplished using the same transport mechanism that is used to transmit the MPEG-7 content description. The THT is, in essence, a high-level synopsis of the MPEG-7 content description, providing information regarding timed events (description of an event and when it occurs). Like the MPEG-7 content description, the THT is also written in XML conforming to an MPEG-7 DDL schema, or equivalently an XML Schema definition. Therefore, the THT may likewise be represented as a tree diagram with access to references using paths and nodes.","Like an MPEG-7 content description, the THT may be transmitted within an MPEG-2 transport stream. MPEG-2 has various streams (e.g., video, audio, etc.) that are multiplexed for transport. Each stream has a process identification number (PID) which is a pointer to the particular stream itself. The PIDs are stored in a program association table (PAT) that can be appended with a unique PID identifying the THT stream. In similar fashion the THT may be transmitted in an elementary stream that is associated with an MPEG-4 media object. MPEG-4 encompasses particular media streams as objects with each object having its own object descriptor identification. That is, a media object may be associated with an object descriptor that contains a collection of elementary streams comprising the media object.","Alternatively, the THT may be transmitted with the MPEG-7 content description. Such a transmission scheme may be preferable where the MPEG-7 content description is transmitted without its associated content, which may be transmitted subsequently, or not at all. Within the MPEG-7 Systems information for the content description, there is additional space that contains initial decoder configuration information. The THT may be transmitted as part of this configuration information. The decoder configuration information is one of the first things sent when an MPEG-7 description is transmitted. The THT, transmitted as part of this configuration information, would therefore, be available when the remainder of the MPEG-7 content description arrives. Limited capability client devices (e.g., text display only, low bandwidth, etc.) may then use the THT to tailor the MPEG-7 content descriptions for presentation or storage. That is, the client devices can schedule particular events of interest based on the information obtained from the sync events in the THT. For example, a client could schedule a particular event such as the sports portion of a news program instead of viewing the entire news telecast.","For stored media, the entire MPEG-7 content description is available a priori and therefore the entire THT may be generated and stored for later transmission. On the other hand, for multimedia content that is broadcast live, the MPEG-7 content descriptions, and hence the THT, cannot be generated a priori, but may be generated in segments as the event is broadcast or later. Additionally, a limited memory client device may not be able to store the entire THT and may therefore store, use, and discard portions of the THT on an on-going basis.","The THT, when represented as XML data, may be transmitted in pieces called access units (AUs) in the same manner as MPEG-7 description data.  illustrates how a THT is transmitted in AUs from a server encoder, and regenerated at the client decoder. An AU may start at any level, and may be an individual node (e.g., node ), or a subtree representing a time-ordered group of nodes (e.g., node B with its children nodes  and ). The choice of AU depends upon the content and application.  shows a THT represented as a tree  that includes nodes A, B, C, and  though . The THT tree may be transmitted progressively by using AUs that contain commands to add nodes, delete nodes, and replace nodes. The fragments of the THT tree may be sent ordered by time using such update commands.","A lower level node cannot be transmitted before the higher-level nodes containing that node. For example node  cannot be transmitted without first transmitting the higher-level parts of the tree containing node  (i.e., nodes A and C). In one embodiment, the first update command used will contain this higher-level \u201cskeleton\u201d or the static part of the tree. In , this higher-level tree diagram is shown as tree  and includes nodes A, B, and C. At this point, to progressively build the THT tree, an \u201cadd node\u201d command, a navigation path, and the AU payload are transmitted. For example, to add node  the command \u201cadd node \/B\/\u201d would be transmitted. The decoder receives the command, proceeds from root node A to node B, and at node B adds the AU payload (i.e., node ). Tree diagram  shows a portion of the THT tree after nodes  and  have been added. At this point segments of the tree may be added in time order while segments that have already been used may be deleted in consideration of the limited storage capability at the client. Tree diagram  shows a progressive stage of the THT tree transmission in which nodes , , and  have been added as described above, and node  has been deleted with the command \u201cdelete node \/B\/\u201d. The process is continued until the entire THT has been transmitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","605"]},"At block  the media content is encoded for transmission. During a transmission, e.g., Internet transmission, the transmitter initially conveys a master time clock\/System Time Clock (MTC\/STC) to the receiver. The MTC\/STC is used by the transmitter and receiver as a reference for synchronization. At run time, as media data is encoded for transmission, the encoder adds a decode time stamp (DTS) and a presentation time stamp (PTS) to the media content delivery units. The delivery unit depends on the underlying transport layer but usually includes the notion of a media access unit, which is a unit of media data with associated time information that is delivered from the sender to the receiving system. Once the decoder is aware of the MTC, the DTS indicates the time at which the data should be decoded and the PTS indicates the time at which the data should be presented\/rendered. The times used in the content description data are written in terms of media time or normal playback time and need not be the same as the PTS or DTS. For example, the first frame of a video may have a media time of 0 (in normal playback time) but will have a PTS that indicates that playback starts at a certain time, such as 12:15AM, Nov. 1, 2001. It is necessary to update (i.e. offset) the times in the sync events, which are media times, to get the correct PTS (or DTS) time values.","At block  the media content is streamed in delivery units (i.e. media access units). In order for the decoder to present the media data synchronously with the description, it is necessary to reflect the DTS or PTS of the media data to the descriptions so that they will be decoded and presented concurrently.","At block  when a segment of the media content is streamed, each relevant location element (which might be represented using an XML element called MediaTime, etc.) of the THT is updated to reflect the PTS (or DTS) of the corresponding media delivery unit. The update of the sync event time may be done by transmitting the correct PTS (or DTS) value for the media delivery unit via an update command (e.g., replace node command). In an embodiment where the entire THT is transmitted via a separate elementary stream, the update commands transmitted are pertinent to, and only affect, the THT.","In an alternative embodiment, the THT is transmitted in an incremental manner in the same stream as the content description. For such an embodiment, each the information for each sync event may be sent as an update command with the time value mapped to the DTS\/PTS of the media time at the encoder itself. Decoder memory capacity may require that the content description and the THT be built in pieces as discussed above. When this is done in the same elementary stream as the content description itself, the decoder must be able to ascertain whether an update command pertains to the THT or to the content description. Therefore, a provision may be made at the level of the update commands to distinguish the in-band (content) versus out-of-band (THT) information. For example, an XML descriptor attribute added to each access unit (e.g., \u201ctype\u201d) may be used to distinguish THT from the content descriptions (e.g., type00=THT, type01=MPEG-7 content descriptions).","As discussed above, for multimedia content that is broadcast live, the MPEG-7 content descriptions, and hence the THT, cannot be generated a priori, but is generated incrementally when event is broadcast or after the event occurs. In such a case, as the events take place, and their description is generated at the encoder, the sync events may be transmitted incrementally as updates to the THT with the time values mapped to the PTS (or DTS) of the live media.","The decoder may use the THT for a variety of applications. For example, because the THT provides summary information about timed events, the decoder may use the THT for random access to the media content. The decoder may request transmission from the encoder of AUs containing the portion of the content relevant to a specified time interval. This allows a user to select a specified portion of the media content, based upon its content, for presentation. For example, a user may wish to present only those portions of the highlights of a sports event in which scoring is taking place. Or a user may select only the financial report from an entire news program.","The decoder may use the THT for resource management as well. In the case of a presentation device having low memory and\/or low bandwidth, the device software has to manage the resources to provide optimum performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","705"]},"At block  a portion of the media content is buffered for subsequent presentation. For a device receiving video frames, for example, the device typically buffers some amount of the media data. Typically video data is transmitted in an encoded form in which particular frames (\u201cI frames\u201d) are used as reference frames with many subsequent frames having a dependency on them. Each I frame must be preserved while dependent frames are being decoded. A scene may cause an I-frame to be sent and thus previous frames may be discarded thus freeing buffer space.","At block  the device accesses the THT for the media content and discards or retains buffered information based upon the information contained in the THT. The THT provides could provide the duration of each scene which indicates how long particular frames need to be buffered, thus facilitating resource management.","The decoder may also use the THT for carousel purposes. For example, when a client device accesses a video being streamed, the client typically awaits a resynchronization marker from the server. Such markers are transmitted in the bitstream at regular intervals to allow the client device to synchronize their state with the server's data transmission. However, the marker does not provide information regarding the media content from the point of resynchronization (i.e., the user has no way of knowing if the information is of interest). The THT may be used to resynchronize with the server at any arbitrary future node (e.g., a particular point of interest). So for example, if a news program is being streamed, the THT allows a user to determine a point of interest at which to access the program. For example, the user may resynchronize with the server for presentation of the financial report without having to present the sports report. This is particularly beneficial for battery-operated devices.","The THT may also be used by the encoder to divide MPEG-7 content descriptions into meaningful AUs for transmission. The THT divides the content description into sync events. The encoder has access to both the THT and the content description and may therefore use the sync events to determine the AUs which would be most suitable for transmission of the MPEG-7 content descriptions.","Exemplary pseudo-code for generation of a THT in accordance with one
