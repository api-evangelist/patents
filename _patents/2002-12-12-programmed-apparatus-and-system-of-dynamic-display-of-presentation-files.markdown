{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to display devices and systems, and more particularly to display devices and systems for dynamic control of presentations.","The use of presentation software for presenting electronic \u201cslideshows\u201d has become ubiquitous today. The most popular presentation software is currently the \u201cPOWERPOINT\u00ae\u201d software package sold by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Typically, a laptop computer having a copy of the POWERPOINT software is connected to a display device. A POWERPOINT presentation file in the \u201c.ppt\u201d or \u201c.pps\u201d format, which has been previously created by the presenter, is executed by the software resident on the laptop computer and a slideshow is displayed on the LCD screen of the laptop and\/or sent to the display device (e.g., a LCD projector) and projected to a screen for display to an audience.","Oftentimes, more than one presentation is scheduled for an event, such as an academic conference or business meeting. Each presentation can and often is associated with a separate slideshow presentation. These multiple presentation events are accommodated in one of two ways. In a first approach, each presenter has his or her own laptop with a copy of the POWERPOINT software and a copy of the presenter's presentation file. After each presentation is given, the presenter's laptop is disconnected from the display device and the next presenter's laptop is connected thereto. This often causes delays as cables are physically disconnected from one laptop and reconnected to the next laptop. Further, the presenter may have to locate the presenter's presentation on the presenter's machine and launch the presentation in the \u201cfull-screen\u201d mode to begin the slideshow. The audience waits through and witnesses this ritual, including viewing any aspects of the presenter's computer desktop before the full-screen mode is presented. Further, the laptop may not be correctly configured to display on the display device. This event requires adjustments to be made for which the presenter is often not familiar, thereby requiring assistance by a more qualified person and perpetuating the aforementioned delay and unwanted displays.","In a second approach, all of the presentations of the various presenters are loaded into a single laptop computer connected to the display device. In this case, transitioning between presentations requires the first presenter to close the presenter's presentation and the subsequent presenter to open up his or her respective presentation. Again, delay results from this routine, and the transition events (e.g., opening and closing of presentations and desktop display) are shown to the audience.","In still yet another approach specific to POWERPOINT presentation software, POWERPOINT VIEWER software\u2014a viewing software application for POWERPOINT presentations\u2014allows a user to run multiple POWERPOINT slideshows, one right after another, by executing a playlist (.1st) file. The playlist file must contain the full pathname information for each presentation when each file is located in a file outside of the folder where the viewer executable file (PPVIEW32.exe) is located. The user creates the playlist using a text editor, such as a notepad software application, and saves the file with the \u201c.1st\u201d extension. While this approach provides for a more seamless presentation of a plurality of presentations files, control and modification capabilities are severely limited. During playback, no changes to the ordering of the presentation files or additions or deletions to the playlist are possible. In essence, a new, modified playlist textual file must be created using a text editor to define the new play order and this new file must then be executed from its beginning. This is not a practical solution during presentations. Further, navigation between individual presentations in the playlist is limited. For example, during playback of the playlist, the user cannot move from the first slide of a presentation directly to the last slide of a previous presentation.","A presentation system with some limited flexibility is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,108,101 to Tuttle, entitled \u201cDynamic Control of Visual and\/or Audio Presentation\u201d issued Aug. 22, 2000, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Tuttle describes a presentation system including a personal computer connected to a LCD projector. The personal computer executes a play story program and various software routines. A story list file including a list of all \u201cstories\u201d that are initially included in a particular presentation and a default sequence for presenting them is loaded into the personal computer. A directory is fetched from an external storage that includes the name and location of all stories. Once the play story program is executed, it reads an incremented story list counter to identify the first story and then reads the directory to obtain the address of the first story in external storage. An I\/O subsystem then fetches the first story from external storage into RAM for presentation. The system allows some control over the presentation ordering during display of the cumulative presentation, but is still dependent upon a static playlist and does not allow for modifications of the playlist of \u201cstories\u201d (e.g., additions, deletions, or reordering) without interrupting the story currently being played. Put another way, the user can immediately command the play of a story that is not the next story defined in the playlist, but this requires either the interruption of a present story or a wait until completion of the present story. Still further, multiple changes, such as reordering of multiple stories, cannot be accomplished without manually commanding the play of each story when desired.","Greater flexibility in group presentations is often desired, such as to accommodate changes in presentation ordering and additions and deletions of presentations, both before the beginning of a group presentations and during the group presentation. Therefore, there is a need for a presentation system that allows for more flexible display of multiple presentations, while eliminating unseemly delays and displays that occur in between individual presentations.","A method of preparing and displaying a cumulative presentation and a presentation system are provided. A listing of available individual presentation files is provided through a user interface. Each of the presentation files comprises a plurality of presentation slides. A user is queried through the user interface to select presentation files from the available individual presentation files for inclusion in a cumulative presentation in a selected presentation order. A listing of presentation files selected by the user is displayed in the user interface. In response to a first command received from the user, a first slide from a first presentation from the cumulative presentation is provided to a display device for display thereon. In response to a second command received from the user, a second slide from the cumulative presentation is provided to the display device for display thereon.","A method of manipulating a presentation order of presentations in a cumulative presentation and a presentation system are also provided. The cumulative presentation comprises a plurality of presentations files each including a plurality of presentation slides. A listing of presentations included in the cumulative presentation is provided to a user through a user interface. Without interrupting a presentation currently being displayed from the cumulative presentation, the presentation order of the presentations in the cumulative presentation is reconfigured in response to a reconfiguration command received from the user.","The above and other features will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention that is provided in connection with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","20","20","22","24","26","28","20","20","20","43","42","45","34","47","30","21","30","32"]},"I\/O media sources  can include any or all of the following: a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-R\/W (or compatible) drive, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-R\/W, DVD+R\/W (or compatible) drive, lomega ZIP drive, digital memory device (e.g., CompactFlash portable storage device, Memory Stick portable storage device, SmartMedia portable storage device or Secure Digital portable storage device), digital tape, portable hard drive or any other storage device. Still further, a media source may be another computer processor and I\/O media sources  may include a wired connection, such as a USB port, wired network card (e.g., Ethernet card), or modem, or wireless connection, such as an infrared port or RF port that facilitates communications via the 802.11a, 802.11b or BlueTooth protocols, for receiving and transmitting files from or to a remote computer processor that contains media.","Processor  also includes Presentation User Interface Controller  connected to user control display , user input device  and presentation control device , the details of which are described below. Programmed processor  may also includes an audio codec , which may be connected to speakers , headphones or earphones. The processor  also preferably includes at least one video controller , shown connected to the local bus and CPU  through AGP controller  and the AGP bus. The video controller  may output video in one or more video formats, including VGA, S-video, composite video or other video format. Video controller  is preferably connected through an appropriate video port to a display device, such as a projector  and\/or a monitor . The monitor  may be, for example, a LCD or CRT display. Likewise, the projector  may be a CRT, LCD or other type of video projector. This connection may be either wireless or hardwired. As described in more detail below, video controller  provides the video signal for a cumulative presentation to monitor  and\/or projector . In one embodiment, presentation user interface controller  provides a video signal to user control display  corresponding to a graphical user interface, specifically a dialog box or window, that allows the user to interact with the processor  via user input device . A second video controller may optionally be connected to the AGP bus to provide this second video signal.","Although the preferred method of interacting with the user, such as displaying information to the user and querying the user for information or instructions, is described by means of a graphical user interface and, more specifically, dialog boxes or windows, it is contemplated that other user interfaces may also be utilized, such as LED displays or other means of communicating with the user.","The use and operation of the system  of  is described hereafter in connection with , specifically with respect to the creation, display and modification of a cumulative presentation. An exemplary embodiment of the system  is described using POWERPOINT presentations, but it should be understood that the system is not limited to this form of presentation file or to any particular form of media. Rather, a presentation includes a group of slides, which may include still images, audio, video or combinations thereof. To that end, presentation software  may include software for playing video and audio or other media, including, but not limited to, RealMedia\/RealPlayer, QuickTime video and\/or audio, MPEG video and\/or audio, Windows Media video and\/or audio, to name a few.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["24","100","40","24","20","22","20","60","60","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 2-2D","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","24","20","102","24","30","32","100","32","20","32","32","20"]},"At step , the control program  receives a selection of a presentation file to add to a cumulative presentation. This selection may be made by the user using user input device . The actual selection may be made in any number of ways. For example, if the user input device  is a pointer device, such as a mouse device, the user can select the desired individual presentation file by pointing to the file on the graphical user interface and selecting the file by \u201cclicking\u201d on it. The user can then drag the file over to the \u201cCumulative Presentation Order\u201d window in the graphical user interface. Another option would be to \u201cdouble-click\u201d on the file, whereby the control program  automatically adds the file to the first location in the cumulative presentation order. Alternatively, the use can select the \u201cselect media\u201d button and the file is then added to the cumulative presentation order. Regardless of how the control software  is configured to query the user for a presentation order selection to enable or allow the user to select the media file for inclusion in the cumulative presentation order, the media file is added to the cumulative presentation order, and the name of the selected presentation file is displayed to the user in the Cumulative Presentation Order window of the graphical user interface (step ) as shown in . The selected presentation is preferably placed in the first order position of the cumulative order, but this is not a requirement. The user could, for example, opt to define the cumulative presentation from the last order position to first order position or in some random manner.","In one embodiment of the invention, the programmed processor  allows the user to select presentations for inclusion in the cumulative presentation at selected slot location in the cumulative presentation. Assume speakers one and five in a symposium are from the same company and have a single diskette containing both of their respective presentation files. The presentations could be added to the cumulative presentation list as presentations one and five after the diskette is inserted at I\/O media source , leaving the other slots open. The next presentation added to the cumulative presentation is then automatically placed in the earliest available slot (in this case, the second slot) unless the user directed it to another randomly accessible slot, such as the third slot. The user also has the option to have new presentations appended to the end of a current list instead of at the earliest unfilled spot (e.g., spot number six). If another presentation were added at slot number four, then slots one, three, four and five would be occupied with presentations. If the cumulative presentation is then displayed (as described below) and no new presentation is added thereto at slot number two, the device displays the cumulative presentation as if it were comprised of four presentations at slots one through four. As described below, presentation two could be added as presentation one is being displayed, and if the cumulative presentation is then saved, it can be saved with the original assigned positions or with the presentation as displayed, at the user's option.","The user interface for configuring and modifying the cumulative presentation may be textual, numeric or pictorial. An example of the latter interface would be an interface that allows the user to drag and drop (using user input device ) presentations into pictorial representations of cubby holes, for example, or onto icons representing empty or full slots. The device may be configured in a variety of ways to address attempts to place presentations into occupied slots. For example, the device could verify the user's intent to place the presentation into that slot, could offer to replace the existing presentations in the slot, or could prompt a shift of all subsequent presentations by one spot (or until each presentation is in an open slot), to name a few.","After a user has selected a presentation file and its name is added to the cumulative presentation order list, the control software  preferably directs that the selected presentation file is copied from the appropriate I\/O media source  associated with the presentation file to local storage in system memory  or hard drive  (step ). At , the user decides whether to add additional presentation files to the cumulative presentation list. Because the system  arranges and displays cumulative presentations from a plurality of individual presentations, the user selects at least one more presentation file for addition to the cumulative order in the manner described above. For example, if the user selects \u201cDr._A_Presentation.PPT\u201d as the second presentation, it is added to the cumulative presentation order, the graphical user interface is updated and displayed to the user as shown in , and the selected presentation file is copied to local storage (steps -). In this manner, the user can define and develop from scratch a cumulative play order of presentations as shown in, for example,  from a plurality of different media sources  and through a user friendly graphical interface.","If the user does not wish to add any additional presentation files to the cumulative presentation list at step , control software  provides the user the option of deleting files from the cumulative presentation order at . If the user decides to delete a presentation from the list at , a presentation from the list is selected by the user and removed from the list at , and the list is redisplayed to the user without the removed presentation file. Using the user input device , the user can select the desired file from the cumulative presentation order window of the graphical user interface by \u201cclicking\u201d on its name and choose \u201cselect media,\u201d drag the file off of the window to a virtual \u201ctrash can,\u201d select a \u201cdelete\u201d button (not shown) or otherwise remove the presentation file from the list. The cumulative list order is then updated to reflect the remaining presentation files.","The user may want to reorganize the cumulative presentation list at step  if the user does not want to delete a file from the cumulative presentation list at step  or after the user has deleted a presentation file from the list. This may be accomplished in any of several manners. As shown at step , the user can simply clear the entire cumulative list order and begin with the empty list shown in . This may be done by selecting the \u201cclear list\u201d button from the user interface. Thereafter, the user can create a new list as described above via steps -. Alternatively, at step  the user can simply click on a selected presentation from the cumulative order list and drag it to the desired order spot. For example, the user may select the fourth presentation (Dr_E_Presentation) from the interface of  and drag it to the second order spot using the user input device . Thereafter, the unselected presentations are shifted accordingly, and the updated cumulative presentation list is shown in the graphical user interface of .","Although shown in a particular order in  for purposes of explanation, it should be understood that the user can utilize the add, delete and reordering options in any selected order and combination to achieve the desired cumulative presentation order. The user can use these options multiple times, and as explained herein, use these options before, during and after display of the cumulative presentation.","Once the user has created the presentation order for the cumulative presentation in the manner described above, the user can then present the cumulative presentation to the audience using the system  at step . This feature is described below in connection with  and the control software , presentation software API  and presentation software . In an exemplary embodiment of the present system , Presentation Software  is a POWERPOINT software application such as POWERPOINT Viewer software and Presentation Software API  is the POWERPOINT Viewer API. The API  allows an external software program such as control software  to interface with Presentation Software  and control the functions of the Presentation Software . Although the present embodiment is described in connection with POWERPOINT software, other presentation software may be utilized for other media file formats (e.g., QuickTime, etc.). Also, the presentation software functionality can be programmed directly within control software .","Referring to , control program  receives a display command from the user through the graphical user interface () and user input device  (step ), i.e., by selecting the \u201cDISPLAY\u201d button from the interface of  with a mouse device. Alternatively, the display command may be received from the user via presentation control device , e.g., by selecting a display button (not shown in  described below). The control program  then presents a cumulative presentation according to the cumulative presentation order established as described above. The cumulative presentation may include a plurality of individual presentations with each individual presentation including at least one presentation slide, and more likely a plurality of presentation slides.","The control program  maintains a list of the presentations selected for inclusion in the cumulative presentation as described above. In an exemplary embodiment, this list is a linked list described below in more detail in connection with  and . After the display command is received at step  from the user, the control program  provides a display command or commands at step  to the presentations software  along with the name (or full pathname if needed) of the first listed presentation and an identification of the slide number to be displayed, e.g., the first slide from the first presentation. The pathname identifies the name of the presentation and any directories in system memory  or hard drive . The control program  also obtains the total number of slides in the first presentation from the cumulative order list (step ).","In an exemplary embodiment, the display command  is provided to POWERPOINT Viewer presentation software  through the POWERPOINT Viewer software API . The NewShow( ) function can be called by the control program  to load a presentation and display the first slide. For example, API \u201cLPDISPATCH_Application::NewShow(LPCTSTR FileName, Long AdvanceMode, long Kiosk)\u201d implements the NewShow( ) function that loads a PowerPoint file and displays a first slide. It accepts a filename and two flags that control the behavior of the POWERPOINT Viewer.","API \u201clong SlideShowView::GetSlidesCount( ) may be used to obtain the number of slides in a file at step . The API implements the \u201cGetSlidesCount( )\u201d function that returns the number of slides in a slideshow that was opened with the NewShow( ) API.","API \u201cvoid SlideShowView::GotoSlide(long Index, long ResetSlide)\u201d implements the \u201cGotoSlide( )\u201d function to facilitate a jump to a particular slide. This command accepts the index number of the slide to be displayed and a flag that controls the behavior of the viewer. This function may be utilized as described hereafter.","At step , the presentation software  then opens the identified slide from the first presentation in a full screen slideshow and displays the slide on the monitor  and\/or projector . This video signal is provided through video controller .","The cumulative presentation and individual slideshows are then controlled via the presentation control device . For example, the control software  may receive a command from a user through presentation control device  and presentation user interface controller  to move to a different slide (step ). The different slide may be a different slide from the presently displayed slideshow from the cumulative presentation or a slide from a completely different presentation included within the cumulative presentation. The control software  then provides the display command to the presentation software  through the API  including the number of the slide to be displayed (step ). If the slide is from a completely different presentation, the control software  obtains the total number of slides in the presentation at step  in the manner described above. There is no need to obtain this number if the requested slide is contained within the presentation currently being displayed or one that has already been displayed. The control software  also provides the pathname information for the presentation if needed, i.e., if the presentation is not the same as the presentation currently being displayed at step . The GotoSlide function is utilized (as described below) if the requested slide is not the first slide from a presentation. The user-requested slide is then displayed on the monitor  and\/or projector  (step ). The control software  then waits at step  for a new display command from the user, i.e., a command to display a different slide. Any newly requested slide is then displayed as described above at steps -. If no new slide is requested for display, the slide displayed at step  remains displayed until the control software  receives an exit command via presentation control device .","Optionally, the control software  can be configured to automatically progress to the next slide based on a pre-programmed timeout value. The timeout value may be embedded in the POWERPOINT file per standard POWERPOINT functionality (or other utilized media file format) or it may be configured within the control software  itself. If it is configured within the control software , there may be a timeout value individually associated with each slide, individually associated with each presentation, globally associated across all presentations, or in any combination thereof. Information associated with a presentation or slide may be stored in the nodes of the linked list along with the other data described below.","In the event that the user commands the display of a slide from a different presentation at step , and assuming the presentation software  is Power Point Viewer software, the PowerPoint Viewer default is to automatically display the first slide in that presentation. Assuming viewer software  includes this default feature, and assuming the user commanded the display of a slide that is not the first slide of the different presentation, this limitation can be addressed by blanking the screen prior to invoking the NewShow( ) function call and un-blanking the screen after the GotoSlide( ) function call. To jump to a slide that is not the first slide of a different presentation (e.g., the third slide from the different presentation), an exemplary process flow is as follows: (1) the display is blanked; (2) the NewShow( ) function is called with the path of the presentation; (3) the GetSlidesCount( ) function is called to obtain the number of slides; (4) the GotoSlide( ) function is called with the appropriate slide number to which to jump; and (5) the screen is then unblanked. The blanking step may be accomplished by creating a full screen sized window of a solid color that is prioritized above all other screen content, thereby preventing any other screen content from being displayed.","It should be understood that the presentation control device  can be configured in many different ways to allow the user to control the cumulative slideshow. For example, an exemplary control device  may include a keypad  shown in . The control device  may be wired to the programmed processor  or be a wireless device that communicates with an RF or infrared port of the programmed processor . An exemplary keypad  includes number keys  that allow the user to specifically input the presentation number and\/or slide number to be displayed. For example, assume that the first slide from the first presentation is currently being displayed. The user may select the \u201cslide number\u201d button , enter \u201c5\u201d to represent the fifth slide from the first presentation, and select the \u201center\u201d key . The control software  receives this command at steps  and , and provides the display command for the fifth slide to the presentation software at step . The fifth slide is then opened and displayed at step . As with other functions, this can occur without the user interface appearing on the projector\/display  utilized to present the cumulative presentation to the audience.","The user may use the control device  to command the display of a slide from a different presentation by the following sequence: (1) selecting the \u201cpresentation number\u201d button ; (2) entering, for example, \u201c3\u201d to indicate the third presentation; (3) selecting the \u201cslide number\u201d key ; (4) entering, for example, \u201c4\u201d to indicate the fourth slide; and (5) selecting the \u201center\u201d button . This command information is then provided to the control software  at steps  and . Since the user has commanded the display of a slide from a different presentation from the cumulative presentation order, the control software obtains the total number of slides from the presentation at step . The control software  then facilitates the display of the requested slide as described above in connection with steps  and .","The keypad  also preferably includes right and left arrow buttons  and , respectively. These buttons may be used to move through a slideshow one slide at a time. For example, assume that the first slide of the first presentation is currently displayed. Selecting the right arrow button  commands the control software  to display the second slide from the slideshow. This command is received by the control software  at steps , . The control software  then provides the display command at  to the presentation software including the number of the slide to be displayed, i.e., slide two, which is the next slide after slide one. Assuming that the present slide being displayed is the last slide in a presentation, selecting the right arrow  facilitates the display of the first slide from the next presentation in the cumulative presentation list developed as described above. In this event, the control software  also executes step  to identify the total number of slides from the next presentation and then provides the display command to the presentation software  including the pathname information for the next presentation from the list and the slide number, e.g., slide one.","The left arrow button  works in a similar manner, only to move backwards through a slideshow, e.g., to move from the second slide in a presentation to the first slide in a presentation or to move from the first side of a presentation to the last slide of a previous presentation. If a command is received via button  to move from the first slide of a presentation to the last slide of a previous presentation, it is not necessary to execute step  if the control software  has already obtained and stored in memory the total number of slides in the previous presentation.","Keypad  also preferably includes a \u201cnext presentation\u201d button  and a \u201cprevious presentation\u201d button . Selecting the \u201cnext presentation\u201d button  requests the display of the first slide from the next presentation from the cumulative presentation order list. This is also accomplished via steps  and -. Likewise, selecting the \u201cprevious presentation\u201d button  requests the display of the first slide from the previous presentation from the cumulative presentation order list, again via steps  and -.","As also shown in , the keypad  includes an \u201cexit\u201d key . This key provides a command to the control software  at step  to terminate the display of the presentation.","An exemplary presentation system  also provides the user with the ability to display a presentation from the cumulative presentation and edit the cumulative presentation order simultaneously. This feature allows for impromptu changes to the cumulative presentation without disrupting the presentation currently being provided. This feature recognizes that any number of events can require cumulative presentations to be changed \u201clast minute\u201d at events or require a presentation order change. For example, presenters can be late, absent or substituted for and\/or presentation topics may be rearranged. This feature is described hereafter in connection with  and .","In one exemplary embodiment, the ordering of the cumulative presentation configured as described above is implemented as a linked list, and preferably a doubly linked list where each element or node includes a pointer to both the next and previous elements or nodes. This linked list may be created after a cumulative presentation is defined as described above. In one exemplary embodiment, the linked list is created when the display command is received at step  (). Referring to , the presentation order defined by the user as explained above in connection with  and  is implemented as a doubly linked list. Assume that the presentation order defined by the user is, from first to last presentation as follows: Presentation C, Presentation A, Presentation B, Presentation E and Presentation D. Each element of the list is illustrated as having at least three components. In another embodiment, additional components may be stored as well, such as the aforementioned timeout values. A first component identifies the presentation file, e.g., Presentation C, or Presentation A, etc., by name (or full pathname if the files are located in a directory that is not the same for each element). A second component identifies a link to the previous element. For all elements except the first element, this previous pointer identifies the previous element of the list, e.g., the previous pointer for the third element (representing Presentation B) points to the second element (representing Presentation A). For the first element, a null value is provided for this previous pointer. A third component identifies a link to the next element. For all elements except the last element, this next pointer identifies the next element from the list, e.g., the next pointer for the second element (representing Presentation A) points to the third element (representing Presentation B).","The list preferably has two pointers\u2014a first presentation pointer and a display pointer. These pointers are utilized in the display of the individual presentations from the cumulative presentation described above in connection with . The first presentation pointer identifies the first presentation from the linked list and, therefore, from the cumulative presentation defined by the user as described above. The display pointer identifies the presentation element that is currently being displayed. This display pointer is incremented or set to point to the next presentation element (or other presentation element from the list as the case may) of the linked list as shown in  when the user requests or commands the display of the next presentation (or other presentation as the case may be) as described above in connection with .","Modification of the cumulative presentation is described hereafter in connection with  and . During the display of the cumulative presentation (which is displayed on monitor  and\/or projector\/display  as described above), a graphical user interface is also preferably provided to the user via user control display  and through presentation user interface controller  (). This graphical user interface allows the user to reconfigure the cumulative presentation while the presentation is still being displayed to the audience without interruption thereof. This feature allows for a user to account for changes in the cumulative presentation order. These changes may become necessary, for example, during conferences if a speaker is a \u201cno show,\u201d a speaker is added, a speaker is late, a new version of a presentation file is provided, or circumstances otherwise dictate a reconfiguration of the presentation order.","In one exemplary embodiment of the present system, the graphical user interface of  is provided in a format similar to that of the interface of  used to initially define the cumulative presentation order. Displayed on the left side of the graphical interface are the presentation files located at the available I\/O media sources . For purposes of this example, the \u201cA\u201d, \u201cD\u201d and \u201cH\u201d drives are shown available. The \u201cD\u201d drive is shown to be empty, indicating that no compact disk is present in the drive. For example, after a presentation is copied to the presentation apparatus  from this drive, the compact disk is removed and returned to the presenter. The \u201cDr_E_Presentation.PPT\u201d file is shown in the \u201cH\u201d drive in this example because it is a network drive that is still available. A new presentation\u2014\u201cDr_F_Presentation.PPT\u201d is shown in the \u201cA\u201d drive. For purposes of this example, the Dr_F presentation is a new presentation not included in the original cumulative presentation and made available through a floppy disk inserted in drive A during the display of the cumulative presentation.","The predefined cumulative presentation order is shown displayed on the right side of the graphical user interface, e.g., dialog box or window interface, of . The individual presentation from the cumulative presentation currently being displayed is shown highlighted in the user interface. In this example, Dr_A_Presentation is currently being displayed. This event corresponds to the lined list shown in . Control buttons, i.e., \u201creorganize\u201d, \u201cadd\u201d and \u201cdelete\u201d, are also shown on the bottom portion of the graphical interface, the function of which is described below.","Assume that a user wants to add the Dr_F_Presentation file to the cumulative presentation list for display after the Dr_B_Presentation and before the Dr_E_Presentation without interrupting the cumulative presentation, i.e., Dr_A_Presentation is currently being displayed. For purposes of the graphical user interface, this may be accomplished by dragging the name of the Dr_F_Presentation file from the left hand side of the interface to the desired location between presentation order spots  and  of the presentation list. The display is then updated for the user to represent the new presentation order, i.e., C, A, B, F, E, then D. As described above in connection with step  (), the selected presentation file is also copied to system memory  or hard drive  for use in the cumulative presentation. This addition may also be accomplished by selecting the \u201cadd\u201d button, then selecting the Dr_F_Presentation name and then selecting the desired inclusion location, i.e., order spot number . The Dr_E and Dr_F presentations are then bumped to the fifth and sixth presentation spots, respectively. It is understood that users can interact and control a graphical user interface in any number of ways, and this disclosure is provided for purpose of explanation and not for purpose of limitation.","Regardless of how the user commands or requests that the presentation\u2014here Dr_F_Presentation\u2014be added to the cumulative order, the linked list is modified to implement this change. Modifications to the linked list may be implemented using manipulation algorithms that should be familiar to those of ordinary skill, but these modifications are described generally hereafter for purposes of clarity. Referring to , a modified linked list is shown. The first, second and last elements remain unchanged. The next element pointer of the third element is changed to point to the new element\u2014the element corresponding to Dr_F_Presentation file. The element that previously followed the third element, i.e., the Dr_E_Presentation element, is also modified. The previous element pointer of this element is modified to point to the new element rather than the third element. The new element includes a previous element pointer that points to the third element and a next element pointer that points to the next element in the list, i.e., Dr_E_Presentation element. In this manner, the linked list is modified, and the new element is added seamlessly within the cumulative order, and thus within the cumulative presentation. The user can then direct the display of this new presentation using the user input device  as if it were originally included in the cumulative presentation, i.e., in response to an appropriate user command described above in connection with , the display pointer eventually is updated to point to the new element and the corresponding presentation is displayed.","It should be understood that a new presentation element or elements can be inserted or added anywhere in the linked list. If the element is to be added before the first element in the linked list, the first element pointer must be changed to point to the new element. The original first element is provided with a previous element pointer that points to the new element (rather than a null element). The new element is provided with a null element for its previous element pointer and its next element pointer points to the original first element. Similar element changes are made to add a new element after the last element of the linked list, only with respect to the last element.","The deletion of an element from the cumulative presentation order is now described in connection with . Again, with respect to user interaction, this task is accomplished through a graphical user interface such as is shown in . Again, the nature of the setup of the interface is not important. The user can, for example, select a presentation from the presentation order list using a user input device  and then select the \u201cdelete\u201d key. Alternatively, the user can select a presentation from the displayed listing and simply drag the name from the list. Again, the linked list is modified to implement this change without interrupting the presentation from the cumulative presentation currently being displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6D"},"An existing list can be reorganized as well For example, the ordering can be changed from C, A, B, E, D to D, E, B, A, C, or any other combination. Again, this may be accomplished via the graphical interface of . For example, the user can simply drag a presentation name from the displayed list to the desired location in the list, at which point the presentation list is redisplayed with the presentation in the correct order. Alternatively, the user can select the \u201creorganize\u201d button, at which point a second presentation order window opens (not shown) adjacent to the illustrated presentation order window. The user can then drag or otherwise select presentations from the original cumulative presentation list to spots in the new presentations list. Selecting the \u201creorganize\u201d button again completes the modification and triggers the linked list to be modified. Reordering the linked list elements includes the steps of removing an element from the list as described above and adding the element to the desired location in the list. Of course, the removal and addition steps are performed as many times as necessary to regroup the elements into the desired ordering. The modified linked list then controls the presentation order in response to presentation commands received from the user as described above.","As explained above, in one embodiment, this feature provides the ability to edit the cumulative presentation list on a user control display  and display the presentation simultaneously on the monitor  and\/or projector\/display . Individual presentations can be added, removed and\/or reordered in the cumulative presentation without interrupting the presentation from the cumulative presentation currently being displayed.","It is contemplated, however, that in one embodiment, the cumulative presentation is merely paused during reconfiguration of the cumulative presentation list. This embodiment is particularly applicable if the system  utilizes monitor  and\/or projector\/display  as the user control display. This may occur when the programmed apparatus  only includes one video controller. In this embodiment, the user may select a \u201cpause\u201d button (not shown) on presentation control device  and then select an \u201cedit\u201d button (not shown). This selection causes the control software  to display an edit screen, such described above in connection with . The user then uses user input device  to interact with the user interface to define a new cumulative presentation order, e.g., presentations may be added, deleted and\/or reordered. When the modification is completed, an updated linked list is created and used when the presentation is restarted or un-paused, by for example, selecting the \u201cedit\u201d or \u201cpause\u201d button again on presentation control device . The slide that was being presented on monitor  and\/or projector\/display  at the time the \u201cpause\u201d button was first selected is then redisplayed on monitor  and\/or projector\/display  (rather than the editing user interface). The linked list defining the new cumulative presentation order is then used to define the presentation order during the display.","Referring again to , the apparatus  preferably is configured to export or save the cumulative presentation to an I\/O media source , such as a CD-R\/W drive or a floppy drive. The user can select this option through the graphical user interface displayed on the user control display . The cumulative presentation can be saved in several different ways. In a first embodiment, the individual presentations are stored with their original file names along with a file corresponding to the linked list described above, which points to the presentation files by name. A user can then load the presentation files onto any processor programmed with presentation software (e.g., POWERPOINT VIEWER software) and open the presentation files individually. If the user has a processor programmed with that portion of control software  directed to displaying cumulative presentations as described above in connection with , Presentation Software API  and Presentation Software , then the user can view the presentations as a cumulative presentation. Alternatively, the linked list can be converted into a simple textual (or other indicia) list illustrating the cumulative presentation order. This list is copied to the I\/O media source  along with the presentation files. Of course, this list may be used as a simple reference indicating the cumulative presentation order, or it may be converted by a processor including control software  into a linked list for use in display of the cumulative presentation.","In a second embodiment, the individual presentation files and the linked list associated with the cumulative presentation of the individual presentation files are again loaded, saved or otherwise transferred to an I\/O media source . In this embodiment, however, the file names are renamed at least in part to correspond to their ordering in the cumulative presentation, i.e., \u201cfile0001.ppt\u201d, \u201cfile0002.ppt\u201d, \u201cfile0003.ppt\u201d etc. The linked list is modified accordingly (or a new linked list is created) to reflect the name changes; In this manner, a user can then load the presentation files onto any processor programmed with presentation software (e.g., POWERPOINT VIEWER software) and open the presentation files individually. Unlike the first embodiment, however, the user can discern the correct ordering of the presentations by their respective names, thereby virtually recreating a cumulative presentation. In many cases, conventional PC software will also list such files names in the correct order when commanded to do so. Of course, if the user has a processor programmed with that portion of control software  directed to displaying cumulative presentations as described above in connection with , Presentation Software API  and Presentation Software , then the user can view the presentations as a seamless cumulative presentation.","In yet another embodiment, the presentation files are concatenated by the display apparatus  into a single presentation file, e.g., a single \u201c.ppt\u201d file having a plurality of individual presentation slides in the order of the cumulative presentation. This concatenating functionality is presently built into the POWERPOINT software (as distinguished from POWERPOINT VIEWER software). This file is then loaded, saved or otherwise transferred to an I\/O media source . In this manner, a user can then load the presentation files onto any processor programmed with presentation software (e.g., POWERPOINT VIEWER software) and open a single presentation file to view as a seamless cumulative presentation.","The save feature allows the user to make the cumulative presentation portable and provides great flexibility in combination with the dynamic modification features described above. The user may choose to wait until the cumulative presentation is finished to utilize the save feature. This allows the user to capture any modifications to the cumulative presentation (and thus the linked list) made during display of the presentation (e.g., additions or deletions of individual presentations, or reordering thereof).","Some other features of an exemplary system  and presentation apparatus  are now described. In one embodiment, the programmed processor  allows the user to add transitions between presentations. Again, this option may be provided to the user through a graphical user interface displayed to the user on user control display . The user may select from a plurality of transitions, such as a blank screen, a graphic design, a logo page, etc. If the same transition for each presentation in the cumulative presentation is selected, whether it be a blank screen, logo, etc., the transition screen is displayed whenever the user moves to the next presentation as described above in connection with . This may be accomplished by inserting the screen as an element in the linked list between each presentation element. Alternatively, assuming there is a common insert screen that is to be inserted at each transition, it does not need to be stored within the linked list. Instead, a variable can be used to indicate that a screen is to be displayed at every transition. This variable can be consulted when the transition is encountered. If the variable is set, the insert screen is displayed. A second variable would be used to indicate which screen is to be displayed during the transition. Alternatively, the user can select a different transition screen for each individual presentation or some individual presentations. In that event, the user can simply add the transition screen as an entry in the cumulative order list. The file corresponding to the screen can be selected from an I\/O media source  as described above","The programmed processor  also preferably allows the user to define bookmarks during presentation of an individual presentation for the cumulative presentation. For example, as shown in , an exemplary presentation control device  may include a \u201cbookmark\u201d key . Assume that a slide from a presentation in the cumulative presentation is currently being displayed on the projector\/display . If the user decides that he or she (or another user) may desire to quickly return to the slide later in the presentation of the cumulative presentation, the user can select the bookmark key . By selecting this key, the location of the slide within the cumulative presentation is stored by the control software . At any later point, i.e., when a different slide from the same or a different presentation is being displayed, a user can again select the bookmark key . By selecting this key , the control software saves the location of the slide presently being displayed and then displays the bookmarked slide. Basically, the slide number and pathname (if needed) are provided to the presentation software  by the control software  at step  of . If the user selects the bookmark button again, the control software retrieves the location information for the previously displayed slide and uses this information to redisplay that slide. In one embodiment, the programmed processor  also allows the user to set multiple bookmarks, each functioning as described above.","Although  shows that the programmed process is separate from the peripherals, such as the monitor , projector\/display  and user control display , this is for purposes of illustrations only. It is contemplated that the programmed processor  and peripherals may form a part of an integral device.","The system described above provides a user-friendly and flexible means of preparing a cumulative presentation, displaying a cumulative presentation and modifying a cumulative presentation. Much of this may be accomplished with or without a user interface and using even as few as one or two \u201cclicks\u201d of a user input device  and\/or presentation control device . A plurality of presentations can be displayed as a cumulative presentation in a seamless manner, and the cumulative presentation can be modified without interrupting a presentation from the cumulative presentation being displayed. The system eliminates awkward transitions between presentations, allows the user to save a cumulative presentation, and can function with a plurality of different sources of media files. Still further, the system relieves the inflexibility inherent in prior art systems that rely upon preprogrammed, static textual play lists.","In one embodiment, some functionality of the control software  may be moved to a peripheral device that interacts with control software  via an API. In such an embodiment of system , the control software  of the programmed processor is associated with an API such that a portable or other control device may interface therewith and enhance the capabilities of the processor , such as to provide the ability to manage and organize or reorganize the cumulative presentation at the peripheral device, while the programmed processor  and central processing unit  direct the ongoing display and maintain storage of the presentations. For example, a cumulative presentation order can be developed or modified in any manner at the peripheral and then be provided to the control program  in a standard format. The control program  can then convert the provided presentation order into a linked list as described above, which is then used in the display of the cumulative presentation as described above. It is assumed that the presentations defined in the cumulative presentation order by the peripheral are available to the control processor via I\/O media sources . Alternatively, the media files may be transferred to the control processor  from the peripheral device. In this manner, control of the cumulative presentation can be implemented through processor  and presentation control device , while the cumulative presentation can be developed and\/or modified before and during the cumulative presentation using a peripheral device that effectively implements the functionality of the user input device  and the user interface displayed on the user control display  This feature allows a user at a location remote from the processor , such as at a different location in a meeting room (e.g., a registration desk), to interact with the processor  to update and modify the cumulative presentation order.","In yet another embodiment of the system , a processor  serves as an I\/O media source . Cumulative presentation lists, individual presentations, timeout values, transition slides, and other data can be transferred from a first processor  to a second processor . This information may be transferred over a phone line or other communication link, for example. This facilitates the sharing of information, as well as coordinating presentations in multiple venues. The signal from video controller  or a display command may also be transmitted to a remote processor  for display to a remote audience.","In another embodiment of the system , programmed processor  allows the user to add, delete and reorder slides within an individual presentation that is included within a cumulative presentation. This feature allows users to make last minute changes to the individual slideshow without the need to edit the PowerPoint file. One implementation of this feature is embodied by creating a doubly linked list corresponding to the slides within an individual presentation (in addition to creating a linked list corresponding to the order of the individual presentations within the cumulative presentation). Each element of the list corresponds to a slide and includes a previous slide pointer and a next slide pointer. A pointer identifies the first slide in the list and the current slide being displayed. The user is presented with a user interface similar to, for example, the dialog interface of , only specific to the slides of an individual presentation. Through the interface, the user defines a new ordering for the individual sides within a selected presentation. The actual presentation file is not modified, but the control software  directs that a doubly linked list be created embodying the slide ordering directed by the user. This slide ordering is then used in the presentation process illustrated in  and described above.","For example, assume there are five slides in a selected presentation\u2014slide 1, slide 2, slide 3, slide 4 and slide 5. The user may select a new presentation order within that presentation as follows\u2014slide 1, slide 2, slide 4 slide 3 and slide 5. This new order is represented in a linked list that is created. When slide 2 is displayed and the user commands the display of the next slide (by selecting right arrow key , for example) a slide presentation pointer is updated in the linked list to point to the next slide pointed to in the linked list\u2014slide 4 \u2014and the display command provided at step  commands the display of slide 4 from the presentation. Without this linked list, slide 3 would be displayed. A slide or slides may also be deleted using a similar mechanism.","The present invention can be embodied in the form of methods and apparatus for practicing those methods. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into and\/or executed by a machine, or transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code segments combine with the processor to provide a unique device that operates analogously to specific logic circuits.","Although the invention has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments, it is not limited thereto. Rather, the appended claims should be construed broadly, to include other variants and embodiments of the invention that may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and range of equivalents of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention, as well as other information pertinent to the disclosure, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-6D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
