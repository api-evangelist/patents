Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an image transmission service in a computer network and an apparatus used for this image transmission service. Further, the present invention relates to a service which periodically captures or obtains an image of a video camera or the like, accumulates image data, and provides the accumulated image data to unspecified users.","2. Related Background Art","Computer networks such as the Internet, an intranet and the like have been spread rapidly by the appearance of the WWW (World Wide Web). Thus, it is possible by the WWW to provide information to a lot of unspecified people and to capture necessary information from a lot of unspecified people.","Ordinarily, it is possible by the WWW to provide previously prepared text, image (video) and voice (audio) to a lot of unspecified users. The diversification of applied form of the WWW caused a demand for capturing not the previously prepared data but the data representing the image, the voice and the like and publishing the captured data.","As one answer for such a need, an image upload system (also called an image upload service) has been designed and manufactured. In the image upload system, image data is captured periodically (or according to a predetermined schedule) from a video camera. Then, the captured image data is transmitted to an Web server, and an image file (or an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) file in the Internet) is made. This process is called an upload.","However, in such the image upload system, since an image is always overwritten, a client side can refer only to the latest one image. Further, in the Internet world, a document made with a description language such as HTML or the like is stored in a server, and information representing a page desired by a user is then transmitted according to a client's transfer request. Even in this Internet world, to cope with access from all over the world, a page of the same contents is made in plural languages, and the respective pages are stored in the server. Namely, the plural pages which have the same contents and are expressed in the different languages are stored in the server.","Further, there are a lot of monitoring systems of the type for imaging by operating a camera. However, even in these systems, there are a lot of situations that it is not easy to guess the direction of the camera on the basis of the formed image. Even if image information representing the camera direction and the like is displayed together with the image itself on the client side, when such the image information is presented in the Internet, there is a possibility that worldwide users access it. In this case, if there is no function to select the appropriate language for such the information, there is some fear that the users who can not understand the meaning of this information arise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","401","402","401","401","402","403","404","403","406","403","405"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["501","501","502","503","504","506","501","507","506","503","501","509","504","502","508"]},"However, in the conventional upload system, the user can watch the latest image but can not watch the previously taken image.","Further, there is a demand for displaying when, where and how the uploaded image data was captured (taken). Also, there is a demand for displaying the past image data in the form of list or the like.","However, such the HTML file  for displaying the image data must be previously made in the WWW host . This does not especially become a problem when the information such as the character information  or  which can be previously prepared (e.g., information such as photographing position information which does not change according to the image itself) is provided.","However, there is information of which value can not be found until the image data is recorded in the WWW host . For example, such the information represents an image data capture time (a capture end time), an image data size, peripheral voice, a peripheral noise and the like. Such the information can not be embedded in the previously prepared HTML file. Thus, in order to display such the information, an administrator must purposely update an HTML document after capturing the image. Further, although it is possible to provide a photographing date or so by incorporating it into an image when photographing the image with a camera, in this case, a character enters the image without fail. Thus, it is impossible to purely provide the image alone.","Namely, since the conventional upload service merely uploads the image data file, it is necessary to previously prepare the page for displaying the uploaded image data in the WWW server. Thus, since such the page must be previously prepared, there is a drawback that it is impossible to display (provide) information (e.g., image data capture date information, data size information, or the like) which can not be known until the image data is actually captured.","Further, since the number of image files capable of being displayed is fixed, it is impossible to watch the arbitrary number of images in the form of list. Further, it is impossible to increase the number of display images every time a new image file is uploaded.","Further, there is a need for editing of the image data captured, i.e., to embed date and message to image data, or to make a panoramic image by joining plural image data together.","Further, even if the past-photographed images can be watched, e.g., when image files are continuously accumulated in the hard disk of the WWW host by periodically uploading these image files, such the accumulated data finally exceeds the capacity of the hard disk. Thus, a new image can not be captured anymore.","Further, as the number of users who enjoy a WWW service increases, as a data quantity to be provided to the user increases, or as the number of provided services increases, it is anticipated not to be able to cope with such increment with the single WWW server.","However, the conventional upload service premises that the WWW server and the upload service are operated and controlled with the identical host. Even if it is not so, since the upload destination is fixed to be one, the conventional upload service can not deal with the complicated operation of the WWW server.","The present invention aims to provide an upload service which can be managed by the plural WWW servers.","In the above conventional system, only one image data is captured at a preset time and then uploaded.","In many cases, such the preset time is determined expecting some events to occur at that time. Thus, it is desirable not to upload a similar image every day but to upload an image with change to some extent day by day (e.g., to upload today an image which includes by chance a bird flying over the sky). However, in the conventional example that only one image data is captured at the specific time, it is necessary to relay on chance to achieve such an effect as above, whereby it is actually easy to continuously provide substantially the same image.","However, it is complicated for the administrator (or a manufacturer) to prepare beforehand the pages of the plural languages as in the conventional case. On the other hand, when the client side wishes to change a Japanese page to an English page, after the download of the Japanese page the client side must again download the English page of which contents are substantially the same as those of the Japanese page, whereby it takes time to finally confirm the contents of the English page.","An object of the present invention is to solve all or a part of the above conventional problems.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an upload system which provides new service by which previously photographed images can be watched, and further provide an upload system which can easily provide information representing an image photographing time and cope with various display form and editing requests.","In order to achieve the above object, the present invention discloses an image processing system comprising: a capture means for capturing image data from an image input apparatus disposed on a network; a storage means for storing the plural image data captured by the capture means and, beside the image data, information at the image capture time; a creation means for creating display image control data from the image data captured by the capture means and the information at the image capture time, the display image control data being the data to control an image for display; and a transmission means for transmitting the display image control data created by the creation means.","Still another object of the present invention is to reduce providing of the same image and increase freedom degree of selection of an image to be uploaded.","In order to achieve the above object, the present invention discloses an image processing system comprising: an image data capture means for capturing image data according to a previously set schedule; a creation means for creating from the plural image data captured by the image data capture means an image to be uploaded to a network, on the basis of a predetermined estimate standard; and a transmission means for transmitting the image created by the creation means, through the network.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an image processing apparatus and an image processing method which can smoothly change a displayed language and do not store data wastefully in a server.","In order to achieve the above object, the present invention discloses an image processing apparatus comprising: a download means for downloading from a server relative information being relative to an image and capable of being selected and displayed from plural languages, together with the image; a storage means for storing the information downloaded by the download means; a reproduction means for reproducing the image from the storage means; a display means for displaying the image reproduced by the reproduction means; a selection means for causing a user to select any of the plural languages; and a display control means for reading from the storage means the relative information of the language selected by the selection means, and causing the display means to display the read relative information together with the image.","Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and the attached drawings.","Hereinafter, an image upload server according to the first embodiment will be explained. First, terms and the like which are used in the following explanation will be briefly explained.","(Image Upload)","Image upload image data is captured from a video camera or the like, and the captured data is transmitted to a host (host computer) such as WWW host which is convenient for a user. The host which received the data performs a process to, e.g., store the image data in a secondary storage.","(Point)","The term \u201cpoint\u201d represents one point on a time axis (i.e., one point in time) which can be designated or defined by date and time. The \u201cpoint\u201d sometimes includes a day of the week. Ordinarily, the term \u201cdate\u201d or \u201ctime\u201d itself represents one point in one case, and represents the date or the time as a structural component of the point in the other case. In order to avoid confusing, in the following explanations, the terms \u201cdate\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d must respectively represent the date and the time as the structural components of the \u201cpoint\u201d.","(Object Management)","The term \u201cobject management\u201d represents a process that one group of objects is managed or controlled. Namely, in the object management, a process to add an object to the group, a process to delete an object from the group, a process to capture or obtain from the group an object satisfying a certain condition, or a process to apply an appropriate process to an object in the group (e.g., to rewrite an attribute value) is performed if necessary.","In implementation, the object management can be easily realized by holding an object ID of the object belonging to the group in a list, a table or the like. A module which is named \u201cmanagement module\u201d surely has such a function of the object management.","(Object\/Object ID\/Object Area)","The term \u201cobject\u201d represents a configuration when data is set in a main memory. The object is referred with \u201cobject ID\u201d, and an area on the memory where the object is set is called \u201cobject area\u201d. In many cases, a head address of the memory area on which the object is set is used as the object ID.","(Object Attribute\/Attribute Value)","When each of data constituting the object is referred, such the data is called \u201cattribute of object\u201d or simply \u201cattribute\u201d. For example, it will be described that a file object has a file name as the attribute. When the concrete value of the attribute is referred, such the value is called \u201cattribute value\u201d. It should be noted that, in implementation, the attribute value corresponds to an instance variable and its value in an object directive language.","(Software Module\/Submodule)","The term \u201csoftware module\u201d which is also called \u201cmodule\u201d simply represents a logical structural component of software. In implementation of software, the module corresponds to (one) function, aggregation of plural functions (i.e., a function group), a source file, a class of the object directive language, and the like.","The module is sometimes constituted by smaller structural components. In this case, such the structural component of the module is called \u201cinferior module\u201d or \u201csubmodule\u201d.","(Module Entry Point)","The term \u201centry point of module\u201d represents an interface which causes one module to perform some process. In implementation, the entry point of the module corresponds to a global function, a global procedure and the like. When appropriate data is given to the entry point to call it, the module performs an appropriate process. When the process at the called module side ends, the processed result is given to the side (ordinarily another module) which called the entry point.","Such a series of the above processes is represented \u201can entry point a of a module A is called\u201d. When there is only one entry point published by the module A, it is possible to represent \u201cthe entry point of the module A is called\u201d or \u201cthe module A is called\u201d.","(Gateway\/Gateway Host)","In case of connecting two computer networks, they are sometimes connected to each other through a gateway host. Namely, the gateway host is the host computer which limits or restricts data exchange between the connected computer networks. For example, it is assumed that two computer networks A and B are connected to each other, and that a computer a connected to the network A communicates with a computer b connected to the network B. When any gate host is not disposed between the networks A and B, the computer a can directly communicate with the computer b. However, when a gateway host G is disposed between the networks A and B, the communication must be performed in the following procedure. Namely, (1) the computer a communicates with the host G, (2) the computer a requests the host G to transfer communication contents to the computer b, and (3) the host G checks the contents and then transfers them to the computer b if there is no problem.","Further, when a reply for the contents transmitted from the computer a is returned, the following procedure is necessary. Namely, (4) the computer b starts communicating with the host G to transmit the reply to the computer a, (5) the computer a requests the host G to transfer communication contents to the computer b, and (6) the host G checks the contents and then transfers them to the computer a if there is no problem.","The term \u201cgateway\u201d represents software which causes an ordinary computer to act as the gateway host. The gateway is sometimes called \u201cgateway server\u201d.","(Communication Between Processes\/Message\/Reply\/Host Name\/Port Number\/Socket)","When two programs mutually exchange data, a communication mechanism between processes is used. Generally, the communication mechanism between processes is incorporated in an operating system. Especially, the communication mechanism between processes in which a socket interface is applied is widely used.","In order to perform the communication between the processes with the socket interface, it is necessary to first prepare the following data, i.e., a name (\u201chost name\u201d) of a computer in which software of a communication partner is running, and an ID of a data reception port which has been provided by the software of the communication partner for the communication between the processes. Such the data reception port is simply called \u201cport\u201d, and such the ID of the port is called \u201cport number\u201d.","When the host name and the port number are prepared, the communication between the processes can be performed in the following procedure. Namely, (1) a socket is made. Here, the socket corresponds to \u201ccommunication path\u201d established between the communication origin and the communication partner. However, at this time, the communication path is merely pro form a and thus can not be used for the communication as it is. Then, (2) the socket is initialized by using the host name and the port number. By these processes, the above \u201ccommunication path\u201d functions as an actual communication path.","The process composed of the above processes (1) and (2) is called \u201cconnection process\u201d. When the connection process succeeds, it is possible to transmit the data by using the socket. At this time, the data exchanged by using the socket is called \u201cmessage\u201d. When the word representing the content of the message is added, the message is sometimes called \u201crequest message\u201d or \u201creturn message\u201d. Further, the return message is sometimes called \u201creply message\u201d or simply \u201creply\u201d.","(Communication Protocol)","When the communication between the processes is performed, there is a case where the program of the communication partner accepts only a specific-pattern message. The term \u201ccommunication protocol\u201d defines the pattern of such the message. The communication control is sometimes called simply \u201cprotocol\u201d. The protocols used normally are enumerated as follows. It should be noted that following protocols are used in the first embodiment.","<ftp Protocol>","The acronym \u201cftp\u201d represents \u201cfile transfer protocol\u201d. This ftp protocol is used when a file is exchanged between programs. A server dedicated to process the ftp protocol is called \u201cftp server\u201d. Refer to Request for Comments 765 (simply called RFC765 hereinafter) for the details of the ftp protocol.","<http Protocol>","The http protocol is used for the WWW service. Mainly the http protocol is used when the Web browser captures or acquires data from the WWW server. Refer to RFC1945 and RFC2068 for the details of the http protocol.","(WWW (World Wide Web) Service)","The WWW service is the service which is provided by the server called the WWW server or the Web server. A user can capture or obtain various information from the WWW server by using the Web browser such as Internet Explorer\u2122 or the like. The WWW server and the Web browser exchange the message with the http protocol. Thus, the WWW server is sometimes called \u201chttp server\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"A camera server host  gives service to provide image data to a user through a computer network .","Since a video camera  is connected to the camera server host , the host  captures or obtains an image from the video camera  The host  can capture, in one frame, the image data of 10 KB or so corresponding to maximum ten sheets for one second. An image upload host  is one of clients of the camera server host . The host  periodically captures the image data from the camera server host , e.g., one frame every ten minutes. Also, the host  can capture an animation for a certain time and then manage it as a group of data.","The image data is transmitted to a general WWW host . The host  stores the received image data in a hard disk or the like such that a user can refer to the data by using the Web browser. In , three users use the Web browser by other hosts ,  and  respectively.","The image upload host  performs an upload process of the image data and simultaneously generates (or creates) information (image information data) concerning the image data. Thus, also the image information can be uploaded. An HTML file for displaying the image data can be considered as one of the image information data. Also, it is possible to generate the different-content HTML file for each image data.","The image upload host  can upload the image data to a WWW host such as a WWW host  connected to a forward computer network , through modems  and . Further, the image upload host  can upload the image data to a WWW host such as a WWW host  connected to a forward computer network , through a gateway host .","Also, the host  can perform the upload process to the WWW hosts ,  and  simultaneously. Namely, the host  can upload the same image to these three WWW hosts and capture images respectively from different camera servers.","Ordinarily, the upload host  is set to periodically perform an image upload process. By using a terminal client, it is possible to immediately perform the image upload process regardless of the setting. Such a function is used to check whether or not the periodical setting of the upload process operates without any trouble. In , one user starts the terminal client one other host .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5"],"b":["701","708","701","701","702","704","706"]},"The display area  displays information such as the page title  which can be prepared beforehand. The display area  displays a list of the images files which can be watched by the user. A character string in each item represents a time when the corresponding image was captured from the video camera. In , the image data  which was captured at 05:00 a.m. is selected.","The display area  displays the image data  and the image information data . The image information data  includes the image data capture date, the image data capture time, the size of the captured image data, and the information concerning the video camera (e.g., pan, tilt and zoom values representing the camera direction in ).","In the present embodiment, such the information which changes according to the image data can be provided to the user.","Numerals  to  are directed to an example of the terminal client. Namely, the window  displays a general terminal program such as Telnet (telecommunication network) or the like. The user inputs a command after the prompt  displayed on the window . The input command is transmitted to the image upload host and then processed. Then, the processed result is returned to the terminal program and displayed on the window .","In , the two commands, i.e., LIST  and INFO001 715, are executed, and the respectively corresponding results  and  are displayed.","The LIST command  inquires how many upload setting there is in the image upload host. The result  displays the four upload settings which are added with ID's 001, 002, 004 and 007 respectively.","The INFO001 command  requests displaying the content of the upload setting 001. The result  represents that a camera server \u201cIMAGE-SERVER\u201d gives a service at a host \u201csvcserv1.cano.co.jp\u201d and with a port number \u201c65310\u201d and uses a communication protocol \u201cwvtcp\u201d for image capture. The protocol \u201cwvtcp\u201d is used to capture an image from a camera server \u201cWebView\/Livescope\u201d\u2122.","Otherwise, the following commands are available.","<ACTN>","The ACTN command has a format ACTN<timer setting object ID>.","When this command is transmitted to the image upload server, an upload process which should be performed at a previously designated point is immediately performed without waiting such the designated point. The timer setting object ID is added to the information concerning such the designated point, and the detail thereof will be explained later.","When this command is executed, a message which shows passage of the upload process is provided to the user. When the process succeeds, a character string \u201cOK\u201d is displayed. When the process fails, a character string \u201cERROR\u201d and its reason are displayed.","An example in which the ACTN command is used will be shown as follows.\n\n","In the above example, the list of the timer settings available for the LIST command is displayed, and the two timer settings from among the displayed timer settings are executed by the ACTN command.","In the reply to the LIST command, the number of timer numbers displayed at the head is displayed in the following format.\n\n","In the above example, the number of timer numbers is \u201c4\u201d.","Next to ITEM-COUNT, the available timer number is displayed one by one. In the above example, \u201c001\u201d, \u201c002\u201d, \u201c004\u201d and \u201c007\u201d are displayed. Finally, \u201cOK\u201d is displayed to represent that the execution of the LIST command succeeded. In the INFO command, the setting contents of the timer number \u201c001\u201d is displayed.\n\n","The \u201cimage capture setting\u201d is the character string of the following format.\n\n","The protocol name represents the name of the protocol which is used by the image upload server to capture image data from the camera. For example, when the camera server provides an image capture interface based on the http protocol, \u201chttp\u201d can be designated for the protocol name. The host name represents the name of the camera server host. The port number represents a TCP (transmission control protocol) port number which is available to transmit the message to the camera server. When the WebView\/Livescope camera server is used, a default port number is \u201c65310\u201d.","The \u201ctransmission destination of image data\u201d and \u201ctransmission destination of image information\u201d are the character string of the following format.\n\n","The protocol name represents the name of the protocol which is used by the image upload server to upload the file. Since the file is ordinarily uploaded by communicating with an FTP (file transfer protocol) server, \u201chttp\u201d is often used.","The host name represents the name of the WWW host. The port number represents the port number of the server acting as the transmission destination on the WWW host. Ordinarily, the port number of the FTP server is used. The file path represents the position (file name) on which the transmission data is set.","The above format is pursuant to URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Refer to RFC1738 for the details of URL.","The timer number \u201c001\u201d is executed by the first ACTN command. The upload of the image file, the upload of the image information file, and the update of the image information list all end normally.","The timer number \u201c004\u201d is designated by the second ACTN command.

A parameter can be set to the captured image data, in accordance with the camera server. In the present embodiment, since WebView\/Livescope is used as the camera server, it is possible to designate the image data size and the video camera direction when the image data is captured. Such the information is called the image parameter. It should be noted that, in order to distinguish the image parameter from \u201clocal image parameter\u201d next described, the image parameter is sometimes called \u201cremote image parameter\u201d.","The local image parameter is held. Even if the camera server does not provide any means for designating the image parameter, it is possible to previously prepare the information concerning the image on the side of the image upload server . For example, when the camera server by which the camera direction can not be changed is used, it only has to previously prepare the information concerning the camera direction on the side of the image upload server . Also, information such as text data for explaining the image data content or the like which is not generally provided by the camera server is conceived as the local image parameter. Such the information is called the local image parameter which can be set in the upload setting file.","An object ID of the server setting object is held. This object ID is the ID for the server setting object which is used in the communication process to the camera server from which the image data is captured.","An object ID list of the data transmission setting object is held. Namely, the ID's of the plural data transmission setting objects are held. These objects are referred when the image data is transmitted to the WWW host.","<Data Transmission Setting Object >","The transmission setting object  is the setting object which is used to transmit the image data and the image information data to the WWW host. Since the data to be transmitted is divided into two types, there are prepared two types of data transmission setting objects, i.e., an image data transmission setting type and an image information data transmission setting type.","Like the timer setting object , each of these types is distinguished based on the type attribute. The object of the image data transmission setting type is characterized not only by transmitting the data but also by holding the information concerning the image data editing. Further, such the object can hold the ID's of the plural image information data setting objects . Thus, it is possible to edit unique data and generate the image information data in accordance with the WWW server being the data transmission destination.","Further, the image data transmission setting type can have an image editing parameter as the attribute value. This parameter is used to designate the process to be performed by the image data editing submodule , for the image data captured from the camera server. Concretely, it only has to designate an external command (program) to be called for the image editing and the format of an argument used in such the call. As an example of the image editing, image size reduction or image data synthesis can be conceived.","Except the above, there is no difference between these two types. Namely, the common attributes are enumerated as follows.","There is an ID of the server setting object.

The transmission parameter is the information which is added when the data is transmitted. Ordinarily, a kind of data, and a name of a file or a directory where the data is set are designated. Further, the data storage method on the reception side such as \u201cto replace old data by transmitted data\u201d or \u201cto add transmitted data to the end of old data\u201d is designated here.","There is a list of the ID's of the image information data setting objects.

The image information data setting object designated here is used to generate the image information data.","There is a batch (collective) transmission flag. The data transmission setting object is sometimes referred from the timer setting object of data transmission timer setting type, because of achievement of a batch transmission method. Ordinarily, the data transmission process is performed subsequent to the data editing and the data generation process, as the final step in the upload process. On the other hand, in the batch transmission method, the data transmission process is reserved for a while, and then this process is performed at a preset point. While the batch transmission flag is being ON, this means that the data setting object is the target of the batch transmission process.","<Image Information Data Setting Object >","The image information data setting object  is the setting object for holding the information necessary to generate the image information data. Namely, the information concerning the position where the template file being the model of the image information data is set, and the kind of data to be generated are held.","Concretely, a template file name is held. The template file name is the name of the file which holds the template data of the information data.","Further, a data generation parameter is held. The data generation parameter is used when the information data is generated. In the present embodiment, the information data is generated as text data. Thus, as the data generation parameters, a language of the text data and designation of a code system are used.","Further, a transmission parameter is held. The contents of the transmission parameter are the same as those of a \u201ctransmission parameter\u201d attribute in the data transmission setting object. The image information data is transmitted to the WWW host based on these contents. However, since the transmission destination has been designated on the side of the data transmission setting object , the transmission destination can not be designated by the image information data setting object.","<Available Term Added Data Setting Object >","After the image upload server  performs the data transmission process to the WWW host, the server  can perform a process to request the WWW host to delete the transmitted data when a certain term passes. In order to prevent a lack of memory capacity of a storage medium, such a function is used to limit an available term of the uploaded data. The available term added data setting object  holds the information which concerns the data being the target of deletion for such a data deletion process. Further, in order to cause the WWW host to perform the data deletion process, it is possible to set only one reference to the server setting object.","Further, there is a method of not accumulating the image data till the available term but of overwriting a new image file as for an old image file. However, the fault of such the method is in the loss of past image data because of the overwriting.","<Server Setting Object >","The server setting object  is the setting object for holding the information concerning the communication partner's server such as the camera server, the WWW host or the like.

Further, a port number which is the number of a TCP port used as the service interface by the server is held. A protocol name which can be received by the server is held. Further, a connection parameter which is the parameter necessary for the communication with the server is held. For example, the ftp server requests a user name and a password in case of communicating with the server. Thus, when the communication with the ftp server is performed, it is necessary to register beforehand the user name and the password as the connection parameters. Further, a list of the object ID's of the route setting objects is held. This list includes the ID's of the route setting objects which hold route (path) information necessary to connect to the server.

Thus, the value of each item read from the timer setting file is set to the timer setting object (S). Concretely, the values of the type attribute, the date designation attribute, the day (of the week) designation attribute and the time designation attribute are captured and then set to the timer setting object. At this time, a data type is converted if necessary. For example, the time setting in the timer setting file is held as the character string representing the time setting. It is not efficient to use this setting in the timer setting object as it is.

In the method (b), the upload image which was obtained as a result of the day-before (not one-before) schedule execution is used as the sample image. In the method (c), the path and the file name of the image file being the sample image are designated as the sample image file name. Also in the methods (a) and (b), the path and the file name used to store the sample image are necessary. However, in these methods, since the image to be designated can be known from the schedule information, such the image is automatically set as the sample image file name.","The comparison area represents the item which is used to set which parts of the sample image and the candidate image should be estimated. Concretely, this area is set as the rectangle information composed of the x coordinate of the left edge of the estimate target part, the y coordinate of the lower edge of the estimate target part, the lateral size of the estimate target part, and the longitudinal size of the estimate target part.","The importance information is the information represents how to give the importance for each candidate image according to the estimate standard. In the present embodiment, the importance is set for the maximum coincident importance, the minimum coincident importance and the other importance, respectively. At this time, the sum of the maximum coincident importance, the minimum coincident importance and the other importance must be set to \u201c1.0\u201d.","The maximum coincident importance represents the importance which is allocated to the candidate image of which coincidence to the sample image is highest (i.e., the image closest to the sample image). The maximum coincident importance can be set up to two digits below decimal point within the range from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1.0\u201d.","The minimum coincident importance represents the importance which is allocated to the candidate image of which coincidence to the sample image is lowest (i.e., the image most different from the sample image). The minimum coincident importance can be also set up to two digits below decimal point within the range from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1.0\u201d.","The other importance represents the importance which is allocated to other candidate image. The other importance can be also set up to two digits below decimal point within the range from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1.0\u201d. Here, it should be noted that, e.g., the most average image can be set. According to implementation, it is thought that the other importance can be set more in detail. For example, the importance is changed if the coincidence exceeds a certain value.

This upload image setting panel  is roughly divided into three areas, i.e., a setting area  for \u201ccandidate image capture time\u201d, a setting area  for \u201cimportance of candidate image\u201d, and a setting area  for \u201csample image\u201d.","The setting area  is the area for setting the candidate image capture control information . In this area, a candidate image capture time is set in the unit of second in an input field , and a candidate image capture interval is set in the unit of second in an input field .","The setting area  is the area for setting the importance information of the image synthesis control information . In this area, the maximum coincident importance is set in an input field , the minimum coincident importance is set in an input field , and the other importance is set in an input field .","The setting area  is the area for setting the sample image of the image synthesis control information . In this area, the sample image capture method is set by selecting one of the items ,  and . Concretely, the method (a) that the sample image is captured from the upload image in the process of the last time can be selected by selecting the item , the method (b) that the sample image is captured from the upload image in the process at the same time on the day before can be selected by selecting the item , and the method (c) that the sample image is captured from the predetermined image file to be designated can be selected by selecting the item file designation item) .","When the item  is selected, an appropriate path of the image file is input. In case of selecting other items, the sample image file name is not set by the user but set using the predetermined path and file name.","The selected sample image is displayed in an area . When the item  is selected, the designated image data itself is displayed in the area .

The user can change the position and size of the comparison area  by dragging the dotted line with a mouse or the like.","Thus, it is possible to set the part which should be emphatically compared. For example, when the part where change appears frequently is known beforehand, such the dragging is effective.","(Process Flow of Embodiment)","The flow of the upload server process in the present embodiment will be explained with reference to .  is a schematic diagram of the upload server process flow, and  is a flow chart showing the process of an image synthesis module .","The operation of an upload server  is started by a schedule management module . Then, a schedule start request  is transmitted to a candidate image capture process control module  at the time designated based on schedule setting set in the schedule management module .","The candidate image capture process control module  which received the schedule start request  transmits plural image capture requests  to an image data capture module  at the candidate image capture interval during the candidate image capture time.","Every time the image data capture module  receives the image capture request , this module  captures image data from a video camera  and then transmits the captured data to the candidate image capture process control module .","When the candidate image capture process control module  receives the candidate image data corresponding to all the image capture requests , this module  transmits all candidate image data  to the image synthesis module .","The image synthesis module  first starts the process in an image estimate submodule ","Then, the image estimate submodule takes out the sample image file name from an image synthesis control information , and reads the content thereof to capture the sample image data (S).","Next, the similarity of each candidate image is calculated (S). In this calculation process, (1) the information representing the comparison area is extracted from the image synthesis control information , and (2) the sum of pixel similarity (or pixel approximation) of all pixels within the comparison area is calculated on the candidate image. At this time, the pixel similarity=ABS{(color data of one pixel in the candidate image)\u2212(color data of the same pixel in the sample image)}. Here, symbol ABS denotes a function to return the absolute value of argument.","The sum of the entire pixel similarity obtained in the above operations (1) and (2) is considered to be \u201csimilarity\u201d. In this case, the similarity represents that, as its value becomes close to \u201c0\u201d, the similarity becomes high. Of course, the calculation of the similarity is not limited to this.","When the similarity of all the candidate images is calculated, the candidate image of which similarity is highest is taken out, and the setting value of the minimum coincident importance is allocated to this image (S).","Further, the setting value of the maximum coincident importance is allocated to the candidate image of which similarity is lowest (S).","The other importance is allocated to the remaining candidate images (S).","When the importance allocation ends, each candidate image is synthesized in the image synthesis submodule , whereby the upload image is created (S).","In the upload image creation, (1) in each pixel of each candidate image, a weighted pixel value is calculated according to an expression (weighted pixel value)=(color data of pixel)\u00d7(importance of candidate image), and (2) the sum of the weighted pixel values of all the candidate images is calculated for each pixel.","When the upload image creation ends, a compression process in the jpeg format or the like is performed, and then an upload request  is transmitted to an image data transfer module . In a case where the created upload image can be reused as the sample image, the file is stored in the hard disk or the like, and its path and file name are written at the sample image file name in the image synthesis control information .","The image data transfer module  which received the upload request  transmits the upload image to an Web server  with the file transfer protocol such as the ftp protocol or the like.","In the present embodiment, although the similarity to the predetermined image is used as the estimate standard, this standard is not limited to the similarity. Namely, the data (e.g., lightness information of obtained plural images) which can be determined for each image can be used as the estimate standard. In other words, the estimate standard can be appropriately determined according to what standard the image to be uploaded is selected on.","As described above, according to the present embodiment, it is possible to generate and upload the image data having a desirable feature. Especially, in the present embodiment, since the desirable feature is set based on the similarity between the sample image and the candidate image, the setting item itself is very simple. For example, in the case where the minimum coincident importance is set to \u201c1.0\u201d and the other importance is set to \u201c0.0\u201d, if the sample image is set to \u201cupload image on the day before\u201d, it is possible to upload the different image data every day.","In this case, it can be said that it is possible to select the image rather than to synthesize it.","Further, when the same value is set to all the importance, it is possible to upload the image data which is obtained by averaging all the candidate images.","Namely, it is possible to freely select what kind of image should be uploaded, in accordance with the setting of importance.

It should be noted that the order is not limited to the order of index number, i.e., it is possible to display the images in the order of photographing time.","Next, an operation procedure will be explained with reference to . First, the process starts in a step S to transmit the transmission request of the desired image data to the server. In a step S, the image corresponding to the request and the relative information being relative to this image and capable of being selected and displayed from the plural languages are read and transmitted to the client by the server. Thus, the client receives these image and relative information from the server. In a step S, a GUI (graphic user interface) on the setting panel is generated and displayed. In a step S, the image file  is downloaded from the server  by the download means  and stored in the image information storage means . In a step S, the relative information list file  is downloaded from the server  by the download means  and stored in the image information storage means . In these steps S, S and S, it is possible to rapidly capture the necessary information from the image information storage means . Next, in a step S, the flow is on standby until next data is input by the user. Then, in a step S, it is judged whether or not the reproduction button within the image reproduction control area  is depressed. If the button is depressed, the flow advances to a step S, while if the button is not depressed, the flow advances to a step S. In the step S, a thread for sequentially displaying the images is generated, and the process starts. The operation procedure of the thread will be explained later. Then, the flow returns to the step S. In the step S, it is judged whether or not the stop button within the image reproduction control area  is depressed. If the button is depressed, the flow advances to a step S, while if the button is not depressed, the flow advances to a step S. In the step S, the thread for sequentially displaying the images is stopped, and the flow then returns to the step S. In the step S, it is judged whether or not there is the user's input to the display information setting area . If there is the input, the flow advances to a step S, while if there is no input, the flow advances to a step S. In the step S, the state of the GUI is changed according to the user's input. For example, when the check box to set whether or not the photographing date and time should be displayed is set to be OFF, such a GUI component is set to be invisible. Then, the flow advances to a step S. In the step S, the language which is being selected is discriminated, the information of this language is stored, and the display is changed to the display of the language selected by referring to the relative information list file . Then, the flow returns to the step S. In the step S, it is judged whether or not there is the user's input to the speed variable slider in the image reproduction control area . If there is the input to the slider, the sleep value representing the time up to a next image is stored according to the user's input, and the flow returns to the step S, while if there is no input to the slider, the flow advances to a step S. In the step S, it is judged whether or not the program end request is input from the user. If the program end request is input, the flow advances to a step S to end the process, while if the program end request is not input, the flow returns to the step S.","Next, the operation procedure of the thread will be explained with reference to . The thread is generated in the step S, and the process starts. Execution of the thread starts in a step S. In a step S, \u201cIndex\u201d which is the variable for holding that the information concerning the image how many is to be proposed is initialized to \u201c0\u201d. In a step S, the Index-th image is captured. The content of this image has been stored in the image information storage means  in the step S. In a step S, the Index-th image information (the camera direction etc.) is captured. The captured content which is the content of the relative information list file  is concretely shown in . This content has been stored in the image information storage means  in the step S. In a step S, the image captured in the step S is displayed on the image display means , and the information captured in the step S is displayed on the photographing date and time display area , the camera information display area , and the like. At this time, the appropriate information is displayed by referring to the language information set in the step S. For example, when the Japanese language is being selected, the Japanese language information is captured from the image information storage means  and then displayed on the GUI component. In a step S, \u201cIndex\u201d is increased by one. In a step S, the execution of the thread is temporarily stopped according to the sleep value set in a step S. Then, the flow returns to the step S. Such the execution of the thread continues until the thread is stopped in the step S. By the above operation, the plural images in the server are displayed together with the corresponding image information. Then, the proposed image information and language are changed according to the user's setting.","In the present invention, it is possible to accumulate the image without overwriting and refer to the accumulated image with the simple GUI such as a VCR. Further, since the information representing the camera direction and the like is also recorded, it is possible to provide such the information on the client side. Further, since the display of the information necessary for the user can be set, it is possible to rapidly refer to only the necessary information. Further, since the language information can be changed, it is possible to avoid an inconvenient state that, when users of various countries access, some of them can not understand meaning of the image. Further, since the information for the plural language is transmitted to the client, the client need not access the server whenever he changes the language, whereby it is possible to change the language smoothly.","The present invention is applicable to a system structured by plural equipments (e.g., a host computer, an interface device, a reader, a printer, etc.) or to an apparatus structured by one equipment (e.g., a copying machine, or a fax machine).","Further, it is needless to say that the present invention includes a case where program codes of software to realize the functions of the above embodiments are supplied to a computer in an apparatus or a system connected to various devices to operate them to realize the above functions, and the computer (or CPU or MPU) in this system or apparatus reads and executes the supplied program codes.","In this case, the software program codes themselves realize the functions of the above embodiments, whereby the program codes themselves and the means for supplying these program codes to the computer (e.g., a storage medium storing such the program codes) constitute the present invention.","As the recording medium recording the program codes, for example, it is possible to use a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magnetooptical disk, a CD-ROM, a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory card, a ROM, or the like.","Further, it is needless to say that the present invention includes not only the case where the functions of the above embodiments can be realized by executing the supplied program codes, but also a case where the functions of the above embodiments are realized by an OS (operating system) on the computer or in cooperation with other application software or the like.","Further, it is needless to say that the present invention further includes a case where the supplied program codes are once stored in a memory provided in a function expansion board inserted in the computer or a function expansion unit connected to the computer, and a CPU or the like provided in the function expansion board or the function expansion unit executes all the actual process or a part thereof according to the instructions of these program codes, thereby realizing the functions of the above embodiments.","Although the present invention has been explained by using the several preferred embodiments, the present invention is not limited to them.
