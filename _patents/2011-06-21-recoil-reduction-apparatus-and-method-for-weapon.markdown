{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/607,164 entitled \u201cApparatus and Method for Gun Recoil Mitigation,\u201d both of which have the same assignee.","The invention relates in general to weapons and in particular to recoil reduction of weapons.","Traditional weapons may include an operating group, which may include a bolt carrier and its subcomponents, that recoils towards the user in order to cycle the weapon. Typically, the operating group may impact a surface at the end of its stroke. The impact may cause a \u201ckick\u201d that may be felt by the user. In some instances, many rounds of ammunition may be fired by an individual in a short period of time. The kick of the weapon may be painful or harmful to the user, particularly when using semi-automatic or automatic weapons. Many devices and methods have been used to minimize or eliminate kick. Many of these devices may not be desirable because they may add too much weight to the weapon or may be too costly.","There is a long-felt and unsolved need for an effective recoil reduction apparatus that adds little or no weight to a weapon and is relatively inexpensive. This need is particularly great for automatic and semi-automatic weapons","It is an object of the invention to provide a weapon which produces little or no kick to the user.","One aspect of the invention is a weapon that may include a housing and a receiver translatably disposed in the housing. A barrel may have one end fixed to the receiver. The barrel may be translatable with respect to the housing. A spring stop may be fixed to the barrel forward of the housing. A spring may be disposed between the spring stop and a front of the housing.","An operating group may be translatably disposed in the receiver. A gear rack may be fixed to the operating group. A longitudinal member may have one end fixed to the operating group. A counter-mass may have a second gear rack and an opening. Another end of the longitudinal member may be translatable through the opening in the counter-mass. A second spring may be disposed around the longitudinal member. One end of the second spring may bear against the operating group and another end of the second spring may bear against the counter-mass. A pinion gear may be rotatably fixed to the receiver and operable to mesh with the gear rack and the second gear rack.","The weapon may include a butt stock fixed to the housing. The butt stock may include an open area for reciprocation of the counter-mass and longitudinal member. An ammunition magazine may be removably disposed in the housing.","The operating group may include an impact surface and the counter-mass may include a second impact surface. The impact surface and the second impact surface may be operable to contact each other after firing the weapon.","Another aspect of the invention is a method of mitigating recoil in a weapon having an operating group and a counter-mass. The method may include moving the counter-mass in a direction substantially opposite a direction of movement of the operating group. The counter-mass and the operating group may be substantially coaxial. The method may include impacting the counter-mass and the operating group. The counter-mass and the operating group may move at a same speed or may move at different speeds. The operating group and the counter-mass may have substantially a same mass or may have substantially different masses.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A recoil reduction apparatus may use a rack and pinion and counter-mass system to partially or completely cancel out the rearward impulse of a weapon's operating group. The operating group of the weapon may impact a forward-moving counterweight. This impact may diminish or eliminate the \u201ckick\u201d produced by the operating group. Peak overall recoil forces may be reduced by coupling the recoil reduction apparatus to a recoil-translating barrel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A","b":["1","1","10","10","10","12","14","16","18","20","22","30","18"]},"A barrel  may have one end fixed to receiver  at area  ().

A longitudinal member  may have one end  () fixed to operating group . A counter-mass  may have a gear rack  and an opening .

One end  of spring  may bear against operating group  and another end  of spring  may bear against counter-mass . A pinion gear  may be rotatably fixed to receiver . Pinion gear  may be operable to mesh with gear racks , .","As seen in , butt stock  may include an open area  therein for reciprocation of counter-mass  and longitudinal member . Operating group  may include an impact surface  and counter-mass  may include an impact surface . Impact surfaces ,  may contact each other after firing weapon .","Prior to firing, the components of weapon  may be in the position shown in , C and D. Compression spring  may separate operating group  and counter-mass . Operating group , longitudinal member , compression spring , and counter-mass  may be substantially coaxial.","Upon firing, the impulse of cartridge  may recoil operating group  and operating group gear rack  rearward, as shown in . Operating group gear rack  may cause rotation of pinion gear  which may, in turn, cause forward translation of counter-mass gear rack  and counter-mass . Both operating group  and counter-mass  may compress compression spring . Operating group  and counter-mass  may impact at respective impact surfaces , . Impact between operating group  and counter-mass  may partially or completely cancel the rearward impulse of operating group . After impact between operating group  and counter-mass , compression spring  may cause operating group  and counter-mass  to return to their pre-firing configuration shown in , C, and D.","After firing and prior to impact of impact surfaces , , velocities of operating group  and counter-mass  may have substantially the same absolute value and opposite directions. In addition, if the mass of operating group  and the mass of counter-mass  are substantially the same, then a large amount of the recoil force may be dissipated and not felt by the user of the weapon . When the mass of counter-mass  is less than the mass of operating group , and, assuming equal and opposite velocities, then, less recoil force may be dissipated in weapon .","Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. Thus, if the velocities of operating group  and counter-mass  are opposite, but not equal, the amount of recoil dissipated in weapon  may be varied. In some embodiments of weapon , the gear ratios between pinion  and gear racks ,  may be varied to vary the velocities of operating group  and counter-mass . Thus, the amount of recoil dissipated in weapon  may be varied by varying the masses and velocities of operating group  and counter-mass .","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A","b":["1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIGS. 1A-C"],"b":["2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2C"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
