Field of Invention","The present invention generally relates to a novel system and method for collecting consumer-product related information and transmitting and delivering the same along the consumer-product supply and demand chain using the National Information Infrastructure (e.g. the Internet), and more particularly to a novel system and method for delivering consumer product related information to consumers within retail environments using Internet-based information servers and sales agents.","2. Brief Description of the Prior Art","Dissemination of consumer-product information between manufacturers and their retail trading partners must be accurate and timely. The traditional methods of phone calls and faxes are time consuming and resource intensive. An electronic Universal Product Code (UPC) Catalog (i.e. database system), accessible 24 hours a day, is a solution. In 1988, QuickResponse Services (QRS), Inc. Of Richmond, Calif., introduced the first independent product information database, using the retail industry standard UPC numbering system. Today the QRSolutions\u2122 Catalog contains information on over 52 million products from over 1500 manufacturers. The QRSolutions Catalog is a Windows-based application providing a critical information flow link between the retailers and the manufacturers along the supply and demand chain.","After assigning a UPC number to each item, the manufacturer organizes and sends the data, via an electronic data interchange (i.e. EDI) transmission, or a tape, to QRS, Inc. to be loaded into the UPC Catalog database. Changes to the data can be made on a daily basis. Retailers with access to a manufacturer's data can view and download the data once it has been added or updated. Automatic update capabilities ensure the most recent UPC data will be in the EDI mailbox of each retailer customer quickly.","The effect of a centralized database such as QRS's UPC Catalog improves the flow of merchandise from the manufacturer to the retailer's selling floor and ultimately to the consumer. With the UPC Catalog, accurate, up-to-date product information is available when the retailer needs it, eliminating weeks from the order cycle time.","In addition to the electronic UPC-based product information subsystem (i.e. UPC Catalog) described above, a number of other information subsystems have been developed for the purpose of providing solutions to problems relating to electronic commerce (EC) merchandising and logistics within the global supply chain. Such ancillary information subsystems include, for example: Sales and Analysis and Forecasting Subsystems for producing and providing retailers with information about what products consumers are buying; Collaborative Replenishment Subsystems for determining what products retailer can be buying in order to satisfy consumer demand at any given point of time; and Transportation and Logistics Information Subsystems for producing and providing retailers with information about when products purchased by them (at wholesale) will be delivered to the their stores. Typically, such information subsystems are connected to various value added information networks in order to efficiently offer such information services to retailers on a global basis.","While the above-described information systems collectively cooperate to optimize the process of moving raw materials into finished products and into the hands of consumers, such information systems simply fail to address the information needs of the consumers of retail products who either require or desire product-related information prior to as well as after the purchase of consumer-products.","Presently, an enormous amount of time, money and effort is being expended by companies in order to advertise and sell their products and services, and after product purchase has taken place, to provide product related information, product warranty service and the like. For decades, various types of media have been used to realize such fundamental business functions.","In recent times, there has have been a number of significant developments in connection with the global information network called the \u201cInternet\u201d, which has greatly influenced many companies to create multi-media Internet Websites in order to advertise, sell and maintain their products and services. Examples of such developments include, for example: the World Wide Web (WWW) based on the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) by Tim Berners-Lee, et al.; easy to use GUI-based Internet navigation tools, such as the Netscape\u00ae browser from Netscape Communications, Inc., the Internet Explorer\u2122 browser from MicroSoft Corporation and the Mosaic\u2122 browser from Spyglass Corporation; and the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) by Mark Pecse. Such developments in recent times have made it very easy for businesses to create 2-D Hypermedia-based Home Pages and 3-D VR Worlds (i.e. 3-D Websites) for the purpose of projecting a desired \u201ccorporate image\u201d and providing a backdrop for financial investment solicitation as well as product advertising, sales and maintenance operations.","Presently, a person desiring to acquire information about any particular product has a number of available search options. In particular, he or she may attempt to directly contact the manufacturer, wholesaler or reseller by telephone, US mail, e-mail, or through the company's World Wide Website (WWW), if they have one. In the event one decides to acquire product information through the seller's WWW site, he or she must first determine the location of its WWW site (i.e. Internet address) which oftentimes can involve using Internet Search engines such as Yahoo\u00ae, AltaVista\u2122, WebCrawler\u2122, Lycos\u2122, Excite\u2122, or the like. This can be a very time consuming process and sometimes leads to a dead end. Once the Internet address is obtained, one must then review the home page of the company's Website in order to find where, if at all, information about a particular product resides on the Website. This search process can be both time consuming and expensive (in terms of Internet time) and may not turn up desired information on the product of interest.","In some instances, product brochures bear a preprinted Internet address designed to direct or point prospective customers to a particular Website where more detailed product information can be found. A recent example of this \u201cpreprinted Web Address\u201d pointing technique is the 1996 product brochure published by the Sony Corporation for its Sony\u00ae PCV-70 Personal Computer, which refers prospective customers to the Sony Web Address \u201chttp:\/\/www.sony.com\/pc\u201d. While this approach provides a direct way of finding product related information on the Internet, it is not without its shortcomings and drawbacks.","In particular, when a company improves, changes or modifies an existing Website which publishes product and\/or service advertisements and related information, it is difficult (if not impossible) not to change the Internet locations (e.g. Web addresses) at which such product and\/or service advertisements and related information appear. Whenever a company decides or is forced to change any of its advertising, marketing and\/or public relations firms, there is a substantial likelihood that new Websites will be created and launched for particular products and services, and that the Web addresses of such new Websites will no longer correspond with the Web addresses on preprinted product brochures currently in circulation at the time. This can result in pointing a consumer to erroneous or vacant Websites, that present either old or otherwise outdated product and\/or service information, possibly adversely influencing the consumer's purchasing decision.","Moreover, when a company launches a new Website as part of a new advertising and marketing campaign for a particular product, any preprinted advertising or marketing material relating to such products will not reflect the new Website addresses which the campaign is attempting to get consumers to visit. This fact about preprinted advertising media renders it difficult to unify new and old advertising media currently in circulation into an advertising and marketing campaign having a coherent theme. In short, the inherently static nature of the \u201cpreprinted Web address\u201d pointing technique described above is wholly incapable of adjusting to the dynamic needs of advertising, marketing and public relations firms alike.","In addition to the above-described techniques, I-World by Mecklermedia has recently launched a commercial product finding a database on the Internet called \u201cInternet Shopper\u201d. Notably, the \u201cInternet Shopper\u201d database is organized by specific types of product categories covering computer and telecommunication related technologies. While this product information finding service may be of help to those looking to buy computer or communication equipment, it fails to provide an easy way to find information on previously purchased products, or on products outside of the field of communication or computer technology. Consequently, the value of this prior art technique is limited to those considering the purchase of products catalogued within the taxonomy of the \u201cInternet Shopper\u201d directory.","In view of the inherent limitations of I-World's \u201cInternet Shopper\u201d and other product finding directories on the Internet, such as \u201cNetBuyer\u201d by Computer Shopper (at \u201chttp:\/\/www.netbuyer.com\u201d), the National Information Infrastructure Testbed (NIIT) organization has recently formed a \u201cconfidential committee of NIIT members\u201d under the title \u201cUniversal Product and Service Code Project\u201d. The stated problem addressed by this Project is how to locate specific goods and services on the Internet, and compare prices and other critical market information. As publicized in a NIIT Project Abstract, the \u201cUniversal Product and Service Code Project seeks to make it easier to electronically locate goods and services on the Internet using universal product and services identifiers and locators. As stated in the Project Abstract, the \u201cNIIT believes that changing the way in which Internet information is organized is fundamental to solving this problem. In the Universal Product and Service Code Project, NIIT members are currently exploring how coding structures can help organize information about products accessible using the Internet. NIT's goal is to inform the development of formalized coding standards that can be used nationally and internationally so that users can locate goods and services through simple searching and browsing methods. In turn, more advanced features, such as comparison shopping, can be added as \u201cintelligent agent\u201d software programs are refined to enable users to search and retrieve products linked to these structures.\u201d","While the NIIT's Universal Product and Service Code Project seeks ways of locating specific goods and services on the Internet, all proposals therefor recommend the development of formalized coding standards and searching and browsing methods which are expensive and difficult to develop and implement on a world-wide basis. Moreover, such sought after methods will be virtually useless to consumers who have already purchased products and now seek product related information on the Internet.","In summary, prior art \u201cdemand chain management\u201d systems have provided: (i) procurement services consisting of UPC Catalogs accessible through the Internet and EDI networks; (ii) inventory management services consisting of replenishment, sales analysis and forecasting services; and (iii) distribution management services consisting of EDI and logistics management services. However, prior art \u201cdemand chain management\u201d systems have failed to address the information needs of the consumers of retail products who either require or desire product-related information prior to as well as after the purchase of consumer-products. Consequently, prior art demand chain management systems operate in an open-loop mode with a \u201cbreak\u201d in information flow cycle, disabling the manufacturers from communicating with the consumers in an efficient manner to satisfy consumer needs.","Thus, it is clear that there is great need in the art for an improved system and method for collecting product related information and transmitting and delivering the same between the manufacturers and retailers of products to the consumers thereof in various environments, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel method and apparatus for collecting product-related information and transmitting and delivering the same between the manufacturers and retailers of products to the consumers thereof in retail shopping environments as well as at home, work and on the road, while overcoming the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an apparatus in the form of a novel consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system with an Internet-based product information database subsystem which, for each commercially available consumer-product, stores a number of information elements including: the name of the manufacturer; the Universal Product Code (UPC) assigned to the product by the manufacturer; one or more URLs specifying the location of information resources (e.g. Web-pages) on the Internet relating to the UPC-labeled consumer-product; and the like.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, in which the URLs stored in the Internet-based product information database are categorically arranged and displayed according to specific types of product information (e.g., product specifications and operation manuals; product wholesalers and retailers; product advertisements and promotions; product endorsements; product updates and reviews; product warranty\/servicing; related or complementary products; product incentives including rebates, discounts and\/or coupons; etc.) that relate to the kind of information required, desired or otherwise sought by consumers, wholesalers, retailers and\/or trading partners; product prices at which the products are being offered for sale by a particular retailer; and the like.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, wherein the information maintained within the Internet-based product information database management subsystem provides a manufacturer defined consumer-product directory that can be used by various persons along the retail supply and demand chain.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, wherein the manufacturers of consumer-products are linked to the retailers thereof in the middle of the supply and demand chain by allowing either trading partner access to consumer-product information from the Internet-based product information database virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, wherein consumer-product manufacturers, their advertisers, distributors and retailers are linked to the consumers of such products at the end of the supply and demand chain, by allowing such parties access to consumer-product information from the Internet-based product information database subsystem virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system and method of using the same, which will accelerate the acceptance of electronic commerce on the Internet and the development of the electronic marketplace, which can be used by consumers and small and large businesses

Internet (e.g. the home page of the manufacturer's Website) related to such products.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system and method, wherein a Web-based document transport subsystem is provided for use by manufacturers as well as their advertisers and agents in registering the UPNs (e.g. UPC numbers) of their products and the URLs of the information resources related to such products.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system with an number of different modes of operation, namely: a Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode,

interconnecting the input and output ports of the above-identified subsystems through the infrastructure of the Internet and various value-added EDI networks of global extent. Notably, unlike prior art supply chain management systems, the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of the present invention embraces the manufacturers, retailers, and consumers of UPC-encoded products, and not simply the manufacturers and retailers thereof. As will become apparent hereinafter, this important feature of the present invention allows manufacturers and retailers to deliver valuable product related information to the consumers of their products, thereby increasing consumer purchases, consumer satisfaction and consumer loyalty. Prior art supply chain management systems simply have no way or means of providing such information services to the consumers of UPC-encoded products along the consumer-product supply and demand chain.","As shown in  and -, the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of  is realized as an arrangement of system components, namely: a central UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  for storing and serving various types of consumer-product information to retailers, manufacturers and consumers alike (e.g., the name of the product's manufacturer; the Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN) assigned to the product by the manufacturer; one or more URLs specifying the location of information resources on the Internet at which particular kinds of information relating to the consumer-product can be found; merchandise classification; style number; trade name; information specifying the size, color and other relevant characteristics of the consumer-product, where applicable; ordering criteria; availability and booking dates, etc.); a globally-based (packet-switched) digital telecommunications network (such as the Internet)  having an infrastructure including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Network Service Providers (NSPs), routers, telecommunication lines, channels, etc., for supporting packet-switched type digital data telecommunications using the TCP\/IP networking protocol well known in the art; one or more Internet Product Finding Directory (IPD) Servers, each indicated by reference numeral  and being connected to the Internet at strategically different locations via the Internet infrastructure  and data-synchronized with each other in order that each such Server maintains mirrored a relational-type database structure as represented in ; a plurality of Internet Product-Information (IPI) Servers, each indicated by reference numeral  and being connected to the Internet via the Internet infrastructure; a plurality of User (or Client) Computers, each indicated by reference numeral , being connected to the Internet via the Internet infrastructure and available to consumers (C, C, C, . . . , Ci); one or more data communication (i.e. EDI) networks , comprising data collection nodes  and communication links , operably connected to the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , each Client Computer  available to a Manufacturer (M, M, M, . . , Mj) and Retailer (R, R, R, . . , Rk) within the retail supply and demand chain; a Web-based Document Server  connected to at least one of the IPD Servers  and the Internet infrastructure, for transferring documents and messages to remote Client Computer Systems during the registration of manufacturers and consumer products with the system hereof and periodically updating product-related information with the IPD Servers  in an automatic manner; and a Web-based Document Administration Computer  connected to the Web-based Document Server  by way of a TCP\/IP connection , for administrating the registration of manufacturers and products with the system, initiating the transfer of consumer product related information (e.g. menu of URLs) between the remote Client Computer Systems and Web-Based Document Server , transferring such information to the IPD Servers , and maintaining local records of such information transfers and the like. As will become apparent hereinafter, Web-based Document Server  and Web-based Document Administration Computer  provide a subsystem for (i) managing the process of registering qualified manufacturers and their consumer products and related Web pages (e.g. UPC numbers and URLs), and (ii) updating the product-related information with the IPD Servers  in an automatic manner to ensure accurate links between UPNs and URLs within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem. The subsystem comprising the Web-based Document Server  and Web-based Document Administration Computer  shall be referred to as the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem of the consumer product information finding and delivery subsystem  and indicated by reference numeral  throughout the figure drawings hereof.","Preferably, the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  and at least one of the IPD Servers  are located at a secured information storage\/processing center , along with a multiprocessor (or mainframe) computer system, information servers, routers, data communication lines, disk storage devices (e.g. RAIDs), tape drives and tape-library system, uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), and other peripheral technology to provide on-line, batch and back-up operations. However, the IPI Servers, the Client Computers and the other IPD Servers (if provided for database mirroring purposes), typically will be located throughout the world, as the distribution of manufacturers, retailers and consumers who are encouraged to use the system are scattered across the planet.","In the illustrative embodiment, the Web-based Document Server  is a Windows NT Server running WebDox\u2122 Server software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif. The Windows NT Server can be realized using a suitable computer system having a Pentium\u00ae or higher CPU, 64 MB of RAM or higher, running (i) Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or higher Operating System software from Microsoft Corporation, (ii) Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 or higher from Microsoft Corporation, and (iii) Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or higher software from Microsoft Corporation.

An exemplary display screen  produced by such a GUI-based web browser program is set forth in FIG. B. Alternatively, the URL of the home page of the IPI Website can be recorded as a browser \u201cbookmark\u201d for easy recall and access through a conventional GUI-based Internet browser. Once at the home page of the IPI Web-site, an Internet user can find product-related information on the Internet in essentially the same way as when using the web browser program of FIG. B. As shown, the on-screen radio button  functions as an \u201cIPI Website Find\u201d Button (or Consumer Product Information Button) for instantly connecting the client subsystem to a particular IPI Website (i.e. hosted on each mirrored IPD Server) and especially adapted for carrying out the IPI finding and serving method of the present invention. In general, each IPI Website can be sponsored by a retail store subscribing to the consumer product information service hereof, or by one or manufacturers and\/or service providers. The URL for the home page of any particular IPI Website can be selected with marketing considerations in mind, for example, \u201chttp:\/\/www.ipf.com\u201d or \u201chttp:\/\/www.upcrequest.com\u201d similar in form with the URLs of other information search-engines and directories currently available on the Internet. Upon selecting the IPI Website Find Button  (e.g. by a clicking of the mouse thereon shown in FIGS. B and C), the user is automatically connected to the home-page of the IPI Website (hosted on each mirrored IPD Server) which, as shown in , supports a Netscape-style \u201cframework\u201d, within which web-pages accessed through the IPI Website are displayed. An excellent tutorial on \u201cframing\u201d entitled \u201cThe Netscape Frames Tutorial\u2122 (2nd edition)\u201d by Charlton D. Rose set forth at the URL: \u201chttp:\/\/www.newbie.net\/frames\/\u201d, last visited by Applicant on Mar. 26, 1997.","As shown in , the IPI Web-site of the illustrative embodiment has a framework characterized by three-display fields, namely: a sponsor frame A; a control frame B; and an information display frame C for displaying web pages. In alternative embodiments, there many be more or fewer display frames than that shown in FIG. C. Each frame acts as a separate display screen where variables such as web-pages, scrolling, page colors, etc., are independently controllable. In practice, it is suggested that the physical layout of the Netscapestyle browser \u201cframework\u201d be designed to simultaneously accommodate the needs of the consumers using the particular Client Subsystems of the present invention, as well as the needs of the retailers who typically will host client subsystems hereof either (1) physically within their stores, and\/or (2) electronically on their WWW sites using Web browser framing techniques as well.","In the case of Client Subsystems physically hosted (i.e. located) within the environment of retail stores, a three-field browser framework as shown in  will be highly effective in meeting the needs of the retailer, consumer, and business organization delivering the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention (hereinafter the \u201cIPI Provider\u201d). As shown in , the first (top-most) display field, the sponsor frame A, can be used to display to the consumer, a Web page (e.g. HTML-encoded document) containing a message that the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is being delivered to the consumer by the IPI Provider under, for example, the sponsorship of either: (1) the hosting retailer; (2) one or more advertisers posting advertising \u201cbanners\u201d in the display frame A; or (3) the consumer him or her self by paying a subscription fee or the like. Understandably, the method of sponsorship employed will vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present invention. An exemplary message for this display screen might read, for example, as follows:\n\n","The height of the sponsor frame A need only be a small fraction of the consumer's display screen (e.g. 3\/4 inches) to convey this message to the consumers during use of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention within the retailer's real (or virtual) shopping environment.","As shown in , the second (left-most) display field, the control frame B, is used to display a HTML-encoded document containing a GUI-based \u201ccontrol panel\u201d  for the consumer product information finding and serving subsystem of the present invention. In the illustrative embodiment, this control panel  includes five Check Box type buttons, namely: a first Check Box type button A which, when selected, automatically activates the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of the subsystem; a second Check Box type button B which, when selected, automatically activates the Manufacturer Website Search Mode of the subsystem; a third Check Box type button C which, when selected, automatically activates the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of the subsystem; a fourth Check Box type button D which, when selected, automatically activates the Trademark-Directed Search Mode; and a fifth Check Box type button F which, when selected, automatically activates the Product-Description Directed Search Mode of operation of the subsystem.

The advantage of this client computer subsystem is that enables a retails sales clerk check out customer purchases in a conventional manner, and conveniently access the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem when check-out business is relatively slow, to answer any questions that consumers may have regarding a particular product in the retail store. This system will be ideal in retail environments having a high level of customer service and large retail service staff. In such instances, the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof empowers retail sales clerks, at the POS counters as well as customer service counters, by enabling them to quickly access any item of product related information linked to products in their stores by manufacturers and their agents.","In alternative embodiments, any Client Computer  can be realized as a network computer (NC), a Web-TV\u2122 type Internet Terminal, a Newton MessagePad\u00ae PDA, or any other device providing Internet access to the IPI Website (i.e. mirrored IPD Servers) of the present invention. Notably, the same functionalities provided within the Web-based kiosk described above can be embodied with such alternative embodiments of client computer system.","The Database Structure of the IPD Server","In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, each data-synchronized IPD Server  of the preferred embodiment maintains at least two different relational-type databases, namely: a IPI Registrant Database for storing information about manufacturers whose products are registered with the system; and a Non-IPI Registrant Database for storing information about manufacturers whose products are not registered with the system. A schematic representation of the IPI Registrant Database is shown in FIG. A, whereas a schematic representation of the Non-IPI Registrant Database is shown in FIG. B.","As shown in FIG. A, the relational-type IPI Registrant Database maintained by each IPD Server comprises a plurality of labeled information fields for each product \u201cregistered\u201d therewith, namely: an IPN Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Product Number (e.g. twelve-digit UPC Version A number, eight-digit UPC Version E number, thirteen-digit UPC\/EAN number, or twelve-digit UPC Version A number plus five-digit Add-On Code Segment number frequently used in the publishing industry) assigned to the consumer product; a Company Name Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the name of the company making, selling or distributing the corresponding product; a URL Information Field(s) for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Resource Locator (URL) or Universal Resource Locators (URLs) at which information resource(s) of a multimedia type (e.g. containing both graphical and sound information) can be found on the Internet relating to the corresponding consumer product; a Trademark Information Field for storing information (e.g. text and\/or alphanumeric strings) representative of each trademark (or Domain Name) used in connection with the promotion, sale, distribution and\/or use of the corresponding product, and preferably registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or other governmental or quasi-governmental agency (e.g. INTERNIC or Network Solutions, Inc.); a Product Description Information Field for storing information (e.g. text strings) descriptive of the corresponding product; an E-mail Address Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the e-mail address of the corresponding company (e.g. manufacturer) on the Internet; and a Status Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of whether the company (e.g. manufacturer) associated registered product has paid their monthly, quarterly or annual registration fees associated with registration within the IPD Servers of the information finding and serving subsystem hereof. Notably, each information item contained with the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is related or linked.","In general, the URL stored in the URL Information Field specifies the address of an information resource on the Internet (e.g. Web), and thus may point to any one of the following types of information resources: a HTML document or file on the World Wide Web (expressed in the HyperText Markup Language); a single record in a database; the front-end of an Internet program such as Gopher; or the results of a query made using another program. In accordance with convention, the syntactic structure of each URL generally comprises: a Protocol Specifier, such as \u201chttp\u201d, \u201cftp\u201d, \u201cgopher\u201d, \u201cnews\u201d, or \u201cmail to\u201d, and specifies the type of resource that the URL is pointing (i.e. connecting) to; a Host Indicator, represented by double slashes \u201c\/\/\u201d if the URL is requesting information from a Web Server; Server Name comprising a Internet Domain Name (e.g. \u201cwww.\u201d), the address of the Web Server (e.g. \u201cibm.\u201d), and a an designator (e.g. \u201ccorn\u201d, \u201cedu\u201d, \u201cint\u201d, \u201cmil\u201d, \u201cnet\u201d, \u201corg\u201d, etc.) identifying who owns the server or where it is located; a Path Name, such as \u201cProducts\/Computers\/\u201d, indicating a path to the destination information file on the identified Server; and a Resource Name (including file extension, e.g. \u201c.html\u201d), such as \u201captiva.htrnl\u201d, identifying the actual named information file that contains actual information resource specified by the URL.","As used herein as well as in the Claims to Invention, the term \u201cregistered\u201d and the variants thereof shall be understood to mean listed or having an entry within a database. Such listing or entry can be achieved in a variety of ways including, but not limited to: (i) by specific request of the associated company or business; or (ii) by the system administrator without a request and\/or authorization of the corresponding company or business linked to the product.","Notably, each information item contained within the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is automatically provided URLs which are assigned to related products of the registrant which may satisfy the goals or objectives of a particular advertising and\/or marketing campaign or product promotion program of the registrant company. As it may be desired to relate particular products at particular points in time, the relationships therebetween can be dynamically changed within the IPI Registrant Database by a straightforward database updating operation carried out by a system administrator (or manager) who, in theory, can be located virtually anywhere throughout the world. Expectedly, such database updating operations would be carried out using appropriate system access and security procedures well known in the art.","Inasmuch as the UPC data structure is presently employed as a universal product identifier (i.e. a primary data structure) in a majority of industries throughout the world, its twelve-digit numeric string (for UPC Version A) or eight-digit numeric string (for UPC Version E) will be a preferred UPN (in many applications) for purposes of carrying out the principles of the present invention. This twelve (12) digit human-readable number, printed on the bottom of each UPC label (and encoded within the bars and spaces of the UPC label itself), comprises: (i) a six digit manufacturer number assigned to the manufacturer by the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UCC) of Dayton, Ohio, and consisting of a one digit \u201cnumber system\u201d number and a five digit manufacturer code; (ii) a five digit \u201cproduct\u201d number assigned to the product by the manufacturer; and (iii) a one digit modulo check digit (mathematically calculated) and added to each UPC number to check that the code has been read correctly by the bar code symbol reader.","In order to provide the requester greater control over what information is actually displayed on its client subsystem, the URL Information Field of the IPI Database shown in FIG. A contains a number of information subfields. As shown in FIG. A, these information subfields comprise: a Product Advertisement Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to advertising and\/or promotion of the product; a Product Specification (i.e. Description) Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to specifications on the product; a Product Update Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to product updates, recalls, notices, etc; a Product Distributor (e.g. Wholesaler and\/or Resaler) Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to distribution, sale and\/or ordering of the product; a Product Warranty\/Servicing Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to warranty, extended warranty offerings, servicing and maintenance of the product; a Product Incentive Information Field (e.g. rebates, discounts and\/or coupons) for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to rebates, discounts and sales on the product; a Product Review Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to reviews, analysis, testing, inspection and\/or comparison of the product; and Miscellaneous Information Field(s) for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to miscellaneous aspects of the product (e.g., direct product sales on the WWW, product installation\/set-up and operating manuals, company reports (10Ks, annual reports, etc.), and the like. Each URL symbolically linked to a UPC-labeled product registered in the Registered IPI Database is categorized within one or more of these URL categories.","The list of URLs recordable in the IPI Registrant Database for each registered UPC-labeled product is virtually unlimited. Below are just a few examples of how the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof can be used as a virtual sales agent that provides value-added services to consumers, retailers and the like.","For each CD sound recording, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a promotional QuickTime\u00ae video recording or the like on the WWW for reviewing and evaluation by the consumer. The promotional song can be by a commissioned or endorsing artist, as is typically done in conventional advertising programs. The same can be done for video recordings on tape and digital video discs (DVDs). The URL may also provide the consumer with a down-loadable trial version of the product for a limited time period.","For each computer software product, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a demonstration of the solutions that the software product provides, as well as the functions and development tools that it enables. It may also provide the consumer with a down-loadable version of the software product for a time-limited trial period.","For electronic consumer products, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an audio-visual demonstration of the product in various user environments. Also, the URL can contain a URL that points to a Web-based Specification Sheet that can printed out in a retail environment, at home, work or on the road.","For groceries and like articles, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a QuickTime\u00ae video recording or the like of the product, illustrating various cooking recipes and uses to which the product can be put. Also, the URL can contain a URL that points to a Web-based Discount Coupon that can be printed out in the store, at home or work.","For toys, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an audio-visual demonstration of the toy along with promotional endorsements by the various characters used in its advertising campaign.","For clothing, garments, or accessories (e.g. wearing apparel), the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an QuickTime\u00ae video recording or the like of the clothing, garments, and\/or accessories being modeled by stunning fashion models. Ideally, such video recordings, linked to particular articles of wearing apparel by their UPC number, can be used to extend and augment the advertising campaign being carried out in other forms of media (e.g. Television, radio, print, billboards, etc.).","Preferably, the manufacturer, its marketing personnel and advertising agents will actively participate in the creation of the product related information resources, as well as the placement of their URLs into the above-defined (or like) URL categories maintained within the Database of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof. Also, using the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem hereof, manufacturers and\/or their agents can easily link their UPNs (e.g. UPC and\/or EANs) with such URLs and manage the same in a dynamic manner to ensure that product related information on the Internet is accurately linked to the UPNs of the manufacturer's products. Through such active participation, the business objectives of any particular manufacturer or retailer can be promoted by way of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention. In this way, the information requesting consumer requesting information is provided with only the kinds of product-related information which he or she seeks.","As shown in , the Non-IPI Registrant Database maintained by each IPD Server comprises a plurality of labeled information fields for each product that is not currently registered with the IPD Server, namely: an IPSN (i.e. IPN) information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Product Number (e.g. a UPC number from a UPC numbering system, or an EAN numbering system) assigned to the non-registered product; a Company Name Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the name of the company making, selling or distributing the corresponding non-registered product; a Trademark Information Field for storing information (e.g. text and\/or alphanumeric strings) representative of each trademark used in connection the promotion, sale, distribution and\/or use of the corresponding product, and preferably registered with the USPTO or other governmental agency; a Product Description Information Field for storing information (e.g. text strings) descriptive of the corresponding product; and an E-mail Address Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the e-mail address of the corresponding company (e.g. manufacturer) on the Internet; a Status Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of whether the company associated non-registered product has been solicited by the IPD Server, and on what dates registration solicitation has occurred. Notably, each information item contained with the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is related or linked. The information required to construct the Non-IPI Registrant Database shown in  can be readily obtained from a number of commercially or publicly available information sources (e.g., the Universal Code Council, Inc., Dayton, Ohio; QuickResponse Services, Inc. of Richmond. Calif.; General Electric Information Services (GEIS) of Delaware, Md.; etc.","Constructing the IPI Registrant Database within the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem Hereof","The utility of the product finding functionalities of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof depends in large part of the number of consumer-products registered with its RDBMS A, illustrated in FIG. B. In principle, numerous techniques may be employed separately and in combination with each other in order to construct the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases supported by the network of IPD Servers of the present invention. Six such techniques will be detailed below.","According to a first database construction technique, the administrator of the IPI Registrant Database would transmit Product Registration Requests (PRRs) in the form of electronic documents to each and every the manufacturer having been issued, for example, a six digit UPC Manufacturer Identification Number (MIN) by the UCC, Inc. Such electronic documents can be transmitted using conventional MIME protocols such as, for example, STMP. The Product Registration Request document would seek to ascertain from the manufacturers the various information items (including the menu of URLs) identified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A. In response to the Product Registration Request, each solicited manufacturer would send back to the administrator of the IPI Registrant Database (for each of its consumer products) its UPC number and a menu of URLs indicating the location of the information resources identified in the Product Registration Request document. This information can then be used to readily construct the IPI Registrant Database of the illustrative embodiment.","According to a second database construction technique, a global advertising campaign would be launched (over various media) in order to solicit the various information elements identified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A and thus register the products of the manufacturers selling UPC-labeled products. Preferably, such information would be collected by way of an electronic document transfer subsystem set-up to cooperate with the system of the present invention in order to facilitate database construction operations.","According to a third database construction technique, the IPI system itself would continuously solicit consumer product registrations over time in order to collect information from companies responding favorably to the solicitations. While such solicitation efforts can involve the issuance of product registration requests using various types of media, it is preferred that the information collection operations are carried out using electronic document transfer techniques described hereinabove.","According to a fourth database construction technique, a number of commercial on-line Internet search engines, such as Altavista\u2122, Yahoo\u2122, WebCrawler\u2122, Lycos\u2122, Excite\u2122, as well as powerful off-line parallel-processing search engines, would be enlisted to analyze (i.e. mine) information on the World Wide Web in order to collect and link the information elements specified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A.","Once an \u201cinitial\u201d IPI Registrant Database has been constructed using any one or more of the four database construction techniques described hereinabove, manufacturers registered therewith can be periodically contacted using Web-based electronic document (i.e. message) transfer techniques in order to request updating and confirmation of the UPN\/URL listings contained within the database of the IPI subsystem of the present invention.","According to a fifth database and preferred construction technique of the present invention, the Registrant IPI Database of the system would be initially \u201cseeded\u201d with several items of information obtained and related without the assistance of manufacturers of UPC-labeled products. Such information items include: (1) the six digit UPC Manufacturer Identification Numbers encoded in the UPC symbols (and numbers) applied to the products of such UCC-registered manufacturers; and (2) the URLs of the Web home pages of such manufacturers.","The first step of this database construction method involves obtaining the six digit Manufacturer Identification Numbers (MINs) uniquely issued to manufacturers by the Uniform Code Council, Inc. of Dayton, Ohio. Such MINs can be obtained from various commercial sources including GE Information Services, QuickResponse Services, Inc., as well as the UCC. At present, about 180,000 Manufacturer Identification Numbers have been issued to manufacturers by the UCC. A string of six zeros (i.e. 000000) may be added to each one of these 180,000 or so six digit Manufacturer Identification Numbers in order to produce 180,000 or so 12 digit numbers (i.e. hereinafter referred to as \u201cManufacturer's Reference Numbers) for the 180,000 or so manufacturers listed in the IPI Registrant Database under construction. As each such Manufacturer Reference Number has the same length as a UPC number of its manufacturer, this number can be conveniently thought of as the \u201cManufacturer Reference UPC Number\u201d which can be stored in the UPN Information Field of the Database along with the corresponding manufacturers name being stored in the Company Name Information Field.","The second step of the method involves finding the URL of the Web home page of each of the 180,000 manufacturers who have been assigned a Manufacturers Identification Code and are listed in the Database. Such URL information can be found using a number of available techniques: (i) using a commercially available search engine to search the WWW in order to find the URL of the home page of each manufacturer's Website, if it has one, using the name and address thereof obtained during the first step above; or (ii) using a commercially available (INTERNIC-enabled) Domain Name search service that uses the names and addresses of the manufacturers (obtained during the first step above) in order to determine whether a particular manufacturer has a registered domain name on the Internet, and if so, is the domain name being actively used in a URL that points to the home page of the manufacturer's Website. Once obtained, such URLs are then added to the IPI Database, along with the e-mail and\/or other address of the manufacturer symbolically linked thereto (if available).","Having constructed the \u201cseeded\u201d Database, it can then be used to connect the client subsystem of users to the home page of Websites of manufacturers of particular products. Initially, when an Internet user provides the UPC number of a particular product as input to the Input Box of the HTML form displayed in the information display frame of the client subsystem (e.g. when operated in its Manufacturer Website Search Mode), then the IPD Server need only compare the first six digits of the entered UPC number against the first six-digits of the Manufacturer Reference UPC Numbers (i.e. Manufacture Identification Numbers) listed in the \u201cseeded\u201d Database. The corresponding (home-page) URL of the matching manufacturer is returned to the client subsystem Cfor display. In instances of an initially seeded Database, in which only the \u201cManufacturer Reference UPC Numbers\u201d are listed therein, the requesting client subsystems are provided with the URLs of the home pages of the symbolically linked manufacturers. Then as manufacturers begin to register their consumer products with the system (e.g. in response to mass e-mailings, advertisements and\/or marketing and promotional efforts, etc.), the IPD Database will return a menu of \u201chot-linked\u201d URLs, for each registered product, pointing to various types of product-related information resources on the Internet (described above) that can be easily accessed by simply clicking thereon in a conventional manner. Over time, Manufacturer Reference UPC Numbers and the URLs of the \u201chome pages\u201d of such manufacturers will become replaced by the UPC numbers of registered products and the menu of URLs on the WWW symbolically linked thereto by the manufacturers, thereby allowing consumers and users of the system to precisely pinpoint consumer product-related information on the WWW which has been specified by the manufacturer, its marketing department and\/or advertising agency. With manufacturer's and advertiser's participation and feedback, the initially seeded Database described hereinabove will quickly grow into a robust relational database richly filled with the various information items described in FIGS. A and A, including the symbolically linked UPCs and URLs that point to very specific consumer product related information resources (i.e. files) stored within IPI Servers of the system located across the global expanse of the Internet.","According to a sixth database construction technique of the present invention, the Registrant IPI Database of the system would be constructed by allowing each manufacturer to construct a limited or restricted version of the master UPN\/URL Database (i.e. Registrant IPI Database) of the system, wherein only UPC-encoded products of the registered manufacturer and Web-based information items related thereto are entered into the database. As will be described in greater detail herebelow in connection with the third method of Product Registration in the subsystem hereof, the creation of such limited-version UPN\/URL databases can be carried out by providing each registered manufacturer with a computer program that allows its administrators to construct and manage a limited UPN\/URL database in a \u201cturn-key\u201d manner. Also, from its Website, the manufacturer can serve the limited UPN\/URL database over the Internet to consumers. As part of the registration process, each registered manufacturer transmits its limited UPN\/URL database to Web-server  which then integrates all such databases in order to update the master UPN\/URL Database (IPI Registrant Database) of the system.","Overview of Modes of Operation for IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem","In order to enter a primary mode of operation of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem, the consumer or retail sales clerk selects a particular mode activation button (e.g. A, B, C, D or E) displayed in the control frame B of the GUI browser program at the requesting client subsystem . Upon making the selection, the Web browser at the client subsystem  automatically requests a particular HTML-encoded form (typically residing on the IPD Server(s) ). This HTML form corresponds to the selected mode of operation, and is displayed within the information display frame C of the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem. The HTML-encoded form corresponds to the selected mode and is linked to a CGI-script related to the selected mode and possibly to other HTML forms required to carry out the database-access and\/or management process associated therewith. The requesting client subsystem then enters the information requested by the HTML form displayed within the information display frame C of the Web browser's GUI interface. Information entry into the HTML form can be carried out using bar code symbol reading equipment, keyboard or keypad, speech dictation equipment (by Dragon Systems, Inc. of Newton, Massachusetts), and the like.","In general, the particular messages which will be displayed within the HTML forms during any particular mode of operation will depend upon several factors namely: whether the IPI Website is intended for access by bar code driven kiosks (i.e. client subsystems ) as shown, for example, in FIGS. A, A, A, and A located within retail environments; or whether the IPI Website is intended for access by desktop, laptop and palmtop client computer systems  as shown, for example, in FIG. A located at home, in the office or on the road.","For example, if the IPI Website supported by the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof is intended for access by bar code driven kiosks, then the HTTP documents related to the IPI Website will be particularly adapted to facilitate the use of bar code symbol reader at the client subsystem. This way UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN symbols) can be easily entered into the subsystem without manual key-entry operations. In contrast, if the IPI Website supported by the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof is intended for access by client subsystems not having bar code symbol readers (e.g. Web-enabled computer systems at home, in the office or on the road), then the HTTP documents related to the IPI Website will be particularly adapted to facilitate the use of data-entry display screens at the client subsystem. This way, UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN symbols) can be easily entered into the subsystem using bar code symbol scanners avoiding manual key-entry operations. In the illustrative embodiment, bar code-code driven and manual data-entry IPI Websites are served from a \u201cframed\u201d GUI interface, in which the control strip B has five (5) Check Boxes A through E described above which enables the consumer, retail sales\/service personnel as well as manufacturers to select the particular mode of operation that suits his or her consumer product information needs at any particular instance in time.","Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode Of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem C, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.  provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in , when selected from the user-interface of an IPI Website, the first Check Box type button A automatically activates the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s)  based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box. As indicated at Block B in , this causes a HTML-encoded document residing on the IPD Server(s)  to be served from the HTTP Server thereof to requesting client subsystem for display on the information display frame C thereof. The HTML document of the illustrative embodiment displays several types of information relevant to the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode, namely: eligibility requirements (i.e. qualifications) for a manufacturer to register with the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem; optional ways of registering consumer products and product-related information with the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem hereof ; ways of acquiring computer software necessary for managing consumer product-related information (e.g. UPNs, URLs, trademarks and product descriptors) on a particular computing platform using EDI techniques supported by the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem ; etc; and one or more Check Boxes embodying links (i.e. anchors) to HTML documents, CGI scripts and the like designed to facilitate this mode of operation. Notably, at least one of these HTML documents will be located on the Web Document Server  of the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem , providing manufacturers (and\/or their designated information-managers and agents) with a point of entry into the manufacturer\/product registration process hereof. As indicated at Block C in , the manufacturer and or its agent follow the instructions displayed on the HTML document, linking to the Web Document Server  of the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem  and filling out the various HTML forms transmitted to the requesting client subsystem, downloading Web-based EDI software for UPN\/URL management; and the like. While carrying out registration of manufacturers with the subsystem is relatively straightforward, there are a number of different ways of carrying out the Product Registration Mode of the subsystem. These alternative techniques will be described below.","The first method illustrated in  involves by carrying out FTP between a client subsystem of the registering manufacturer (or its agent) Mand an IPD Server in order to update the IPI Registrant Database associated therewith. This can be carried out by the manufacturer's officer or agent surfing to the IPI Website, selecting the \u201cProduct Registration Mode\u201d from the control strip, and then following the instructions displayed on the various screens of the Website in this mode. When using the first method, product UPCs, URLs and other information elements can be formatted within suitable Product Registration Forms and transmitted by FTP from the client subsystem or Database Server of a registering manufacturer to the IPD Server  so that the IPI Registrant Database thereof can be updated accordingly. The first method will be desirable typically when registering a few consumer-products.","The second method illustrated in , involves first carrying out EDI between a client subsystem of the registering manufacturer (or its agent) and the UPN\/URL Database Subsystem , and then carrying out FTP or SMTP between the client subsystem and an IPD Server in order to update the IPI Registrant Database maintained therein. The second method will be desirable when a manufacturer needs or desires to register a large number of consumer-products. The details of these information transmission methods will be described below.","When using the second method, conventional EDI protocols can be used to transmit product UPCs, URLs and other information elements from client subsystems or Database Servers of manufacturers to the UPN\/URL Database Subsystem  of the present invention. FTP can be used to transmit UPCs and URLs from the UPN\/URL Database Subsystem to each IPD Server in the system so that the IPI Registrant Database thereof can be updated accordingly. Once registered with the system using either of these methods in the Product Registration Mode, such consumer-products can be easily found on the Internet by anyone wishing to use the product finding techniques of the present invention.","The third method involves by carrying out electronic document interchange over the Internet between the WebDox Remote\u2122 Computer System  and the WebDox\u2122 Server  of the system of the present invention, and communication between the WebDox\u2122 Server  and the WebDox\u2122 Admin computer system  of the system hereof. The various steps involved in this embodiment of the consumer product registration process will be described in detail below.","When the manufacturer selects the \u201cProduct Registration Mode\u201d of the system, a Manufacturer Registration Form is automatically downloaded from the WebDox\u2122 Server  to the Manufacturer's client computer system  (i.e. the WebDox Remote\u2122 Computer System). At the end of the downloading process, a Manufacturer Registration Form is presented (i.e. displayed) and the manufacturer then enters some requested identification information (e.g. Manufacturer's Company Name, Address, Name of CEO and President, phone number, 6-digit Manufacturer Identification Number assigned by the UCC, etc.) and presses the \u201cSend\u201d button on the Manufacturer Registration Form. The form is then transmitted immediately via the Internet and received by the WebDox\u2122 Server . At the WebDox\u2122 Server , an automated process takes the information in the Manufacturer Registration Form and registers the Manufacturer with the system.","Upon registering the manufacturer with the system, the manufacturer is asked to select which version of \u201ccustomized\u201d WebDox Remote\u2122 software (i.e. the UPN\/URL Registration Application) the manufacturer would like downloaded to its client computer system  (e.g. WebDox Remote with UPN\/URL Database and CGI for MacOS WebServer, WebDox Remote with UPN\/URL Database and CGI for UNIX Web Server, or WebDox Remote with UPN\/URL Database and CGI for NT Web Server). Once the manufacturer makes its selection, the customized WebDox Remote software is automatically downloaded to the manufacturer's client computer system . This downloaded software includes a computer program that automatically generates (on the manufacturer's) client subsystem, a relational database management system (RDBMS) which allows the manufacturer (or its agents) to easily construct and maintain a UPN\/URL database (akin to that specified in FIG. A) but restricted to containing information relating only to the manufacturer's products. Thus, when the manufacturer attempts to enter a UPC number into the manufacturer's UPN\/URL database that does not contain the 6-digit Manufacturer Identification Number assigned to the manufacturer by the UCC, the RDBMS automatically blocks all such information entries. Consequently, the UPN\/URL database can only maintain information pertaining to the registered manufacturer's products and information relating thereto on the Internet. As the manufacturer adds or removes products from its retail or wholesale line, the database administrator simply adds or removes the UPC and URL information relating thereto from the RDBMS. As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, such database changes are periodically transmitted to the WebDox\u2122 Server  so that the IPI Registrant Database (i.e. master UPN\/URL database) of the system (maintained on the IPD Servers thereof) can be updated in a timely manner.","Preferably, the limited or restricted version of the UPN\/URL database maintained by each registered manufacturer on its client subsystem  is connected to the manufacturer's Internet Server \u2032 by a Common Gateway Interface program (CGI) , or other suitable means, as shown in FIG. . In this way, the manufacturer's limited version of the UPN\/URL database can be made accessible to consumers world-wide from the manufacturer's Website which, in the illustrative embodiment, is assumed hosted on an Internet information server \u2032 that is similar to an IPI Server  described in detail hereinabove. In order to simply the process of serving of the manufacturer's limited-version of the UPN\/URL database on the WWW, it is preferred that the CGI , and input and output forms and methods for searching and the displaying the results from the limited-version UPN\/URL database are predesigned for use with manufacturer's Internet Server \u2032 (taking into consideration its operating system and the like). This way, prior to registration the manufacturer need only make a selection of the type of customized WebDox Remote software it needs for its computing and Internet serving platform(s). Then, during software download, the WebDox Server  simply transmits the suitable version of the customized WebDox Remote software to the manufacturer so that it can create, maintain and serve (on the WWW) its limited version of the UPN\/URL database in a \u201cturn-key\u201d manner.","In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the homepage of each registered manufacturer's Website will display a visually conspicuous radio button labeled \u201cUPC Request\u2122 Product Finder\u201d or the like. Moreover, whenever a consumer attempts to search the manufacturer's limited-version UPN\/URL database for products not registerable to the manufacturer (i.e. using UPC numbers not containing the manufacturer's 6-digit UCC Manufacturer Identification Number), the limited-version of the UPN\/URL database will automatically display an HTML-encoded message from the manufacturer's Website, urging the consumer to surf to the IPI Registrant Database of the system (maintained on the network of IPD servers ). Preferably, such HTML-encoded messages will have a hot-linked URL (i.e. anchor) to Website(s) providing consumer access to the \u201cmaster\u201d UPN\/URL database.","The WebDox Remote\u2122 computer system  available to each registered manufacturer has both online and offline modes of operation. In the offline mode, the manufacturer responds to a UPN\/URL Registration Request from the WebDox\u2122 Server in the following manner. First the WebDox Remote\u2122 software analyzes the limited-version of the UPN\/URL database that it has been currently created and maintained by the manufacturer or its designee. Thereafter, the WebDox software automatically creates a UPN\/URL Registration Response document which contains a set of currently active URLs specifying the address location of Web-based information resources associated with each UPC-encoded product of the manufacturer. Then, WebDox Remoter program establishes an Internet connection with the WebDox\u2122 Server, through a \u201cGet\/Send Mail\u201d option. This delivers the UPN\/URL Registration Response (document) to the WebDox\u2122 Server  and retrieves any documents which are waiting thereat for the manufacturer. These new documents are listed by WebDox Remote\u2122 program and presented in the In basket of the manufacturer's WebDox Remote\u2122 computer system .","In the online mode, WebDox Remoter (under the control of the Form Application) can also send UPN\/URL Registration Request documents immediately. For very sensitive applications (i.e. Just-in-Time), this ensures that the UPN\/URL Registration Response document is received at the WebDOX\u2122 Server  the moment that the manufacturer completes the document.","In general, the WebDox\u2122 Server  provides a high-volume document processing and mailboxing environment between the WebDox Server and the WebDox Remote\u2122 system of each registered manufacturer. WebDox\u2122 Server  performs: permanent storage and tracking of all UPN\/URL Registration Request documents sent and UPN\/URL Registration Response documents received; automatic reconciliation of acknowledgments from WebDox Remoter\u2122 program; Automatic creation of user-friendly receipt messages to the manufacturer; \u201cmailboxing\u201d of outbound UPN\/URL Registration documents for retrieval by manufacturer; and automatic manufacturer and profile creation based on forms received from manufacturers. The WebDox\u2122 Server  consists of online components that run as extensions to Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) using the ISAPI interface. This provides higher performance and lower hardware requirements than a conventional CGI Web Interface. Processing intensive tasks are performed asynchronously from the Web server. An integrated queuing and dispatching system manages the processing of documents and interaction with the corresponding application. For large volume situations, the WebDox\u2122 Server components can be deployed on different machines, the WebDox\u2122 Server components (ISAPI extensions) on one machine, the processing components and database on another machine.","Data for UPN\/URL Registration Request documents to be sent to manufacturers is extracted from the IPI Registrant Database using an interface or utility program. The document data (e.g. information fields associated with UPN\/URL registration) can then be accepted by WebDox in a direct manner after formatting. The UPN\/URL Registration Request document should be formatted to a file structure created during the design of the UPN\/URL Registration Application. The WebDox\u2122 Server  then converts the application data into a UPN\/URL Registration request document (i.e. data package). The data package for each manufacturer is then stored (as a message) in an assigned Mailbox of the WebDox\u2122 Server . These messages are then available to be retrieved by the registered manufacturers using WebDox Remote's\u2122 \u201cGet\/Send Mail\u201d feature.","As discussed above, the WebDox Remote\u2122 program transmits messages (e.g. UPN\/URL Registration Response documents) to the WebDox\u2122 Server , where, after passing security checks, they are placed in the WebDox Mailbox system. Incoming (document) messages are received from the Mailbox, processed, and converted into data files for direct transfer to the database management system handling the IPI Registrant Database.","For each document received, the WebDox\u2122 Server  will return a message to the manufacturer confirming receipt of the document. WebDox Remote\u2122 system also returns delivery confirmations to the WebDox Server. These messages are used by the WebDox\u2122 Server to track the status of messages. WebDox\u2122 Server  maintains Mailbox Files for all inbound and outbound messages. The status of messages is updated on an ongoing basis as acknowledgement messages are received allowing timely and precise audits.","WebDox Admin\u2122 Computer system  provides an easy-to-use tool to manage the community of manufacturers, review the status of documents, and configure the WebDox\u2122 Server , including: ad hoc maintenance of manufacturer information; online display of the Mailbox permitting inquiry into document status or document activity for particular manufacturers, and the ability to reset document status; creation and maintenance of UPN\/URL Registration Profiles; preparation of \u201creleases\u201d of new and updated UPN\/URL Registration Applications; Distribution of new and updated UPN\/URL Registration Applications; and automatic inventory and tracking of UPN\/URL Registration Applications distributed to manufacturers.","In the preferred embodiment, UPN\/URL Registration Application design and development is carried out on a Windows 95 or NT workstation. The UPN\/URL Registration Application is developed, tested, and then fully implemented for production with manufacturers. New or updated UPN\/URL Registration Applications are registered with the WebDox Admin\u2122 computer system  and are then distributed to the manufacturers as described herein above.","In the preferred embodiment, UPN\/URL Registration Applications are developed using Microsoft Visual Basic\u2122 and related software tools. These products provide rapid design and creation of the screen-based forms that the manufacturer uses. In addition, the \u201cintelligence\u201d behind the form, in the UPN\/URL Registration Application, can be very powerful, making the manufacturer's work easier while ensuring that the user and Server application receive high quality data.","The WebDox Admin\u2122 system handles the distribution of UPN\/URL Registration Applications to manufacturers. New UPN\/URL Registration Applications can be sent to some or all of the existing manufacturers assigned UPC Manufacturer Identification Numbers. Updates to UPN\/URL Registration Applications can be sent to manufacturers who are currently using that UPN\/URL Application. The actual update is distributed by sending a small notification message to each manufacturer, which then results in the remote site downloading the new forms from the WebDox\u2122 Server , as hereinbefore described above.","Manufacturer Website Search Mode Of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem C, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Manufacturer Website Search Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.  provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its Manufacturer Website Search Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in , when selected from the user-interface of a bar-code driven IPI Website, the second Check Box type button B automatically activates the Manufacturer Website Search Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s)  based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in , this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s)  to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the Manufacturer Website Search Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the Manufacturer Website Search Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, presumably, a CGI script within CGI B that will act upon the request appropriately; and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. a UPC or EAN number associated with a particular consumer product) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in or scan in a UPC or EAN number assigned to a consumer product on which product related information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in , the consumer or retail clerk scans the bar coded consumer product, or enters the UPC or EAN number thereon into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon. In response thereto, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a GET request to the HTTP Server C of the IPD Server . When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored UPC (or EAN) value to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of the CGI script within CGI B that will process the request from the HTML form. This amounts to the Web browser constructing a GET request for that URL, with the arguments (the query string) being attached to the end of the URL. The arguments of the HTML form are specified by the INPUT items of the HTML form (i.e. the UPC or EAN number on the consumer product on which information is sought).","In general, the HTTP and HTML protocols provide three ways to pass the input (e.g. UPC or EAN number) from the users to scripts on the IPD Server  (i.e. HTTP Server). All three methods accomplish the same thing: they allow the Web browser to pass information to a script on the IPD Server . A script may use any of the three methods, and some really robust Web gateways (CGI) B are able to deal with Web clients  that use any of the three methods. The way these methods are implemented on the HTTP Server  depends on the specific operating system that it uses, and is defined as part as the system-specific CGI B. The same HTML form used in this mode might cause completely different things to happen on two different servers, but it would produce the same result for the user.","The first method, used in the illustrative embodiment, passes the scanned UPC or EAN number (input) as part of a GET request, attached to the end of the URL after a question mark \u201c?\u201d. This convention means that what follows the \u201c?\u201d is a query, and (on a UNIX-based server) is copied into the environment variable QUERY_STRING onto the HTTP Server C before calling the CGI script. When the script executes, it gets the query string from this environment variable. The query string consists of a series of terms, each of which is a name and a value, e.g. EAN=9781558603769, having a single term and single value. In the case where the query string consists of two or more terms, then each term is separated by the character :\u201c&\u201d.","The second way that the scanned UPC or EAN number can be sent from the Web browser of the client subsystem  to the HTTP Server C is with a path extension. In this convention, the client subsystem sends a GET request for the URL of the Web script B, with the extra information attached to the URL as if it were part of a longer name. The HTTP (http) program B discovers this extra path and calls the script with the environment variable PATH_INFO set to the extra characters.","The third way to pass information to the server is through the POST method. When used with a script, the input UPC or EAN number from the HTML form is sent from the Web browser of the client subsystem  to the HTTP Server C as an HTTP object. This means that the client subsystem may send information to the HTTP Server C in the same way as the HTTP server sends the information to the client subsystem, which could be a full HTML document. When the POST method is used on a UNIX-based system, the information from the Web browser of the client subsystem is passed to the Web script B through standard input, rather than an environment variable.","The above three ways of passing information from users of client subsystems  to the CGI scripts B on the IPD Server  of the system hereof are specified in the HTML, HTTP and CGI standards, and depend on the specific operating system that the HTTP Server B. The details of how the CGI script must be written and how the input UPC or EAN number from the HTML form is received are drastically different for Macintosh, Microsoft Windows NT, and the UNIX platforms. All of the events described above must happen on each of these platforms, but the way they happen is completely different on different computing platforms. These differences are specified in the CGI standard for each operating system. These differences should not be apparent to the Web browser program of the client subsystems or the users thereof, but will matter to the creators of the CGI script B.","As indicated at Block D in , the HTTP (http) program C passing the arguments (the UPC or EAN numbers in the query string) to the CGI program B and the CGI script translates the query string into a proper query for use in searching the RDBMS A of the IPD Server .","As indicated at Block E in , the translated query is used to search the RDBMS A in order to find the set of URLs pointing to HTML documents (i.e. Web Pages) published on the Internet and containing information relating to the consumer product having the input UPC or EAN number. The result returned from the RDBMS A is an ASCII record specifying the set of URLs pointing to HTML documents published on the Internet and containing information relating to the consumer product having the input UPC or EAN number entered into the HTML form. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search using the UPC or EAN input, the ASCII record must be converted into a HTML document (i.e. output HTML form).","As indicated at Block F in , the CGI C creates the elements of an output HTML form (Web output form), inserts the result from the RDBMS A into the output form, and sets the content-type to be text\/html. The CGI script may translate, filter, augment and reformat the result from the database search in any way so long as the result is an HTML document or some format that the Web browser of the client subsystem can display.","As indicated at Block G, the menu of URLs retrieved from the database search is displayed in the Web output form. At Block H, the consumer or retail sales clerk can link to a desired consumer product related information resource (HTML document) by selecting from the information menu, the URL anchored to the information resource in the displayed information menu.","UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem C, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.  provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in , when selected from the user-interface of an IPI Website, the third Check Box type button C automatically activates the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s)  based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in , this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s)  to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the Manufacturer Website Search Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, presumably, a CGI script within CGI B that will act upon the request appropriately; and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. a UPC or EAN number associated with a particular consumer product) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in or scan in a UPC or EAN number assigned to a consumer product on which product related information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in , the consumer or retail clerk scans the bar coded consumer product, or enters the UPC or EAN number thereon into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon.

When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored UPC (or EAN) value to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of the CGI script within CGI B that will process the request from the HTML form. This amounts to the Web browser constructing a GET request for that URL, with the arguments (the query string) being attached to the end of the URL. The arguments of the HTML form are specified by the INPUT items of the HTML form (i.e. the UPC or EAN number on the consumer product on which information is sought).","As indicated at Block D, the HTTP (http) program C passes the arguments (the UPC or EAN numbers in the query string) to the CGI program B and the CGI script translates the Web query string into a proper query to the RDBMS A of the IPD Server .","As indicated at Block E, the translated query is used to search the RDBMS A and find the set of URLs (i) linked to the registered consumer product (by the manufacturer or agent thereof) assigned the UPC or EAN number entered into the Input Box of the HTML form, and (ii) pointing to HTML (or FTP) documents on the WWW containing particular types of consumer product related information. The result returned from the RDBMS A is an ASCII record specifying the set of URLs satisfying the above criteria. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search during this mode, the ASCII record must be converted into a HTML document (i.e. Web output form).","As indicated at Block F, the CGI script B creates the elements of an HTML document (Web output form), inserts the result from the RDBMS A into the Web output form, and sets the content-type of this HTML document to text\/html. In the illustrative embodiment, when the Web output form is displayed by the requesting client subsystem, a set of URLs categorized by particular product information types is displayed on the information display frame C Notably, this set of URLs points to particular types of consumer product related information registered within the RDBMS A of the system.","As indicated at Block G, the consumer or retail sales clerk can then access and display any HTML document (Web page) located at a particular URL within the information menu by selecting the same using a touch screen, mouse, or other input selection device.","Trademark-Directed Search Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem C, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Trademark-Directed Search Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem. FIGS. D through D, taken together, provide a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its Trademark-Directed Search Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. D, when selected from the user-interface of an IPI Website, the fourth Check Box type button D automatically activates the Trademark-Directed Search Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s)  based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. D, this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb input form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s)  to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the Trademark-Directed Search Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, presumably, a CGI script within CGI B that will act upon the request appropriately; and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. the trademark or trade name used with a particular consumer product on which information is sought) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in the trademark or trade name believed or otherwise known to be used in connection with a particular consumer product on which information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. D, the consumer or retail clerk enters the trademark or trade name into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon. In response thereto, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a GET request to the HTTP Server C of the PD Server . When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored trademark value to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of the CGI script within CGI B that will process the request from the HTML form.

E, the consumer or retail sales clerk can access and display any HTML document (Web page) located at a particular URL within the displayed information menu by selecting the same using a touch screen, mouse, or other input selection device available at the requesting client subsystem .","The protocols described above can be realized using any suitable programming language including, for example, an object-oriented programming language such as the Java\u2122 programming language.","Registration Solicitation Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem","In the illustrative embodiments of the present invention, the data-synchronized IPD Servers of the system hereof are also provided with an \u201cAutomated Registration Solicitation Mode\u201d programmed by the webmaster (or administrator) of the IPI Website(s). In this mode, each IPD Server analyzes the data collected within its Non-IPI Registrant Database. The data analysis procedure seeks to determine: (1) which \u201cunregistered\u201d products in the Non-IPI Registrant Database were the subject of an information request at the IPD Server; (2) how many hits (requests) were made for the product within a predetermined length of time (e.g. one week) by Internet users; and (3) whether the number of requests exceeds a particular \u201crequest threshold\u201d (e.g. 100 requests in week period). Then for each unregistered product which has exceeded the request threshold, the IPD Server automatically sends an E-mail message to the associated company. Preferably, the E-mail message is designed to (i) inform the company of recent information requests for their products, and (ii) solicit the registration of such products with the IPD Server. Once registered with the system, such products can be easily found on the Internet by anyone wishing to use the product information finding techniques of the present invention.","Operation of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem and Method Hereof","When the Check Box button C is selected from the control frame B, the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem enters its \u201cUPN-Directed Information Access Mode\u201d illustrated in FIG. C. Preferably, the user is provided with a choice of language (e.g. English, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) by way of an appropriate menu-selection screen. After the desired language selection is made, the home page is displayed upon the client subsystem's display screen. A typical display screen produced from the IPD Server might read as follows:\n\n","When the subsystem is in its \u201cUPN-Directed Information Access Mode\u201d, a Web-based information resource pertaining to any commercial product registered with the system can be displayed and selected by the user in order to automatically access the same from the Internet. Such information resources can include advertisements, specifications, operation descriptions, product simulations, purchase information, maintenance information, warranty and servicing information, product updates, distributor\/reseller information, incentives (e.g. discounts, rebates, coupons, etc.), electronic data transaction screens, etc. In this mode, desired product information is obtained by simply entering the registered product's UPN (e.g. its UPC's 12 digit numerical string) into the Input Box of the HTML form displayed in the information display frame C. Such data entry can be carried out manually using a keyboard data entry techniques, or automatically using a bar code symbol reader connected to the client subsystem as discussed in detail above. When using the seeded IPI Database described hereinabove, only the first six digits of the UPC number need be entered into the dialogue box. An exemplary display screen produced from the IPD Server might be as follows:","\u201cSimply enter the 12 digit UPC the particular product; click REQUEST, and then wait for the display of the list of Web locators (URLs) at which the desired product information can be found on the Internet?\u201d","In response to such data entry operations, a list or menu of URLs organized according to information subfield classifications as set forth, for example, in FIG. A, are displayed on client subsystem Cmaking the request of the IPD Server. At this stage, another display screen associated with the HTML form produced from the IPD Server would appear with an exemplary message as follows:","\u201cPlease select the URL from the displayed URL Menu using the information subfield product information category displayed above. This will connect you to the product information related to the selected URL. You can return to the URL display list at anytime.\u201d","Upon selecting a particular URL from the displayed URL menu, video and audio information content are automatically served from the IPI Server  hosting the selected URL and thereafter displayed on the client subsystem .","When the Check Box button D is selected, the IPI Finding and Searching Subsystem enters its Trademark-Directed Search Mode, illustrated in FIGS. D through D. Preferably, the user is provided with a choice of languages (e.g. English, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) by way of an appropriate menu-selection screen.","When the system is in its Trademark-Directed Search Mode, a predesignated information resource pertaining to any commercial product registered with the system can be automatically accessed from the Internet and displayed from the Internet browser of a client subsystem . Such information resources can include advertisements, specifications, operation descriptions, product simulations, product upgrade information, purchase information, maintenance information, warranty and servicing information, etc. In this mode, desired product information is obtained by simply entering the registered product's trademark(s) and\/or associated company name into the Input Box of the HTML form displayed on the information display frame C of the client subsystem. An exemplary message associated with the HTML form produced from the IPD Server  might be as follows:","\u201cSimply enter the trademark used in connection with the particular product and\/or the company name of the product's manufacturer; click REQUEST, and then wait for the display of a list of Web locators (URLs) at which desired types of product information can be found on the Internet?\u201d","In response to such data entry operations, a list of URLs organized according to the information subfield classifications set forth in FIG. A is displayed on the client subsystem placing the request. Upon selecting a particular URL from the displayed list thereof, video and audio information content are automatically served from the IPI Server hosting the selected URL and thereafter displayed on the client subsystem.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode and the Trademark-Directed Search Mode can be integrated into a single server application so that there is no need or desire to manually select between mode activation buttons C and D, respectively. In such an embodiment, the interaction between the IPD Server and the requesting client subsystem can be designed to support the following Web server display screens and script underlying the same:\n\n","In instances when an IPI Website in accordance with the present invention is being served to consumers in retail environments using a computer-based kiosk as shown in FIG. A, the consumer as well as retail sales clerk is presented with the option of ascertaining the price of a product in the store. This is achieved by simply depressing the \u201cPrice Display\u201d button F on Control Strip B, shown in , to engage the system in its price lookup\/display mode. In this mode of operation, the consumer then need only scan the UPC bar code symbol on the product using the bar code scanner  in order for the price to be looked-up in the Product Price Database maintained in the Retailer's Price Server (RPS) , and displayed on the kiosk display screen. In general, the Product Price Database of the hosting retailer can be made accessible by the computer-based kiosk in several possible ways. As shown in , one way is to place the retailer's RPS on Internet (by using an HTTP server) and connect the RPS to the IPD Server  of the system by way of a CGI well known in the art. The CGI can be made accessible only by authorized client subsystems (e.g. computer-based kiosks installed in the hosting retailer's store and possible administrators of the information delivery system of the present invention). An alternative technique of connecting the Product Price Database to each computer-based kiosk would involve providing the RPS with a direct interface to each computer-based kiosk in the hosting retailer's store(s). This alternative technique may require the use of computer networking technology well known in the art.","A Best Mode Embodiment of IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the Present Invention","The IPI finding subsystem (i.e. system) of the present invention can be realized on the Internet in a variety of different ways. Each embodiment of the system will provide manufacturers, retailers, consumers and sponsors with various benefits hitherto unachievable using prior art systems and methodologies. A best mode embodiment of the system will now be described below with reference to Intent-to-Use (ITU) servicemarks that Applicant has sought to register under the Lanbam Act and ultimately to use in reducing the Internet-based consumer product information finding system to commercial practice in the near future. The inventive subject matter herein disclosed can be readily applied to carry out such an Internet-based information finding and delivery system.","According to the best mode embodiment, the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem , referred to as the \u201cUPC REQUEST\u2122 Consumer Product Information Finding System\u201d in  hereof, comprises an integration of several subsystems including, for example: the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem  (e.g. Web Document Server  and Workstation ) including Wed-based and Value Added Networks (VAN)-based infrastructure and processes  for supporting EDI and UPN\/URL database management operations by manufacturers and\/or their agents; the UPC REQUEST Database Management Subsystem  interfaced with the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem ; numerous UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks (e.g. client subsystems ) installed in retail stores, retail outlets and the like, each having a bar code symbol driven Internet browser providing access to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP); and all of the Web-enabled client subsystems  located in consumer homes, in consumer offices and on the road, having access to the Internet through an ISP. While distributed geographically, these subsystems are integrated through the infrastructure of the Internet.","The function of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem  is two-fold: to enable qualified manufacturers to quickly and easily register their companies with the System (i.e. the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem ) by way of a Web-enabled computer system of their choice; and (2) enable manufacturers and\/or their agents to easily link, manage and update their UPC numbers and linked URLs using any Web-enabled computer system  running the EDI-based UPN\/URL Database Management software (downloaded during manufacturer registration), and periodically transmit such updated information to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem in order to update each manufacturer's information within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database (i.e., IPI Database shown in FIGS. A and A).","The function of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem  is to maintain and update the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database (shown in FIGS. A, A and FIGS. C through C), which contains various information items regarding registered manufacturers, service-subscribing retailers, and registered consumer products including, for example, UPC (and\/or UPC\/EAN) numbers assigned to consumer products and linked URLs pointing to published HTTP-encoded documents (i.e. Web pages) containing particular types of information related to such products.","Within the store of each retailer subscribing to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Consumer Information Service, the function of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk is to provide consumer access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website (e.g. UPC REQUEST\u2122@ Wal-Mart, UPC REQUEST\u2122 @ Home Depot, etc.). The UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website served to kiosks with the retailer's store provides consumer access to UPN\/URL information links relating only to those products sold by the retailer and maintained within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System by the manufacturer or agent thereof. If desired by the subscribing retailer, its UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website can be freely served to customers over the Internet, e.g. accessible from a hot-link embedded somewhere in the retailer's Website.","Within the realm of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System , the function of the Web-enabled client computer system  of each consumer, wherever it may be located (e.g. at home, in the office or on the road), is to provide consumer access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website which is freely served over the Internet to any consumer having a Web-enabled computer system. Unlike each UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website maintained by the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website provides consumer access to UPN\/URL information links relating to every product maintained within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System by every registered manufacturer. Any attempt by a consumer to access information from a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website regarding a product not sold in the retailer's store will automatically result in a link over to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","A Brief Description of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Service","When installed in retail stores, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System will provide five revolutionary Internet-based consumer information services under the servicemarks HOME-PAGE\u2122, INFO-LINK\u2122, CYBER-SERVICE\u2122, TRADE-MARK\u2122 and PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122, respectively. Each of these information services is accessible to consumers and sales clerks alike from a UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website (e.g. UPC REQUEST\u2122 @ Home Depot Website) accessed within a retail store, as well as from on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","To constantly remind the public at large of the \u201cfee-paying\u201d sponsors of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System, all Web pages displayed by the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in a retail store (e.g. on UPC REQUEST\u2122 @ Home Depot Website), or on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, will be displayed within a three-frame display \u201cframework\u201d comprising a sponsor frame, a control frame, and an information frame.","The \u201csponsor frame\u201d, located on the upper-most portion of the Internet browser screen, displays the sponsor's greeting such as, for example, \u201cWelcome to UPC REQUEST\u2122, sponsored by Visa and Federal Express.\u201d","The \u201ccontrol frame\u201d, located on the left-most side of the Internet browser screen, will provide five mode activations buttons. The first mode activation button A enables consumers to request the INFO-LINK\u2122 service. The second mode activation button B enables consumers to request the HOME-PAGE\u2122 service. The third mode activation button C enables consumers to request CYBER-SERVICE\u2122. The fourth mode activation button D enables consumers to request TRADE-MARK\u2122. The fifth mode activation button E enables consumers to request PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122. A sixth button enables the download a free plug-in software module which automatically installs a \u201cProduct Information\u201d button on the graphical user interface of the consumer's Internet browser, so that the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website can be accessed anywhere in the world with a single click of the mouse button.","The \u201cinformation frame\u201d, occupying the balance of the Internet browser screen, will display: all HTTP (i.e. Web) and FTP pages launched by in-store scanning of UPC-labeled products during HOME-PAGE\u2122 or CYBER-SERVICE\u2122; all HTTP and FTP pages launched by clicking on hypertext-links embedded within Web pages accessed through a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website in retail stores or from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website; as well as all information search and display (menu) screens served by a UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","In retail stores subscribing to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System, HOME-PAGE\u2122 manufacturer's website search site will enable consumers to automatically access the WWW Home Page of any registered manufacturer by scanning the UPC (or UPC\/EAN) bar code symbol on any product thereof using the bar code symbol reader associated with a UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk. In general, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk can be realized by any Web-enabled computer system  having an Internet browser program, on-line access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website, and optionally a touch-screen display panel. The UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk may, however, be realized as an inexpensive Internet access terminal comprising a Web-enabled network computer (NC), an LCD touch-screen panel, and a laser scanning bar code symbol reader integrated within an ultra-compact housing that is mountable within diverse locations within retail stores. As shown in FIG. A, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk may also be integrated within a conventional Point Of Sale (POS) station having a laser scanning bar code symbol reader and a large rotatable LCD display panel. Being as easy to install as a telephone modem, UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks of this design can be widely deployed throughout retail stores world-wide with minimal modifications to the preexisting information infrastructure.","At home, in the office, or on the road, HOME-PAGE\u2122 enables consumers to automatically access the WWW Home Page of any registered manufacturer by entering the UPN (or UPC\/EAN number) on any product into the search screen served up by a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website, or by the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","INFO-LINK\u2122, carried out using EDI-based UPN\/URL Database Management software (downloaded from Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem ), enables manufacturers to simply relate (link), manage and update therein (i) the UPN (or UPC\/EAN number) on any product with (ii) the Internet address (i.e. URL) of product-related Web pages published on the Internet by the manufacturer, its agents, or others, for subsequent access and display by consumers using CYBER-SERVICE\u2122. While the INFO-LINK\u2122 service would be made accessible through UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks  in retail stores (i.e. for the sake of vendors who frequent the same), the actual UPN\/URL information linking and management operations associated with the INFO-LINK\u2122 service will typically occur in the \u201cback-offices\u201d of registered manufacturers using Internet-enabled computer systems accessing INFO-LINK\u2122 through a hot-linked URL posted on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website and\/or the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122, accessible through a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website or the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, enables consumers at home, in the office, on the road, and in retail stores, to quickly access particular types of product-related information which have been published on the WWW by registered manufacturers, their agents and others about consumer products registered with the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System. CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 displays such product-related information in a menu-like format organized by particular information types (e.g., Product Advertisements, Product Endorsements, Product Reviews, Product Rebates and Incentives, Product Description, Product Manual\/Instructions, Product Updates (at FTP Sites), Warranty and Repair Service, Direct Product Purchase, Retailers, Wholesalers, Complementary Products, Company Annual Report, Stock Purchase, etc.). Each displayed information menu associated with a consumer product contains hyper-linked URLs pointing to HTTP-documents containing particular types of product-related information linked to the product by the manufacturer or its agent.","When CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 is selected from a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website, each product-related Web page listed in the displayed \u201cinformation menu\u201d can be accessed and displayed simply by touching the corresponding Internet address (i.e. URL) displayed on the touch-screen display panel of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk in the retail store. When CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 is selected from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, each product-related Web page listed in the displayed \u201cinformation menu\u201d can be accessed and displayed simply by clicking the display screen thereof accessed by an Internet-enabled computer system.","TRADE-MARK\u2122, accessible through a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website or the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, enables consumers to quickly access particular types of product-related information from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database, by using the trademark or trade name of the related product. When this mode of service is requested, a search screen is displayed within the information frame so that the consumer or sales clerk can enter the trademark or trade name for the related consumer product.","PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122, accessible through a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website or the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, enables consumers to quickly access particular types of product-related information from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database, by using a descriptive term for the related product. When this mode of service is requested, a search screen is displayed within the information frame so that the consumer or sales clerk can enter a descriptive term for the related consumer product.","To maximize value to a particular retail store's customers, each UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website served at each retail store subscriber would be made accessible to consumers outside their retail stores (e.g. at home, in the office or on the road) by several Internet access methods including, for example: through a hot-linked URL posted on the retail store's Website, pointing to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website; through a publicly accessible URL, e.g.http:\/\/www.upcrequest.com\/@ retail store; etc.","Benefits Provided to Sponsors Promoting the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System","HOME-PAGE\u2122 and CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will foster customer loyalty and patronage with sponsors by providing consumers with valuable product-related information before and after product purchases.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will provide sponsors with an economical and effective way of marketing products and services to their customers and shoppers worldwide.","HOME-PAGE\u2122 will provide sponsors with valuable advertising space on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, for subleasing to retailers, manufacturers and business concerns.","INFO-LINK\u2122 will provide sponsors with an effective way of promoting their products and\/or services among manufacturers, retailers and consumers using the UPC REQUESTS\u2122 System.","Benefits Provided to Customers Using the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in Retail Stores","HOME-PAGE\u2122 will allow customers to automatically access the Home Page of any manufacturer's Website by simply scanning the UPC bar code symbol on any product thereof at any UPC REQUEST\u2122 information kiosk in a retailer's store.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will allow customers to quickly access (by touch-screen URL selection) particular types of product-related information that have been published on the World Wide Web (WWW) by manufacturers, their agents or others, and registered within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database through INFO-LINK\u2122.","TRADE-MARK\u2122 will allow customers to quickly access product related information menus from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database using trademarks or trade names used in connection with the product on which information is being sought.","PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122 will allow customers to quickly access product related information menus from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database using descriptive terms related to the product on which information is being sought.","Benefits Provided to Customers Using the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System at Home, in the Office, or on the Road","HOME-PAGE\u2122 will allow customers to automatically access the Home Page of any manufacturer's Website by simply entering the UPC (or UPC\/EAN) number on any consumer product, into a UPC REQUEST\u2122 search screen served from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website and accessible to anyone using an Internet-enabled computer system at home, in the office, or on the road.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will allow customers to quickly access from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database, particular types of product-related information that have been published on the WWW by manufacturers, their agents or others, and registered within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database through the INFO-LINK\u2122 service.","TRADE-MARK\u2122 will allow customers to quickly access product related information menus from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database using trademarks or trade names used in connection with the product on which information is being sought.","PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122 will allow customers to quickly access product related information menus from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database using descriptive terms related to the product on which information is being sought.","Benefits Provided to Retailers Providing UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in their Stores","HOME-PAGE\u2122 and CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will foster customer loyalty and patronage with retailers by providing shoppers with valuable product-related information before and after product purchases.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will provide retailers with an economical and effective way of marketing its products to customers and shoppers within its stores.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will provide retail sales personnel with an opportunity to learn about a retailer's products by scanning the UPC bar code symbols on such products, and selecting product-related Web pages for in-store review and sales-training sessions whenever customer demand allows.","HOME-PAGE\u2122 and CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 will provide retailers with valuable advertising space in their stores for subleasing to manufacturers and others (e.g. Local sponsors) in order to self-finance the store-wide delivery of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Service.","TRADE-MARK\u2122 will allow sales clerks and customers to quickly access product related information menus from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database using trademarks or trade names used in connection with the product on which information is being sought.","PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122 will allow sales clerks and customers to quickly access product related information menus from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database using descriptive terms related to the product on which information is being sought.","Proposed Revenue Model for the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System","The UPC REQUEST\u2122 System will generate revenue from at least four sources: Manufacturer Fees paid by manufacturers who want to register their products and product-related Web pages with the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database; Retailer Fees paid by retailers who want to provide bar code driven access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in retail stores; Sponsor Fees paid by Sponsors of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System; and Advertiser Fees paid by advertisers on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","Manufacturers desiring to register their consumer products and product-related Web pages within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database would pay a one-time Manufacturer Registration Fee, based on volume of sales. An annual maintenance fee may be desired or necessary. Minimally, such fees should cover the cost of the EDI and UPN\/URL Database Management software (and updates) automatically downloaded to each manufacturer upon registration. Such Web-based EDI software enables manufacturers to easily manage the UPC numbers and Web page URLs associated with their changing product lines, and to automatically transmit such information to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem in order that the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem is periodically updated.","Retailers providing bar code driven access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in their retail stores would pay an annual Retailer License Fee based on the number of UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks deployed therein (within store isles, at POS stations and behind information\/service counters).","Each sponsor of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System would pay an annual Sponsor Fee for the right to display its name, trademark\/servicemark and\/or message in hypertext within a selected portion of the sponsor frame displayed by licensed UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks in retail stores, as well as Internet-enabled computer systems accessing the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website. For marketing reasons, it would be desirable to limit the number of sponsors of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System at any instant in time.","Advertisers, who advertise on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, would pay an Advertiser Fee based on the time and location that the Web advertisement is displayed.","Usage of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 in Diverse Retail Markets","The UPC REQUEST\u2122 System can be used to provide consumers quick access to useful product-related information in diverse types of retail shopping environments including, for example, retail superstores, discount department stores, home-improvement stores, computer superstores, drugstores and pharmacies, music stores, video rental stores, bookstores, supermarkets, grocery stores and the like. Each of these retail markets provides a unique environment in which the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System can be used by manufacturers of consumer products to effectively deliver product-related information to consumers in retail stores, at home, in the office or on the road, before and after consumer purchases.","As the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System provides manufacturers with an effective way and means of making direct contact with present and future customers, it enables both manufacturers and retailers alike to influence demand in ways that have hitherto have been unavailable. Such features of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System present enormous growth opportunities in retail supply and demand chain management across diverse markets within our ever expanding global economy.","Modifications of the Illustrative Embodiments of the Invention","The present invention has been described in great detail with reference to the above illustrative embodiments. It is understood, however, that numerous modifications will readily occur to those with ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of reading the present disclosure.","For example, in the illustrative embodiments described hereinabove, separate databases are maintained by each data-synchronized IPD Server for (i) registered products within the system, and (ii) non-registered products within the system. Notably, the reasons for using a dual database design of this sort would be based largely on economics, namely: only those companies who have paid the required maintenance (or registration) fees get their products and linked-URLs \u201cregistered\u201d with the system, whereas non-paying companies and organizations do not get their products and linked-URLs registered with the system, regardless of how such product-URL information is ascertained (e.g. by solicitation versus data-mining).","Thus it is contemplated that in some embodiments of the present invention, each IPD Server will be designed to maintain only a single database for maintaining product-URL information currently available on the Internet. In such embodiments of the present invention, the concept of \u201cnon-registered\u201d products will be altogether avoided, since the system implementation and administration may be designed to not require companies to pay maintenance (or registration) fees in order that their products and linked URLs are registered with the IPI system. Instead, some alternative income producing scheme will be used in such embodiments of the present invention (e.g. user fees, subscription fees, Internet browser-licensing fees, etc.) for system maintenance and administration.","When practicing the system and method of the present invention, it is preferred that the UPC label (with its human-readable UPC number) assigned to the particular product be attached, embossed or otherwise embodied on an accessible surface thereof. In addition to applying the UPC label to the external packaging of the product, it is preferred that the UPC label also be printed on any and all product instructions and manuals provided with the product. In this way, the UPC number can be easily read by a human being and then used to access a desired type of product information using the system and method of the present invention.","In order that the system hereof can be used to find information pertaining to large products such as automobiles, motorcycles, skidoos, farm machinery, boats, etc., the present invention also contemplates assigning UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN numbers) to such products and attaching, embossing or otherwise embodying the same on an accessible surface thereof. Also, the UPN label can be printed on all instruction booklets and\/or operating manuals normally provided with the product. In this way, information related to any particular product that is posted anywhere on the Internet and linked to URLs registered with the IPD Servers  of the system hereof can be readily found using the unique UPC number assigned thereto by the manufacturer at the time of sale. Notably multimedia information about such products can be most helpful in regard to the operation, repair and servicing of such products.","The system and method of the present invention has been shown to combine the use of UPNs, trademarks and company names when making a product information request of the system. It is understood, however, that the present invention can be practiced using anyone of these items of information, alone or in combination with each other, in order to place a product information request with the system hereof.","Also, while the system of the illustrative embodiment has been shown used to collect, transport and serve information related to consumer products, it is understood that the system can be used to link the URLs of HTML (and other Internet) documents with consumer services assigned uniform service numbers (USN) which may be based on the UPC or EAN numbering system, or some other suitable system. In such alternative embodiments, the IPI Database would contain information pertaining to uniform service numbers (USN) that have been linked to the URLs of HTML or like documents on the Internet by the manufacturer or its agents, in essentially the same manner as conducted for consumer products. Such USN\/URL management operations can be carried out in a similar to that described in connection with UPN\/URL management along the retail supply and demand chain.","In connection with the consumer service information embodiment of the present invention, it is understood that at present, few (if any) services have been assigned a UPC (or EAN) number in the manner that nearly all consumer products have been assigned in the contemporary period. In spite of this fact, however, the present invention contemplates the need and utility of widespread assignment of UPC, EAN or similar numbers by service providers to particular services (as well as the imprinting of UPC, EAN or similar symbols on printed service brochures and advertisements. Notably, assigning uniform service numbers (USNs) to particular services, and labeling printed and graphical brochures and advertisements with such universal numbers, will provide a number of new opportunities hitherto unavailable.","In particular, service-related information could be easily found (i.e. located and accessed) on Websites using the system and method of the present invention, and thereafter the service can easily be procured through an electronic data transaction. In accordance with the present invention, this can be achieved by uniquely identifying and assigning \u201cparticular\u201d services by a Universal Service Code (USC) which has many if not all of the attributes of a conventional UPC. While not necessary, a single digit may be optionally added to the USC in order to demark that services are being identified rather than products. An example of such USC labeling would be printing an assigned UPC label (number) on: admission tickets to a theatrical, dramatic or musical performance and\/or its playbill; admission tickets to a movie; admission ticket to a concert and\/or its concert program; admission tickets to a sporting event and\/or its sports program; admission tickets to an art, science or history museum; admission tickets to the zoo or botanical gardens; and the like. The UPC label would be encoded to identify a particular event at which an entertainment, educational or professional service is provided. The UPC label printed on the tangible medium associated with the promotion of or access to the particular service would then be registered with the IPI Registrant Database of the system hereof, along with the name of the provider of the service, and a list of URLs that identify the Web locations at which particular kinds of information related to the particular service can be found (in accordance with the categories of FIG. A).","These and all other such modifications and variations are deemed to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the accompanying Claims to Invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of how to practice the Objects of the Present Invention, the following Detailed Description of the Illustrative Embodiments can be read in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-1","b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},"FIG.
