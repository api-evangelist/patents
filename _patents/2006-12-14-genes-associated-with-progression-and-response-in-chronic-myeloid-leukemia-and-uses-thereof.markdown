The invention also relates to methods and computer systems tor evaluating the progression of CML based on these molecular markers. The present invention also relates to methods and compositions for treating CML patients by modulating the expression or activity of certain genes involved in CML progression and\/or their encoded proteins. The invention further relates to methods and compositions for determining the responsiveness of a CML patient to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec\u2122).","Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoetic stem cell disease with distinct biological and clinical features. In humans, a majority of CML (about 95%) has been found to be associated with a chromosomal abnormality that involves a t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation, which results in the expression of the BCR\/ABL fusion gene (Philadelphia Chromosome or Ph). The rest is associated with either a cryptic translocation that is invisible on G-banded chromosome preparations or a variant translocation involving another chromosome or chromosomes as well as chromosomes 9 and 22. CML usually presents in the so-called chronic phase, in which the clonal expansion of mature myeloid cells leads to an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. Without curative intervention chronic phase CML will invariably transform through a phase of \u201cacceleration,\u201d often heralded by the appearance of increased immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, as well as new cytogenetic changes in addition to the Ph chromosome. Progression then proceeds quickly to blast crisis, with immature blast cells overwhelming the production of normal hematopoetic elements. Blast crisis is highly resistant to treatment, with death generally occurring from infection and bleeding complications secondary to the absence of normal granulocytes and platelets. The median time from diagnosis of chronic phase CML to progression blast crisis is approximately 3-4 years but the range of timing is quite broad, encompassing from 0.5-15 years (Faderl et al., 1999, Ann Intern Med 131:207).","There is a broad range of treatment options for CML. All treatments work far better on chronic phase disease than on accelerated or blast phase. The only known curative therapy for CML is stem cell transplantation, a complex and potentially toxic modality that carries a high potential for morbidity and mortality (Radich et al., 2003, Blood 102:31). Non-transplant therapy includes alpha interferon, which can produce a major reduction in the proportion of Ph positive cells and extend the natural history of the disease in approximately 10-20% of cases (Kantarjian et al., 1999, J Clin Oncol 17:284). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, suppresses the Ph to the point where it is undetectable by cytogenetic evaluation (\u201ccomplete cytogenetic remission\u201d) in >70% of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML cases (Druker et al., 2001, N Engl J Med 344:1031). The duration of such responses is unknown, as is potential for cure with imatinib. Resistance to imatinib occurs (especially in advanced phase disease) often accompanied by point mutations in the active area of imatinib binding in the abl gene (Shah et al., 2002, Cancer Cell 2:117). The natural history of such relapses is unknown, though some appear to have a speedy entry into advanced disease (Branford et al., 2003, Blood 102:276).","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003\/0104426 A1 discloses genetic markers whose expression correlates with progression of CML. Specifically, the patent application discloses sets of markers whose expression patterns can be used to differentiate chronic phase individuals from those in blast crisis, and methods of using these markers to distinguish these conditions. The patent application also discloses kits containing ready-to-use microarrays and computer data analysis software for carrying out the disclosed methods.","PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen of Melanoma) was identified as a tumor antigen recognized by cytotoxic T-cells against a melanoma surface antigen (Matsushita et al., 2001, Br J Haematol 112:916, 2001; van Baren et al., 1998, Br J Haematol 102:1376). PRAME has been found to be overexpressed in over 25% of leukemia, and has been found to be induced by Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines (Watari et al., 2000, FEBS Lett 466:367). PRAME over-expression has been described as one of the few features that characterize the transient myeloproliferative syndrome of Down's syndrome from the progressive acute megakaryoblastic leukemia found in that disorder (McElwaine et al., 2004, Br J Haematol 125:729).","The genetic events that cause the progression of chronic phase to blast crisis CML are unknown (Calabretta et al., 2004, Blood 103:4010; Shet et al., 2002, Leukemia 16:1402). Numerous genetic abnormalities have been demonstrated, including chromosomal changes including a multiplication of the Ph, the disruption of TP53, the deletion of the p15\/p16 tumor suppressor genes (the latter only in lymphoid blast crisis). However, none of these changes are particularly common. Genetic instability is apparent in the additional chromosomal changes that occur with progression, though standard assays of instability, such as alterations in minisatellite repeats, is relatively uncommon (Wada et al., 1994, Blood 83:3449; Mori et al., 1997, Leukemia 11:151). Unfortunately, clinical and molecular tests cannot predict where on the \u201cclock\u201d of progression an individual lies at the time of the initial diagnosis, and this makes it impossible to tailor therapy to the degree of risk that faces an individual CML patient. It is also not possible to identify the subset of patients who will benefit most from the variety of therapy options, such as interferon, imatinib, or transplantation. Thus, presently tailoring therapy to individual risk is difficult. There is therefore a need to identify genes whose levels of expression change during the evolution of the chronic phase to blast crisis. There is a need for methods that utilize measured expression levels of such genes to determine the phase and\/or progression of CML in a patient. There is also a need for methods of treating CML by targeting such genes.","Discussion or citation of a reference herein shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is prior art to the present invention.","The invention provides a method for determining the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a patient, comprising (a) classifying a marker profile comprising measurements of a plurality of gene products in a cell sample taken from said patient as a chronic phase (CP-CML) profile or as an advanced phase (ADV-CML) profile, wherein said gene products are respectively products of at least 5 of the genes listed in Table 1a and\/or Table 1b or respective functional equivalents thereof, wherein at least one of said 5 genes is from Table 1a; and (b) determining said patient as in a chronic phase if said marker profile is classified as a CP-CML profile, or determining said patient as in an advanced phase if said marker profile is classified as an ADV-CML profile.

The identities of these markers and the measurements of their respective gene products, e.g., measurements of levels (abundances) of their encoded mRNAs or proteins, can be used by application of a pattern recognition algorithm to develop a progression classifier that discriminates between different phases of CML based on measurements of such gene products in a sample from a patient. As used herein, the term \u201cgene product\u201d includes mRNA transcribed from the gene and protein encoded by the gene.","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by high peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts with granulocyte predominance and extramedullary hematopoiesis. CML typically evolves through 3 clinically distinct stages or phases: chronic phase (CP-CML or CP), accelerated phase (AP-CML or AP), and blast phase (BP-CML or BP), which is also called acute phase or blast crisis (BC-CML or BC). The chronic phase lasts several years and is characterized by accumulation of myeloid precursors and mature cells in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and extramedullary sites. During the chronic phase, patients typically have fewer than 10% blasts (or 20% blasts and promyelocytes combined) in blood or bone marrow samples. These patients usually have relatively mild symptoms and usually respond to standard treatments. The chronic phase progresses into the accelerated phase, which lasts about 4 to 6 months. During the accelerated phase, patients typically have more than 10% blasts (or 20% blasts and promyelocytes combined) but less than 30% blasts and promyelocytes in their bone marrow or blood samples. These patients often have fever, poor appetite, and weight loss. Symptoms and blood counts of an AP-CML patient are not as responsive to treatments as they are during the chronic phase. The leukemia cells often have developed new chromosomal changes, in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome. The accelerated phase progresses to the blast phase, which lasts for a few months. During the blast phase, patients typically have more than 30% blasts and promyelocytes in their bone marrow and\/or blood samples. The blast cells often spread to tissues and organs beyond the bone marrow. The accelerated phase and the blast phase are often grouped together into an advanced phase of CML (ADV-CML or ADV). The molecular markers of the invention are particular useful for evaluating the progression of a CML patient from the chronic phase to the advanced phase.","The invention provides a list of genes that are differentially expressed across different phases of CML (Tables 1a and 1b, infra). This set of genes is called the phase reporter geneset. Measurements of gene products of these molecular markers, as well as of their functional equivalents, can be used for staging a CML patient. A functional equivalent with respect to a gene, designated as gene A, refers to a gene that encodes a protein or mRNA that at least partially overlaps in physiological function in the cell to that of the protein or mRNA encoded by gene A. In particular, CML staging in a patient is carried out by a method comprising determining whether the patient is in a chronic phase or an advanced phase (accelerated phase or blast phase) based on a profile of measurements (e.g., of the levels) of gene products of (i.e., encoded by) at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200, 500 or all of the genes in Tables 1a and\/or 1b; or of at least 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the genes in Tables 1a and\/or 1b, or functional equivalents of such genes, in an appropriate cell sample from the patient, e.g., a bone marrow or blood sample obtained from the patient, wherein at least 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 genes as appropriate are from Table 1a. Such a profile of measurements is also referred to herein as an \u201cexpression profile\u201d or a \u201cmarker profile.\u201d In a specific embodiment, the evaluation of CML progression in a patient is carried out using measurements (e.g., of the levels) of gene products of (i.e., encoded by) at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200, 500 or all of the genes in Tables 1a; or of at least 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the genes in Tables 1a, or functional equivalents of such genes. In another specific embodiment, the evaluation of CML progression in a patient is carried out using measurements of gene products of less than 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 total genes, in which all or at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the genes are from Tables 1a and\/or 1b or their functional equivalents, or at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 100 of the genes are from Tables 1a and\/or 1b or their functional equivalents. In one embodiment, if the patient expression profile is classified as a CP-CML profile, the patient is determined as in chronic phase, whereas if the patient expression profile is classified as a ADV-CML profile, the patient is determined as in an advanced phase (accelerated phase or blast crisis).","The invention also provides a list of genes that are associated with CML progression (Tables 2a and 2b, infra). These genes are also termed \u201cprogression genes\u201d in the application. This set of genes is called the progression geneset. Measurements of gene products of these molecular markers, as well as of their functional equivalents, can be used for staging a CML patient. Since these genes are associated with CML progression, they are also targets for therapeutic intervention of CML. For example, a CML patient exhibiting aberrant regulation of such genes can be treated by therapies targeting such genes. Thus, measurements of gene products of these molecular markers, as well as of their functional equivalents, can also be used for determining an appropriated treatment regimen for a CML patient.","Different subcombination of CML progression genes can also be used. Thus, in various embodiments, the markers that are the genes listed in Tables 2a-2b or 3 are used. Measurements of gene products of these molecular markers and\/or their functional equivalents can be used for evaluating the progression of CML in a patient. The evaluation of CML progression in a patient is carried out by a method comprising determining whether the patient is in a chronic phase or an advanced phase (accelerated phase or blast phase) based on a profile of measurements (e.g., of the levels) of gene products of (i.e., encoded by) at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200 or all of the genes in Tables 2a and\/or 2b, or at least 5, 10, 15 or all of the genes in Table 3; or of at least 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the genes in Tables 2a and\/or 2b or in Table 3, or functional equivalents of such genes, in an appropriate cell sample from the patient, e.g., a bone marrow or peripheral blood sample obtained from the patient, wherein at least 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 genes as appropriate are from Table 2a. In a specific embodiment, the evaluation of CML progression in a patient is carried out using measurements (e.g., of the levels) of gene products of (i.e., encoded by) at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200, 300 or all of the genes in Tables 2a; or of at least 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the genes in Tables 2a, or functional equivalents of such genes. In one embodiment, if the patient expression profile is classified as a CP-CML profile, the patient is determined as in chronic phase, whereas if the patient expression profile is classified as a ADV-CML profile, the patient is determined as in an advanced phase (accelerated phase or blast crisis).","The invention also provides a list of genes that are associated with resistance to imatinib mesylate (Table 4, infra). These genes are also termed \u201cimatinib resistance genes\u201d in the application. This set of genes is called the imatinib resistance geneset. Measurements of gene products of these molecular markers, as well as of their functional equivalents, can be used for evaluating the responsiveness of a CML patient to imatinib treatment. The evaluation of responsiveness of a patient to imatinib is carried out by a method comprising determining whether the patient is likely to be responsive to imatinib treatment based on a profile of measurements (e.g., of the levels) of gene products of (i.e., encoded by) at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200 or all of the genes in Table 4; or of at least 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the genes in Table 4, or functional equivalents of such genes, in an appropriate cell sample from the patient, e.g., a bone marrow or peripheral blood sample obtained from the patient. In one embodiment, if the patient expression profile is classified as a IM-resistance profile, the patient is determined as likely to be resistant to imatinib treatment, whereas if the patient expression profile is classified as a IM-sensitive profile, the patient is determined as likely to be responsive to imatinib treatment. In a specific embodiment, a CML patient in the chronic phase is evaluated for responsiveness to imatinib treatment based on an expression profile of such imatinib resistance genes. If the patient's expression profile indicates that the patient is likely to be resistant to imatinib treatment, bone marrow transplantation and\/or other investigative treatment regimens may be assigned to the patient.","In another embodiment, the responsiveness of a CML patient to imatinib treatment can also be evaluated based on expression of phase reporters or progression genes. In this embodiment, the patient expression profile comprising measurements of phase reporter genes (Table 1a and\/or 1b) or progression genes (Table 2a and\/or 2b) is evaluated using a method described above. If the patient expression profile is classified as a ADV-CML profile, the patient is determined as likely to be resistant to imatinib treatment.","The measurements in the profiles of the gene products that are used can be any suitable measured values representative of the expression levels of the respective genes. The measurement of the expression level of a gene can be direct or indirect, e.g., directly of abundance levels of RNAs or proteins or indirectly, by measuring abundance levels of cDNAs, amplified RNAs or DNAs, proteins, or activity levels of RNAs or proteins, or other molecules (e.g., a metabolite) that are indicative of the foregoing. In one embodiment, the profile comprises measurements of abundances of the transcripts of the marker genes. The measurement of abundance can be a measurement of the absolute abundance of a gene product. The measurement of abundance can also be a value representative of the absolute abundance, e.g., a normalized abundance value (e.g., an abundance normalized against the abundance of a reference gene product) or an averaged abundance value (e.g., average of abundances obtained at different time points or from different tumor cell samples from the patients, or average of abundances obtained using different probes, etc.), or a combination of both. As an example, the measurement of abundance of a gene transcript can be a value obtained using an Affymetrix\u00ae GeneChip\u00ae to measure hybridization to the transcript.","In another embodiment, the expression profile is a differential expression profile comprising differential measurements of a plurality of transcripts in a sample derived from the patient versus measurements of the plurality of transcripts in a reference sample, e.g., a cell sample of normal cells. Each differential measurement in the profile can be but is not limited to an arithmetic difference, a ratio, or a log(ratio). As an example, the measurement of abundance of a gene transcript can be a value for the transcript obtained using an ink-jet array or a cDNA array in a two-color measurement. In a preferred embodiment, the reference sample comprise target polynucleotide molecules from normal cell samples (i.e., cell sample, e.g., bone marrow or peripheral blood, from those not afflicted with CML). In another preferred embodiment, the reference sample comprise target polynucleotide molecules from cell samples, e.g., bone marrow or peripheral blood, from chronic phase CML patients.","The invention also provides methods and computer systems for evaluating the progression of CML in a patient based on a measured marker profile comprising measurements of the markers of the present invention, e.g., an expression profile comprising measurements of transcripts of at least some of the genes listed in Tables 1a and\/or 1b, e.g., at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 100 in Tables 1a and\/or 1b or functional equivalents of such genes, wherein at least 1, 2, 3, 5 or 10 genes are from Table 1a. The methods and systems of the invention use a progression classifier for evaluating the progression of CML. The progression classifier can be based on any appropriate pattern recognition method (such as those described in Section 5.2) that receives an input comprising a marker profile and provides an output comprising data indicating which phase the patient belongs, i.e., chronic phase or advanced phase. The progression classifier can be constructed with training data from a plurality of CML patients for whom marker profiles and progression status are known. The plurality of patients used for training the progression classifier is also referred to herein as the training population. The training data comprise for each patient in the training population (a) a marker profile comprising measurements of gene products of a plurality of genes, respectively, in an appropriate cell sample, e.g., a bone marrow or peripheral blood sample, taken from the patient; and (b) progression status information (e.g., the CML phase of the patient). Various progression classifiers that can be used in conjunction with the present invention are described in Section 5.2., infra. In some embodiments, additional patients having known marker profiles and progression status can be used to test the accuracy of the progression classifier obtained using the training population. Such additional patients are also called \u201cthe testing population.\u201d","The markers in the marker sets are selected based on their ability to discriminate patients having different CML phases in a plurality of CML patients for whom the progression status are known. Various methods can be used to evaluate the correlation between marker levels and CML progression. For example, genes whose expression levels are significantly different across patients in different CML phases can be identified using an appropriate statistical method, e.g., ANOVA.","The invention also provides methods and compositions for treating a patient having CML by modulating, e.g., enhancing or reducing, the expression and\/or activities of one or more CML progression genes and\/or target genes and\/or their gene products.

The invention also provides methods and compositions for treating a patient having CML by targeting PRAME. The invention is based, at least in part, on the identification of aberrant regulation of these genes and pathways in CML.","Thus, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating CML by modulating the expression and\/or activity of CML progression genes and\/or CML target genes and\/or their gene products, and\/or by modulating interactions of the CML progression genes and\/or target genes and\/or their gene products with other proteins or molecules, e.g., substrates. The methods and compositions can be used for treating CML patient who exhibit aberrant regulation in such CML progression\/target genes. Thus, such methods and compositions can be used in conjunction with imatinib mesylate. In one embodiment, the expression of one or more of the CML progression\/target genes is modulated, e.g., reduced or enhanced, to treat a CML patient exhibiting aberrant regulation of these CML progression\/target genes. Such modulation can be achieved by, e.g., using siRNA, antisense nucleic acid, ribozyme, and\/or triple helix forming nucleic acid that target the CML progression\/target genes. In another embodiment, the activity of one or more CML progression\/target proteins is modulated, e.g., reduced or enhanced, to enhance the effects of chemotherapy agents.

2a and 2b list a set of 386 progression genes identified by searching for phase reporter genes after removing CD34 content (p<10) (the \u201cprogression geneset\u201d). The CD34 content is removed by subtracting the expression level of each gene in a sample of CD34+ cells from the expression level of the gene in a tumor sample from a CML patient. The progression genes are identified by their SEQ ID NOs in Tables 2a and 2b. Information for these genes is presented in Table 8. Table 2a lists progression genes that were not disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003\/01044026 A1, dated Jun. 5, 2003. Table 2b lists progression genes that were also identified in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003\/01044026 A1, dated Jun. 5, 2003. Tables 2a and 2b also listed for each gene the log ratio of CD34+(\u2212) expression level of the gene (i.e., the expression level of the gene in a tumor sample from a CML patient minus the expression level of the gene in a sample of CD34+ cells) in samples from patients of a particular phase (e.g., CP, AP, or BC) versus CD34+(\u2212) expression level of the gene in a pool of CML bone marrow samples from chronic phase patients.

The methods make use of measured expression profiles of a plurality of genes (e.g., measurements of abundance levels of the corresponding gene products) in bone marrow or blood samples from a plurality of patients whose CML stage\/progression status are known. As used herein, a patient is animal inflicted with CML. The patient can be but is not limited to a human, or, in a veterinary context, from non-human animals such as ruminants, horses, swine or sheep, or from domestic companion animals such as felines and canines. In one embodiment, for each of the plurality of genes a metric of correlation between expression level of the gene and survival outcome in the plurality of CML patients is determined.

In preferred embodiments, genes whose expression levels exhibit differences across different phrase groups to at least a predetermined level are selected as the genes whose expression levels correlate with CML phases.

In one embodiment, a gene is selected if the p-value of the gene corresponds to a predetermined significance level, e.g., a p-value less than 10.","The invention also provides a computer system comprising a processor, and a memory coupled to said processor and encoding one or more programs, wherein said one or more programs cause the processor to carry out a method described above.","The invention also provides a computer program product for use in conjunction with a computer having a processor and a memory connected to the processor, said computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having a computer program mechanism encoded thereon, wherein said computer program mechanism may be loaded into the memory of said computer and cause said computer to carry out a method described above.","The invention provides methods for determining the stage or progression status in a CML patient using a measured marker profile comprising measurements of the gene products of genes, e.g., the sets of genes described in Section 5.1., supra.","In preferred embodiments, the methods of the invention use a progression classifier, also called a classifier, for predicting CML progression and\/or responsiveness to imatinib mesylate in a patient. The progression classifier can be based on any appropriate pattern recognition method that receives an input comprising a marker profile and provides an output comprising data indicating which phase the patient belongs. The progression classifier can be trained with training data from a training population of CML patients. Typically, the training data comprise for each of the CML patients in the training population a training marker profile comprising measurements of respective gene products of a plurality of genes in a suitable sample taken from the patient and CML progression information. In a preferred embodiment, the training population comprises patients from each of the different stages of CML, i.e., CP-CML, ADV-CML, or AP-CML and BC-CML. In another preferred embodiment, the training population comprises patients from each of the different IM response groups, i.e., IM resistant and IM responsive.","In preferred embodiments, the progression classifier can be based on a classification (pattern recognition) method described below, e.g., profile similarity (Section 5.2.1.1., infra); artificial neural network (Section 5.2.1.2., infra); support vector machine (SVM, Section 5.2.1.3., infra); logic regression (Section 5.2.1.4., infra), linear or quadratic discriminant analysis (Section 5.2.1.5., infra), decision trees (Section 5.2.1.6., infra), clustering (Section 5.2.1.7., infra), principal component analysis (Section 5.2.1.8., infra), nearest neighbor classifier analysis (Section 5.2.1.9., infra). Such progression classifiers can be trained with the training population using methods described in the relevant sections, infra.","The marker profile can be obtained by measuring the plurality of gene products in a CML cell sample from the patient using a method known in the art, e.g., a method described in Section 5.2.4-5.2.5., infra.","Various known statistical pattern recognition methods can be used in conjunction with the present invention. A progression classifier based on any of such methods can be constructed using the marker profiles and progression data of training patients. Such a progression classifier can then be used to evaluate the progression status of a CML patient based on the patient's marker profile. The methods can also be used to identify markers that discriminate between different progression status and\/or imatinib resistance using a marker profile and progression and\/or imatinib resistance data of training patients. For simplicity, the methods are often discussed with respect to evaluation of the progression status. It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the methods are equally applicable to evaluation of IM responsiveness.","A patient's CML stage or progression status can be evaluated by comparing a marker profile obtained in a suitable sample from the patient with a marker profile that is representative of a particular CML phase. Such a marker profile is also termed a \u201ctemplate profile\u201d or a \u201ctemplate.\u201d The degree of similarity to such a template profile provides an evaluation of the patient's CML stage or progression status. If the degree of similarity of the patient marker profile and a template profile is above a predetermined threshold, the patient is assigned a CML phase or progression status represented by the template. For example, a patient's CML stage or progression status can be evaluated by comparing a marker profile of the patient to a predetermined template profile corresponding to a certain CML stage or progression status, e.g., an ADV-CML template comprising measurements of the plurality of markers which are representative of levels of the markers in a plurality of advanced phase patients or a CP-CML template comprising measurements of the plurality of markers which are representative of levels of the markers in a plurality of chronic phase patients.","In one embodiment, the similarity is represented by a correlation coefficient between the patient's profile and the template. In one embodiment, a correlation coefficient above a correlation threshold indicates a high similarity, whereas a correlation coefficient below the threshold indicates a low similarity.","In a specific embodiment, Pmeasures the similarity between the patient's profile {right arrow over (y)} and a template profile, e.g., a template profile comprising measurements of marker gene products representative of measurements of marker gene products of a level of progression of CML, e.g., the CP-CML template {right arrow over (z)}or the ADV-CML template {right arrow over (z)}. Such a coefficient, P, can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n=()\/(\u2225\u2225)\n\nwhere i designates the ith template. For example, i is CP for CP-CML template. Thus, in one embodiment, {right arrow over (y)} is classified as a CP-CML profile if Pis greater than a selected correlation threshold. In another embodiment, {right arrow over (y)} is classified as an ADV-CML profile if Pis greater than a selected correlation threshold. In preferred embodiments, the correlation threshold is set as 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6. In another embodiment, {right arrow over (y)} is classified as a CP-CML profile if Pis greater than P, whereas {right arrow over (y)} is classified as a ADV-CML profile if Pis less than P.\n","In another embodiment, the correlation coefficient is a weighted dot product of the patient's profile {right arrow over (y)} and a template profile, in which measurements of each different marker is assigned a weight.","In another embodiment, similarity between a patient's profile and a template is represented by a distance between the patient's profile and the template. In one embodiment, a distance below a given value indicates high similarity, whereas a distance equal to or greater than the given value indicates low similarity.","In one embodiment, the Euclidian distance according to the formula\n\n\u2225\n\nis used, where Dmeasures the distance between the patient's profile {right arrow over (y)} and a template profile comprising measurements of marker gene products representative of measurements of marker gene products of a level of progression of CML, e.g., the CP-CML template {right arrow over (z)}, the ADV-CML template {right arrow over (z)}or the AP-CML template {right arrow over (z)}or BC-CML template {right arrow over (z)}.

Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method for classifying an advanced phase CML patient as either AP-CML or BC-CML by comparing the distances between a marker profile of the patient with an AP-CML template and a BC-CML template, and classifying the patient as either AP-CML or BC-CML if the distance to the corresponding template is smaller.","A person skilled in the art would understand that the above described methods can be applied to expression profiles of IM resistance genes for evaluation of IM responsiveness. For example, the methods can be used to compare a patient expression profile to IM resistance template and IM responsive template by calculating a Pmeasuring the similarity between the patient's profile {right arrow over (y)} and the IM resistance template comprising measurements of marker gene products representative of measurements of marker gene products in IM resistant patients, {right arrow over (z)}, and\/or IM responsive template comprising measurements of marker gene products representative of measurements of marker gene products in IM responsive patients, {right arrow over (z)}. Such a coefficient, P, can be calculated using the equation described above.","In some embodiments, a neural network is used to classify a patient marker profile. The neural network takes the patient marker profile as an input and generates an output comprising the progression status and\/or IM responsiveness. A neural network can be constructed for a selected set of molecular markers of the invention. A neural network is a two-stage regression or classification model. A neural network has a layered structure that includes a layer of input units (and the bias) connected by a layer of weights to a layer of output units. For regression, the layer of output units typically includes just one output unit. However, neural networks can handle multiple quantitative responses in a seamless fashion.","In multilayer neural networks, there are input units (input layer), hidden units (hidden layer), and output units (output layer). There is, furthermore, a single bias unit that is connected to each unit other than the input units. Neural networks are described in Duda et al., 2001, Second Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York; and Hastie et al., 2001, Springer-Verlag, New York.","The basic approach to the use of neural networks is to start with an untrained network, present a training pattern, e.g., marker profiles from training patients, to the input layer, and to pass signals through the net and determine the output, e.g., the status of progression and\/or the status of imatinib resistance in the training patients, at the output layer. These outputs are then compared to the target values; any difference corresponds to an error. This error or criterion function is some scalar finction of the weights and is minimized when the network outputs match the desired outputs. Thus, the weights are adjusted to reduce this measure of error. For regression, this error can be sum-of-squared errors. For classification, this error can be either squared error or cross-entropy (deviation). See, e.g., Hastie et al., 2001, Springer-Verlag, New York.","Three commonly used training protocols are stochastic, batch, and on-line. In stochastic training, patterns are chosen randomly from the training set and the network weights are updated for each pattern presentation. Multilayer nonlinear networks trained by gradient descent methods such as stochastic back-propagation perform a maximum-likelihood estimation of the weight values in the model defined by the network topology. In batch training, all patterns are presented to the network before learning takes place. Typically, in batch training, several passes are made through the training data. In online training, each pattern is presented once and only once to the net.","In some embodiments, consideration is given to starting values for weights. If the weights are near zero, then the operative part of the sigmoid commonly used in the hidden layer of a neural network (see, e.g., Hastie et al., 2001, Springer-Verlag, New York) is roughly linear, and hence the neural network collapses into an approximately linear model. In some embodiments, starting values for weights are chosen to be random values near zero. Hence the model starts out nearly linear, and becomes nonlinear as the weights increase. Individual units localize to directions and introduce nonlinearities where needed. Use of exact zero weights leads to zero derivatives and perfect symmetry, and the algorithm never moves. Alternatively, starting with large weights often leads to poor solutions.","Since the scaling of inputs determines the effective scaling of weights in the bottom layer, it can have a large effect on the quality of the final solution. Thus, in some embodiments, at the outset all expression values are standardized to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one. This ensures all inputs are treated equally in the regularization process, and allows one to choose a meaningful range for the random starting weights. With standardization inputs, it is typical to take random uniform weights over the range [\u22120.7, +0.7].","A recurrent problem in the use of networks having a hidden layer is the optimal number of hidden units to use in the network. The number of inputs and outputs of a network are determined by the problem to be solved. In the present invention, the number of inputs for a given neural network can be the number of molecular markers in the selected set of molecular markers of the invention. The number of output for the neural network will typically be just one. However, in some embodiment more than one output is used so that more than just two states can be defined by the network. If too many hidden units are used in a neural network, the network will have too many degrees of freedom and is trained too long, there is a danger that the network will overfit the data. If there are too few hidden units, the training set cannot be learned. Generally speaking, however, it is better to have too many hidden units than too few. With too few hidden units, the model might not have enough flexibility to capture the nonlinearities in the data; with too many hidden units, the extra weight can be shrunk towards zero if appropriate regularization or pruning, as described below, is used. In typical embodiments, the number of hidden units is somewhere in the range of 5 to 100, with the number increasing with the number of inputs and number of training cases.","One general approach to determining the number of hidden units to use is to apply a regularization approach. In the regularization approach, a new criterion function is constructed that depends not only on the classical training error, but also on classifier complexity. Specifically, the new criterion function penalizes highly complex models; searching for the minimum in this criterion is to balance error on the training set with error on the training set plus a regularization term, which expresses constraints or desirable properties of solutions:\n\n.\n\nThe parameter \u03bb is adjusted to impose the regularization more or less strongly. In other words, larger values for \u03bb will tend to shrink weights towards zero: typically cross-validation with a validation set is used to estimate \u03bb. This validation set can be obtained by setting aside a random subset of the training population. Other forms of penalty can also be used, for example the weight elimination penalty (see, e.g., Hastie et al., 2001, Springer-Verlag, New York).\n","Another approach to determine the number of hidden units to use is to eliminate\u2014prune\u2014weights that are least needed. In one approach, the weights with the smallest magnitude are eliminated (set to zero). Such magnitude-based pruning can work, but is nonoptimal; sometimes weights with small magnitudes are important for learning and training data. In some embodiments, rather than using a magnitude-based pruning approach, Wald statistics are computed. The fundamental idea in Wald Statistics is that they can be used to estimate the importance of a hidden unit (weight) in a model. Then, hidden units having the least importance are eliminated (by setting their input and output weights to zero). Two algorithms in this regard are the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) algorithms that use second-order approximation to predict how the training error depends upon a weight, and eliminate the weight that leads to the smallest increase in training error.","Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon share the same basic approach of training a network to local minimum error at weight w, and then pruning a weight that leads to the smallest increase in the training error. The predicted functional increase in the error for a change in full weight vector \u03b4w

A remarkable property of this alternative representation is that only a subset of the points will be associated with a non-zero \u03b1. These points are called support vectors and are the points that lie closest to the separating hyperplane. The sparseness of the \u03b1 vector has several computational and learning theoretic consequences. It is important to note that neither the learning algorithm nor the decision function needs to represent explicitly the image of points in the feature space, \u03c6(X), since both use only the dot products between such images, \u03c6(X),\u03c6(X). Hence, if one were given a function K(X, Y)=\u03c6(X),\u03c6(X), one could learn and use the maximum margin hyperplane in the feature space without ever explicitly performing the mapping. For each continuous positive definite function K(X, Y) there exists a mapping \u03c6 such that K(X, Y)=\u03c6(X),\u03c6(X) for all X, Y\u03b5R(Mercer's Theorem). The function K(X, Y) is called the kernel function. The use of a kernel function allows the support vector machine to operate efficiently in a nonlinear high-dimensional feature spaces without being adversely affected by the dimensionality of that space. Indeed, it is possible to work with feature spaces of infinite dimension. Moreover, Mercer's theorem makes it possible to learn in the feature space without even knowing \u03c6 and F. The matrix K=\u03c6(X),\u03c6(X) is called the kernel matrix. Finally, note that the learning algorithm is a quadratic optimization problem that has only a global optimum. The absence of local minima is a significant difference from standard pattern recognition techniques such as neural networks. For moderate sample sizes, the optimization problem can be solved with simple gradient descent techniques. In the presence of noise, the standard maximum margin algorithm described above can be subject to overfitting, and more sophisticated techniques should be used. This problem arises because the maximum margin algorithm always finds a perfectly consistent hypothesis and does not tolerate training error. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to trade some training accuracy for better predictive power. The need for tolerating training error has led to the development the soft-margin and the margin-distribution classifiers. One of these techniques replaces the kernel matrix in the training phase as follows:\n\n\n\nwhile still using the standard kernel function in the decision phase. By tuning \u03bb, one can control the training error, and it is possible to prove that the risk of misclassifying unseen points can be decreased with a suitable choice of \u03bb.\n","If instead of controlling the overall training error one wants to control the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, it is possible to modify K as follows:\n\n\n\nwhere D is a diagonal matrix whose entries are either d or d, in locations corresponding to positive and negative examples. It is possible to prove that this technique is equivalent to controlling the size of the \u03b1in a way that depends on the size of the class, introducing a bias for larger \u03b1in the class with smaller d. This in turn corresponds to an asymmetric margin; i.e., the class with smaller d will be kept further away from the decision boundary. In some cases, the extreme imbalance of the two classes, along with the presence of noise, creates a situation in which points from the minority class can be easily mistaken for mislabeled points. Enforcing a strong bias against training errors in the minority class provides protection against such errors and forces the SVM to make the positive examples support vectors.

In such embodiments, the coefficients for the regression model are computed using, for example, a maximum likelihood approach. In particular embodiments, molecular marker data from two different clinical groups, e.g., chronic phase and advanced phase or imatinib resistant and imatinib sensitive, is used and the dependent variable is the clinical status of the patient for which molecular marker characteristic data are from.","Some embodiments of the present invention provide generalizations of the logistic regression model that handle multicategory (polychotomous) responses. Such embodiments can be used to discriminate an organism into one or three or more clinical groups, e.g., chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase. Such regression models use multicategory logit models that simultaneously refer to all pairs of categories, and describe the odds of response in one category instead of another. Once the model specifies logits for a certain (J\u22121) pairs of categories, the rest are redundant.

In other words, LDA tests whether object attributes measured in an experiment predict categorization of the objects. LDA typically requires continuous independent variables and a dichotomous categorical dependent variable. In the present invention, the expression values for the selected set of molecular markers of the invention across a subset of the training population serve as the requisite continuous independent variables. The clinical group classification of each of the members of the training population serves as the dichotomous categorical dependent variable.","LDA seeks the linear combination of variables that maximizes the ratio of between-group variance and within-group variance by using the grouping information. Implicitly, the linear weights used by LDA depend on how the expression of a molecular marker across the training set separates in the two groups (e.g., a group that has CP-CML and a group that have ADV-CMP) and how this gene expression correlates with the expression of other genes. In some embodiments, LDA is applied to the data matrix of the N members in the training sample by K genes in a combination of genes described in the present invention. Then, the linear discriminant of each member of the training population is plotted. Ideally, those members of the training population representing a first subgroup (e.g. those subjects that have CP-CML) will cluster into one range of linear discriminant values (e.g., negative) and those member of the training population representing a second subgroup (e.g. those subjects that have ADV-CML) will cluster into a second range of linear discriminant values (e.g., positive). The LDA is considered more successful when the separation between the clusters of discriminant values is larger. For more information on linear discriminant analysis, see Duda, , Second Edition, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Inc; and Hastie, 2001, Springer, N.Y.; Venables & Ripley, 1997-, Springer, N.Y.","Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) takes the same input parameters and returns the same results as LDA.

A particular combination of genes of the present invention is considered to be a good classifier in this aspect of the invention when the vectors cluster into the trait groups found in the training population. For instance, if the training population includes patients with chronic phase and advanced phase CML, a clustering classifier will cluster the population into two groups, with each group uniquely representing either chronic phase or advanced phase.","Clustering is described on pages 211-256 of Duda and Hart, 1973, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. As described in Section 6.7 of Duda, the clustering problem is described as one of finding natural groupings in a dataset. To identify natural groupings, two issues are addressed. First, a way to measure similarity (or dissimilarity) between two samples is determined. This metric (similarity measure) is used to ensure that the samples in one cluster are more like one another than they are to samples in other clusters. Second, a mechanism for partitioning the data into clusters using the similarity measure is determined.","Similarity measures are discussed in Section 6.7 of Duda, where it is stated that one way to begin a clustering investigation is to define a distance function and to compute the matrix of distances between all pairs of samples in a dataset. If distance is a good measure of similarity, then the distance between samples in the same cluster will be significantly less than the distance between samples in different clusters. However, as stated on page 215 of Duda, clustering does not require the use of a distance metric. For example, a nonmetric similarity ftmction s(x, x\u2032) can be used to compare two vectors x and x\u2032. Conventionally, s(x, x\u2032) is a symmetric function whose value is large when x and x\u2032 are somehow \u201csimilar\u201d. An example of a nonmetric similarity function s(x, x\u2032) is provided on page 216 of Duda.","Once a method for measuring \u201csimilarity\u201d or \u201cdissimilarity\u201d between points in a dataset has been selected, clustering requires a criterion function that measures the clustering quality of any partition of the data. Partitions of the data set that extremize the criterion function are used to cluster the data. See page 217 of Duda. Criterion functions are discussed in Section 6.8 of Duda.","More recently, Duda et al., Pattern Classification, 2edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York, has been published. Pages 537-563 describe clustering in detail. More information on clustering techniques can be found in Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990, Wiley, New York, N.Y.; Everitt, 1993(3d ed.), Wiley, New York, N.Y.; and Backer, 1995-, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J. Particular exemplary clustering techniques that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, hierarchical clustering (agglomerative clustering using nearest-neighbor algorithm, farthest-neighbor algorithm, the average linkage algorithm, the centroid algorithm, or the sum-of-squares algorithm), k-means clustering, fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm, and Jarvis-Patrick clustering.","Principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed to analyze gene expression data. Principal component analysis is a classical technique to reduce the dimensionality of a data set by transforming the data to a new set of variable (principal components) that summarize the features of the data. See, for example, Jolliffe, 1986, Springer, N.Y. Principal components (PCs) are uncorrelate and are ordered such that the kPC has the kth largest variance among PCs. The kPC can be interpreted as the direction that maximizes the variation of the projections of the data points such that it is orthogonal to the first k\u22121 PCs. The first few PCs capture most of the variation in the data set. In contrast, the last few PCs are often assumed to capture only the residual \u2018noise\u2019 in the data.","PCA can also be used to create a progression classifier in accordance with the present invention. In such an approach, vectors for a selected set of molecular markers of the invention can be constructed in the same manner described for clustering above. In fact, the set of vectors, where each vector represents the expression values for the select genes from a particular member of the training population, can be considered a matrix. In some embodiments, this matrix is represented in a Free-Wilson method of qualitative binary description of monomers (Kubinyi, 1990, 3, Pergamon Press, Oxford, pp 589-638), and distributed in a maximally compressed space using PCA so that the first principal component (PC) captures the largest amount of variance information possible, the second principal component (PC) captures the second largest amount of all variance information, and so forth until all variance information in the matrix has been accounted for.","Then, each of the vectors (where each vector represents a member of the training population) is plotted. Many different types of plots are possible. In some embodiments, a one-dimensional plot is made. In this one-dimensional plot, the value for the first principal component from each of the members of the training population is plotted. In this form of plot, the expectation is that members of a first group (e.g. chronic phase patients) will cluster in one range of first principal component values and members of a second group (e.g., advance phase patients) will cluster in a second range of first principal component values.","In one example, the training population comprises two groups: chronic phase patients and advanced phase patients or imatinib resistant and imatinib sensitive. The first principal component is computed using the molecular marker expression values for the select genes of the present invention across the entire training population data set. Then, each member of the training set is plotted as a function of the value for the first principal component. In this example, those members of the training population in which the first principal component is positive are the chronic phase (or imatinib sensitive) patients and those members of the training population in which the first principal component is negative are advanced phase (or imatinib resistant) patients.","In some embodiments, the members of the training population are plotted against more than one principal component. For example, in some embodiments, the members of the training population are plotted on a two-dimensional plot in which the first dimension is the first principal component and the second dimension is the second principal component. In such a two-dimensional plot, the expectation is that members of each subgroup represented in the training population will cluster into discrete groups. For example, a first cluster of members in the two-dimensional plot will represent subjects with CP-CML, a second cluster of members in the two-dimensional plot will represent subjects with ADV-CML, and so forth.","In some embodiments, the members of the training population are plotted against more than two principal components and a determination is made as to whether the members of the training population are clustering into groups that each uniquely represents a subgroup found in the training population. In some embodiments, principal component analysis is performed by using the R mva package (Anderson, 1973, Academic Press, New York 1973; Gordon, , Second Edition, Chapman and Hall, CRC, 1999.). Principal component analysis is further described in Duda, , Second Edition, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Nearest neighbor classifiers are memory-based and require no model to be fit. Given a query point x, the k training points x, r, . . . , k closest in distance to xare identified and then the point xis classified using the k nearest neighbors. Ties can be broken at random. In some embodiments, Euclidean distance in feature space is used to determine distance as:\n\n\u2225.\n\nTypically, when the nearest neighbor algorithm is used, the expression data used to compute the linear discriminant is standardized to have mean zero and variance 1. In the present invention, the members of the training population are randomly divided into a training set and a test set. For example, in one embodiment, two thirds of the members of the training population are placed in the training set and one third of the members of the training population are placed in the test set. Profiles of a selected set of molecular markers of the invention represents the feature space into which members of the test set are plotted. Next, the ability of the training set to correctly characterize the members of the test set is computed. In some embodiments, nearest neighbor computation is performed several times for a given combination of genes of the present invention. In each iteration of the computation, the members of the training population are randomly assigned to the training set and the test set. Then, the quality of the combination of genes is taken as the average of each such iteration of the nearest neighbor computation.\n","The nearest neighbor rule can be refined to deal with issues of unequal class priors, differential misclassification costs, and feature selection. Many of these refinements involve some form of weighted voting for the neighbors. For more information on nearest neighbor analysis, see Duda, , Second Edition, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Inc; and Hastie, 2001, Springer, N.Y.","Inspired by the process of biological evolution, evolutionary methods of classifier design employ a stochastic search for an optimal classifier. In broad overview, such methods create several classifiers\u2014a population\u2014from measurements of gene products of the present invention. Each classifier varies somewhat from the other. Next, the classifiers are scored on expression data across the training population. In keeping with the analogy with biological evolution, the resulting (scalar) score is sometimes called the fitness. The classifiers are ranked according to their score and the best classifiers are retained (some portion of the total population of classifiers). Again, in keeping with biological terminology, this is called survival of the fittest. The classifiers are stochastically altered in the next generation\u2014the children or offspring. Some offspring classifiers will have higher scores than their parent in the previous generation, some will have lower scores. The overall process is then repeated for the subsequent generation: The classifiers are scored and the best ones are retained, randomly altered to give yet another generation, and so on. In part, because of the ranking, each generation has, on average, a slightly higher score than the previous one. The process is halted when the single best classifier in a generation has a score that exceeds a desired criterion value. More information on evolutionary methods is found in, for example, Duda, , Second Edition, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Bagging, boosting and the random subspace method are combining techniques that can be used to improve weak classifiers. These techniques are designed for, and usually applied to, decision trees. In addition, Skurichina and Duin provide evidence to suggest that such techniques can also be useful in linear discriminant analysis.","In bagging, one samples the training set, generating random independent bootstrap replicates, constructs the classifier on each of these, and aggregates them by a simple majority vote in the final decision rule. See, for example, Breiman, 1996, Machine Learning 24, 123-140; and Efron & Tibshirani, , Chapman & Hall, New York, 1993.","In boosting, classifiers are constructed on weighted versions of the training set, which are dependent on previous classification results. Initially, all objects have equal weights, and the first classifier is constructed on this data set. Then, weights are changed according to the performance of the classifier. Erroneously classified objects (molecular markers in the data set) get larger weights, and the next classifier is boosted on the reweighted training set. In this way, a sequence of training sets and classifiers is obtained, which is then combined by simple majority voting or by weighted majority voting in the final decision. See, for example, Freund & Schapire, \u201cExperiments with a new boosting algorithm,\u201d Proceedings 13International Conference on Machine Learning, 1996, 148-156.","To illustrate boosting, consider the case where there are two phenotypic groups exhibited by the population under study, phenotype 1 (e.g., advanced phase patients), and phenotype 2 (e.g., chronic phase patients).

Preferably, the predetermined threshold level is at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, or 10-fold of the normal expression level of an aberrantly up-regulated CML target gene or less than 50%, 25%, 10% or 1% of the normal level of an aberrantly down-regulated CML target gene.

In still another embodiment, the method comprises determining a level of activity of a protein encoded by the CML target gene in a sample of a patient, and determining whether the level of activity is deviated a predetermined threshold, and an activity level deviated from a predetermined threshold level indicates aberrant regulation of the protein in the patient. A reduced activity may be a result of mutation of the CML target gene. Thus, the invention also provides a method for evaluating the status of CML target in a patient, comprising determining a mutation in a CML target gene or a protein encoded by the CML target gene in a sample from the patient, and the detection of a mutation causing the activity of the CML target protein to deviate from a predetermined threshold level indicates aberrant regulation of the protein in the patient. Preferably, the predetermined threshold level of abundance or activity is at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, or 10-fold above the normal level of abundance or activity of an aberrantly up-regulated CML target protein or less than 50%, 25%, 10% or 1% of the normal level of an aberrantly down-regulated CML target protein. In the foregoing embodiments, and the embodiments described below, the sample can be an ex vivo cell sample, e.g., cells in a cell culture, or in vivo cells.","In a specific embodiment, the method comprises determining an expression level of a CML target gene selected from the group consisting of the up-regulated genes listed in Table 3 (which is a subset of the genes listed in Table 5a) in the sample of a patient, and determining whether the expression level is above a predetermined threshold, and an expression level above a predetermined threshold level indicates aberrant regulation of the gene in the patient. Preferably, the predetermined threshold level is at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, or 10-fold of the normal expression level of the gene. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining a level of abundance of a protein encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of the up-regulated genes listed in Table 3 in a sample from a patient, and determining whether the level is above a predetermined threshold, and a level of abundance of the protein above a predetermined threshold level indicates aberrant regulation of the protein in the patient.","In another specific embodiment, the method comprises determining an expression level of a CML target gene selected from the group consisting of the down-regulated genes listed in Table 3 in the sample of a patient, and determining whether the expression level is below a predetermined threshold, and an expression level below a predetermined threshold level indicates aberrant regulation of the gene in the patient. Preferably, the predetermined threshold level is a level less than 50%, 25%, 10% or 1% of the normal expression level of the gene. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining a level of abundance of a protein encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of the down-regulated genes listed in Table 3 in a sample from a patient, and determining whether the level is below a predetermined threshold, and a level of abundance of the protein below a predetermined threshold level indicates aberrant regulation of the protein in the patient.","In one embodiment, the method comprises determining an expression level of an imatinib resistance gene (a gene listed in Table 4) in the sample of a patient, and determining whether the expression level is deviated (above or below) a predetermined threshold, and an expression level deviated from a predetermined threshold level indicates that the patient is resistant to imatinib treatment. Preferably, the predetermined threshold level is at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, or 10-fold of the normal expression level of an aberrantly up-regulated imatinib resistance gene or less than 50%, 25%, 10% or 1% of the normal level of an aberrantly down-regulated imatinib resistance gene. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining a level of abundance of an imatinib resistance protein, i.e., a protein encoded by an imatinib resistance gene, in a sample from a patient, and determining whether the level is deviated (above or below) a predetermined threshold, and a level of abundance of the protein deviated from a predetermined threshold level indicates that the patient is resistant to imatinib treatment. In still another embodiment, the method comprises determining a level of activity of a protein encoded by an imatinib resistance gene in a sample of a patient, and determining whether the level is deviated (above or below) a predetermined threshold, and an activity level deviated from a predetermined threshold level indicates that the patient is resistant to imatinib treatment. Such reduce activity may be a result of mutation of the imatinib resistance gene. Thus, the invention also provides a method for evaluating imatinib resistance in a patient, comprising determining a mutation in an imatinib resistance gene or a protein encoded by the imatinib resistance gene in a sample from the patient, and the detection of a mutation causing the activity of the imatinib resistance protein to deviate from a predetermined threshold level indicates the patient is resistant to imatinib treatment. Preferably, the predetermined threshold level of abundance or activity is at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, or 10-fold above the normal level of abundance or activity of an aberrantly up-regulated imatinib resistance protein or less than 50%, 25%, 10% or 1% of the nomal level of an aberrantly down-regulated imatinib resistance protein.","In a specific embodiment, imatinib resistance is determined according to the expression levels of one or more genes selected from the group consisting of serine threonine kinases CTRL, MAP21K14, CLK3, MAP kinase MKNK2, the tyrosine kinase oncogene FYN, TCF7 (a putatively T cell specific transcription factor), guanine nucleotide binding proteins GNAZ and GNG11, and the MAF.","Such methods may, for example, utilize reagents such as nucleotide sequences and antibodies, e.g., the CML progression nucleotide sequences, and antibodies directed against CML progression proteins, including peptide fragments thereof. Specifically, such reagents may be used, for example, for: (1) the detection of the presence of mutations in a CML progression gene, or the detection of either over- or under-expression of a CML progression gene relative to the normal expression level; and (2) the detection of either an over- or an under-abundance of a CML progression protein relative to the normal CML progression protein level. These methods are also applicable to imatinib resistance genes and\/or proteins.","The methods described herein may be performed, for example, by utilizing pre-packaged diagnostic kits comprising nucleic acid of at least one specific CML progression gene or an antibody that binds a CML progression\/target protein or an IM resistance protein described herein, which may be conveniently used, e.g., in clinical settings, to diagnose patients exhibiting CML progression\/target protein related disorder or abnormalities or exhibiting IM resistance.","For the detection of mutations in a CML progression\/target gene or an IM resistance gene, any nucleated cell can be used as a starting source for genomic nucleic acid, e.g., bone marrow or peripheral blood. For the detection of expression of a CML progression\/target gene or an IM resistance gene or CML progression\/target gene or IM resistance gene products, any cell type or tissue in which the CML progression\/target gene or the IM resistance gene is expressed may be utilized.","Nucleic acid-based detection techniques and peptide detection techniques are described in Section 5.3., infra. In one embodiment, the expression levels of one or more marker genes are measured using qRT-PCR.","The invention also provides diagnostic methods for the detection of CML cells, e.g., advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells, by detecting a cell surface expressed CML progression protein (e.g., PRAME or CD47) or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, using, for example, immunoassays wherein the CML progression protein or conserved variants or peptide fragments are detected by their interaction with an anti-CML progression protein antibody.","For example, antibodies, or fragments of antibodies, such as those described in the present invention may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells by the presence of a CML progression protein or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof on their surfaces. This can be accomplished, for example, by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled antibody (see below, this Section) coupled with light microscopic, flow cytometric, or fluorimetric detection.","The antibodies (or fragments thereof) useful in the present invention may, additionally, be employed histologically, as in immunofluorescence or immunoelectron microscopy, for in situ detection of a CML progression protein or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient, e.g., bone marrow, and applying thereto a labeled antibody of the present invention. The antibody (or fragment) is preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody (or fragment) onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of the CML progression protein, or conserved variants or peptide fragments, but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the present invention, those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods (such as staining procedures) can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.","Immunoassays for a CML progression protein or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample, such as a biological fluid, a tissue extract, freshly harvested cells, or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture, in the presence of a detectably labeled antibody capable of identifying A CML progression protein or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well-known in the art.","The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose, or other solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled antibody specific for a CML progression protein. The solid phase support may then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on solid support may then be detected by conventional means.","By \u201csolid phase support or carrier\u201d is intended any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well-known supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to an antigen or antibody. Thus, the support configuration may be spherical, as in a bead, or cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tub, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface may be flat such as a sheet, test strip, etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen, or will be able to ascertain the same by use of routine experimentation.","The binding activity of a given lot of an antibody may be determined according to well known methods. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine operative and optimal assay conditions for each determination by employing routine experimentation.","One of the ways in which the antibody specific to a CML progression protein can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to an enzyme and use in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Voller, A., \u201cThe Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\u201d, 1978, Diagnostic Horizons 2:1-7, Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication, Walkersville, Md.); Voller, A. et al., 1978, J. Clin. Pathol. 31:507-520; Butler, J. E., 1981, Meth. Enzymol. 73:482-523; Maggio, E. (ed.), 1980, Enzyme Immunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Ishikawa, E. et al., (eds.), 1981, Enzyme Immunoassay, Kgaku Shoin, Tokyo). The enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate, preferably a chromogenic substrate, in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorimetric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-5-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate, dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. The detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme. Detection may also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.","Detection may also be accomplished using any of a variety of other immunoassays. For example, by radioactively labeling the antibodies or antibody fragments, it is possible to detect a CML progression protein through the use of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (see, for example, Weintraub, B., Principles of Radioimmunoassays, Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques, The Endocrine Society, March, 1986, which is incorporated by reference herein). The radioactive isotope can be detected by such means as the use of a gamma counter or a scintillation counter or by autoradiography.","It is also possible to label the antibody with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wave length, its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine.","The antibody can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).","The antibody also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.","Likewise, a bioluminescent compound may be used to label the antibody of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in, which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.","An antibody that is specific to a CML progression protein conjugated to detectable substances can be utilized to sort advanced phase CML cells from normal cells by methods known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the advanced phase CML cells are sorted using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) is a well-known method for separating particles, including cells, based on the fluorescent properties of the particles (Kamarch, 1987, Methods Enzymol, 151:150-165). Laser excitation of fluorescent moieties in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing electromagnetic separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture.","In one embodiment, cells, e.g, cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood, obtained from a patient, e.g., a human, are incubated with fluorescently labeled antibody specific for the CML progression protein for a time sufficient to allow the labeled antibodies to bind to the cells. In an alternative embodiment, such cells are incubated with the antibody, the cells are washed, and the cells are incubated with a second labeled antibody that recognizes the CML progression protein-specific antibody. In accordance with these embodiments, the cells are washed and processed through the cell sorter, allowing separation of cells that bind both antibodies to be separated from hybrid cells that do not bind both antibodies. FACS sorted particles may be directly deposited into individual wells of 96-well or 384-well plates to facilitate separation and further characterization.","In the present invention, gene products, such as target polynucleotide molecules or proteins, are extracted from a sample taken from a CML patient. The sample may be collected in any clinically acceptable manner, but must be collected such that marker-derived polynucleotides (i.e., RNA) are preserved (if gene expression is to be measured) or proteins are preserved (if encoded proteins are to be measured). In one embodiment, bone marrow samples are used. In another embodiment, peripheral blood samples are used. In one embodiment, the pre-treatment bone marrow or peripheral blood sample from a patient is used. In another embodiment, the treatment bone marrow or peripheral blood sample from a patient after and\/or during treatment is used. In one embodiment, the unsorted bone marrow or peripheral blood sample from a patient is used. In one embodiment, the unsorted bone marrow or peripheral blood sample from a clinical chronic phase patient is used. In another embodiment, the sorted bone marrow or peripheral blood sample from a patient after and\/or during treatment is used. Other suitable samples may comprise any clinically relevant tissue sample, such as a tumor biopsy or fine needle aspirate, or a sample of body fluid, such as blood, plasma, serum, lymph, ascitic fluid, cystic fluid, or urine. The sample may be taken from a human, or, in a veterinary context, from non-human animals such as ruminants, horses, swine or sheep, or from domestic companion animals such as felines and canines.","In a specific embodiment, mRNA or nucleic acids derived therefrom (i.e., cDNA or amplified RNA or amplified DNA) are preferably labeled distinguishably from polynucleotide molecules of a reference sample, and both are simultaneously or independently hybridized to a microarray comprising some or all of the markers or marker sets or subsets described above. Alternatively, mRNA or nucleic acids derived therefrom may be labeled with the same label as the reference polynucleotide molecules, wherein the intensity of hybridization of each at a particular probe is compared.","Methods for preparing total and poly(A)+ RNA are well known and are described generally in Sambrook et al., MC\u2014A LM(2E.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)) and Ausubel et al., CPMB, vol. 2, Current Protocols Publishing, New York (1994)). Preferably, total RNA, or total mRNA (poly(A)+ RNA) is measured in the methods of the invention directly or indirectly (e.g., via measuring cDNA or cRNA).","RNA may be isolated from eukaryotic cells by procedures that involve lysis of the cells and denaturation of the proteins contained therein. Cells of interest include wild-type cells (i.e., non-cancerous), drug-exposed wild-type cells, tumor- or tumor-derived cells, modified cells, normal or tumor cell line cells, and drug-exposed modified cells. Preferably, the cells are breast cancer tumor cells.","Additional steps may be employed to remove DNA. Cell lysis may be accomplished with a nonionic detergent, followed by microcentrifugation to remove the nuclei and hence the bulk of the cellular DNA. In one embodiment, RNA is extracted from cells of the various types of interest using guanidinium thiocyanate lysis followed by CsCl centrifugation to separate the RNA from DNA (Chirgwin et al., 18:5294-5299 (1979)). Poly(A)+ RNA is selected by selection with oligo-dT cellulose (see Sambrook et al., MC\u2014A LM(2E.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). Alternatively, separation of RNA from DNA can be accomplished by organic extraction, for example, with hot phenol or phenol\/chloroform\/isoamyl alcohol.","If desired, RNase inhibitors may be added to the lysis buffer. Likewise, for certain cell types, it may be desirable to add a protein denaturation\/digestion step to the protocol.","For many applications, it is desirable to preferentially enrich mRNA with respect to other cellular RNAs, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Most mRNAs contain a poly(A) tail at their 3\u2032 end. This allows them to be enriched by affinity chromatography, for example, using oligo(dT) or poly(U) coupled to a solid support, such as cellulose or Sephadex\u2122 (see Ausubel et al., CPMB, vol. 2, Current Protocols Publishing, New York (1994). Once bound, poly(A)+ mRNA is eluted from the affinity column using 2 mM EDTA\/0.1% SDS.","In a specific embodiment, total RNA or total mRNA from cells is used in the methods of the invention. The source of the RNA can be cells of an animal, e.g., human, mammal, primate, non-human animal, dog, cat, mouse, rat, bird, etc. In specific embodiments, the method of the invention is used with a sample containing total mRNA or total RNA from 1\u00d710cells or less. In another embodiment, proteins can be isolated from the foregoing sources, by methods known in the art, for use in expression analysis at the protein level.","Probes to the homologs of the marker sequences disclosed herein can be employed preferably when non-human nucleic acid is being assayed.","The abundance levels of the gene products of the genes in a sample may be determined by any means known in the art. The levels may be determined by isolating and determining the level (i.e., amount) of nucleic acid transcribed from each marker gene. Alternatively, or additionally, the level of specific proteins encoded by a marker gene may be determined.","The levels of transcripts of specific marker genes can be accomplished by determining the amount of mRNA, or polynucleotides derived therefrom, present in a sample. Any method for determining RNA levels can be used. For example, RNA is isolated from a sample and separated on an agarose gel. The separated RNA is then transferred to a solid support, such as a filter. Nucleic acid probes representing one or more markers are then hybridized to the filter by northern hybridization, and the amount of marker-derived RNA is determined. Such determination can be visual, or machine-aided, for example, by use of a densitometer. Another method of determining RNA levels is by use of a dot-blot or a slot-blot. In this method, RNA, or nucleic acid derived therefrom, from a sample is labeled. The RNA or nucleic acid derived therefrom is then hybridized to a filter containing oligonucleotides derived from one or more marker genes, wherein the oligonucleotides are placed upon the filter at discrete, easily-identifiable locations. Hybridization, or lack thereof, of the labeled RNA to the filter-bound oligonucleotides is determined visually or by densitometer. Polynucleotides can be labeled using a radiolabel or a fluorescent (i.e., visible) label.","The levels of transcripts of particular marker genes may also be assessed by determining the level of the specific protein expressed from the marker genes. This can be accomplished, for example, by separation of proteins from a sample on a polyacrylamide gel, followed by identification of specific marker-derived proteins using antibodies in a western blot. Alternatively, proteins can be separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis systems. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is well-known in the art and typically involves isoelectric focusing along a first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis along a second dimension. See, e.g., Hames et al, 1990, GEP: A PA, IRL Press, New York; Shevchenko et al., . USA 93:1440-1445 (1996); Sagliocco et al., 12:1519-1533 (1996); Lander, 274:536-539 (1996). The resulting electropherograms can be analyzed by numerous techniques, including mass spectrometric techniques, western blotting and immunoblot analysis using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.","Alternatively, marker-derived protein levels can be determined by constructing an antibody microarray in which binding sites comprise immobilized, preferably monoclonal, antibodies specific to a plurality of protein species encoded by the cell genome. Preferably, antibodies are present for a substantial fraction of the marker-derived proteins of interest. Methods for making monoclonal antibodies are well known (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988, A: A LM, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes). In one embodiment, monoclonal antibodies are raised against synthetic peptide fragments designed based on genomic sequence of the cell. With such an antibody array, proteins from the cell are contacted to the array, and their binding is assayed with assays known in the art. Generally, the expression, and the level of expression, of proteins of diagnostic or prognostic interest can be detected through immunohistochemical staining of tissue slices or sections.","Finally, levels of transcripts of marker genes in a number of tissue specimens may be characterized using a \u201ctissue array\u201d (Kononen et al., 4(7):844-7 (1998)). In a tissue array, multiple tissue samples are assessed on the same microarray. The arrays allow in situ detection of RNA and protein levels; consecutive sections allow the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously.","In preferred embodiments, polynucleotide microarrays are used to measure expression so that the expression status of each of the markers above is assessed simultaneously. Generally, microarrays according to the invention comprise a plurality of markers informative for clinical category determination, for a particular disease or condition.","The invention also provides a microarray comprising for each of a plurality of genes, said genes being all or at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100 or 200 of the genes listed in Tables 1a and\/or 1b or any of Tables 2a-2b, 4 and 5a-5b, or all or at least 5, 10, or 15 of the genes listed in Table 3, one or more polynucleotide probes complementary and hybridizable to a sequence in said gene, wherein polynucleotide probes complementary and hybridizable to said genes constitute at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98% of the probes on said microarray. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides such a microarray wherein the plurality of genes comprises the 20 genes listed in Table 3 or the 228 genes listed in Table 4 or the 368 genes listed in Tables 5a and 5b. The microarray can be in a sealed container.","The microarrays preferably comprise at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or more of markers, or all of the markers, or any combination of markers, identified as informative for CML progression and\/or imatinib resistance, e.g., within Tables 1a and 1b or any of Tables 2a-2b, 3, 4, and 5a-5b. The actual number of informative markers the microarray comprises will vary depending upon the particular condition of interest.","In other embodiments, the invention provides polynucleotide arrays in which the CML progression markers comprise at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% of the probes on the array. In another specific embodiment, the microarray comprises a plurality of probes, wherein said plurality of probes comprise probes complementary and hybridizable to at least 75% of the CML progression markers.","General methods pertaining to the construction of microarrays comprising the marker sets and\/or subsets above are described in the following sections.","Microarrays are prepared by selecting probes which comprise a polynucleotide sequence, and then immobilizing such probes to a solid support or surface. For example, the probes may comprise DNA sequences, RNA sequences, or copolymer sequences of DNA and RNA. The polynucleotide sequences of the probes may also comprise DNA and\/or RNA analogues, or combinations thereof. For example, the polynucleotide sequences of the probes may be full or partial fragments of genomic DNA. The polynucleotide sequences of the probes may also be synthesized nucleotide sequences, such as synthetic oligonucleotide sequences. The probe sequences can be synthesized either enzymatically in vivo, enzymatically in vitro (e.g., by PCR), or non-enzymatically in vitro.","The probe or probes used in the methods of the invention are preferably immobilized to a solid support which may be either porous or non-porous. For example, the probes may be polynucleotide sequences which are attached to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane or filter covalently at either the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 end of the polynucleotide. Such hybridization probes are well known in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., MC\u2014A LM(2E.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). Alternatively, the solid support or surface may be a glass or plastic surface. In a particularly preferred embodiment, hybridization levels are measured to microarrays of probes consisting of a solid phase on the surface of which are immobilized a population of polynucleotides, such as a population of DNA or DNA mimics, or, alternatively, a population of RNA or RNA mimics. The solid phase may be a nonporous or, optionally, a porous material such as a gel.","In preferred embodiments, a microarray comprises a support or surface with an ordered array of binding (e.g., hybridization) sites or \u201cprobes\u201d each representing one of the markers described herein. Preferably the microarrays are addressable arrays, and more preferably positionally addressable arrays. More specifically, each probe of the array is preferably located at a known, predetermined position on the solid support such that the identity (i.e., the sequence) of each probe can be determined from its position in the array (i.e., on the support or surface). In preferred embodiments, each probe is covalently attached to the solid support at a single site.","Microarrays can be made in a number of ways, of which several are described below. However produced, microarrays share certain characteristics. The arrays are reproducible, allowing multiple copies of a given array to be produced and easily compared with each other. Preferably, microarrays are made from materials that are stable under binding (e.g., nucleic acid hybridization) conditions. The microarrays are preferably small, e.g., between 1 cmand 25 cm, between 12 cmand 13 cm, or 3 cm. However, larger arrays are also contemplated and may be preferable, e.g., for use in screening arrays. Preferably, a given binding site or unique set of binding sites in the microarray will specifically bind (e.g., hybridize) to the product of a single gene in a cell (e.g., to a specific mRNA, or to a specific cDNA derived therefrom). However, in general, other related or similar sequences will cross hybridize to a given binding site.","The microarrays of the present invention include one or more test probes, each of which has a polynucleotide sequence that is complementary to a subsequence of RNA or DNA to be detected. Preferably, the position of each probe on the solid surface is known. Indeed, the microarrays are preferably positionally addressable arrays. Specifically, each probe of the array is preferably located at a known, predetermined position on the solid support such that the identity (i.e., the sequence) of each probe can be determined from its position on the array (i.e., on the support or surface).","According to the invention, the microarray is an array (i.e., a matrix) in which each position represents one of the markers described herein. For example, each position can contain a DNA or DNA analogue based on genomic DNA to which a particular RNA or cDNA transcribed from that genetic marker can specifically hybridize. The DNA or DNA analogue can be, e.g., a synthetic oligomer or a gene fragment. In one embodiment, probes representing each of the markers are present on the array. In a preferred embodiment, the array comprises probes for each of the markers listed in Tables 1a and\/or 1b or any one of Tables 2a-2b, 3, 4, and 5a-5b.","As noted above, the \u201cprobe\u201d to which a particular polynucleotide molecule specifically hybridizes according to the invention contains a complementary genomic polynucleotide sequence. The probes of the microarray preferably consist of nucleotide sequences of no more than 1,000 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the probes of the array consist of nucleotide sequences of 10 to 1,000 nucleotides. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleotide sequences of the probes are in the range of 10-200 nucleotides in length and are genomic sequences of a species of organism, such that a plurality of different probes is present, with sequences complementary and thus capable of hybridizing to the genome of such a species of organism, sequentially tiled across all or a portion of such genome. In other specific embodiments, the probes are in the range of 10-30 nucleotides in length, in the range of 10-40 nucleotides in length, in the range of 20-50 nucleotides in length, in the range of 40-80 nucleotides in length, in the range of 50-150 nucleotides in length, in the range of 80-120 nucleotides in length, and most preferably are 60 nucleotides in length.","The probes may comprise DNA or DNA \u201cmimics\u201d (e.g., derivatives and analogues) corresponding to a portion of an organism's genome. In another embodiment, the probes of the microarray are complementary RNA or RNA mimics. DNA mimics are polymers composed of subunits capable of specific, Watson-Crick-like hybridization with DNA, or of specific hybridization with RNA. The nucleic acids can be modified at the base moiety, at the sugar moiety, or at the phosphate backbone. Exemplary DNA mimics include, e.g., phosphorothioates.","DNA can be obtained, e.g., by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA or cloned sequences. PCR primers are preferably chosen based on a known sequence of the genome that will result in amplification of specific fragments of genomic DNA. Computer programs that are well known in the art are useful in the design of primers with the required specificity and optimal amplification properties, such as Oligo version 5.0 (National Biosciences). Typically each probe on the microarray will be between 10 bases and 50,000 bases, usually between 300 bases and 1,000 bases in length. PCR methods are well known in the art, and are described, for example, in Innis et al., eds., PCR P: A GMA, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, Calif. (1990). It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that controlled robotic systems are useful for isolating and amplifying nucleic acids.","An alternative, preferred means for generating the polynucleotide probes of the microarray is by synthesis of synthetic polynucleotides or oligonucleotides, e.g., using N-phosphonate or phosphoramidite chemistries (Froehler et al., 14:5399-5407 (1986); McBride et al., 24:246-248 (1983)). Synthetic sequences are typically between about 10 and about 500 bases in length, more typically between about 20 and about 100 bases, and most preferably between about 40 and about 70 bases in length. In some embodiments, synthetic nucleic acids include non-natural bases, such as, but by no means limited to, inosine. As noted above, nucleic acid analogues may be used as binding sites for hybridization. An example of a suitable nucleic acid analogue is peptide nucleic acid (see, e.g., Egholm et al., 363:566-568 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,083).","Probes are preferably selected using an algorithm that takes into account binding energies, base composition, sequence complexity, cross-hybridization binding energies, and secondary structure. See Friend et al., International Patent Publication WO 01\/05935, published Jan. 25, 2001; Hughes et al., 19:342-7 (2001).","A skilled artisan will also appreciate that positive control probes, e.g., probes known to be complementary and hybridizable to sequences in the target polynucleotide molecules, and negative control probes, e.g., probes known to not be complementary and hybridizable to sequences in the target polynucleotide molecules, should be included on the array. In one embodiment, positive controls are synthesized along the perimeter of the array. In another embodiment, positive controls are synthesized in diagonal stripes across the array. In still another embodiment, the reverse complement for each probe is synthesized next to the position of the probe to serve as a negative control. In yet another embodiment, sequences from other species of organism are used as negative controls or as \u201cspike-in\u201d controls.","The probes are attached to a solid support or surface, which may be made, e.g., from glass, plastic (e.g., polypropylene, nylon), polyacrylamide, nitrocellulose, gel, or other porous or nonporous material. A preferred method for attaching the nucleic acids to a surface is by printing on glass plates, as is described generally by Schena et al, 270:467-470 (1995). This method is especially useful for preparing microarrays of cDNA (See also, DeRisi et al, 14:457-460 (1996); Shalon et al., 6:639-645 (1996); and Schena et al., 93:10539-11286 (1995)).","A second preferred method for making microarrays is by making high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Techniques are known for producing arrays containing thousands of oligonucleotides complementary to defined sequences, at defined locations on a surface using photolithographic techniques for synthesis in situ (see, Fodor et al., 1991251:767-773; Pease et al., 199491:5022-5026; Lockhart et al., 199614:1675; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,578,832; 5,556,752; and 5,510,270) or other methods for rapid synthesis and deposition of defined oligonucleotides (Blanchard et al., & 11:687-690). When these methods are used, oligonucleotides (e.g., 60-mers) of known sequence are synthesized directly on a surface such as a derivatized glass slide. Usually, the array produced is redundant, with several oligonucleotide molecules per RNA.","Other methods for making microarrays, e.g., by masking (Maskos and Southern, 199220:1679-1684), may also be used. In principle, and as noted supra, any type of array, for example, dot blots on a nylon hybridization membrane (see Sambrook et al., MC\u2014A LM(2E.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)) could be used. However, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art, very small arrays will frequently be preferred because hybridization volumes will be smaller.","In one embodiment, the arrays of the present invention are prepared by synthesizing polynucleotide probes on a support. In such an embodiment, polynucleotide probes are attached to the support covalently at either the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 end of the polynucleotide.","In a particularly preferred embodiment, microarrays are manufactured by means of an ink jet printing device for oligonucleotide synthesis, e.g., using the methods and systems described by Blanchard in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,189; Blanchard et al., 199611:687-690; Blanchard, 1998, in Synthetic DNA Arrays in Genetic Engineering, Vol. 20, J. K. Setlow, Ed., Plenum Press, New York at pages 111-123. Specifically, the oligonucleotide probes in such microarrays are preferably synthesized in arrays, e.g., on a glass slide, by serially depositing individual nucleotide bases in \u201cmicrodroplets\u201d of a high surface tension solvent such as propylene carbonate. The microdroplets have small volumes (e.g., 100 pL or less, more preferably 50 pL or less) and are separated from each other on the microarray (e.g., by hydrophobic domains) to form circular surface tension wells which define the locations of the array elements (i.e., the different probes). Microarrays manufactured by this ink-jet method are typically of high density, preferably having a density of at least about 2,500 different probes per 1 cm. The polynucleotide probes are attached to the support covalently at either the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 end of the polynucleotide.","The polynucleotide molecules which may be analyzed by the present invention (the \u201ctarget polynucleotide molecules\u201d) may be from any clinically relevant source, but are expressed RNA or a nucleic acid derived therefrom (e.g., cDNA or amplified RNA derived from cDNA that incorporates an RNA polymerase promoter), including naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules, as well as synthetic nucleic acid molecules. In one embodiment, the target polynucleotide molecules comprise RNA, including, but by no means limited to, total cellular RNA, poly(A) messenger RNA (mRNA) or fraction thereof, cytoplasmic mRNA, or RNA transcribed from cDNA (i.e., cRNA; see, e.g., Linsley & Schelter, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/411,074, filed Oct. 4, 1999, or U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,522, 5,891,636, or 5,716,785). Methods for preparing total and poly(A)RNA are well known in the art, and are described generally, e.g., in Sambrook et al., MC\u2014A LM(2E.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). In one embodiment, RNA is extracted from cells of the various types of interest in this invention using guanidinium thiocyanate lysis followed by CsCl centrifugation (Chirgwin et al., 197918:5294-5299). In another embodiment, total RNA is extracted using a silica gel-based column, commercially available examples of which include RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and StrataPrep (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). In an alternative embodiment, which is preferred for , RNA is extracted from cells using phenol and chloroform, as described in Ausubel et al., eds., 1989, CPMB, Vol. III, Green Publishing Associates, Inc., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, at pp. 13.12.1-13.12.5). Poly(A)RNA can be selected, e.g., by selection with oligo-dT cellulose or, alternatively, by oligo-dT primed reverse transcription of total cellular RNA. In one embodiment, RNA can be fragmented by methods known in the art, e.g., by incubation with ZnCl, to generate fragments of RNA. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide molecules analyzed by the invention comprise cDNA, or PCR products of amplified RNA or cDNA.","In one embodiment, total RNA, mRNA, or nucleic acids derived therefrom, is isolated from a sample taken from a CML patient. Target polynucleotide molecules that are poorly expressed in particular cells may be enriched using normalization techniques (Bonaldo et al., 19966:791-806).","As described above, the target polynucleotides are detectably labeled at one or more nucleotides. Any method known in the art may be used to detectably label the target polynucleotides. Preferably, this labeling incorporates the label uniformly along the length of the RNA, and more preferably, the labeling is carried out at a high degree of efficiency. One embodiment for this labeling uses oligo-dT primed reverse transcription to incorporate the label; however, conventional methods of this method are biased toward generating 3\u2032 end fragments. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, random primers (e.g., 9-mers) are used in reverse transcription to uniformly incorporate labeled nucleotides over the full length of the target polynucleotides. Alternatively, random primers may be used in conjunction with PCR methods or T7 promoter-based in vitro transcription methods in order to amplify the target polynucleotides.","In a preferred embodiment, the detectable label is a luminescent label. For example, fluorescent labels, bioluminescent labels, chemiluminescent labels, and colorimetric labels may be used in the present invention. In a highly preferred embodiment, the label is a fluorescent label, such as a fluorescein, a phosphor, a rhodamine, or a polymethine dye derivative. Examples of commercially available fluorescent labels include, for example, fluorescent phosphoramidites such as FluorePrime (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.), Fluoredite (Miilipore, Bedford, Mass.), FAM (ABI, Foster City, Calif.), and Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). In another embodiment, the detectable label is a radiolabeled nucleotide.","In a further preferred embodiment, target polynucleotide molecules from a patient sample are labeled differentially from target polynucleotide molecules of a reference sample. The reference can comprise target polynucleotide molecules from normal cell samples (i.e., cell sample, e.g., bone marrow or peripheral blood, from those not afflicted with CML) or from cell samples, e.g., bone marrow or peripheral blood, from chronic phase CML patients.","Nucleic acid hybridization and wash conditions are chosen so that the target polynucleotide molecules specifically bind or specifically hybridize to the complementary polynucleotide sequences of the array, preferably to a specific array site, wherein its complementary DNA is located.","Arrays containing double-stranded probe DNA situated thereon are preferably subjected to denaturing conditions to render the DNA single-stranded prior to contacting with the target polynucleotide molecules. Arrays containing single-stranded probe DNA (e.g., synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleic acids) may need to be denatured prior to contacting with the target polynucleotide molecules, e.g., to remove hairpins or dimers which form due to self complementary sequences.","Optimal hybridization conditions will depend on the length (e.g., oligomer versus polynucleotide greater than 200 bases) and type (e.g., RNA, or DNA) of probe and target nucleic acids. One of skill in the art will appreciate that as the oligonucleotides become shorter, it may become necessary to adjust their length to achieve a relatively uniform melting temperature for satisfactory hybridization results. General parameters for specific (i.e., stringent) hybridization conditions for nucleic acids are described in Sambrook et al., MC\u2014A LM(2E.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), and in Ausubel et al., CPMB, vol. 2, Current Protocols Publishing, New York (1994). Typical hybridization conditions for the cDNA microarrays of Schena et al. are hybridization in 5\u00d7SSC plus 0.2% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. for four hours, followed by washes at 25\u00b0 C. in low stringency wash buffer (1\u00d7SSC plus 0.2% SDS), followed by 10 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. in higher stringency wash buffer (0.1\u00d7SSC plus 0.2% SDS) (Schena et al., 93:10614 (1993)). Useful hybridization conditions are aiso provided in, e.g., Tijessen, 1993, HWNAP, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.; and Kricka, 1992, NDNA PT, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.","Particularly preferred hybridization conditions include hybridization at a temperature at or near the mean melting temperature of the probes (e.g., within 51\u00b0 C., more preferably within 21\u00b0 C.) in 1 M NaCl, 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5), 0.5% sodium sarcosine and 30% formamide.","When fluorescently labeled gene products are used, the fluorescence emissions at each site of a microarray may be, preferably, detected by scanning confocal laser microscopy. In one embodiment, a separate scan, using the appropriate excitation line, is carried out for each of the two fluorophores used. Alternatively, a laser may be used that allows simultaneous specimen illumination at wavelengths specific to the two fluorophores and emissions from the two fluorophores can be analyzed simultaneously (see Shalon et al., 1996, \u201cA DNA microarray system for analyzing complex DNA samples using two-color fluorescent probe hybridization,\u201d 6:639-645, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the arrays are scanned with a laser fluorescent scanner with a computer controlled X-Y stage and a microscope objective. Sequential excitation of the two fluorophores is achieved with a multi-line, mixed gas laser and the emitted light is split by wavelength and detected with two photomultiplier tubes. Fluorescence laser scanning devices are described in Schena et al., 6:639-645 (1996), and in other references cited herein. Alternatively, the fiber-optic bundle described by Ferguson et al., 14:1681-1684 (1996), may be used to monitor mRNA abundance levels at a large number of sites simultaneously.","In addition to microarrays such as those described above any technique known to one of skill for detecting and measuring RNA can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention. Non-limiting examples of techniques include Northern blotting, nuclease protection assays, RNA fingerprinting, polymerase chain reaction, ligase chain reaction, Qbeta replicase, isothermal amplification method, strand displacement amplification, transcription based amplification systems, nuclease protection (S1 nuclease or RNAse protection assays), SAGE as well as methods disclosed in International Publication Nos. WO 88\/10315 and WO 89\/06700, and International Applications Nos. PCT\/US87\/00880 and PCT\/US89\/01025.","A standard Northern blot assay can be used to ascertain an RNA transcript size, identify alternatively spliced RNA transcripts, and the relative amounts of mRNA in a sample, in accordance with conventional Northern hybridization techniques known to those persons of ordinary skill in the art. In Northern blots, RNA samples are first separated by size via electrophoresis in an agarose gel under denaturing conditions. The RNA is then transferred to a membrane, crosslinked and hybridized with a labeled probe. Nonisotopic or high specific activity radiolabeled probes can be used including random-primed, nick-translated, or PCR-generated DNA probes, in vitro transcribed RNA probes, and oligonucleotides. Additionally, sequences with only partial homology (e.g., cDNA from a different species or genomic DNA fragments that might contain an exon) may be used as probes. The labeled probe, e.g., a radiolabelled cDNA, either containing the full-length, single stranded DNA or a fragment of that DNA sequence may be at least 20, at least 30, at least 50, or at least 100 consecutive nucleotides in length. The probe can be labeled by any of the many different methods known to those skilled in this art. The labels most commonly employed for these studies are radioactive elements, enzymes, chemicals that fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light, and others. A number of fluorescent materials are known and can be utilized as labels. These include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, auramine, Texas Red, AMCA blue and Lucifer Yellow. A particular detecting material is anti-rabbit antibody prepared in goats and conjugated with fluorescein through an isothiocyanate. Proteins can also be labeled with a radioactive element or with an enzyme. The radioactive label can be detected by any of the currently available counting procedures. Non-limiting examples of isotopes include H, C, P, S, Cl, Cr, Co, Co, Fe, Y, I, I, and Re. Enzyme labels are likewise useful, and can be detected by any of the presently utilized colorimetric, spectrophotometric, fluorospectrophotometric, amperometric or gasometric techniques. The enzyme is conjugated to the selected particle by reaction with bridging molecules such as carbodiimides, diisocyanates, glutaraldehyde and the like. Any enzymes known to one of skill in the art can be utilized. Examples of such enzymes include, but are not limited to, peroxidase, beta-D-galactosidase, urease, glucose oxidase plus peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,654,090, 3,850,752, and 4,016,043 are referred to by way of example for their disclosure of alternate labeling material and methods.","Nuclease protection assays (including both ribonuclease protection assays and S1 nuclease assays) can be used to detect and quantitate specific mRNAs. In nuclease protection assays, an antisense probe (labeled with, e.g., radiolabeled or nonisotopic) hybridizes in solution to an RNA sample. Following hybridization, single-stranded, unhybridized probe and RNA are degraded by nucleases. An acrylamide gel is used to separate the remaining protected fragments. Typically, solution hybridization is more efficient than membrane-based hybridization, and it can accommodate up to 100 \u03bcg of sample RNA, compared with the 20-30 \u03bcg maximum of blot hybridizations.","The ribonuclease protection assay, which is the most common type of nuclease protection assay, requires the use of RNA probes. Oligonucleotides and other single-stranded DNA probes can only be used in assays containing S1 nuclease. The single-stranded, antisense probe must typically be completely homologous to target RNA to prevent cleavage of the probe:target hybrid by nuclease.","Serial Analysis Gene Expression (SAGE), which is described in e.g., Velculescu et al., 1995270:484-7; Carulli, et al., 199830\/31:286-96, can also be used to determine RNA abundances in a cell sample.","Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) can also be used to determine the expression profiles of marker genes (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005\/0048542A1). The first step in gene expression profiling by RT-PCR is the reverse transcription of the RNA template into cDNA, followed by its exponential amplification in a PCR reaction. The two most commonly used reverse transcriptases are avilo myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MLV-RT). The reverse transcription step is typically primed using specific primers, random hexamers, or oligo-dT primers, depending on the circumstances and the goal of expression profiling. For example, extracted RNA can be reverse-transcribed using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer, Calif., USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The derived cDNA can then be used as a template in the subsequent PCR reaction.","Although the PCR step can use a variety of thermostable DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, it typically employs the Taq DNA polymerase, which has a 5\u2032-3\u2032 nuclease activity but lacks a 3\u2032-5\u2032 proofreading endonuclease activity. Thus, TaqMan\u00ae PCR typically utilizes the 5\u2032-nuclease activity of Taq or Tth polymerase to hydrolyze a hybridization probe bound to its target amplicon, but any enzyme with equivalent 5\u2032 nuclease activity can be used. Two oligonucleotide primers are used to generate an amplicon typical of a PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide, or probe, is designed to detect nucleotide sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non-extendible by Taq DNA polymerase enzyme, and is labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser-induced emission from the reporter dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they are on the probe. During the amplification reaction, the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template-dependent manner. The resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution, and signal from the released reporter dye is free from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized, and detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data.","TaqMan\u00ae RT-PCR can be performed using commercially available equipment, such as, for example, ABI PRISM 7700\u2122. Sequence Detection System\u2122 (Perkin-Elmer-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA), or Lightcycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). In a preferred embodiment, the 5\u2032 nuclease procedure is run on a real-time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI PRISM 7700\u2122 Sequence Detection System\u2122. The system consists of a thermocycler, laser, charge-coupled device (CCD), camera and computer. The system includes software for running the instrument and for analyzing the data.","5\u2032-Nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct, or the threshold cycle. Fluorescence values are recorded during every cycle and represent the amount of product amplified to that point in the amplification reaction. The point when the fluorescent signal is first recorded as statistically significant is the threshold cycle (Ct).","To minimize errors and the effect of sample-to-sample variation, RT-PCR is usually performed using an internal standard. The ideal internal standard is expressed at a constant level among different tissues, and is unaffected by the experimental treatment. RNAs most frequently used to normalize patterns of gene expression are mRNAs for the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and \u03b2-actin.","A more recent variation of the RT-PCR technique is the real time quantitative PCR, which measures PCR product accumulation through a dual-labeled fluorigenic probe (i.e., TaqMan\u00ae probe). Real time PCR is compatible both with quantitative competitive PCR, where internal competitor for each target sequence is used for normalization, and with quantitative comparative PCR using a normalization gene contained within the sample, or a housekeeping gene for RT-PCR. For further details see, e.g. Held et al., Genome Research 6:986-994 (1996).","Measurement of the translational state may be performed according to several methods. For example, whole genome monitoring of protein (e.g., the \u201cproteome,\u201d) can be carried out by constructing a microarray in which binding sites comprise immobilized, preferably monoclonal, antibodies specific to a plurality of protein species encoded by the cell genome. Preferably, antibodies are present for a substantial fraction of the encoded proteins, or at least for those proteins relevant to the action of a drug of interest. Methods for making monoclonal antibodies are well known (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes). In one embodiment, monoclonal antibodies are raised against synthetic peptide fragments designed based on genomic sequence of the cell. With such an antibody array, proteins from the cell are contacted to the array and their binding is assayed with assays known in the art.","Immunoassays known to one of skill in the art can be used to detect and quantify protein levels. For example, ELISAs can be used to detect and quantify protein levels. ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, an ELISA may be performed by coating a high binding 96-well microtiter plate (Costar) with 2 \u03bcg\/ml of rhu-IL-9 in PBS overnight. Following three washes with PBS, the plate is incubated with three-fold serial dilutions of Fab at 25\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. Following another three washes of PBS, 1 \u03bcg\/ml anti-human kappa-alkaline phosphatase-conjugate is added and the plate is incubated for 1 hour at 25\u00b0 C. Following three washes with PBST, the alkaline phosphatase activity is determined in 50 \u03bcl\/AMP\/PPMP substrate. The reactions are stopped and the absorbance at 560 nm is determined with a VMAX microplate reader. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","Protein levels may be determined by Western blot analysis. Further, protein levels as well as the phosphorylation of proteins can be determined by immunoprecitation followed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1 to 4 hours) at 40\u00b0 C., adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 40\u00b0 C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%-20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, incubating the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), incubating the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, incubating the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., P or I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","Protein expression levels can also be separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis systems. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is well-known in the art and typically involves iso-electric focusing along a first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis along a second dimension. See, e.g., Hames et al., 1990, IRL Press, New York; Shevchenko et al., 199693:1440-1445; Sagliocco et al., 199612:1519-1533; Lander, 1996274:536-539. The resulting electropherograms can be analyzed by numerous techniques, including mass spectrometric techniques, Western blotting and immunoblot analysis using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and internal and N-terminal micro-sequencing.","The invention provides methods and compositions for utilizing CML target genes listed in Table 3 or 5a or 5b and or imatinib resistance genes listed in Table 4 in treating CML. The methods and compositions are used for treating CML patient exhibiting aberrant regulation of one or more CML target\/progression genes or IM resistance genes by modulating the expression and\/or activity of such genes and\/or the encoded proteins. The methods and composition can be used in conjunction with other CML treatment, e.g., imatinib mesylate. The compositions (e.g., agents that modulate expression and\/or activity of the CML target gene or gene product) of the invention are preferably purified. In the following, for simplicity reasons, the methods are often described with reference to CML target gene(s). It will be understood that the methods are equally applicable to CML progression genes and IM resistance genes.","In one embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating a CML patient exhibiting an aberrant up-regulation of a CML target gene by reducing the expression and\/or activity of the gene, and\/or its encoded protein by at least 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 6 fold, 8 fold or 9 fold.","In a specific embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating a CML patient exhibiting an aberrant up-regulation of a CML target gene as listed in Table 5a or 5b by reducing the expression and\/or activity of the gene, and\/or its encoded protein.","In another embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating a CML patient exhibiting an aberrant down-regulation of a CML target gene by enhancing the expression and\/or activity of the gene, and\/or its encoded protein by at least 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 6 fold, 8 fold or 9 fold.","In a specific embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating a CML patient exhibiting an aberrant down-regulation of a CML target gene as listed in Table 5a or 5b by enhancing the expression and\/or activity of the gene, and\/or its encoded protein.","In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating CML by administering to a patient (i) an agent that modulates the expression and\/or activity of an imatinib resistance gene and\/or the encoded protein, and (ii) a therapeutically sufficient amount of imatinib mesylate.","In another embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating a CML patient exhibiting aberrant regulation of a plurality of different CML target gene as listed in Tables 5a and 5b by modulating the expression and\/or activity of the plurality of genes, and\/or its encoded proteins. In one embodiment, a CML patient exhibiting aberrant up-regulation of a plurality of CML progression gene listed in Tables 5a and 5b, e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or more different CML target genes, is treated by administering to the patient one or more agents that reduce the expression and\/or activities of these genes, and\/or their encoded proteins.","A variety of therapeutic approaches may be used in accordance with the invention to modulate expression of a CML target gene or imatinib resistance gene and\/or its encoded protein in vivo. For example, siRNA molecules may be engineered and used to silence a CML target gene in vivo. Antisense DNA molecules may also be engineered and used to block translation of a CML target mRNA in vivo. Alternatively, ribozyme molecules may be designed to cleave and destroy the mRNAs of a CML target gene in vivo. In another alternative, oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to the 5\u2032 region of the CML target gene (including the region upstream of the coding sequence) and form triple helix structures may be used to block or reduce transcription of the CML target gene. The expression and\/or activity of a CML target protein can be modulated using antibody, peptide or polypeptide molecules, and small organic or inorganic molecules. In the following, for simplicity, methods are described in reference to a CML target gene or protein. These methods are equally applicable to imatinib resistance genes.","In a preferred embodiment, RNAi is used to knock down the expression of a CML target gene. In one embodiment, double-stranded RNA molecules of 21-23 nucleotides which hybridize to a homologous region of mRNAs transcribed from the CML target gene are used to degrade the mRNAs, thereby \u201csilence\u201d the expression of the CML target gene. The method can be used to reduce expression levels of aberrantly up-regulated CML target genes. Preferably, the dsRNAs have a hybridizing region, e.g., a 19-nucleotide double-stranded region, which is complementary to a sequence of the coding sequence of the CML target gene. Any siRNA that targets an appropriate coding sequence of a CML target gene and exhibit a sufficient level of silencing can be used in the invention. As exemplary embodiments, 21-nucleotide double-stranded siRNAs targeting the coding regions of a CML target gene are designed according to selection rules known in the art (see, e.g., Elbashir et al., 200226:199-213; International Application No. PCT\/US04\/35636, filed Oct. 27, 2004, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In a preferred embodiment, the siRNA or siRNAs specifically inhibit the translation or transcription of a CML target protein without substantially affecting the translation or transcription of genes encoding other protein kinases in the same kinase family. In a specific embodiment, siRNAs targeting an up-regulated gene listed in Table 4 are used to silence the respective CML target genes.","The invention also provides methods and compositions for treating a CML patient exhibiting aberrant up-regulation of a plurality of CML target genes as listed in Tables 5a and 5b by reducing the expression and\/or activities of these genes, and\/or their encoded proteins. In one embodiment, a CML patient exhibiting aberrant up-regulation of a plurality of CML target gene listed in Tables 5a and 5b, e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or more different CML target genes, is treated by administering to the patient one or more agents that reduce the expression and\/or activities of these genes, and\/or their encoded proteins. In a preferred embodiment, an siRNA is used to silence the plurality of different CML target genes. The sequence of the siRNA is chosen such that the transcript of each of the genes comprises a nucleotide sequence that is identical to a central contiguous nucleotide sequence of at least 11 nucleotides of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the siRNA, and\/or comprises a nucleotide sequence that is identical to a contiguous nucleotide sequence of at least 9 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the siRNA. Thus, when administrated to the patient, the siRNA silences all of the plurality of genes in cells of the patient. In preferred embodiments, the central contiguous nucleotide sequence of the siRNA that is identical to one or more CML target genes is 11-15, 14-15, 11, 12, or 13 nucleotides in length. In other preferred embodiments, the 3\u2032 contiguous nucleotide sequence of the siRNA that is identical to one or more CML target genes is 9-15, 9-12, 11, 10, or 9 nucleotides in length. The length and nucleotide base sequence of the target sequence of each different target gene, i.e., the sequence of the gene that is identical to an appropriate sense or antisense sequence of the siRNA, can be different from gene to gene. For example, gene A may have a sequence of 11 nucleotides identical to the nucleotide sequence 3-13 of the sense strand of the siRNA, while gene B may have a sequence of 12 nucleotides identical to the nucleotide sequence 4-15 of the sense strand of the siRNA. Thus, a single siRNA may be designed to silence a large number of CML target genes in cells.","RNAi can be carried out using any standard method for introducing nucleic acids into cells. In one embodiment, gene silencing is induced by presenting the cell with one or more siRNAs targeting the CML target gene (see, e.g., Elbashir et al., 2001411, 494-498; Elbashir et al., 200115, 188-200, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). The siRNAs can be chemically synthesized, or derived from cleavage of double-stranded RNA by recombinant Dicer. Another method to introduce a double stranded DNA (dsRNA) for silencing of the CML target gene is shRNA, for short hairpin RNA (see, e.g., Paddison et al., 200216, 948-958; Brummelkamp et al., 2002296, 550-553; Sui, G. et al. 200299, 5515-5520, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). In this method, a siRNA targeting a CML target gene is expressed from a plasmid (or virus) as an inverted repeat with an intervening loop sequence to form a hairpin structure. The resulting RNA transcript containing the hairpin is subsequently processed by Dicer to produce siRNAs for silencing. Plasmid- or virus-based shRNAs can be expressed stably in cells, allowing long-term gene silencing in cells both in vitro and in vivo (see, McCaffrey et al. 2002418, 38-39; Xia et al., 200220, 1006-1010; Lewis et al., 200232, 107-108; Rubinson et al., 200333, 401-406; Tiscornia et al., 2003100, 1844-1848, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). Such plasmid- or virus-based shRNAs can be delivered using a gene therapy approach. SiRNAs targeting the CML target gene can also be delivered to an organ or tissue in a mammal, such a human, in vivo (see, e.g., Song et al. 20039, 347-351; Sorensen et al., 2003327, 761-766; Lewis et al., 200232, 107-108, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). In this method, a solution of siRNA is injected intravenously into the mammal. The siRNA can then reach an organ or tissue of interest and effectively reduce the expression of the target gene in the organ or tissue of the mammal.","In preferred embodiments, an siRNA pool (mixture) containing at least k (k=2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 10) different siRNAs targeting a CML target gene at different sequence regions is used to silence the gene. In a preferred embodiment, the total siRNA concentration of the pool is about the same as the concentration of a single siRNA when used individually. As used herein, the word \u201cabout\u201d with reference to concentration means within 20%. Preferably, the total concentration of the pool of siRNAs is an optimal concentration for silencing the intended target gene. An optimal concentration is a concentration further increase of which does not increase the level of silencing substantially. In one embodiment, the optimal concentration is a concentration further increase of which does not increase the level of silencing by more than 5%, 10% or 20%. In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the pool, including the number of different siRNAs in the pool and the concentration of each different siRNA, is chosen such that the pool of siRNAs causes less than 30%, 20%, 10% or 5%, 1%, 0.1% or 0.01% of silencing of any off-target genes (e.g., as determined by standard nucleic acid assay, e.g., PCR). In another preferred embodiment, the concentration of each different siRNA in the pool of different siRNAs is about the same. In still another preferred embodiment, the respective concentrations of different siRNAs in the pool are different from each other by less than 5%, 10%, 20% or 50% of the concentration of any one siRNA or said total siRNA concentration of said different siRNAs. In still another preferred embodiment, at least one siRNA in the pool of different siRNAs constitutes more than 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, or 20% of the total siRNA concentration in the pool. In still another preferred embodiment, none of the siRNAs in the pool of different siRNAs constitutes more than 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, or 20% of the total siRNA concentration in the pool. In other embodiments, each siRNA in the pool has a concentration that is lower than the optimal concentration when used individually. In a preferred embodiment, each different siRNA in the pool has an concentration that is lower than the concentration of the siRNA that is effective to achieve at least 30%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% silencing when used in the absence of other siRNAs or in the absence of other siRNAs designed to silence the gene. In another preferred embodiment, each different siRNA in the pool has a concentration that causes less than 30%, 20%, 10% or 5% of silencing of the gene when used in the absence of other siRNAs or in the absence of other siRNAs designed to silence the gene. In a preferred embodiment, each siRNA has a concentration that causes less than 30%, 20%, 10% or 5% of silencing of the target gene when used alone, while the plurality of siRNAs causes at least 80% or 90% of silencing of the target gene. In specific embodiments, a pool containing the 3 different is used for targeting a CML target gene. More detailed descriptions of techniques for carrying out RNAi are also presented in Section 5.6.","In other embodiments, antisense, ribozyme, and triple helix forming nucleic acid are designed to inhibit the translation or transcription of a CML target protein or gene with minimal effects on the expression of other genes that may share one or more sequence motif with the CML target gene. To accomplish this, the oligonucleotides used should be designed on the basis of relevant sequences unique to a CML target gene. In one embodiment, the oligonucleotide used specifically inhibits the translation or transcription of a CML target protein or gene without substantially affecting the translation or transcription of other proteins in the same protein family.","For example, and not by way of limitation, the oligonucleotides should not fall within those regions where the nucleotide sequence of a CML target gene is most homologous to that of other genes. In the case of antisense molecules, it is preferred that the sequence be at least 18 nucleotides in length in order to achieve sufficiently strong annealing to the target mRNA sequence to prevent translation of the sequence. Izant et al., 1984, Cell, 36:1007-1015; Rosenberg et al., 1985, Nature, 313:703-706.","Ribozymes are RNA molecules which possess highly specific endoribonuclease activity. Hammerhead ribozymes comprise a hybridizing region which is complementary in nucleotide sequence to at least part of the target RNA, and a catalytic region which is adapted to cleave the target RNA. The hybridizing region contains nine (9) or more nucleotides. Therefore, the hammerhead ribozymes useful for targeting a CML target gene having a hybridizing region which is complementary to the sequences of the target gene and is at least nine nucleotides in length. The construction and production of such ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff et al., 1988, Nature, 334:585-591.","The ribozymes of the present invention also include RNA endoribonucleases (hereinafter \u201cCech-type ribozymes\u201d) such as the one which occurs naturally in Tetrahymena Thermophila (known as the IVS, or L-19 IVS RNA) and which has been extensively described by Thomas Cech and collaborators (Zaug, et al., 1984, Science, 224:574-578; Zaug and Cech, 1986, Science, 231:470-475; Zaug, et al., 1986, Nature, 324:429-433; published International patent application No. WO 88\/04300 by University Patents Inc.; Been et al., 1986, Cell, 47:207-216). The Cech endoribonucleases have an eight base pair active site which hybridizes to a target RNA sequence whereafter cleavage of the target RNA takes place.","In the case of oligonucleotides that hybridize to and form triple helix structures at the 5\u2032 terminus of a CML target gene and can be used to block transcription, it is preferred that they be complementary to those sequences in the 5\u2032 terminus of a CML target gene which are not present in other related genes. It is also preferred that the sequences not include those regions of the promoter of a CML target gene which are even slightly homologous to that of other related genes.","The foregoing compounds can be administered by a variety of methods which are known in the art including, but not limited to the use of liposomes as a delivery vehicle. Naked DNA or RNA molecules may also be used where they are in a form which is resistant to degradation such as by modification of the ends, by the formation of circular molecules, or by the use of alternate bonds including phosphothionate and thiophosphoryl modified bonds. In addition, the delivery of nucleic acid may be by facilitated transport where the nucleic acid molecules are conjugated to poly-lysine or transferrin. Nucleic acid may also be transported into cells by any of the various viral carriers, including but not limited to, retrovirus, vaccinia, AAV, and adenovirus.","Alternatively, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule which encodes, or is, such antisense nucleic acid, ribozyme, triple helix forming nucleic acid, or nucleic acid molecule of a CML target gene can be constructed. This nucleic acid molecule may be either RNA or DNA. If the nucleic acid encodes an RNA, it is preferred that the sequence be operatively attached to a regulatory element so that sufficient copies of the desired RNA product are produced. The regulatory element may permit either constitutive or regulated transcription of the sequence. In vivo, that is, within the cells or cells of an organism, a transfer vector such as a bacterial plasmid or viral RNA or DNA, encoding one or more of the RNAs, may be transfected into cells e.g. (Llewellyn et al., 1987, J. Mol. Biol., 195:115-123; Hanahan et al. 1983, J. Mol. Biol., 166:557-580). Once inside the cell, the transfer vector may replicate, and be transcribed by cellular polymerases to produce the RNA or it may be integrated into the genome of the host cell. Alternatively, a transfer vector containing sequences encoding one or more of the RNAs may be transfected into cells or introduced into cells by way of micromanipulation techniques such as microinjection, such that the transfer vector or a part thereof becomes integrated into the genome of the host cell.","The activity of a CML target protein can be modulated by modulating the interaction of a CML target protein with its binding partners. In one embodiment, agents, e.g., antibodies, peptides, aptamers, small organic or inorganic molecules, can be used to inhibit binding of a CML target protein binding partner to treat CML. In another embodiment, agents, e.g., antibodies, aptamers, small organic or inorganic molecules, can be used to inhibit the activity of a CML target protein to treat CML.","In other embodiments, when the CML target protein is a kinase, the invention provides small molecule inhibitors of the CML target protein. A small molecule inhibitor is a low molecular weight phosphorylation inhibitor. As used herein, a small molecule refers to an organic or inorganic molecule having a molecular weight is under 1000 Daltons, preferably in the range between 300 to 700 Daltons, which is not a nucleic acid molecule or a peptide molecule. The small molecule can be naturally occurring, e.g., extracted from plant or microorganisms, or non-naturally occurring, e.g., generated de novo by synthesis. A small molecule that is an inhibitor can be used to block a cellular process that dependent on a CML target protein. In one embodiment, the inhibitors are substrate Mimics. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitor of the CML target proteins is an ATP mimic. In one embodiment, such ATP mimics possess at least two aromatic rings. In a preferred embodiment, the ATP mimic comprises a moiety that forms extensive contacts with residues lining the ATP binding cleft of the CML target protein and\/or peptide segments just outside the cleft, thereby selectively blocking the ATP binding site of the CML target protein. Minor structural differences from ATP can be introduced into the ATP mimic based on the peptide segments just outside the cleft. Such differences can lead to specific hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the peptide segments just outside the cleft.","In still other embodiments, antibodies that specifically bind the CML target protein are used. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides antibodies that specifically bind the extracellular domain of a CML target protein that is a receptor. Antibodies that specifically bind a target can be obtained using standard method known in the art, e.g., a method described in Section 5.8.","In one embodiment, an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an antibody that specifically binds a CML target protein is used. The efficacy of the antibodies that targets specific molecules expressed by advanced phase immature myeloid cells can be increased by attaching toxins to them. Existing immunotoxins are based on bacterial toxins like pseudomonas exotoxin, plant exotoxin like ricin or radio-nucleotides. The toxins are chemically conjugated to a specific ligand such as the variable domain of the heavy or light chain of the monoclonal antibody. Normal cells lacking the cancer specific antigens are not targeted by the targeted antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the CML target protein target is PRAME.","In other embodiments, a peptide and peptidomimetic that interferes with the interaction of a CML target protein with its interaction partner is used. A peptide preferably has a size of at least 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 amino acids. Such a peptide or peptidomimetic can be designed by a person skilled in the art based on the sequence and structure of a CML target protein. In one embodiment, a peptide or peptidomimetic that interferes with substrate binding of a CML target protein is used. In another embodiment, peptide or peptidomimetic that interferes with the binding of a signal molecule to a CML target protein is used. In some embodiments of the invention, a fragment or polypeptide of at least 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 amino acids in length of a CML target protein are used. In a specific embodiment, a peptide or peptidomimetic that interferes with the interaction with PRAME is used. The peptide can be prepared by standard method known in the art.","In another embodiment, a dominant negative mutant of a CML target protein is used to reduce activity of a CML target protein. Such a dominant negative mutant can be designed by a person skilled in the art based on the sequence and structure of a CML target protein. In one embodiment, a dominant negative mutant that interferes with substrate binding of a CML target protein is used. In another embodiment, a dominant negative mutant that interferes with the binding of a signal molecule to a CML target protein is used. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a dominant negative mutant that comprises the C-terminal region of a CML target protein. In another embodiment, the invention provides a dominant negative mutant that comprises the N-terminal region of the CML target protein.","Gene therapy can be used for delivering any of the above described nucleic acid and protein\/peptide therapeutics into target cells. Gene therapy is particularly useful for enhancing aberrantly down-regulated genes. Exemplary methods for carrying out gene therapy are described below. For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., 1993, Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, Biotherapy 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 1993, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596; Mulligan, 1993, Science 260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 1993, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217; May, 1993, TIBTECH 11 (5):155-215). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York; and Kriegler, 1990, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, New York.","In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic comprises a nucleic acid that is part of an expression vector that expresses a the therapeutic nucleic acid or peptide\/polypeptide in a suitable host. In particular, such a nucleic acid has a promoter operably linked to the coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule is used in which the coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the CML target nucleic acid (see e.g., Koller and Smithies, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:8932-8935; Zijlstra et al., 1989, Nature 342:435-438).","Delivery of the nucleic acid into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vector, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acid in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid is directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by infection using a defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering it in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (see e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid-ligand complex can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180 dated Apr. 16, 1992 (Wu et al.); WO 92\/22635 dated Dec. 23, 1992 (Wilson et al.); WO92\/20316 dated Nov. 26, 1992 (Findeis et al.); WO93\/14188 dated Jul. 22, 1993 (Clarke et al.), WO 93\/20221 dated Oct. 14, 1993 (Young)). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:8932-8935; Zijlstra et al., 1989, Nature 342:435-438).","In a specific embodiment, a viral vector that contains the nucleic acid of a CML target gene is used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., 1993, Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599). These retroviral vectors have been modified to delete retroviral sequences that are not necessary for packaging of the viral genome and integration into host cell DNA. The CML target nucleic acid to be used in gene therapy is cloned into the vector, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., 1994, Biotherapy 6:291-302, which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdrl gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., 1994, J. Clin. Invest. 93:644-651; Kiem et al., 1994, Blood 83:1467-1473; Salmons and Gunzberg, 1993, Human Gene Therapy 4:129-141; and Grossman and Wilson, 1993, Curr. Opin. Genet. and Devel. 3:110-114.","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson (1993, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al. (1994, Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., 1991, Science 252:431-434; Rosenfeld et al., 1992, Cell 68:143-155; and Mastrangeli et al., 1993, J. Clin. Invest. 91:225-234.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (Walsh et al., 1993, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (see e.g., Loeffler and Behr, 1993, Meth. Enzymol. 217:599-618; Cohen et al., 1993, Meth. Enzymol. 217:618-644; Cline, 1985, Pharmac. Ther. 29:69-92) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, epithelial cells are injected, e.g., subcutaneously. In another embodiment, recombinant skin cells may be applied as a skin graft onto the patient. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled person in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, a nucleic acid is introduced into the cells such that it is expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Such stem cells can be hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).","Any technique which provides for the isolation, propagation, and maintenance in vitro of HSC can be used in this embodiment of the invention. Techniques by which this may be accomplished include (a) the isolation and establishment of HSC cultures from bone marrow cells isolated from the future host, or a donor, or (b) the use of previously established long-term HSC cultures, which may be allogeneic or xenogeneic. Non-autologous HSC are used preferably in conjunction with a method of suppressing transplantation immune reactions of the future host\/patient. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, human bone marrow cells can be obtained from the posterior iliac crest by needle aspiration (see e.g., Kodo et al., 1984, J. Clin. Invest. 73:1377-1384). The HSCs can be made highly enriched or in substantially pure form. This enrichment can be accomplished before, during, or after long-term culturing, and can be done by any techniques known in the art. Long-term cultures of bone marrow cells can be established and maintained by using, for example, modified Dexter cell culture techniques (Dexter et al., 1977, J. Cell Physiol. 91:335) or Witlock-Witte culture techniques (Witlock and Witte, 1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79:3608-3612).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","The methods and\/or compositions described above for modulating the expression and\/or activity of a CML target gene or CML target protein may be used to treat patients in conjunction with a chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., Gleevec\u2122.","The effects or benefits of administration of the compositions of the invention alone or in conjunction with a chemotherapeutic agent can be evaluated by any methods known in the art, e.g., by methods that are based on measuring the survival rate, side effects, dosage requirement of the chemotherapeutic agent, or any combinations thereof. If the administration of the compositions of the invention achieves any one or more benefits in a patient, such as increasing the survival rate, decreasing side effects, lowing the dosage requirement for the chemotherapeutic agent, the compositions of the invention are said to have augmented a chemotherapy, and the method is said to have efficacy.","The present invention provides methods and compositions for diagnosis and treatment of CML by targeting PRAME (GenBank\u00ae accession no. NM006115) on cell surfaces of advanced phase hematopoetic stem cells and immature myeloid cells. PRAME is known to be expressed in testis and to expressed at a low level in endometrium, adrenals and ovaries, and is not expressed in other normal tissues. The inventors have found that PRAME is significantly overexpressed in advanced phase CML cells as compared to chronic phase CML cells. Thus, methods and compositions that target PRAME can be used for detecting advanced phase CML cells and for treating CML by selectively targeting advanced phase CML cells.","Antibodies or labeled antibodies directed against a PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen of Melanoma) can be used for evaluating CML progression, e.g., by detecting the presence of PRAME protein on cell surface of hematopoetic stem cells and immature myeloid cells. Such diagnostic\/prognostic methods are particularly useful for detecting CML progression in unsorted samples.","The tissue or cell type to be analyzed may include those which are known to relate to CML, e.g., bone marrow or peripheral blood. The protein isolation methods employed herein may, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow, E. and Lane, D., 1988, \u201cAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or from a patient. The analysis of cells taken from culture may be a necessary step in the assessment of cells to be used as part of a cell-based gene therapy technique or, alternatively, to test the effect of compounds for CML treatment.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for diagnosing whether a patient has advanced phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), comprising (a) contacting a cell sample from said patient with an antibody conjugate, said antibody conjugate comprising an antibody that binds a PRAME protein conjugated with a label; and (b) detecting said label in said sample, wherein detection of said label above a predetermined threshold indicating said patient has advanced phase CML. Detection of the labeled antibody can be performed using a method described in Section 5.2.5, supra.","The invention provides methods and compositions for treating CML by targeting PRAME expressed on the cell surface.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of using anti-PRAME antibodies for treatment of a CML patient. In the methods of the invention, one or more anti-PRAME antibodies are administered to the patient. The anti-PRAME antibodies bind to PRAME on the surface of advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells. The binding of arti-PRAME antibodies to PRAME blocks the function mediated by PRAME, thereby preventing the proliferation of advanced phase hematopoetic stem cells.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treatment of CML using an anti-PRAME antibody that belongs to an isotype that is capable of mediating lysis of cells to which the anti-PRAME antibody is bound. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-PRAME antibody belongs to an isotype that binds a growth factor receptor and activates serum complement and\/or mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by activating effector cells, e.g., macrophages. In another preferred embodiment, the isotype is IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3 or IgM.","In still another embodiment, the anti-PRAME antibodies are used in conjunction with one or more other chemotherapeutic drugs. In such combined therapies, the anti-PRAME antibodies can be administered in a manner such as described in Section 5.10.5.","The dosage of the anti-PRAME antibodies can be determined by routine experiments that are familiar to one skilled in the art. The effects or benefits of administration of the anti-PRAME antibodies can be evaluated by any method known in the art.","In another embodiment, an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an antibody that specifically binds PRAME and a chemotherapeutic drug is used to selectively deliver the chemotherapeutic drug to advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells. Chemotherapeutic drugs normally spread throughout the body, reaching not only the intended target but also healthy cells\/organs such as the intestines and healthy bone marrow, where they kill off normal dividing cells. A drug conjugated to PRAME should be able to selectively target the advance phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells, thus increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the drug. For example, an anti-PRAME antibody may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, or a radioactive metal ion (see, e.g., Section 5.8). Any suitable antibody-drug conjugate, e.g., those described in Section 5.8.3 can be used. Normal hematopoetic stem cells and\/or myeloid cells lack PRAME and are not targeted by the antibody.","In still another embodiment, a peptide or a peptidomimetic that interferes with the interaction of PRAME with its interaction partner is used. A peptide preferably has a size of at least 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 amino acids. Such a peptide or peptidomimetic can be designed by a person skilled in the art based on the sequence and structure of PRAME. In some embodiments of the invention, a PRAME fragment of at least 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 amino acids in length is used. In a specific embodiment, a peptide or peptidomimetic that interferes with the interaction with PRAME is used. The peptide can be prepared by a standard method known in the art (see, e.g., Section 5.8.4).","The invention also provides methods for treating CML using fragments of a PRAME protein as vaccines to elicit an immunotherapeutic response in a patient, e.g., an antibody response and\/or a cell mediated immune response. Antibody responses involve the production of antibodies, which are proteins called immunoglobulins. The antibodies circulate in the bloodstream and permeate the other body fluids, where they bind specifically to the foreign antigen that elicited them. Binding by antibody inactivates advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells by blocking their functions facilitated by PRAME. Antibody binding also marks advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells, either by making it easier for a phagocytic cell to ingest them or by activating a system of blood proteins, collectively called complement, which kills the marked target cells.","Cell-mediated immune responses to PRAME involve the production of specialized cells that react with PRAME antigen on the surface of advanced phase CML cells. T lymphocytes, which develop in the thymus, are responsible for cell-mediated immunity. The majority of T lymphocytes, called helper T cells and suppressor T cells, play a regulatory role in immunity, acting either to enhance or suppress the responses of other white blood cells. Other T lymphocytes, called cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), kill virus-infected cells, parasites, and cancer cells. The surface of T cells contains transmembrane proteins called T cell receptors that recognize the PRAME antigen on the surface of PRAME presenting advanced phase CML cells. T cell receptors are antibody-like proteins. The antigen must be presented to the T cell by a particular membrane protein, one encoded by a complex of genes called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Histocompatibility molecules are expressed on the cells of all higher vertebrates. There are two principal classes of MHC molecules, class I MHC and class II MHC. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize foreign antigens in association with class I MHC glycoproteins on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell, whereas helper T cells recognize foreign antigens in association with class II MHC glycoproteins on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. A cytotoxic T lymphocyte will kill an antigen-presenting cell when it recognizes antigen bound to class I MHC molecules on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. In one embodiment, a PRAME vaccine is used to elicit production of CTLs.","The PRAME protein fragment or polypeptide can be prepared by a standard method known in the art. In a specific embodiment, the fragment is a human PRAME protein fragment, or its murine homolog. In another embodiment, the vaccine comprises a peptide sequence that is at least 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, or 95% homologous (e.g., over an equal size) to such fragments of a PRAME protein, e.g., as determined by a BLAST algorithm. In some embodiments, the PRAME protein fragments or polypeptides are at least 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 amino acids in length.","A peptide or polypeptide which is functionally equivalent to any PRAME fragment described above can also be used. Such an equivalent PRAME fragment may contain deletions, additions or substitutions of amino acid residues within the amino acid sequence encoded by the PRAME gene sequence but which result in a silent change, thus producing a functionally equivalent PRAME protein fragment. Amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and\/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. Conservative substitutions may be made from among amino acids of the same polarity. For example, nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. \u201cFunctionally equivalent\u201d, as utilized herein, refers to a protein fragment capable of exhibiting a substantially similar in vivo activity as the endogenous PRAME protein fragment.","The PRAME peptide fragments may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art (see, e.g., Section 5.8.4).","The PRAME peptide can be used in combination with a suitable carrier and\/or adjuvant, such as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant, or a similar immunostimulatory agent. An oil\/surfactant based adjuvant comprising one or more surfactants combined with one or more non-metabolizable mineral oil or metabolizable oil, such as the Incomplete Seppic Adjuvant (Seppic, Paris, France), may be used. An Incomplete Seppic Adjuvant has a comparable effect as Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant for antibody production, but induces a lower inflammatory response.","A fragment of a PRAME gene can also be used as a DNA or RNA vaccine. In a specific embodiment, the fragment of a PRAME gene is a fragment of a human PRAME gene, or its murine homolog. The invention also provides any sequence that is at least 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, or 95% homologous (e.g., over an equal size) to such fragments of a PRAME gene. In some embodiments of the invention, the fragment of a PRAME gene is at least 20, 25, 40, 60, 80, 100, 500, 1000 bases in length. Such sequences may be useful for production of PRAME peptides.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a naked DNA or RNA vaccine comprising a fragment of a PRAME gene, and uses thereof. The PRAME DNA fragment can be administered as a vaccine to elicit anti-PRAME antibodies. The DNA can be converted to RNA for example by subcloning the DNA into a transcriptional vector, such as pGEM family of plasmid vectors, or under control of a transcriptional promoter of a virus such as vaccinia, and the RNA used as a naked RNA vaccine. The naked DNA or RNA vaccine can be injected alone, or combined with one or more DNA or RNA vaccines directed to PRAME.","The naked DNA or RNA vaccine of the present invention can be administered for example intramuscularly, or alternatively, can be used in nose drops. The DNA or RNA fragment or a portion thereof can be injected as naked DNA or RNA, as DNA or RNA encapsulated in liposomes, as DNA or RNA entrapped in proteoliposomes containing viral envelope receptor proteins (Nicolau, C. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983, 80, 1068; Kanoda, Y., et al. Science 1989, 243, 375; Mannino, R. J. et al. Biotechniques 1988, 6, 682). Alternatively, the DNA can be injected along with a carrier. A carrier can be a protein or such as a cytokine, for example interleukin 2, or a polylysine-glycoprotein carrier (Wu, G. Y. and Wu, C. H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988, 263, 14621), or a nonreplicating vector, for example expression vectors containing either the Rous sarcoma virus or cytomegalovirus promoters. Such carrier proteins and vectors and methods for using same are known to a person in the art (See for example, Acsadi, G. et al. Nature 1991, 352, 815-818). In addition, the DNA or RNA could be coated onto tiny gold beads and the beads introduced into the skin with, for example, a gene gun (Cohen, J. Science 1993, 259, 1691-1692; Ulmer, J. B. et al. Science 1993, 259, 1745-1749).","The invention provides methods of depleting advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells from bone marrow or blood in vitro (or ex vivo). In particular, the invention provides for methods of depleting advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells by killing them or by separating them from bone marrow or blood. In one embodiment, anti-PRAME antibodies are combined, e.g., incubated, in vitro with bone marrow or blood from a patient, e.g., a human.","In one embodiment, a column containing an anti-PRAME antibody bound to a solid matrix is used to remove advanced phase hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells from a bone marrow or blood sample.","The anti-PRAME antibodies used in the in vitro depletion of advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells from samples can be conjugated to detectable labels (e.g., various enzymes, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials) or therapeutic agents (e.g., cytostatic and cytocidal agents), which are disclosed in section 5.8.3.","Anti-PRAME antibodies conjugated to detectable substances can be utilized to sort advanced phase hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples by methods known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, advanced phase hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells are sorted using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) is a well-known method for separating particles, including cells, based on the fluorescent properties of the particles (Kamarch, 1987, Methods Enzymol, 151:150-165). Laser excitation of fluorescent moieties in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing electromagnetic separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture.","In one embodiment, bone marrow or peripheral blood samples, obtained from a patient, e.g., a human, are incubated with fluorescently labeled PRAME specific antibodies for a time sufficient to allow the labeled antibodies to bind to the cells. In an alternative embodiment, such cells are incubated with PRAME specific antibodies, the cells are washed, and the cells are incubated with a second labeled antibody that recognizes the PRAME specific antibodies. In accordance with these embodiments, the cells are washed and processed through the cell sorter, allowing separation of cells that bind both antibodies to be separated from hybrid cells that do not bind both antibodies. FACS sorted particles may be directly deposited into individual wells of 96-well or 384-well plates to facilitate separation.","In another embodiment, magnetic beads can be used to separate advanced phase immature myeloid cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Advanced phase immature myeloid cells may be sorted using a magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) technique, a method for separating particles based on their ability to bind magnetic beads (0.5-100 nm diameter) (Dynal, 1995). A variety of useful modifications can be performed on the magnetic microspheres, including covalent addition of antibody which immunospecifically recognizes PRAME. A magnetic field is then applied, to physically manipulate the selected beads. The beads are then mixed with the cells to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a magnetic field to separate out advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells.","Bone marrow or peripheral blood sample from a patient that is depleted of advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells can be used for autologous transplant treatment of the patient. Healthy bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from a sample depleted of advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells can be collected. These cells can then be administered to the patient to replace the abnormal cells in the patient's bone marrow. Healthy bone marrow or peripheral blood cells can also be stored, e.g., frozen, for transplant at a later time.","Agents that modulate the expression or activity of a CML progression\/target gene or encoded protein (or imatinib resistance gene or encoded protein), or modulate interaction of a CML progression\/target protein (or imatinib resistance protein) with other proteins or molecules can be identified using a method described in this section. Such agents are useful in treating CML patients who exhibit aberrant regulation of these genes. In the following, for simplicity, methods directed to CML progression\/target gene are described. These methods are equally applicable to imatinib resistance genes.","The following assays are designed to identify compounds that bind to a CML progression gene or its products, bind to other cellular proteins that interact with a CML progression protein, bind to cellular constituents, e.g., proteins, that are affected by a CML progression protein, or bind to compounds that interfere with the interaction of the CML progression gene or its product with other cellular proteins and to compounds which modulate the expression or activity of a CML progression gene (i.e., modulate the expression level of the CML progression gene and\/or modulate the activity level of the CML progression protein). Assays may additionally be utilized which identify compounds which bind to CML progression protein regulatory sequences (e.g., promoter sequences), see e.g., Platt, K. A., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:28558-28562, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, which may modulate the level of CML progression gene expression. Compounds may include, but are not limited to, small organic molecules which are able to affect expression of the CML progression gene or some other gene involved in the CML progression protein pathways, or other cellular proteins. Further, among these compounds are compounds which affect the level of CML progression gene expression and\/or CML progression protein activity and which can be used in the regulation of sensitivity to the effect of a chemotherapy agent.","Compounds may include, but are not limited to, peptides such as, for example, soluble peptides, including but not limited to, Ig-tailed fusion peptides, and members of random peptide libraries (see, e.g., Lam, K. S. et al., 1991, Nature 354:82-84; Houghten, R. et al., 1991, Nature 354:84-86), and combinatorial chemistry-derived molecular library made of D- and\/or L-configuration amino acids, phosphopeptides (including, but not limited to members of random or partially degenerate, directed phosphopeptide libraries; see, e.g., Songyang, Z. et al., 1993, Cell 72:767-778), antibodies (including, but not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, anti-idiotypic, chimeric or single chain antibodies, and Fab, F(ab\u2032)and Fab expression library fragments, and epitope-binding fragments thereof), and small organic or inorganic molecules.","Compounds identified via assays such as those described herein may be useful, for example, in modulating the biological function of the CML progression protein.","In vitro systems may be designed to identify compounds capable of binding a CML progression protein. Compounds identified may be useful, for example, in modulating the activity of wild type and\/or mutant CML progression protein, may be useful in elaborating the biological function of the CML progression protein, may be utilized in screens for identifying compounds that disrupt normal CML progression protein interactions, or may in themselves disrupt such interactions.","The principle of the assays used to identify compounds that bind to the CML progression protein involves preparing a reaction mixture of the CML progression protein and the test compound under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two components to interact and bind, thus forming a complex which can be removed and\/or detected in the reaction mixture. These assays can be conducted in a variety of ways. For example, one method to conduct such an assay would involve anchoring CML progression protein or the test substance onto a solid phase and detecting CML progression protein\/test compound complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In one embodiment of such a method, the CML progression protein may be anchored onto a solid surface, and the test compound, which is not anchored, may be labeled, either directly or indirectly.","In practice, microtiter plates may conveniently be utilized as the solid phase. The anchored component may be immobilized by non-covalent or covalent attachments. Non-covalent attachment may be accomplished by simply coating the solid surface with a solution of the protein and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, specific for the protein to be immobilized may be used to anchor the protein to the solid surface. The surfaces may be prepared in advance and stored.","In order to conduct the assay, the nonimmobilized component is added to the coated surface containing the anchored component. After the reaction is complete, unreacted components are removed (e.g., by washing) under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the previously nonimmobilized component is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the previously nonimmobilized component is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the previously nonimmobilized component (the antibody, in turn, may be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with a labeled anti-Ig antibody).","Alternatively, a reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase, the reaction products separated from unreacted components, and complexes detected; e.g., using an immobilized antibody specific for a CML progression protein or the test compound to anchor any complexes formed in solution, and a labeled antibody specific for the other component of the possible complex to detect anchored complexes.","The CML progression gene or CML progression protein may interact in vivo with one or more intracellular or extracellular molecules, such as proteins. For purposes of this discussion, such molecules are referred to herein as \u201cbinding partners\u201d. Compounds that disrupt CML progression protein binding may be useful in modulating the activity of the CML progression protein. Compounds that disrupt CML progression gene binding may be useful in modulating the expression of the CML progression gene, such as by modulating the binding of a regulator of CML progression gene. Such compounds may include, but are not limited to molecules such as peptides which would be capable of gaining access to the CML progression protein.","The basic principle of the assay systems used to identify compounds that interfere with the interaction between the CML progression protein and its intracellular or extracellular binding partner or partners involves preparing a reaction mixture containing the CML progression protein, and the binding partner under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two to interact and bind, thus forming a complex. In order to test a compound for inhibitory activity, the reaction mixture is prepared in the presence and absence of the test compound. The test compound may be initially included in the reaction mixture, or may be added at a time subsequent to the addition of a CML progression protein and its binding partner. Control reaction mixtures are incubated without the test compound or with a placebo. The formation of any complexes between the CML progression protein and the binding partner is then detected. The formation of a complex in the control reaction, but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound, indicates that the compound interferes with the interaction of the CML progression protein and the interactive binding partner. Additionally, complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and a normal CML progression protein may also be compared to complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and a mutant CML progression protein. This comparison may be important in those cases where it is desirable to identify compounds that disrupt interactions of mutant but not the normal CML progression protein.","The assay for compounds that interfere with the interaction of the CML progression proteins and binding partners can be conducted in a heterogeneous or homogeneous format. Heterogeneous assays involve anchoring either the CML progression protein or the binding partner onto a solid phase and detecting complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In homogeneous assays, the entire reaction is carried out in a liquid phase. In either approach, the order of addition of reactants can be varied to obtain different information about the compounds being tested. For example, test compounds that interfere with the interaction between the CML progression proteins and the binding partners, e.g., by competition, can be identified by conducting the reaction in the presence of the test substance; i.e., by adding the test substance to the reaction mixture prior to or simultaneously with the CML progression protein and interactive binding partner. Alternatively, test compounds that disrupt preformed complexes, e.g. compounds with higher binding constants that displace one of the components from the complex, can be tested by adding the test compound to the reaction mixture after complexes have been formed. The various formats are described briefly below.","In a heterogeneous assay system, either the CML progression protein or its interactive binding partner, is anchored onto a solid surface, while the non-anchored species is labeled, either directly or indirectly. In practice, microtiter plates are conveniently utilized. The anchored species may be immobilized by non-covalent or covalent attachments. Non-covalent attachment may be accomplished simply by coating the solid surface with a solution of the CML progression protein or binding partner and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody specific for the species to be anchored may be used to anchor the species to the solid surface. The surfaces may be prepared in advance and stored.","In order to conduct the assay, the partner of the immobilized species is exposed to the coated surface with or without the test compound. After the reaction is complete, unreacted components are removed (e.g., by washing) and any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the non-immobilized species is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the non-immobilized species is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the initially non-immobilized species (the antibody, in turn, may be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with a labeled anti-Ig antibody). Depending upon the order of addition of reaction components, test compounds which inhibit complex formation or which disrupt preformed complexes can be detected.","Alternatively, the reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase in the presence or absence of the test compound, the reaction products separated from unreacted components, and complexes detected; e.g., using an immobilized antibody specific for one of the binding components to anchor any complexes formed in solution, and a labeled antibody specific for the other partner to detect anchored complexes. Again, depending upon the order of addition of reactants to the liquid phase, test compounds which inhibit complex or which disrupt preformed complexes can be identified.","In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a homogeneous assay can be used. In this approach, a preformed complex of the CML progression protein and the interactive binding partner is prepared in which either the CML progression protein or its binding partners is labeled, but the signal generated by the label is quenched due to complex formation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,496 which utilizes this approach for immunoassays). The addition of a test substance that competes with and displaces one of the species from the preformed complex will result in the generation of a signal above background. In this way, test substances which disrupt CML progression protein\/binding partner interaction can be identified.","In a particular embodiment, the CML progression protein can be prepared for immobilization using recombinant DNA techniques. For example, the coding region of CML progression gene can be fused to a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) gene using a fusion vector, such as pGEX-5X-1, in such a manner that its binding activity is maintained in the resulting fusion protein. The interactive binding partner can be purified and used to raise a monoclonal antibody, using methods routinely practiced in the art. This antibody can be labeled with the radioactive isotope I, for example, by methods routinely practiced in the art. In a heterogeneous assay, e.g., the GST-CML progression protein fusion protein can be anchored to glutathione-agarose beads. The interactive binding partner can then be added in the presence or absence of the test compound in a manner that allows interaction and binding to occur. At the end of the reaction-period, unbound material can be washed away, and the labeled monoclonal antibody can be added to the system and allowed to bind to the complexed components. The interaction between the CML progression protein and the interactive binding partner can be detected by measuring the amount of radioactivity that remains associated with the glutathione-agarose beads. A successful inhibition of the interaction by the test compound will result in a decrease in measured radioactivity.","Alternatively, the GST-CML progression protein fusion protein and the interactive binding partner can be mixed together in liquid in the absence of the solid glutathione-agarose beads. The test compound can be added either during or after the species are allowed to interact. This mixture can then be added to the glutathione-agarose beads and unbound material is washed away. Again the extent of inhibition of the CML progression protein\/binding partner interaction can be detected by adding the labeled antibody and measuring the radioactivity associated with the beads.","In another embodiment of the invention, these same techniques can be employed using peptide fragments that correspond to the binding domains of the CML progression protein and\/or the interactive binding partner (in cases where the binding partner is a protein), in place of one or both of the full length proteins. Any number of methods routinely practiced in the art can be used to identify and isolate the binding sites. These methods include, but are not limited to, mutagenesis of the gene encoding one of the proteins and screening for disruption of binding in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Compensating mutations in the gene encoding the second species in the complex can then be selected. Sequence analysis of the genes encoding the respective proteins will reveal the mutations that correspond to the region of the protein involved in interactive binding. Alternatively, one protein can be anchored to a solid surface using methods described in this section above, and allowed to interact with and bind to its labeled binding partner, which has been treated with a proteolytic enzyme, such as trypsin. After washing, a short, labeled peptide comprising the binding domain may remain associated with the solid material, which can be isolated and identified by amino acid sequencing. Also, once the gene coding for the binding partner is obtained, short gene segments can be engineered to express peptide fragments of the protein, which can then be tested for binding activity and purified or synthesized.","For example, and not by way of limitation, a CML progression protein can be anchored to a solid material as described in this section, above, by making a GST-CML progression protein fusion protein and allowing it to bind to glutathione agarose beads. The interactive binding partner can be labeled with a radioactive isotope, such as S, and cleaved with a proteolytic enzyme such as trypsin. Cleavage products can then be added to the anchored GST-CML progression protein fusion protein and allowed to bind. After washing away unbound peptides, labeled bound material, representing the binding partner binding domain, can be eluted, purified, and analyzed for amino acid sequence by well-known methods. Peptides so identified can be produced synthetically or fused to appropriate facilitative proteins using recombinant DNA technology.","Some CML progression proteins are kinases. Kinase activity of a CML progression protein can be assayed in vitro using a synthetic peptide substrate of a CML progression protein of interest, e.g., a GSK-derived biotinylated peptide substrate. The phosphopeptide product is quantitated using a Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) assay system (Park et al., 1999269:94-104). The reaction mixture contains suitable amounts of ATP, peptide substrate, and the CML progression protein. The peptide substrate has a suitable amino acid sequence and is biotinylated at the N-terminus. The kinase reaction is incubated, and then terminated with Stop\/Detection Buffer and GSK3\u03b1 anti-phosphoserine antibody (e.g., Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, Mass.; Cat# 9338) labeled with europium-chelate (e.g., from Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). The reaction is allowed to equilibrate, and relative fluorescent units are determined. Inhibitor compounds are assayed in the reaction described above, to determine compound IC50s. A particular compound is added to in a half-log dilution series covering a suitable range of concentrations, e.g., from 1 nM to 100 \u03bcM. Relative phospho substrate formation, read as HTRF fluorescence units, is measured over the range of compound concentrations and a titration curve generated using a four parameter sigmoidal fit. Specific compounds having ICbelow a predetermined threshold value, e.g., \u226650 \u03bcM against a substrate, can be identified.","The extent of peptide phosphorylation can be determined by Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) using a lanthanide chelate (Lance)-coupled monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphopeptide in combination with a streptavidin-linked allophycocyanin (SA-APC) fluorophore which binds to the biotin moiety on the peptide. When the Lance and APC are in proximity (i.e. bound to the same phosphopeptide molecule), a non-radiative energy transfer takes place from the Lance to the APC, followed by emission of light from APC at 665 nm. The assay can be run using various assay format, e.g., streptavidin flash plate assay, streptavidin filter plate assay.","A standard PKA assay can be used to assay the activity of protein kinase A (PKA). A standard PKC assay can be used to assay the activity of protein kinase C (PKC). The most common methods for assaying PKA or PKC activity involves measuring the transfer of P-labeled phosphate to a protein or peptide substrate that can be captured on phosphocellulose filters via weak electrostatic interactions.","Kinase inhibitors can be identified using fluorescence polarization to monitor kinase activity. This assay utilizes GST-CML progression protein, peptide substrate, peptide substrate tracer, an anti-phospho monoclonal IgG, and the inhibitor compound. Reactions are incubated for a period of time and then terminated. Stopped reactions are incubated and fluorescence polarization values determined.","In a specific embodiment, a standard SPA Filtration Assay and FlashPlate\u00ae Kinase Assay can be used to measure the activity of a CML progression protein. In these assays, GST-CML progression protein, biotinylated peptide substrate, ATP, and P-\u03b3-ATP are allowed to react. After a suitable period of incubation, the reactions are terminated. In a SPA Filtration Assay, peptide substrate is allowed to bind Scintilation proximity assay (SPA) beads (Amersham Biosciences), followed by filtration on a Packard GF\/B Unifilter plate and washed with phosphate buffered saline. Dried plates are sealed and the amount of P incorporated into the peptide substrate is determined. In a FlashPlate\u00ae Kinase Assay, a suitable amount of the reaction is transferred to streptavidin-coated FlashPlates\u00ae (NEN) and incubated. Plates are washed, dried, sealed and the amount of P incorporated into the peptide substrate is determined.","A standard DELFIA\u00ae Kinase Assay can also be used. In a DELFIA\u00ae Kinase Assay, GST-CML progression protein, peptide substrate, and ATP are allowed to react. After the reactions are terminated, the biotin-peptide substrates are captured in the stopped reactions. Wells are washed and reacted with anti-phospho polyclonal antibody and europium labeled anti-rabbit-IgG. Wells are washed and europium released from the bound antibody is detected.","Other assays, such as those described in WO 04\/080973, WO 02\/070494, and WO 03\/101444, may also be utilized to determine biological activity of the instant compounds.","For CML progression genes that are kinases, inhibitor compounds can be assayed for their ability to inhibit a CML progression protein in hematopoetic stem cells and\/or immature myeloid cells by monitoring the phosphorylation or autophosphorylation in response to the compound. Cells are grown in culture medium. Cells are pooled, counted, seeded into 6 well dishes at 200,000 cells per well in 2 ml media, and incubated. Serial dilution series of compounds or control are added to each well and incubated. Following the incubation period, each well is washed and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete is added to each well. Lysates are then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Lysates are thawed on ice and cleared by centrifugation and the supernatants are transferred to clean tubes. Samples are electorphoresed and proteins are transferred onto PVDF. Blots are then blocked and probed using an antibody against phospho-serine or phospho threonine. Bound antibody is visualized using a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. After stripping of the first antibody set, blots are re-probed for total CML progression protein, using a monoclonal antibody specific for the CML progression protein. The CML progression protein monoclonal is detected using a sheep anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence. ECL exposed films are scanned and the intensity of specific bands is quantitated. Titrations are evaluated for level of phosphor-Ser signal normalized to total CML progression protein and IC50 values are calculated.","Detection of phosphonucleolin in cell lysates can be carried out using biotinylated anti-nucleolin antibody and ruthenylated goat anti-mouse antibody. To each well of a 96-well plate is added biotynylated anti-nucleolin antibody and streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads, along with a suitable cell lysate. The antibodies and lysate are incubated. Next, another anti-phosphonucleolin antibody are added to each well of the lysate mix and incubated. Lastly, the ruthenylated goat anti-mouse antibody in antibody buffer is added to each well and incubated. The lysate antibody mixtures are read and EC50s for compound dependent increases in phosphor-nucleolin are determined.","The compounds identified in the screen include compounds that demonstrate the ability to selectively modulate the expression or activity of a CML progression gene or its encoded protein. These compounds include but are not limited to siRNA, antisense nucleic acid, ribozyme, triple helix forming nucleic acid, antibody, and polypeptide molecules, aptamrs, and small organic or inorganic molecules.","Any method known in the art for gene silencing can be used in the present invention (see, e.g., Guo et al., 1995, Cell 81:611-620; Fire et al., 1998, Nature 391:806-811; Grant, 1999, Cell 96:303-306; Tabara et al., 1999, Cell 99:123-132; Zamore et al., 2000, Cell 101:25-33; Bass, 2000, Cell 101:235-238; Petcherski et al., 2000, Nature 405:364-368; Elbashir et al., Nature 411:494-498; Paddison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:1443-1448). The siRNAs targeting a gene can be designed according to methods known in the art (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 2005\/018534, published on Mar. 3, 2005, and Elbashir et al., 200226:199-213, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","An siRNA having only partial sequence homology to a target gene can also be used (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 2005\/018534, published on Mar. 3, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, an siRNA that comprises a sense strand contiguous nucleotide sequence of 11-18 nucleotides that is identical to a sequence of a transcript of a gene but the siRNA does not have full length homology to any sequences in the transcript is used to silence the gene. Preferably, the contiguous nucleotide sequence is in the central region of the siRNA molecules. A contiguous nucleotide sequence in the central region of an siRNA can be any continuous stretch of nucleotide sequence in the siRNA which does not begin at the 3\u2032 end. For example, a contiguous nucleotide sequence of 11 nucleotides can be the nucleotide sequence 2-12, 3-13, 4-14, 5-15, 6-16, 7-17, 8-18, or 9-19. In preferred embodiments, the contiguous nucleotide sequence is 11-16, 11-15, 14-15, 11, 12, or 13 nucleotides in length.","In another embodiment, an siRNA that comprises a 3\u2032 sense strand contiguous nucleotide sequence of 9-18 nucleotides which is identical to a sequence of a transcript of a gene but which siRNA does not have full length sequence identity to any contiguous sequences in the transcript is used to silence the gene. In this application, a 3\u2032 9-18 nucleotide sequence is a continuous stretch of nucleotides that begins at the first paired base, i.e., it does not comprise the two base 3\u2032 overhang. Thus, when it is stated that a particular nucleotide sequence is at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA, the 2 base overhang is not considered. In preferred embodiments, the contiguous nucleotide sequence is 9-16, 9-15, 9-12, 11, 10, or 9 nucleotides in length.","An siRNA having only partial sequence homology to its target genes is especially useful for silencing a plurality of different genes in a cell. In one embodiment, an siRNA is used to silence a plurality of different genes, the transcript of each of the genes comprises a nucleotide sequence that is identical to a central contiguous nucleotide sequence of at least 11 nucleotides of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the siRNA, and\/or comprises a nucleotide sequence that is identical to a contiguous nucleotide sequence of at least 9 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the siRNA. In preferred embodiments, the central contiguous nucleotide sequence is 11-15, 14-15, 11, 12, or 13 nucleotides in length. In other preferred embodiments, the 3\u2032 contiguous nucleotide sequence is 9-15, 9-12, 11, 10, or 9 nucleotides in length.","In one embodiment, in vitro siRNA transfection is carried out as follows: one day prior to transfection, 100 microliters of chosen cells, e.g., cervical cancer HeLa cells (ATCC, Cat. No. CCL-2), grown in DMEM\/10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to approximately 90% confluency are seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Corning, Corning, N.Y.) at 1500 cells\/well. For each transfection 85 microliters of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) is mixed with 5 microliter of serially diluted siRNA (Dharna on, Denver) from a 20 micro molar stock. For each transfection 5 microliter OptiMEM is mixed with 5 microliter Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) and incubated 5 minutes at room temperature. The 10 microliter OptiMEM\/Oligofectamine mixture is dispensed into each tube with the OptiMEM\/siRNA mixture, mixed and incubated 15-20 minutes at room temperature. 10 microliter of the transfection mixture is aliquoted into each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO.","In preferred embodiments, an siRNA pool containing at least k (k=2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 10) different siRNAs targeting the secondary target gene at different sequence regions is used to transfect the cells. In another preferred embodiment, an siRNA pool containing at least k (k=2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 10) different siRNAs targeting two or more different target genes is used to transfect the cells.","In a preferred embodiment, the total siRNA concentration of the pool is about the same as the concentration of a single siRNA when used individually, e.g., 100 nM. Preferably, the total concentration of the pool of siRNAs is an optimal concentration for silencing the intended target gene. An optimal concentration is a concentration further increase of which does not increase the level of silencing substantially. In one embodiment, the optimal concentration is a concentration further increase of which does not increase the level of silencing by more than 5%, 10% or 20%. In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the pool, including the number of different siRNAs in the pool and the concentration of each different siRNA, is chosen such that the pool of siRNAs causes less than 30%, 20%, 10% or 5%, 1%, 0.1% or 0.01% of silencing of any off-target genes (e.g., as determined by standard nucleic acid assay, e.g., PCR). In another preferred embodiment, the concentration of each different siRNA in the pool of different siRNAs is about the same. In still another preferred embodiment, the respective concentrations of different siRNAs in the pool are different from each other by less than 5%, 10%, 20% or 50% of the concentration of any one siRNA or said total siRNA concentration of said different siRNAs. In still another preferred embodiment, at least one siRNA in the pool of different siRNAs constitutes more than 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, or 20% of the total siRNA concentration in the pool. In still another preferred embodiment, none of the siRNAs in the pool of different siRNAs constitutes more than 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, or 20% of the total siRNA concentration in the pool. In other embodiments, each siRNA in the pool has an concentration that is lower than the optimal concentration when used individually. In a preferred embodiment, each different siRNA in the pool has an concentration that is lower than the concentration of the siRNA that is effective to achieve at least 30%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% silencing when used in the absence of other siRNAs or in the absence of other siRNAs designed to silence the gene. In another preferred embodiment, each different siRNA in the pool has a concentration that causes less than 30%, 20%, 10% or 5% of silencing of the gene when used in the absence of other siRNAs or in the absence of other siRNAs designed to silence the gene. In a preferred embodiment, each siRNA has a concentration that causes less than 30%, 20%, 10% or 5% of silencing of the target gene when used alone, while the plurality of siRNAs causes at least 80% or 90% of silencing of the target gene.","Another method for gene silencing is to introduce an shRNA, for short hairpin RNA (see, e.g., Paddison et al., 200216, 948-958; Brummelkamp et al., 2002296, 550-553; Sui, G. et al. 200299, 5515-5520, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety), which can be processed in the cells into siRNA. In this method, a desired siRNA sequence is expressed from a plasmid (or virus) as an inverted repeat with an intervening loop sequence to form a hairpin structure. The resulting RNA transcript containing the hairpin is subsequently processed by Dicer to produce siRNAs for silencing. Plasmid-based shRNAs can be expressed stably in cells, allowing long-term gene silencing in cells both in vitro and in vivo, e.g., in animals (see, McCaffrey et al. 2002418, 38-39; Xia et al., 200220, 1006-1010; Lewis et al., 200232, 107-108; Rubinson et al., 200333, 401-406; Tiscornia et al., 2003100, 1844-1848, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). Thus, in one embodiment, a plasmid-based shRNA is used.","In a preferred embodiment, shRNAs are expressed from recombinant vectors introduced either transiently or stably integrated into the genome (see, e.g., Paddison et al., 200216:948-958; Sui et al., 200299:5515-5520; Yu et al., 200299:6047-6052; Miyagishi et al., 200220:497-500; Paul et al., 200220:505-508; Kwak et al., 200393:214-217; Brummelkamp et al., 2002296:550-553; Boden et al., 200331:5033-5038; Kawasaki et al., 200331:700-707). The siRNA that disrupts the target gene can be expressed (via an shRNA) by any suitable vector which encodes the shRNA. The vector can also encode a marker which can be used for selecting clones in which the vector or a sufficient portion thereof is integrated in the host genome such that the shRNA is expressed. Any standard method known in the art can be used to deliver the vector into the cells. In one embodiment, cells expressing the shRNA are generated by transfecting suitable cells with a plasmid containing the vector. Cells can then be selected by the appropriate marker. Clones are then picked, and tested for knockdown. In a preferred embodiment, the expression of the shRNA is under the control of an inducible promoter such that the silencing of its target gene can be turned on when desired. Inducible expression of an siRNA is particularly useful for targeting essential genes.","In one embodiment, the expression of the shRNA is under the control of a regulated promoter that allows tuning of the silencing level of the target gene. This allows screening against cells in which the target gene is partially knocked out. As used herein, a \u201cregulated promoter\u201d refers to a promoter that can be activated when an appropriate inducing agent is present. An \u201cinducing agent\u201d can be any molecule that can be used to activate transcription by activating the regulated promoter. An inducing agent can be, but is not limited to, a peptide or polypeptide, a hormone, or an organic small molecule. An analogue of an inducing agent, i.e., a molecule that activates the regulated promoter as the inducing agent does, can also be used. The level of activity of the regulated promoter induced by different analogues may be different, thus allowing more flexibility in tuning the activity level of the regulated promoter. The regulated promoter in the vector can be any mammalian transcription regulation system known in the art (see, e.g., Gossen et al, 1995, Science 268:1766-1769; Lucas et al, 1992, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 61:1131; Li et al., 1996, Cell 85:319-329; Saez et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:14512-14517; and Pollock et al., 2000, Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 97:13221-13226). In preferred embodiments, the regulated promoter is regulated in a dosage and\/or analogue dependent manner. In one embodiment, the level of activity of the regulated promoter is tuned to a desired level by a method comprising adjusting the concentration of the inducing agent to which the regulated promoter is responsive. The desired level of activity of the regulated promoter, as obtained by applying a particular concentration of the inducing agent, can be determined based on the desired silencing level of the target gene.","In one embodiment, a tetracycline regulated gene expression system is used (see, e.g., Gossen et al, 1995, Science 268:1766-1769; U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,941). A tet regulated system utilizes components of the tet repressor\/operator\/inducer system of prokaryotes to regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Thus, the invention provides methods for using the tet regulatory system for regulating the expression of an shRNA linked to one or more tet operator sequences. The methods involve introducing into a cell a vector encoding a fusion protein that activates transcription. The fusion protein comprises a first polypeptide that binds to a tet operator sequence in the presence of tetracycline or a tetracycline analogue operatively linked to a second polypeptide that activates transcription in cells. By modulating the concentration of a tetracycline, or a tetracycline analogue, expression of the tet operator-linked shRNA is regulated.","In other embodiments, an ecdyson regulated gene expression system (see, e.g., Saez et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:14512-14517), or an MMTV glucocorticoid response element regulated gene expression system (see, e.g., Lucas et al, 1992, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 61:1131) may be used to regulate the expression of the shRNA.","In one embodiment, the pRETRO-SUPER (pRS) vector which encodes a puromycin-resistance marker and drives shRNA expression from an HI (RNA Pol III) promoter is used. The pRS-shRNA plasmid can be generated by any standard method known in the art. In one embodiment, the pRS-shRNA is deconvoluted from the library plasmid pool for a chosen gene by transforming bacteria with the pool and looking for clones containing only the plasmid of interest. Preferably, a 19mer siRNA sequence is used along with suitable forward and reverse primers for sequence specific PCR. Plasmids are identified by sequence specific PCR, and confirmed by sequencing. Cells expressing the shRNA are generated by transfecting suitable cells with the pRS-shRNA plasmid. Cells are selected by the appropriate marker, e.g., puromycin, and maintained until colonies are evident. Clones are then picked, and tested for knockdown. In another embodiment, an shRNA is expressed by a plasmid, e.g., a pRS-shRNA. The knockdown by the pRS-shRNA plasmid, can be achieved by transfecting cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).","In yet another method, siRNAs can be delivered to an organ or tissue in an animal, such a human, in vivo (see, e.g., Song et al. 20039, 347-351; Sorensen et al., 2003327, 761-766; Lewis et al., 200232, 107-108, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). In this method, a solution of siRNA is injected intravenously into the animal. The siRNA can then reach an organ or tissue of interest and effectively reduce the expression of the target gene in the organ or tissue of the animal.","CML progression proteins, or peptide fragments thereof, can be prepared for uses according to the present invention. For example, CML progression proteins, or peptide fragments thereof, can be used for the generation of antibodies, in diagnostic assays, for screening of inhibitors, or for the identification of other cellular gene products involved in the regulation of expression and\/or activity of a CML progression gene.","The CML progression proteins or peptide fragments thereof, may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. The amino acid sequences of the CML progression proteins are well-known and can be obtained from, e.g., GenBank\u00ae. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing CML progression protein coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra, and Ausubel et al., 1989, supra. Alternatively, RNA capable of encoding CML progression protein sequences may be chemically synthesized using, for example, synthesizers. See, for example, the techniques described in \u201cOligonucleotide Synthesis\u201d, 1984, Gait, M. J. ed., IRL Press, Oxford, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the CML progression gene coding sequences. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, exhibit the CML progression protein in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing CML progression protein coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the CML progression protein coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the CML progression protein coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing CML progression protein coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3, N2a) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the CML progression protein being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of CML progression protein protein or for raising antibodies to CML progression protein protein, for example, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 1983, EMBO J. 2:1791), in which the CML progression protein coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, 1985, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3109; Van Heeke & Schuster, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The CML progression gene coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter). Successful insertion of CML progression gene coding sequence will result in inactivation of the polyhedrin gene and production of non-occluded recombinant virus (i.e., virus lacking the proteinaceous coat coded for by the polyhedrin gene). These recombinant viruses are then used to infect cells in which the inserted gene is expressed. (E.g., see Smith et al., 1983, J. Virol. 46: 584; Smith, U.S. Pat. No. 4,215,051).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the CML progression gene coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing CML progression protein in infected hosts. (E.g., See Logan & Shenk, 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655-3659). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted CML progression protein coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. In cases where an entire CML progression gene, including its own initiation codon and adjacent sequences, is inserted into the appropriate expression vector, no additional translational control signals may be needed. However, in cases where only a portion of the CML progression gene coding sequence is inserted, exogenous translational control signals, including, perhaps, the ATG initiation codon, must be provided. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., 1987, Methods in Enzymol. 153:516-544).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, HeLa, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the CML progression protein may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the CML progression protein. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that affect the endogenous activity of the CML progression protein.","In another embodiment, the expression characteristics of an endogenous gene (e.g., a CML progression gene) within a cell, cell line or microorganism may be modified by inserting a DNA regulatory element heterologous to the endogenous gene of interest into the genome of a cell, stable cell line or cloned microorganism such that the inserted regulatory element is operatively linked with the endogenous gene (e.g., a CML progression gene) and controls, modulates, activates, or inhibits the endogenous gene. For example, endogenous CML progression genes which are normally \u201ctranscriptionally silent\u201d, i.e., a CML progression gene which is normally not expressed, or is expressed only at very low levels in a cell line or microorganism, may be activated by inserting a regulatory element which is capable of promoting the expression of the gene product in that cell line or microorganism. Alternatively, transcriptionally silent, endogenous CML progression genes may be activated by insertion of a promiscuous regulatory element that works across cell types.","A heterologous regulatory element may be inserted into a stable cell line or cloned microorganism, such that it is operatively linked with and activates or inhibits expression of endogenous CML progression genes, using techniques, such as targeted homologous recombination, which are well known to those of skill in the art, and described e.g., in Chappel, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,071; PCT Publication No. WO 91\/06667 published May 16, 1991; Skoultchi, U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,214; and Treco et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,502 and PCT Publication No. WO 94\/12650 published Jun. 9, 1994. Alternatively, non-targeted, e.g. non-homologous recombination techniques may be used which are well-known to those of skill in the art and described, e.g., in PCT Publication No. WO 99\/15650 published Apr. 1, 1999.","CML progression gene activation (or inactivation) may also be accomplished using designer transcription factors using techniques well known in the art. Briefly, a designer zinc finger protein transcription factor (ZFP-TF) is made which is specific for a regulatory region of the CML progression gene to be activated or inactivated. A construct encoding this designer ZFP-TF is then provided to a host cell in which the CML progression gene is to be controlled. The construct directs the expression of the designer ZFP-TF protein, which in turn specifically modulates the expression of the endogenous CML progression gene.

USA 77:3567; O'Hare, et al., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Colberre-Garapin, et al., 1981, J. Mol. Biol. 150:1); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre, et al., 1984, Gene 30:147).","Alternatively, any fusion protein may be readily purified by utilizing an antibody specific for the fusion protein being expressed. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Janknecht, et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 8972-8976). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the gene's open reading frame is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. Extracts from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni.nitriloacetic acid-agarose columns and histidine-tagged proteins are selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.","In a specific embodiment, recombinant human CML progression proteins can be expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase at the amino-terminus (GST-CML progression protein) using standard baculovirus vectors and a (Bac-to-Bac\u00ae) insect cell expression system purchased from GIBCO\u2122 Invitrogen. Recombinant protein expressed in insect cells can be purified using glutathione sepharose (Amersham Biotech) using standard procedures described by the manufacturer.","CML progression protein or a fragment thereof can be used to raise antibodies which bind CML progression protein. Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments, and an Fab expression library. In a preferred embodiment, anti CML progression protein C-terminal antibodies are raised using an appropriate C-terminal fragment of a CML progression protein, e.g., the kinase domain. Such antibodies bind the kinase domain of the CML progression protein. In another preferred embodiment, anti CML progression protein N-terminal antibodies are raised using an appropriate N-terminal fragment of a CML progression protein. The N-terminal domain of a CML progression protein are less homologous to other kinases, and therefore offered a more specific target for a particular CML progression protein.","Antibodies can be prepared by immunizing a suitable subject with a CML progression protein or a fragment thereof as an immunogen. The antibody titer in the immunized subject can be monitored over time by standard techniques, such as with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using immobilized polypeptide. If desired, the antibody molecules can be isolated from the mammal (e.g., from the blood) and further purified by well-known techniques, such as protein A chromatography to obtain the IgG fraction.","At an appropriate time after immunization, e.g., when the specific antibody titers are highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256:495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique by Kozbor et al. (1983, Immunol. Today 4:72), the EBV-hybridoma technique by Cole et al. (1985, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96) or trioma techniques. The technology for producing hybridomas is well known (see Current Protocols in Immunology, 1994, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y.). Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that bind the polypeptide of interest, e.g., using a standard ELISA assay.","Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., 1975, Nature, 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein also indicates that the antibody is an immunoglobulin.","In the hybridoma method of generating monoclonal antibodies, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,914,112, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA.","Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, 1984, J. Immunol., 133:3001; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)). Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., 1980, Anal. Biochem., 107:220.","After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and\/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103, Academic Press, 1986). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.","Alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody directed against a CML progression protein or a fragment thereof can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody phage display library) with the CML progression protein or the fragment. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are commercially available (e.g., Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene antigen SurfZAP\u2122 Phage Display Kit, Catalog No. 240612). Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,409 and 5,514,548; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/18619; PCT Publication No. WO 91\/17271; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/20791; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/15679; PCT Publication No. WO 93\/01288; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/01047; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/09690; PCT Publication No. WO 90\/02809; Fuchs et al., 1991, Bio\/Technology 9:1370-1372; Hay et al., 1992, Hum. Antibod. Hybridomas 3:81-85; Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275-1281; Griffiths et al., 1993, EMBO J. 12:725-734.","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison, et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 81, 6851-6855; Neuberger, et al., 1984, Nature 312, 604-608; Takeda, et al., 1985, Nature, 314, 452-454) by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.)","Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in PCT Publication No. WO 87\/02671; European Patent Application 184,187; European Patent Application 171,496; European Patent Application 173,494; PCT Publication No. WO 86\/01533; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567 and 5,225,539; European Patent Application 125,023; Better et al., 1988, Science 240:1041-1043; Liu et al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439-3443; Liu et al., 1987, J.

Immunol. 141:4053-4060.","Complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting is another method of humanizing antibodies. It involves reshaping murine antibodies in order to transfer full antigen specificity and binding affinity to a human framework (Winter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539). CDR-grafted antibodies have been successfully constructed against various antigens, for example, antibodies against IL-2 receptor as described in Queen et al., 1989 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029); antibodies against cell surface receptors-CAMPATH as described in Riechmann et al. (1988, Nature, 332:323; antibodies against hepatitis B in Cole et al. (1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2869); as well as against viral antigens-respiratory syncitial virus in Tempest et al. (1991, Bio-Technology 9:267). CDR-grafted antibodies are generated in which the CDRs of the murine monoclonal antibody are grafted into a human antibody. Following grafting, most antibodies benefit from additional amino acid changes in the framework region to maintain affinity, presumably because framework residues are necessary to maintain CDR conformation, and some framework residues have been demonstrated to be part of the antigen binding site. However, in order to preserve the framework region so as not to introduce any antigenic site, the sequence is compared with established germline sequences followed by computer modeling.","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Such antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a CML progression protein.","Monoclonal antibodies directed against a CML progression protein can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,126; U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,425; U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,016; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,806. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif., see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,615) and Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.), can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a CML progression protein or a fragment thtereof using technology similar to that described above.","Completely human antibodies which recognize and bind a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope (Jespers et al., 1994, Bio\/technology 12:899-903).","A pre-existing anti-CML progression protein antibody can be used to isolate additional antigens of the CML progression protein by standard techniques, such as affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation for use as immunogens. Moreover, such an antibody can be used to detect the protein (e.g., in a cellular lysate or cell supernatant) in order to evaluate the abundance and pattern of expression of CML progression protein. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include 125I, 131I, 35S or 3H.","The anti-CML progression protein antibodies can be produced by immunization of a suitable animal, such as but are not limited to mouse, rabbit, and horse.","An immunogenic preparation comprising a CML progression protein or a fragment thereof can be used to prepare antibodies by immunizing a suitable subject (e.g., rabbit, goat, mouse or other mammal). An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for example, recombinantly expressed or chemically synthesized CML progression protein peptide or polypeptide. The preparation can further include an adjuvant, such as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant, or similar immunostimulatory agent.","A fragment of a CML progression protein suitable for use as an immunogen comprises at least a portion of the CML progression protein that is 8 amino acids, more preferably 10 amino acids and more preferably still, 15 amino acids long.","The invention also provides chimeric or fusion CML progression protein polypeptides for use as immunogens. As used herein, a \u201cchimeric\u201d or \u201cfusion\u201d CML progression protein polypeptide comprises all or part of a CML progression protein polypeptide operably linked to a heterologous polypeptide. Within the fusion CML progression protein polypeptide, the term \u201coperably linked\u201d is intended to indicate that the CML progression protein polypeptide and the heterologous polypeptide are fused in-frame to each other. The heterologous polypeptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the CML progression protein polypeptide.","One useful fusion CML progression protein polypeptide is a GST fusion CML progression protein polypeptide in which the CML progression protein polypeptide is fused to the C-terminus of GST sequences. Such fusion CML progression protein polypeptides can facilitate the purification of a recombinant CML progression protein polypeptide.","In another embodiment, the fusion CML progression protein polypeptide contains a heterologous signal sequence at its N-terminus so that the CML progression protein polypeptide can be secreted and purified to high homogeneity in order to produce high affinity antibodies. For example, the native signal sequence of an immunogen can be removed and replaced with a signal sequence from another protein. For example, the gp67 secretory sequence of the baculovirus envelope protein can be used as a heterologous signal sequence (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, 1992). Other examples of eukaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the secretory sequences of melittin and human placental alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.). In yet another example, useful prokaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the phoA secretory signal and the protein A secretory signal (Pharmacia Biotech; Piscataway, N.J.).","In yet another embodiment, the fusion CML progression protein polypeptide is an immunoglobulin fusion protein in which all or part of a CML progression protein polypetide is fused to sequences derived from a member of the immunoglobulin protein family. The immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be used as immunogens to produce antibodies directed against the CML progression protein polypetide in a subject.","Chimeric and fusion CML progression protein polypeptide can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. In one embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (e.g., Ausubel et al., supra). Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion domain (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A nucleic acid encoding an immunogen can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion domain is linked in-frame to the polypeptide.","The CML progression protein immunogenic preparation is then used to immunize a suitable animal. Preferably, the animal is a specialized transgenic animal that can secret human antibody. Non-limiting examples include transgenic mouse strains which can be used to produce a polyclonal population of antibodies directed to a specific pathogen (Fishwild et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology 14:845-851; Mendez et al., 1997, Nature Genetics 15:146-156). In one embodiment of the invention, transgenic mice that harbor the unrearranged human immunoglobulin genes are immunized with the target immunogens. After a vigorous immune response against the immunogenic preparation has been elicited in the mice, the blood of the mice are collected and a purified preparation of human IgG molecules can be produced from the plasma or serum. Any method known in the art can be used to obtain the purified preparation of human IgG molecules, including but is not limited to affinity column chromatography using anti-human IgG antibodies bound to a suitable column matrix. Anti-human IgG antibodies can be obtained from any sources known in the art, e.g., from commercial sources such as Dako Corporation and ICN. The preparation of IgG molecules produced comprises a polyclonal population of IgG molecules that bind to the immunogen or immunogens at different degree of affinity. Preferably, a substantial fraction of the preparation contains IgG molecules specific to the immunogen or immunogens. Although polyclonal preparations of IgG molecules are described, it is understood that polyclonal preparations comprising any one type or any combination of different types of immunoglobulin molecules are also envisioned and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.","A population of antibodies directed to a CML progression protein can be produced from a phage display library. Polyclonal antibodies can be obtained by affinity screening of a phage display library having a sufficiently large and diverse population of specificities with a CML progression protein or a fragment thereof. Examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,409 and 5,514,548; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/18619; PCT Publication No. WO 91\/17271; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/20791; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/15679; PCT Publication No. WO 93\/01288; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/01047; PCT Publication No. WO 92\/09690; PCT Publication No. WO 90\/02809; Fuchs et al., 1991, Bio\/Technology 9:1370-1372; Hay et al., 1992, Hum. Antibod. Hybridomas 3:81-85; Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275-1281; Griffiths et al., 1993, EMBO J. 12:725-734. A phage display library permits selection of desired antibody or antibodies from a very large population of specificities. An additional advantage of a phage display library is that the nucleic acids encoding the selected antibodies can be obtained conveniently, thereby facilitating subsequent construction of expression vectors.","In other preferred embodiments, the population of antibodies directed to a CML progression protein or a fragment thereof is produced by a method using the whole collection of selected displayed antibodies without clonal isolation of individual members as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,098, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Polyclonal antibodies are obtained by affinity screening of a phage display library having a sufficiently large repertoire of specificities with, e.g., an antigenic molecule having multiple epitopes, preferably after enrichment of displayed library members that display multiple antibodies. The nucleic acids encoding the selected display antibodies are excised and amplified using suitable PCR primers. The nucleic acids can be purified by gel electrophoresis such that the full length nucleic acids are isolated. Each of the nucleic acids is then inserted into a suitable expression vector such that a population of expression vectors having different inserts is obtained. The population of expression vectors is then expressed in a suitable host.","Cancer cells can be targeted and killed using anti-CML progression protein antibody-drug conjugates that target an advanced phase CML hematopoetic stem cell and\/or immature myeloid cell expressing a CML progression protein on its surface, e.g., PRAME. For example, an antibody specific for a CML progression protein may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, or a radioactive metal ion. Antibody-drug conjugates can be prepared by method known in the art (see, e.g., Immunoconjugates, Vogel, ed. 1987; Targeted Drugs, Goldberg, ed. 1983; Antibody Mediated Delivery Systems, Rodwell, ed. 1988). Therapeutic drugs, such as but are not limited to, paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof, can be conjugated to anti-CML progression protein antibodies. Other therapeutic agents that can be conjugated to anti-CML progression protein antibodies include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites, e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine; alkylating agents, e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin; anthracyclines, e.g., daunorubicin (daunomycin) and doxorubicin; antibiotics, e.g., dactinomycin (actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, anthramycin (AMC); and anti-mitotic agents, e.g., vincristine and vinblastine. The therapeutic agents that can be conjugated to anti-CML progression protein antibodies may also be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Other chemotherapeutic agents known in the art, such as those described in Section 5.8.5, infra, can also be conjugated with such an anti-CML progression protein antibody. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin.","The drug molecules can be linked to the anti-CML progression protein antibody via a linker. Any suitable linker can be used for the preparation of such conjugates. In some embodiments, the linker can be a linker that allows the drug molecules to be released from the conjugates in unmodified form at the target site.","The antibodies can also be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the presence of cancer cells as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. See generally U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include fluorescent proteins, e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP), umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include I, I, In, Lu, Y or Tc.","Techniques for conjugating therapeutic moieties to antibodies are well known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy\u201d, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al.

No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference.","A CML progression protein-binding peptide or polypeptide or peptide or polypeptide of a CML progression protein may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus; the polypeptide or peptide can be produced by expressing nucleic acid containing sequences encoding the polypeptide or peptide. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra, and Ausubel et al., 1989, supra. Alternatively, RNA capable of encoding CML progression protein polypeptide sequences may be chemically synthesized using, for example, synthesizers. See, for example, the techniques described in \u201cOligonucleotide Synthesis\u201d, 1984, Gait, M.

DNA damage agents can disrupt DNA replication or cause the generation of nonsense DNA or RNA.

This illustrates the global change of gene expression as the disease progresses from the chronic phase through the advanced phase of the disease.","The expression patterns were then examined to determine if progression of CML best fits a three-step model as often described in the literature (chronic phase to accelerated phase to blast crisis), or a two-step model (chronic phase to advanced phase, i.e., accelerated or blast phase). The gene expression patterns of accelerated phase cases were compared to those of the blast crisis cases (). The correlation between the expression profiles of accelerated cases and those of the blast phase was quite strong (r=0.81). Comparing differentially regulated genes between accelerated phase with blast phase, there are very few phase specific genes, i.e. genes only regulated in one phase but not in another. These observations suggest that the difference of gene expression changes between accelerated and blast phase is a quantitative one rather than a qualitative one that requires new gene expression or repression.","The biological functions of the genes associated with CML phases were also examined by applying a biological annotation program based on the GO and KEGG annotations. The functional groups most highly correlated with progression to blast crisis included increased expression of nuclear genes, mitochondrial genes, RNA binding genes, protein biosynthesis genes, and genes involved in chaperone function, all reflecting the increased proliferation and metabolism of progressive disease.","Progression was also associated with decreases in the expression levels of genes involved in structural integrity and adhesion, as well as decreases in the expression levels of genes involved in inflammatory and immune response. In addition, several proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were differentially expressed with progression. For example, N- and Hras, FLT3, yes, AF1q, CBFB, WT1, ORALOV1, PTNN11, and Bcl-2 demonstrated increased expression in blast crisis as compared to chronic phase. Analysis of the phase reporter genes suggested a relative decrease in MAPPK signaling in advanced phase as compared to chronic phase. The progression was also seen as associated with increases in alternative signal pathways. Thus, the cytoplasmic GTP protein Rras2 was highly over-expressed in advanced phases, as was ras signaling components RAB56 and RALGD5. Alterations of cytokine signaling were demonstrated by an increase in expression of TNF factors SF4 and 7, and SOCS2 and 4.","Next, how the phase reporter gene set was influenced by the gene expression signature of leukemia blasts and how they compared to normal immature CD34+ cells were investigated. First, the gene expression signatures of eight samples of normal CD34+ cells were compared with CML blast samples containing >70% blasts (). It was found that the gene expression pattern of CML blast cells was very similar to normal CD34+ cells, suggesting that \u201cprogression\u201d from the chronic phase to the advanced phase is functionally similar to a block or \u201creversion\u201d towards a more primitive hematopoetic cell. To uncover genes that are unique to progression, the normal CD34+ signatures were mathematically subtracted from each of the disease samples and the phase reporter signals were searched for (and ). A set of 386 genes (p<10) were identified (and Tables 2a and 2b). These genes are called the \u201cprogression genes.\u201d A set of 368 genes with ANOVA p<0.1% were identified as differentially expressed between CML blast crisis and normal immature CD34+ cells were also identified (and Tables 5a and 5b). These genes are called the \u201ctarget genes.\u201d There were 103 genes overlapping between these two sets (hypergeometric P-value: 1.3\u00d710). This gene set is enriched in genes that are diagnostic markers of progression and novel targets of therapy. Table 3 shows the \u201ctop ten\u201d genes that are associated with progression, independent of normal CD34+ expression, based on log 10 ratio of expression compared to the chronic phase pool. These genes suggest a deregulation of genes of transcriptional regulation (GLI2, WT1, FOS, FOSB), signal transduction (SOCS2, Rras2, IL8), and apoptosis (GAS2). Moreover, two HSP 70 subunits are differentially down-regulated, suggesting an alteration of this component of the chaperone system in blast crisis. Also significantly associated with progression was the surface protein PRAME, which has an unknown function, but has been associated with myeloid malignancy (van Baren et al. 1998, Br J Haematol 102:1376; Watari et al. 2000, FEBS Lett 466:367). Gene functions overrepresented in blast crisis were predominated by changes in ribosome gene expression and increased in the beta-catenin\/WNT signaling pathway. More significant changes in gene function were down-regulated in progression, including nucleosome assembly and chromatin structure, sugar catabolism and metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis.","Multiple changes in several signaling pathways are represented in the progression gene set. Again, these genes were seen in the progression of chronic phase to advanced disease, but are differentially expressed compared to normal CD34+ cells. There was a deregulation of the betacatenin\/WNT pathway. Expression of the cell surface protein cadherin was decreased, as was proto-cadhedrin, potentially leading to an activation of the beta-catenin\/WNT signaling pathway by allowing more free beta-catenin to move to the cytoplasm. Moreover, the myogenesis transcription control gene MDFI (I-mfa), which complexes with axin (therefore potentially increasing free beta-catenin), was increased by approximately 7-fold. In all, 16 genes associated with the beta-catenin pathway were significantly over-expressed (e.g., PRICKLE1, CSNK1E, PLCB1, FZD2, LRP6, SMAD3, etc.). In summary, these findings strongly suggest aberrant activation of the betacatenin\/WNT pathway during CML progression. Moreover, progression appears to be associated with a remodeling of several cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules, which may play a role in regulating proliferation. Thus there is an increase in CD47, Crebl1, and ITGA5 expression, and a decrease in proto-cadhedrin, cadhedrin, actin, and betaactin.","In addition, the abl family member abl2 (ARG) was significantly associated with disease progression; by contrast, abl1, which is both expressed from the normal chromosome 9 and the t(9;22) translocation, was not differentially expressed with progression. Advanced phase disease was associated with deregulation of transcription factors, differentiation and apoptosis. Both components of the AP-1 transcription complex, Jun B and Fos, show decreased expression in progression. In addition, the Kupple-like zinc finger GLI2 is highly over-expressed in progression. The block in differentiation may be facilitated by the up-regulation of MDFI, WT1, and AF1q, and the down regulation of GADD45. Apoptosis in blast cells appears to be inhibited by the over-expression of Bcl2, DAP, and the decrease in MCL1 and Acinus. Progression was also associated with alterations in normal protein chaperone and degradation processes, with a widespread decrease in the expression of HSP70 and DNAJ families of genes. In addition, proteosome components BMA1 PSME2, and TRIP12 were all significantly increased in advanced phase CML cases.","In order to examine if specific pathways were altered in progression, the progression and phase reporter gene sets were analyzed for aberrant expression of genes possessing known promoter sequences. Aberrant regulation of several sets of promoter controlled genes was revealed (Table 6). The most statistically significantly set of genes showing aberrant control in progression where those that contained a MZF promoter or a delta EF1 promoter sequence (p<10and <10, respectively; and ). Also significantly associated with progression were genes bearing SPI-B, Yin Yang, and Ahr-ARNT promoter sequences (all with p values <10).","Gene expression profiles of patients who failed imatinib therapy were analyzed. A set of 21 cases of CML treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, including 9 patients who initially achieved a complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) on imatinib therapy, but then relapsed, most back into an apparent chronic phase by morphology; 3 cases who had achieved a complete hematologic but no cytogenetic response; 3 late chronic phase patients before treatment with imatinib; and 6 cases of blast crisis was used. All but one of these the chronic phase patients who relapsed after a CCR had a point mutation in abl1, presumably abrogating imatinib activity (Table 7).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0558","num":"0576"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Characteristics of cases treated with imatinib"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Phase of Disease at","Phase of disease at",{},{}]},{"entry":["CODE","Case type","initiation of imatinib","time of sample","Cytogenetics","Mutation(s)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["\u20022","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+;","M244V"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"NEW: t(1; 12) in all",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"cells",{}]},{"entry":["\u20024","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+","T315I"]},{"entry":["\u20025","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","80% Ph+","F359V"]},{"entry":["\u20026","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+","M351T,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"F317L"]},{"entry":["\u20028","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+","M351T"]},{"entry":["10","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+","E255K"]},{"entry":["11","Imatinib failure","chronic post-allo","relapsed chronic","not available","T315I"]},{"entry":[{},{},"BMT",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["12","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+","L248V"]},{"entry":["14","Imatinib failure","chronic","relapsed chronic","100% Ph+","M351T,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"H396R"]},{"entry":["15","Pre-imatinib","chronic","chronic pre-treatment","50% Ph+","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["17","Pre-imatinib","chronic","chronic pre-treatment","100% Ph+","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["18","Pre-imatinib","chronic","CHR; no cytogenetic","100% Ph+","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},"response",{},{}]},{"entry":["19","Pre-imatinib","chronic","chronic pre-treatment","45% t(9; 13; 22); 50%","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},"t (9; 13; 22), \u2212Y; 5%",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"nl",{}]},{"entry":["21","Pre-imatinib","chronic","CHR; no cytogenetic","100% Ph+","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},"response",{},{}]},{"entry":["22 (same pt as","Pre-imatinib","chronic","CHR; no cytogenetic","100% Ph+ (3 of 18","none"]},{"entry":["13)","treatment",{},"response","with additional Ph)",{}]},{"entry":["23","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","pre-treatment MBC","100% Ph+","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["24","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","pre-treatment MBC","100% Ph+, t(2; 16)","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["25","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","pre-treatment MBC","100% Ph+, +8, iso","none"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},"17q",{}]},{"entry":["26","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","not treated","not available","unknown"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["27","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","relapsed MBC","100% Ph+","unknown"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["29","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","relapsed MBC","not available","unknown"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["29","Pre-imatinib","myeloid blast crisis","relapsed MBC","not available","unknown"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0559","num":"0577"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","b","c "]},"The biology and treatment of CML is dictated by the phase of disease, since the efficacy of all therapies (transplantation, interferon, imatinib) works best in chronic phase, and worse in accelerated phase and blast crisis. Understanding the biology of progression provides clinical diagnostic markers of progression, and offer insights into new strategies for treatment. The data presented in these examples suggest that the progression of chronic phase CML to advanced phase CML is a two-step process, with progression associated with a block of differentiation and apoptosis, a shift towards turning on expression of genes involved in the nucleosome, while down-regulating histone transcription. Moreover, progression is associated with alterations in cell adhesion, and activation of alternative signaling pathways. In addition, it appears that relapse after initial successful treatment with imatinib may be associated with gene expression patterns similar to advanced phase CML, suggesting that the process of progression persists in a subpopulation of CML cells even in the background of apparent successful therapy.","The demonstration that the gene expression pattern between accelerated and blast phases are very similar suggests that the crucial steps in progression are at the transition of chronic to accelerated phase, before obvious morphologic, cytogenetic or clinical evidence of progression. This has obvious clinical implications, since these patients might benefit from aggressive therapy. In addition, the observation that gene signatures of blast crisis can be seen in accelerated phase patients by cytogenetic criteria only, and blast crisis cases in remission (both of which have low blast counts similar to patients with chronic phase disease), demonstrates two important points. First, it points out the difficulty of correlating morphology with the biology of the disease.","Secondly, the penetration of a progression gene expression signature into a \u201cchronic phase\u201d appearing bone marrow suggests that progression is not merely an absolute block of differentiation, but that abnormal gene expression signals \u201cleak\u201d from the presumably immature blast crisis precursors into more normal appearing differentiated cell. This is critically important since it provides the basis for testing for progression genes in unsorted bone marrow samples from \u201cchronic phase\u201d patients.","In addition, the finding that CML blasts share a gene expression profile with normal CD34+ cells has important biological considerations (Passegue et al., 2003, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100 Suppl 1:11842). First, it implies that there may be a limited number of novel pathways active in CML blasts. This finding is obviously important (and encouraging) in the era of targeted therapeutics. It also may explain the relative resistance of blast crisis CML to chemotherapy. Normal hematopoetic stem cells are remarkably resistant to chemotherapy, and thus in AML and ALL, with remission comes the return of normal hematopoesis. Remission is rare in blast crisis CML, perhaps because the blast cells are similarly resistant to chemotherapy as their normal counterpart.","Bcr-Abl has a wholesale range of biological activities. Critical in the transformation process is the activation of the Ras\/MAPK pathways, which has broad effects on changes in cell adhesion (through Rho), proliferation (MAPK pathway), and apoptosis (through Akt) (Faderl et al., 1999, N Engl J Med 341:164; Ren, 2002, Oncogene 21:8629). The efficacy of imatinib works through the blockade of these effects.","Imatinib works poorly on advanced phase disease, and it may be because these tumors are less reliant on the pathways that imatinib blocks than chronic phase disease. Thus, it was found that the MAPK pathway was relatively under-expressed in advanced disease compared to chronic phase, but other signaling pathways, including those involving cytokines (IL3RA, SOCS2), alternative ras pathways (Rras2), and those involved in cell adhesion (B-catenin\/WNT) were activated. The activation of these pathways may allow progression even in the face of therapeutic blockade of Bcr-Abl activated pathways. In addition, abl2 (Abl related gene, or ARG) is also upregulated in progresson. As opposed to abl1 (which is a nuclear protein until involved in the chimeric Bcr-Abl protein, at which time it migrates to the cytoplasm), ARG is a cytoplasmic protein (Kruh et al., 1990, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87:5802). The signaling targets of ARG are unknown, and although broadly expressed in tissue, its only known functional role apparent from knockout mouse models appears to be in the nervous system (Koleske et al., 1998, Neuron 21:1259; Perego et al., 1991, Oncogene 6:1899). ARG has been associated with myeloid leukemia in the contest of TEL\/ARG translocations (Cazzaniga et al., 1999, Blood 94:4370; Iijima et al., 2000, Blood 95:2126). ARG shares over 90% homology of its tyrosine kinase domain with abl1, and ARG tyrosine kinase activity is inhibited by imatinib at similar drug concentrations (Kruh et al., 1990, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87:5802; Okuda et al., 2001, Blood 97:2440). However, given that Bcr-ABL amplification is considered to play a role in imatinib resistance (le Coutre et al. 2000, Blood 95:1758; Weisberg et al., 2000, Blood 95:3498), ARG over-expression in blast crisis could theoretically contribute to the relative resistance to imatinib found with progressive disease.","Two recent observations on the molecular biology of progression in CML are relevant to this study. First, activation of the beta-catenin pathway was observed in primary cell samples from patients with CML (Jamieson et al., 2004, N Engl J Med 351:657). Secondly, it was recently observed that mice deficient in Jun B develop a disease much like CML (Passegue et al., 2004, Cell 119:431). The data in these examples complement these findings, as we found broad dysregulation of WNT\/beta-catenin pathway as well as decreased Jun B expression. A link between these pathways may be the gene MDFI (Imfa), an inhibitor of myogenic basic H-L-H transcription factors 4. MDFI interacts with axin, which is involved in binding and modulating free beta-catenin. Thus an increase in MDFI would effectively allow for more free beta-catenin to migrate to the nucleus, where it causes gene activation (Nelson et al., 2004, Science 303:1483). An increase in MDFI could also decrease the axinmediated activation of Jun (Kusano et al., 2002, Mol Cell Biol 22:6393). Thus, MDFI may play a central role in progression by both influencing the beta-catenin and Jun B pathways. Moreover, the fact that both Jun B and Fos were down-regulated in progression suggests that there may be a wholesale deregulation in AP-1 targets, which could have broad functional affects on differentiation, apoptosis, and cell cycle control (Hess et al., 2004, J Cell Sci 117:5965).","The analysis suggests that genes controlled by MZF1 and delta EF1 may be particularly important in progression. MZF1 is a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins, and was originally cloned from a cDNA library from a blast crisis CML patient (Hromas et al., 1991, J Biol Chem 266:14183). MZF1 appears to play a critical role in hematopoetic stem cell differentiation, including modulation of CD34 and c-myb expression (Gaboli et al., 2001, Genes Dev 15:1625; Perrotti et al., 1995, Mol Cell Biol 15:6075). MZF1 \u2212\/\u2212 knock-out mice display an increase in hemapoetic progenitor proliferation which continues in long-term culture conditions (Gaboli et al., 2001, Genes Dev 15:1625). These data support the findings found in our human studies described about that MZF1 deregulation may disrupt normal differentiation, promoting the progression to advanced disease. Delta EF1 is related to the Smad zinc finger proteins that play an important role in TGFbeta gene regulation. Delta EF1 has been shown to compete with basic helix-loop-helix activators, and is implicated in modulation of MyoD regulated pathways (Funahashi et al., 1993, Development 119:433; Sekido et al., 1994, Mol Cell Biol 14:5692). It is not known if delta EF1 directly influences MDFI expression.","Of note is that both MZF1 and delta EF1 have been shown to influence cadherin expression (Guaita et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:39209; Le et al., 2005, Exp Cell Res 302:129; Miyoshi et al., 2004, Br J Cancer 90:1265). Thus, the further study of the control of MZF1 and delta EF1 may be particularly fruitful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of CML progression. Given that efficacy of treatment in CML (be it with interferon, imatinib, or transplantation) is so intimately associated with phase of disease, those patients who fail therapy in chronic phase may have genetic features of advanced phase invisible to routine pathological and cytogenetic exam. Imatinib failures are a reasonable setting to explore this possibility. While imatinib can cause cytogenetic remissions in the majority of chronic phase cases, treatment failure, especially secondary to point mutations, is an increasingly important problem. It has previously been demonstrated that the probability of developing a point mutation depends largely on the time from diagnosis to initiation of therapy (Branford et al., 2003, Blood 102:276). This finding implies that the genetic mechanisms that lead to point mutations are relentless, and therefore the treatment of \u201clate\u201d chronic phase patients (i.e., >1 year from diagnosis) may be undermined by genetic changes that have already occurred. Branford et al. demonstrated that patients who developed point mutations had a very poor outcome, with approximately half dying within a year of relapse (Branford et al., 2003, Blood 102:276). These observations are in keeping with the demonstration in these examples that many imatinib failures have gene expression changes similar to advanced disease, despite their benign pathological appearance. Thus, resistance to imatinib may be ameliorated by either targeting pathways of progression (beta-catenin, JunB\/Fos, etc.), or by targeting pathways specifically found activated in imatinib resistance cases (alternative kinases, protein transporters).","Several of the genes found in the progression set might serve as early markers of progression in diagnostic assays, and may serve as therapeutic targets, as well. For example, PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen of Melanoma) was originally identified as a tumor antigen recognized by cytotoxic T-cells against a melanoma surface antigen (Matsushita et al., 2001, Br J Haematol 112:916, 2001; van Baren et al., 1998, Br J Haematol 102:1376). Like similar antigens MAGE, BAGE, and GAGE, which are expressed in some solid tumors; unlike these other antigens, however, PRAME has been found to be overexpressed in over 25% of leukemia, and has been found to be induced by Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines (Watari et al., 2000, FEBS Lett 466:367). Indeed, PRAME over-expression has been described as one of the few features that characterize the transient myeloproliferative syndrome of Down's syndrome from the progressive acute megakaryoblastic leukemia found in that disorder (McElwaine et al., 2004, Br J Haematol 125:729). While the function of PRAME is still unknown, its expression on the cell surface might be amenable to flow cytometry assays, as well as a target for immunologic (vaccine or cell-based) therapy. CD47, an integrin-like protein, is another potential diagnostic target discovered in our analysis of progression (Motegi et al., 2003, Embo J 22:2634; Okazawa et al., 2005, J Immunol 174:2004). In addition, the demonstration of aberrant regulation of alternative signaling pathways (FLT3; Rras2; beta-catenin. SOCS2), proteosomes, and chaperone proteins suggest that the targeting of several novel pathways may be needed in the treatment of advanced CML.","Compared to other types of leukemia, there have been few papers exploring the use of microarrays on the biology of CML. In sum, 23 patients of various stages have been studied, 10 on unsorted samples, 13 from AC133+ isolated cells. It is difficult to make a direct comparison of these studies and ours, given the different types of samples obtained, the difference in the array platforms (these studies used platforms examining 3,000-5,000 genes, compared to \u02dc24,000 genes in this current study). In general, however, the functional changes of progression, e.g., changes in differentiation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion, remained as common themes across the study. In contrast to one study, no significant differences in signatures obtained from bone marrow and peripheral blood () were found, which may be important in future prospective studies of this disease in patients.","These findings have the potential to influence therapy of CML. Patients who present with gene expression patterns suggestive of advanced phase disease might benefit to move straight to transplantation if a donor exists, or if not, other investigation therapies. Moreover, PCR assays of individual genes (or small sets of genes) may be used to monitor patients early in the course of imatinib therapy for signs of progression to advanced disease. Microarray studies of large cohorts of patients treated with imatinib will likely identify gene patterns indicative of response that can be used immediately at diagnosis to tailor therapy.","Patient samples. All samples were obtained under the auspices of institutional review board approve protocols. Samples came from the FHCRC, the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Myeloid Repository, the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, the University of California, Los Angeles, or the University of Chicago. RNA extraction was either performed immediately, or in the case of samples stored in a liquid nitrogen repository, after thawing. All RNA samples were quality tested by analysis of ribosomal RNA peaks using an ABI Bioalyzer. The definition of chronic, accelerated and blast crisis was based on the criteria of Sokal (Sokal et al., 1984, Blood 63:789).","Amplification, labeling, and hybridization. The procedures of RNA amplification, labeling, and the hybridization to arrays, as well as the specifics of the array platforms, has been previously published (Hughes et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:342).","Analytic Methods and Results. Each individual sample was hybridized to a pool of chronic phase samples. The log 10 (Ratio) of intensity of individual samples to the pool were used for the subsequent analysis. Before selecting features by ANOVA, 25,000 genes on the array were first screened for evidence of differential regulation by requiring P-value of regulation <1% in more than 3 experiments. Where P-value of regulation is based on the platform error model. Features differentiating progression stages were selected by ANOVA test.","Functional annotation of gene lists. Genes represented on the microarray were annotated by assignment to GO Biological Process or Molecular Function categories, or to KEGG pathways. Gene lists (input sets) were queried for enrichment of members of specific functional classes or pathways relative to the background frequency. The significance (P-value) of enrichment was computed using the hypergeometric probability distribution. Reported in each case are the numbers of genes in the input set (input gene count), number of genes in a particular category or pathway in the input set (overlap gene count), number of genes in a particular category among all genes present on the array (set gene count). The total number of unique genes on the array is 24132.","Methods to common promote site analysis. The common promoter sites were based on the predictions derived from the database (oPOSSUM) by Wasserman et al. (www.cisreg.ca). The hypergeometric P-value for enrichment of a particular binding site was computed by comparing the number of genes with the binding site from a signature gene set to that from a background set (i.e., all genes represented on the microarray).","Controls. We compared the genes found associated with progression to the genes found significantly over- and under-expressed with prolonged \u201ctransit time\u201d from sample acquisition to RNA processing (Radich et al., 2004, Genomics 83:980). There gene signatures of the two data sets were different, excluding this artifact as contributing significantly to the progression gene set.","Lastly, we compared gene expression signatures from the sites contributing samples to confirm that there were no site-signatures confounding the analysis. We found no evidence of site-specific signatures.","As some samples of blast crisis came from peripheral blood rather than bone marrow, we compared three samples in which simultaneous samples were available from bone marrow and peripheral blood.
