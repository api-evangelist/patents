This application is also related to patent application Ser. No. 10\/692,398, \u201cA REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER FILTERING SYSTEM\u201d, filed Oct. 23, 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference.","This disclosure relates to reverse osmosis systems.","A typical reverse osmosis water filtering system used in purifying water includes a semi-permeable membrane. Typically, a pressure is applied to incoming water that forces the incoming water through the membrane. The membrane filters impurities from the incoming water leaving purified water on the other side of the membrane called permeate water. The impurities left on the membrane are washed away by a portion of the incoming water that does not pass through the membrane. The impurities and the water used to wash them away from the membrane are called concentrate water.","In one aspect, the invention is a one-piece manifold for a reverse osmosis system. The manifold includes a filter configured to receive water from a water port and a membrane configured to receive filtered water via a first conduit. The membrane is also configured to send permeate water to a reverse osmosis tank. The manifold also includes a flow restrictor configured to receive concentrate water from the membrane via a second conduit and to pass the concentrate water to a drain port.","In another aspect, the one piece manifold is adapted for use in a zero waste reverse osmosis system by passing the concentrate water to a water source port. This aspect may include a feature of having a shut-off valve modified for zero-waste.","In still another aspect, the invention is a flow restrictor defining a restricted flow path for liquid. The flow restrictor includes a housing defining an elongated conduit having a tapering conical wall defining a first screw thread and a water-channel thread extending along the tapering conical wall. The housing includes a first opening into a distal region of the conduit for receiving a flow of liquid and a second opening into a proximal region of the conduit. The flow restrictor also includes an axially elongated plug received into the conduit. A surface of the plug is opposed to the tapering conical wall defining a second screw thread and a tapering surface. The second screw thread is disposed in threaded engagement with the first screw thread defined by the conical wall of the housing. The opposed surface of the water-channel thread and the tapering surface of the plug are disposed in sealing engagement within the conduit and opposite to define a region for liquid flow. The housing with the water-channel thread and the tapering surface of the plug thereby cooperatively define a generally spiral liquid flow path along the water-channel screw thread and the tapering surface, for flow of liquid generally between the first opening and the second port for delivery of liquid from the conduit.","In still another aspect, the invention is the flow restrictor modified for flow of liquid generally between the first opening and a port defined by the flow restrictor for delivery of liquid from the conduit.","The aspects above may have one or more of the following advantages. A one-piece manifold provides many components of a standard reverse osmosis system into a single unit. Thus, tubular connections between these components are eliminated thereby providing a system that reduces the number leaks caused by these tubular connections. In addition, a one-piece manifold can be installed faster than the standard reverse osmosis system because there are less overall components.","A tapered plug within the flow restrictor can be manufactured using injection molding techniques compared to standard tubular flow restrictor designs. In addition, modifications can be further made in flow restrictor flow rate at little cost. For example, the flow rate of the restrictor can be controlled by maintaining the same insert length while adjusting the length of the plug.","Other features, objects and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Referring to , a typical prior art reverse osmosis water filtering system  may be modified by combining components of system  into a single housing, a one-piece manifold  (), to minimize leaks that result from standard tubular connections between the components. System  includes a filter system , a reverse osmosis membrane , a reverse osmosis storage tank , a flow restrictor , a shut-off valve , a carbon filter  and an air gap faucet . Filter system  includes a sediment filter  and carbon filters (e.g., carbon filter and carbon filter ). Intake water enters system  from a cold water angle stop valve , which is connected to a cold water source , and is routed through an intake tube  to filter system . Cold water angle stop valve  is also connected to a standard faucet  through a cold water faucet line  providing cold water to the standard faucet.","Sediment filter  removes sediment such as sand and dirt and the like from the intake water. Carbon filters and remove chlorine and other contaminants that cause bad color, odor and taste. The filtered water is routed to membrane  through a water tube .","Membrane  includes three ports: an intake port , a permeate outlet port  and a concentrate outlet port . Intake port  receives filtered intake water from filter system  through water tube . Permeate water is routed from outlet port  through permeate tubes and and shut-off valve  to tank  to be stored under pressure. Shut-off valve  is automatic and stops the flow of water to membrane  and to tank . When air gap faucet  is opened by a user, permeate water is forced from tank  and through a carbon filter  though the faucet  for use by a user. Concentrate water is routed from outlet port  through a waste water tube , having a flow restrictor , through a drain tube  for subsequent disposal down drain .","Referring to , a one-piece manifold  combines a sediment filter, carbon filters, a membrane, a flow restrictor and a shut-off valve into a single unit within a reverse osmosis water filtering system.","One-piece manifold  includes a sediment filter , two carbon filters and a membrane , a check valve , a flow restrictor , and a shut-off valve  all encased in a housing or manifold  made of a light but solid material (e.g., polypropylene, plastic, glass, talc). Each filter , and is located within its own separate filter bowl and respectively. The one-piece manifold  is injected molded. Thus, instead of having tubes interconnecting the components of the reverse osmosis system like traditional systems, the one-piece manifold system  uses grooves and conduits (e.g., conduit and conduit ) molded in the housing , thereby reducing the potential for leaks to occur, e.g. as compared to standard tubing connections.","Water enters system  via an intake port  and through shutoff valve . The water can pass through sediment filter  and\/or through each of the carbon filters and depending on the mold configuration. End caps and located on each end of the manifold define grooves (not shown) that can be manufactured in different desired configurations to control the flow of the water between membrane  and each of the filters , and Thus, the reconfigurable end caps alter the order of filtration through the filters , and and membrane . For example, water can flow through sediment filter  and one carbon filter and then to membrane . Other embodiments include routing the water from one of the carbon filters, carbon filter for example, to membrane  and then to the other carbon filter, carbon filter The end cap and membrane vessel cap  are plate welded to housing  and an end cap respectively.","Membrane  is positioned within a membrane housing  that defines threads that screw onto the membrane vessel cap . A clip  over the membrane housing supports the membrane housing if the membrane housing  is used as a handle e.g., to lift the entire unit when the housing is full of water.","The water exits the membrane in one of three paths. The first path carries the permeate water through the check valve  through to a tank port . The tank port  includes a \u215c inch fitting for connection to a \u00bc inch inside diameter tube that allows the water to flow faster from the tank to the faucet. The second path carries water from the tank to a faucet port . Faucet port  includes a \u215c inch fitting. The third path carries the concentrate water to the flow restrictor .","Referring next to , flow restrictor  consisting of a plug  and a hollow housing or insert  constructed to receive plug . Plug  includes a tapered shaft  having a length L, e.g. about 1.5 inches, a screw thread section , and an O-ring  at a proximal end . Tapered shaft  has a taper angle of approximately 1.5 degrees. Screw thread section  includes screw threads and separated from one another by a first gap and a second gap Without gaps and screw threads and would form one continuous thread around the circumference of plug . Each gap and extends 90 degrees about the circumference of plug . Plug  is made of a suitable material such as polyethylene and the like so it is softer than the housing material.","Housing , having a length, L, e.g., about 3 inches, includes screw thread  and water-channel thread . Water-channel thread  includes a pointed end , with a gap  between the thread that is a part of a water-flow path. Housing  is made of a suitable material such as ABS plastic and the like so it is harder than the plug material.","Plug  and housing  are interengaged by screw threads and with screw thread  initially and then interengaged by screw thread  with plug material as the plug is screwed in further, which provide a water tight seal. Tapered shaft  extends into housing  about \u00bd its length, L. Flow restrictor  is constructed so that the water-channel thread  seals around tapered shaft  to provide a sealed gap  forming a spiral flow path for water along and around the tapered shaft. In particular, point  of water-channel thread  slightly penetrates into the opposed surface of the tapered shaft  to ensure the tight seal.","The flow path of the water through flow restrictor  starts by passing through an aperture  at distal end  of the housing  and continues into housing  until the water comes in contact with the tip region  of the tapered plug . The volume occupied by tapered shaft  within housing  directs the water into sealed gap . The water continues to spiral around and along the tapered shaft following the water-channel thread until the water reaches threads and . The water is forced through gaps and and into the end cap and through a drain port . However, in other embodiments, the flow can be restricted in the opposite direction.","The flow path cross section is designed to restrict water flow using capillary characteristics of water, while at the same time providing a large enough flow cross section to prevent small particles from clogging the flow path.","The tapering of plug  from the proximal end  to the distal end region , and the use of water-channel thread , allows the flow restrictor to be injected molded very easily and inexpensively. For example, after plug  has been injected molded, it can be easily released from a mold by rotating the plug a few turns and then drawing the plug from the mold. The tooling also allows the flow restrictor to be configured for \u201cstand alone\u201d use as a flow restrictor for other common reverse osmosis water filtration systems.","Water-channel thread  within flow restrictor  controls the flow of the water by generating a capillary action around tapered shaft  to restrict the flow of water. Thus, the flow restrictor restricts the water, unlike the traditional winding tube design. The length, i.e., pitch, of the thread can be altered to change the degree of flow restriction.","In other embodiments, the length, L, of tapered shaft  can also be modified to control flow rate. For example, housing  can have the same dimensions, thus saving on manufacturing costs, and the length of plug  can be modified to be shorter, thereby to increase the flow rate through the flow restrictor, or longer, thereby to reduce the flow rate through the flow restrictor.","The one-piece manifold is mountable by screwing screws (not shown) through each of the screw openings and ","The advantages of the one-piece are not limited to the following. The one-piece manifold has an easy to change membrane by simply unscrewing the membrane housing . The one-piece manifold integrates the check valve for permeate water. The one-piece manifold includes high flow water paths from the tank inlet to the faucet outlet. The filter bowls  have two \u201cslip\u201d type O-rings each  of which the top o-ring will also seal in compression, and an end stop (not shown) for the threads so that the bowls cannot be over tightened and will maintain a good seal.","Referring to , B, and  to , the one-piece manifold  is modified from a standard configuration (a reverse osmosis system that empties concentrate water into a drain) to a zero-waste reverse osmosis system that empties concentrate water into a water source by modifying the shut-off valve . Details of converting a standard reverse osmosis system to a zero-waste reverse osmosis system is described in patent application Ser. No. 10\/692,398, \u201cA REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER FILTERING SYSTEM\u201d, filed Oct. 23, 2003 and is incorporated in its entirety herein.","Without modification, shut-off valve  stops the flow of intake water based on the pressure in the reverse osmosis tank. Shut-off valve  is a barrier between an intake water flow path  and a permeate water flow path . The shut-off valve includes a piston  and a spacer . Intake water flow path  is opened or closed by the piston  depending on the water pressure in the tank. When the piston  is closed, the flow of intake water from the filter  is prevented from flowing to the filter ","In one embodiment of a zero-waste reverse osmosis system, a modified shut-off valve  includes a piston  having a shorter length than piston  and replaces piston . The intake water path  will continuously flow from filter to filter independent of the pressure in the reverse osmosis tank due to the piston  stopping before it can close the water path  to the next filter An external pump of a zero-waste reverse osmosis system (not shown) pumps into the normal inlet port .","In another embodiment, a shut-off valve  is modified to include a spacer , instead of piston  and spacer , so that spacer  is long enough so that the incoming water from filter  does not flow to filter regardless of the pressure within the reverse osmosis tank. Instead, the water flows out through a zero-waste port  and in through a zero-waste port  and continues on to filter ","Referring to , in other embodiments, the flow restrictor may be modified for systems that do not include one-piece manifolds. For example, a flow restrictor  may be used in system  or in zero-waste reverse osmosis systems such as those described in patent application Ser. No. 10\/692,398, \u201cA REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER FILTERING SYSTEM\u201d, filed Oct. 23, 2003 and is incorporated in its entirety herein. The flow restrictor  includes a plug  and a housing .","Plug  includes a tapered shaft  having a length L, e.g., about 1.5 inches, a screw thread section , an o-ring  and an aperture  that leads into a proximal end  forming a port . Screw thread section  includes screw threads and separated from one another by a first gap and a second gap (not shown). Plug  and housing  are interengaged by screw threads and with screw thread , which along with o-ring  provide a water tight seal. Water flow is similar to flow restrictor  except after water passes through the first and second gaps, the water is forced through aperture  and out port .","There has been described novel apparatuses and techniques for reverse osmosis systems. It is evident that those skilled in the art may now make numerous modifications and uses of and departures from specific apparatus and techniques herein disclosed without departing from the inventive concepts. Consequently, the invention is to be construed as embracing each and every novel feature and novel combination of features present in or possessed by the apparatus and techniques herein disclosed and limited solely by the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 2\u20135"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 17A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 17B","FIG. 17A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 17C","FIG. 17A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 17D","FIG. 17C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 22A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 22B","FIG. 22A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 22C","FIG. 22A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
