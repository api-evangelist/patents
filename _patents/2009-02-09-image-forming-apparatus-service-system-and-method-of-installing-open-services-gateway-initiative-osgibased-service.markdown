Description of the Related Art","The rapid development of digital technologies and growth of the Internet have enabled users to be provided with various services through digital home construction. Digital home technologies provide more varied services using external communication infrastructures relative to home networking technologies for sharing over high speed Internet connections, file sharing, and sharing between neighboring apparatuses.","Such digital home technologies provide a platform standard for various services, such as an Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) service platform operated using a Java virtual machine (JVM). The OSGi service platform provides basic services using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), service management, and\/or log services on an OSGi framework. Service providers provide services by distributing their respective services using the OSGi framework in the form of bundles. The OSGi service platform supports conventional home network technologies (such as Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Jini, and\/or Home Audio Video interoperability (HAVi)) so that the OSGi service platform can be applied in various environments (such as a set-top box (STB) of a television (TV), a cable modem, an alarm system, and\/or an energy management system).","An application programming interface (API) of the OSGi service platform is written in Java, so the API can run on various platforms having diverse operating systems (OS).

Here, the information on the user interface may be used to inform a user of the name or operation of a service in the form of an icon, and may include information on the position in which icon data is stored. Such characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle may be generated using Java Archive (JAR) files formed to distribute a conventional OSGi bundle.","Here, services refer to various operations provided by an OSGi-based apparatus. For example, if the OSGi-based apparatus is an image forming apparatus, the services may include facsimile transmission, copying, and\/or printing provided by the image forming apparatus. Additionally, the services may include an operation that is only supported by an image forming apparatus in which an OSGi bundle is installed (such as transmission of a facsimile document to a predetermined mail address).","The terminal apparatus  provides the stored characteristic information to the image forming apparatus . Specifically, the terminal apparatus  may transmit position information and\/or a URL address of the characteristic information to the image forming apparatus , in response to a request from the image forming apparatus . For example, if the characteristic information is stored as a web page, the terminal apparatus  may provide the image forming apparatus  with the URL address of the web page. However, it is understood that aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the terminal apparatus  may transmit the characteristic information directly to the image forming apparatus , or may transmit the URL address of characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle stored in an external server (not shown) to the image forming apparatus , without storing the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle.","The terminal apparatus  includes a service engine corresponding to the OSGi bundle. Specifically, the service engine of the terminal apparatus  performs predetermined operations in response to the request from the image forming apparatus , and sends the result thereof to the image forming apparatus . It is understood that the service engine may be implemented in the form of web pages, rather than an OSGi framework, and may be written in programming languages other than Java.","The image forming apparatus  accesses the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle from the terminal apparatus , generates a virtual JAR file, and installs the generated JAR file on the OSGi framework. The image forming apparatus  may be implemented as a copier, a printer, a facsimile machine, or a multifunctional peripheral (MFP) combining operations of one or more of those devices.","Hereinafter, the configuration and operations of the image forming apparatus  will be described in detail.  is a block diagram of the image forming apparatus  according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to , the image forming apparatus  includes an interface unit , a JAR generating unit , a control unit , a user interface unit , and a storage unit .","The interface unit  accesses the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle. Specifically, if an address in which an OSGi bundle install command and the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle are stored is received from the terminal apparatus , the interface unit  accesses the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle using the received address.","The address at which the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle is stored may be a storage address in the terminal apparatus , or a URL address of the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle provided in the form of web pages. Additionally, the interface unit  may receive the address from the terminal apparatus , or a user may directly receive the address via the user interface unit . The user interface unit  may be able to simultaneously implement input and output (such as a touch pad). However, it is understood that aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the user interface unit  may include separate devices for input and output (such as a mouse and a monitor).","Additionally, the interface unit  may periodically access a preset address in the terminal apparatus . If characteristic information associated with a new OSGi bundle is found, the interface unit  may allow the new OSGi bundle to be installed. The characteristic information accessed as described above may be temporarily stored in the storage unit  of the image forming apparatus , and the user interface unit  may notify a user that there is a new OSGi bundle to be installed. If the user enters the OSGi bundle install command, the new OSGi bundle is installed. The storage unit  may be a memory mounted inside the image forming apparatus  (for example, a read-only memory (ROM), a flash memory, or a hard disk drive (HDD)), or may be an external HDD or memory card connected to the image forming apparatus  (for example, a Memory Stick (MS), an extreme Digital (xD) picture card, a Secure Digital (SD) card, or a user serial bus (USB) memory).","The JAR generating unit  generates a virtual JAR file using the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle. Specifically, the JAR generating unit  generates a virtual manifest file and\/or a virtual activator file using the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle accessed by the interface unit . In more detail, the JAR generating unit  generates a virtual activator file to connect to the web page of the service engine, using the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle. An activator file registers services to the OSGi framework. However, since the service engine related to the OSGi bundle according to an embodiment of the present invention is not installed in the image forming apparatus , the virtual activator file may be formed to register a service to connect a URL of the service engine to the OSGi framework. Additionally, the JAR generating unit  generates a virtual manifest file used to operate services.

The virtual JAR file may be installed in the OSGi framework in the same manner as an actual JAR file in the OSGi framework, so no further description thereof will be provided herein. The control unit  provides a service defined in the installed OSGi bundle. Specifically, if a user enters a command to start the service defined in the installed OSGi bundle, the control unit  accesses, for example, a web page forming the service engine for the installed OSGi bundle by referring to the \u201cApplicationAliasURL\u201d described in the virtual manifest file. Additionally, the control unit  may perform various operations in the image forming apparatus  in response to operations of the service engine performed by the terminal apparatus .","Accordingly, the image forming apparatus  generates the virtual JAR file related to the OSGi bundle and installs the virtual JAR file in the OSGi framework, so that a user can easily install the OSGi bundle in the image forming apparatus  from a remote location. Additionally, the service engine for the OSGi bundle is provided from web pages outside the image forming apparatus , so an application may be written using various programming languages other than Java (such as C or PHP).","While the terminal apparatus  may, although not necessarily, store the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle and provides the service engine as described above with reference to , it is understood that, according to other aspects, more than one apparatus can provide the characteristic information associated with the OSGi bundle and service engine.
