{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to visualization of information and more particularly to techniques for displaying information related to collection hierarchies.","The concept of collections is integral to several fields. For example, collections are commonly used to show containment relationship. A collection may comprise several elements, one or more of which may themselves be collections, and so on. There may be several levels to a collection hierarchy with a collection comprising a subcollection, the subcollection comprising another collection, and so on. Improved techniques are desired for depicting information related to collections.","Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for displaying information related to collection hierarchies. In one embodiment, an integrated direct-manipulation image-based interface is provided for displaying information related to collections. The interface also enables operations to be performed on collections and their elements. Multiple levels of the collection hierarchy are made visible and editable at the same time by the user interface.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for displaying information related to collections. In one embodiment, a graphical object representative of a collection is displayed. The graphical object representing the collection has a bounds associated with it that defines an area of a certain shape and size and a grid of tiled cells on a 2-dimensional plane, wherein each element in the collection is associated with one or more cells of the grid. The cells of the grid may be of the same shape and size or of different shapes and sizes. A graphical object is displayed for each element in the collection such that the graphical object for an element is displayed based upon the one or more cells of the grid associated with the element represented by the graphical object. Displaying of graphical objects for the elements in the collection comprises scaling and positioning the grid such that all graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed within the area defined by the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.","In one embodiment, the grid of the graphical object representing the collection may be positioned such that a centroid of a span of cells of the grid associated with the elements of a collection is the same as a centroid of the graphical object representing the collection. Scaling the grid may comprise scaling the grid such that all graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed as large as possible.","In one embodiment, a first and a second bounds may be associated with the graphical object representing a collection. The area defined by the second bounds may be such that it is within the area defined by the first bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. The graphical objects representing the elements of the collection may be displayed within the second bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.","The elements of a collection may be a non-collection element or a collection element. Multiple levels of a collection hierarchy may exist. For example, a collection may comprise an element that is another collection which in turn may comprise one or more elements that are collections, and so on. The user interface according to an embodiment of the present invention displays graphical objects depicting collections at the multiple levels and elements of the collections. At each level, graphical objects are displayed such that graphical objects representing elements within a collection are displayed within the bounds of a graphical object representing the collection.","In one embodiment, a cell of a grid associated with a graphical object representing a collection may be assigned or associated with at most one element of the collection. In other embodiments, a cell of the grid may be associated with multiple elements of the collection.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, when displaying a graphical object representing a collection and graphical objects for elements of the collection, the grid associated with the graphical object representing the collection may be iteratively scaled and positioned such that all the cells of the grid that are associated with the elements of the collection are positioned within the graphical object representing the collection. As part of displaying the graphical objects for the elements of a collection, for at least one element from the collection, a set of cells of the grid associated with the collection graphical object are determined that are associated with the at least one element. The graphical object representing the at least one element is then displayed in a position corresponding to the set of cells of the grid. A minimum bounding box may also be determined based upon the set of cells. The grid associated with a graphical object representing a collection may or may not be displayed.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the graphical objects displayed for collections and their elements are individually selectable. One or more graphical objects may be selected at a time. One or more operations may be performed on the selected graphical objects. In one embodiment, the operation performed on a selected graphical object is performed on an element or collection represented by the selected graphical object.","Various different operations may be performed. In one embodiment, a new element may be added to a collection. This may cause the user interface and graphical objects displayed for the collection to be redisplayed. The grid associated with the graphical object representing the collection may be scaled and positioned such that all cells of the grid associated with the elements of the collection, including the new element, are positioned within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. Graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are redisplayed such that the graphical object for an element is displayed in a position corresponding to the one or more cells of the grid associated with the element and the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.","In one embodiment, an element may be deleted from a collection and may cause the graphical objects for the collection and its elements to be redisplayed. The grid associated with the graphical object representing the collection may be scaled and positioned such that all cells of the grid associated with elements of the collection, excluding the deleted element, are positioned within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. Graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are redisplayed such that the graphical object for an element is displayed in a position corresponding to the one or more cells of the grid associated with the element and the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.","In yet another embodiment, information may be received indicative of a change in size or position of a graphical object representing a first element in a collection. The grid associated with the graphical object representing the collection may be scaled and positioned such that all cells of the grid associated with elements of the collection, including the first element, are positioned within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. Graphical objects for elements in the collection may be redisplayed such that the graphical object for an element is displayed in a position corresponding to the one or more cells of the grid associated with the element and the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.","The foregoing, together with other features, embodiments, and advantages of the present invention, will become more apparent when referring to the following specification, claims, and accompanying drawings.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details.","Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for displaying information related to collection hierarchies. In one embodiment, an integrated direct-manipulation image-based interface is provided for displaying information related to collections. The interface also enables operations to be performed on collections and their elements. Multiple levels of the collection hierarchy are made visible and editable at the same time by the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100"]},"As depicted in , computer system  comprises a processor , memory , renderer , one or more output devices , one or more input devices , and a network interface . The various components of computer system  communicate with each other using bus subsystem . While one bus subsystem is shown in the embodiment depicted in , alternative embodiments may utilize multiple bus subsystems.","Network interface  provides an interface to other computer systems and networks. Network interface  provides an interface for receiving data from other sources and for transmitting data to other sources from computer system . Embodiments of network interface  include an Ethernet card, a modem (telephone, satellite, cable, ISDN, etc.), (asynchronous) digital subscriber line (DSL) units, and the like.","Processor  is configured to perform processing for displaying collections information according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example, processor  may be configured to execute code modules or instructions  that cause the processor to perform processing to display information related to collections. The code modules or instructions  may be stored in memory . Processor  may also perform other functions performed by computer system . Processor  may also control the functioning of other subsystems of computer system .","Information  related to one or more collections may be stored in memory  (depicted as collections information ). Processor  may use collections information  to draw graphical objects representing the collections according to the teachings of the present invention. Collections information  may also be stored in memory locations remote to computer system  such as on one or more systems or servers that can be accessed by computer system  using network interface . The collections information may also be stored on storage devices that are made accessible to computer system .","Collections information  comprises information related to one or more collections and the elements contained by the collections. A collection may contain zero or more elements. A collection with zero elements is an empty collection. An element of a collection may itself be another collection containing zero or more elements or a non-collection element. As a result, multiple levels of collections hierarchy may exist with a first collection comprising an element which is a collection, which in turn may comprise an element which is another collection, and so on. Examples of collections include a folder, a directory, a bag, a set, etc. An element of a collection may be a document (e.g., an image, a web page, an editable document), a media object (e.g., an audio clip), a link (e.g., a URL), and the like.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, collections are depicted using one or more graphical objects. A graphical object is displayed for a collection and for each element of the collection. The graphical objects representing the collection and its elements are displayed such that the graphical objects for the elements are displayed completely within the boundary of the graphical object representing the collection containing the elements. In this manner, the containment relationship between a collection and its elements is clearly visually displayed to a user.","Multiple levels of a collection hierarchy may be displayed using graphical objects. For example, consider a scenario where a first collection comprises an element that is another collection (a second collection) that in turn comprises one or more elements. In this scenario, a graphical object is displayed for the first collection. A graphical object is displayed for each element of the first collection, including the second collection, such that the graphical objects are displayed within the boundaries of the graphical object representing the first collection. Further, a graphical object is displayed for each element of the second collection in such a way that the graphical objects representing elements of the second collection are displayed within the boundaries of the graphical object representing the second collection. The graphical objects are displayed such that multiple levels of the collection hierarchy are visible at the same time. Further, in one embodiment, the graphical objects are drawn such that each of the graphical objects is individually selectable using an input device such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, pen, etc. and any of the graphical objects may be selected at a time. Operations may be performed using the selected graphical objects. Performing an operation on a graphical object translates to performing the operation on the collection or element, which may be a collection or a non-collection, represented by the graphical object. In this manner, an integrated direct-manipulation image-based interface is provided for displaying and manipulating collections and their elements.","Information  stored in memory  relates to graphical objects and associated information that is used to display the collections hierarchy. Information  may also be stored in other memory locations accessible to computer system  such as on one or more systems or servers that are remote from computer  and that can be accessed by computer system  using network interface . Processor  may use information  to display the collections information. Information  may comprise information related to the size and shape of the graphical objects, colors or patterns to be used for displaying the objects, and other attributes associated with the graphical objects.","Renderer  is configured to render or draw the graphical objects representing collections and their elements on a display. Renderer  may receive information from processor  and use the information to draw graphical objects for collections and their elements at multiple levels of hierarchy. In one embodiment, renderer  may be a special purpose graphics processing unit (GPU) such as GPUs provided by ATI\u2122, NVIDIA\u2122, or the like. In the embodiment depicted in , renderer  is provided in addition to a processor  and may work in conjunction with processor  to perform the graphics processing. In alternative embodiments, renderer  may be part of processor  or processor  may be configured to perform the processing performed by renderer .","Computer system  may comprise one or more output devices . Output devices  may include a visual output device such as a screen or monitor or projector that displays the collections information according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example, graphical objects representing a collection and its elements may be displayed on a screen or monitor.","Input devices  enable a user of system  to interact with and provide information to system . Input devices  may include wired or wireless devices such as a keyboard, pointing devices such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, or graphics tablet, a scanner, a touchscreen incorporated into the display, audio input devices such as voice recognition systems, microphones, and other types of input devices. In general, an input device may refer to any device or mechanism that may be used for inputting information to system . A user may use an input device such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, pen, etc. to select and manipulate one or more of the graphical objects depicting collections or non-collections displayed on an output device.","Memory  provides a repository for storing the programming and data constructs that provide the functionality of the present invention. For example, a computer program or software code modules (or instructions)  implementing the functionality of the present invention may be stored in memory . These modules\/instructions may be executed by processor . Memory  may also provide a repository for storing data used in accordance with the present invention such as collections information  and graphical objects information . In one embodiment, memory  may also store rendered images of graphical objects that may be displayed via a display device.","Memory  may include a number of memories including a main random access memory (RAM) for storage of instructions and data during program execution and a read only memory (ROM) in which fixed instructions are stored. Memory  may also comprise subsystems that provide persistent (non-volatile) storage and caching for program and data files, and may include a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive along with associated removable media, a Compact Disk Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) drive, an optical drive such as a DVD, removable media cartridges, flash memory, and other like storage media.","Computer system  can be of various types including a personal computer, a portable computer, a workstation, a network computer, a mainframe, a kiosk, a photocopier, a printer, a multi-function printer (MFP), or any other data processing system. Due to the ever-changing nature of computers and networks, the description of system  depicted in  is intended only as a specific example for purposes of illustrating the preferred embodiment of a processing system. Many other configurations having more or fewer components than the system depicted in  are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["2","2","200","202","204","206","202","204","206","210","200","202","204","206","200"]},"The example depicted in  assumes a hierarchy of collections. A graphical object  is displayed representing a first collection. The first collection contains two elements. Graphical objects  and  representing the elements of the first collection are displayed within the boundaries of graphical object  representing the first collection. One of the elements (represented by graphical object ) of the first collection is also a collection (a second collection) comprising two elements. Graphical objects  and  are displayed representing the elements of the second collection. Graphical objects  and  are displayed within the boundaries of graphical object  representing the second collection. The element represented by graphical object  is also a collection (a third collection). Two graphical objects  and  are displayed representing the elements of the third collection. Graphical objects  and  are displayed within the boundaries of graphical object  representing the third collection.","The graphical objects displayed in  visually convey information that a first collection comprises two elements, one of the elements being a collection (second collection) comprising two elements, where one of the elements of the second collection is another collection (third collection) comprising two elements. In this manner, multiple levels of the collection hierarchy are displayed at the same time. The manner in which the graphical objects are displayed clearly visually indicates information regarding the containment relationship between the different elements and collections. Each of the graphical objects depicted in  is individually selectable using an input device such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, pen, etc. Different techniques may be used for showing a selected graphical object such as emphasizing the border of the selected graphical object, changing the color of the selected graphical object, etc. One or more operations may be performed on a selected graphical object.","In the example depicted in , a first collection comprises two elements, both of which are collections (a second collection and a third collection). The second collection comprises two elements. The third collection comprises one element which is a collection (a fourth collection). The fourth collection contains four elements. Graphical objects are displayed representing the collections and their elements. A graphical object  is displayed representing the first collection. Graphical objects  and  are displayed representing the elements of the first collection with graphical object  representing the second collection and graphical object  representing the third collection. Graphical objects  and  are displayed representing elements of the second collection. Graphical object  is displayed representing the element contained by the third collection. Graphical objects , , , and  are displayed representing elements contained by the fourth collection. In this manner, multiple levels of the collection hierarchy are displayed at the same time. The manner in which the graphical objects are displayed clearly identifies the containment relationship between the different elements and collections. Each of the graphical objects depicted in  is individually selectable for performing operations. For example, the displayed graphical objects may be selected using an input device such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, pen, etc. Different techniques may be used for showing a selected graphical object such as emphasizing the border of the selected graphical object, changing the color of the selected graphical object, etc.","The graphical objects may be displayed in various different ways. In one embodiment, different colors may be used to display the graphical objects such that the containment relationship is clearly visible. Different shapes and sizes may be used for displaying the graphical objects. A graphical object for an element may also comprise a representation that visually identifies a characteristic of the element represented by the graphical object. For example, the graphical object may display information that identifies the contents of the element represented by the graphical object. For instance, in an embodiment where the elements are documents, a graphical object for a document may display a visual representation generated based upon the contents of the document.","In order to facilitate display of the collection hierarchy, graphical objects have attributes associated with them. As described above, a graphical object may be used to depict a collection or a non-collection. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the type of attributes associated with a graphical object may depend upon whether the graphical object is used to represent a collection or a non-collection. For example, the attributes associated with a graphical object used to depict a collection may include an outer bounds, an inner bounds, and a grid associated with a graphical object while the attributes associated with a graphical object used to depict a non-collection may not have an associated grid. In other embodiments, the attributes associated with a graphical object may be the same irrespective of whether the graphical object is used to depict a collection or a non-collection.","As previously stated, a graphical object may have an outer bounds attribute associated with it. The outer bounds of a graphical object is a boundary that defines the outer boundary or periphery of the graphical object. The outer bounds of a graphical object defines an area of the graphical object that is contained within the outer bounds of the graphical object. The outer bounds of a graphical object thus implicitly defines the size and shape of the graphical object.","The inner bounds of a graphical object is a boundary that is equal to or less than the outer bounds of the graphical object. The inner bounds of a graphical object may be the same as the outer bounds of the graphical object. Alternatively, the inner bounds of a graphical object may mark a boundary that is within the outer bounds of the graphical object. For example, the inner bounds for a graphical object may be determined by shrinking the outer bounds by a certain amount. In one embodiment, the inner bounds is calculated based upon the outer bounds of the graphical object by subtracting a value from the outer bounds. The value that is subtracted from the outer bounds to generate the inner bounds may be different in different dimensions and directions. For example, the subtracted value may be different in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. In general, the inner bounds of a graphical object defines an area of the graphical object that is within the area defined by the outer bounds of the graphical object.","A graphical object may have an associated grid of tiled cells on a 2-dimensional plane. A tiling is a collection of cells which do not overlap and which completely cover the 2-D area in question. In one embodiment, the tiling may be regular-shaped implying that all the cells of the grid are of the same shape and size. In alternative embodiments, the cells of a grid may have different shapes and\/or sizes. Examples of a grid of tiled cells include a rectangular grid of polygons, a jigsaw puzzle, and others.","If a graphical object represents a collection, then each element of the collection is assigned or associated with one or more cells of the grid of the graphical object. In one embodiment, a cell of the grid may be associated with two or more different elements of the collection. In another embodiment, each cell of the grid may be associated with at most one element from the collection.","The association between elements of a collection and cells of a grid associated with a graphical object representing the collection is used for displaying graphical objects representing the elements of the collection. In one embodiment, when displaying a graphical object for an element of a collection, the graphical object for the element is displayed such that it occupies the one or more cells of the grid associated with the element represented by the graphical object. The grid of a graphical object representing the collection is positioned and scaled such that all the cells of the grid associated with one or more elements of the collection are located within the bounds (typically inner bounds) of the graphical object. In this manner, the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection, which are positioned in the cells associated with the corresponding elements, are also all displayed within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. Scaling may involve changing the size of the cells of the grid which may involve shrinking the cells or expanding the size of the cells. Positioning may involve translating the grid in one or more directions. The grid associated with a graphical object itself may or may not be displayed. Whether or not a grid is displayed may be user-configurable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","302","300","304","306","302","308","310","302","312","302","314","304","306","316","308","310","318","312","314","316","318","302","314","316","318","300","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["320","322","320","324","326","328","330","324","326","328","330","320","322","322","320","324","326","328","330","320","322"]},"In the example depicted in , the element represented by graphical object  is another collection containing three elements.

The inputs may include information related to a collection and its elements that are to be represented using one or more graphical objects. A graphical object representing a collection is referred to as a \u201ccollection graphical object\u201d.","As part of step , information related to attributes associated with graphical objects may be determined. For example, information related to the inner and outer bounds associated with the graphical objects may be determined. The inner and outer bounds for a graphical object may be specified by a user. In alternative embodiments, the outer bounds for a graphical object may be determined based upon the available space for displaying the graphical object and the inner bounds for the object may be calculated based upon the outer bounds of the graphical object, such as by shrinking the outer bounds by a certain amount such that the area defined by the inner bounds lies within the area defined by the outer bounds.","As part of , information related to a grid associated with a collection graphical object to be used for representing the collection may be determined. The grid lies in a 2-dimensional plane and is a grid of tiled cells. The cells of the grid may be of the same size and shape (a grid of regular-shaped cells) or of different shapes and sizes. The processing performed in  may comprise determining the shape and size of the cells of the grid.","Other attributes of graphical objects may also be determined such as information specifying a shape and size for the graphical objects to be displayed, colors or background patterns to be used for displaying the graphical objects, and the like.","As part of step , information related to the collection is determined. A list of elements of the collection may be determined. For each element of the collection, the one or more cells of the grid of the collection graphical object associated with the element are determined. An element may be associated with one or more cells of the grid. In one embodiment, a cell of the collection graphical object grid may be associated with multiple elements of the collection. In an alternative embodiment, a cell of the grid may be associated with at most one element of the collection. The alternative embodiment results in non-overlapping display of the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection.","The collection graphical object is then displayed (step ).

As part of , the grid associated with the collection graphical object may be scaled and\/or positioned such that all the cells of the grid that are associated with elements of the collection are all located within the bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. The graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are then displayed in the cells associated with the elements represented by the graphical objects. In one embodiment, the grid of the collection graphical object is scaled and positioned such that all graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed as large as possible while being displayed within the bounds of the collection graphical object. In one embodiment, the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are displayed within the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. In alternative embodiments, for example in scenarios where a graphical object does not have an inner bounds or the inner bounds is the same as the outer bounds, the graphical objects representing the elements may be drawn within the outer bounds of the collection graphical object.","In the manner described above, a graphical object may be displayed for a collection and one or more graphical objects may be displayed representing elements of the collection such that the graphical objects for the elements are displayed within the bounds (typically inner bounds) of the graphical object representing the collection. As previously described, an element of the collection may itself be a collection (a second collection). The method depicted in  and described above may then be re-executed for drawing graphical objects representative of elements of the second collection. In this manner, the method depicted in  and described above may be used to draw graphical objects for collections and elements of collections at various levels of the collection hierarchy. Where at most one element of a collection is associated with a cell, the graphical objects displayed at the various collection levels are all visible at the same time. The graphical objects are also individually selectable at the same time. As previously described, a graphical object may be selected using an input device such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, pen, etc. Different techniques may be used for showing a selected graphical object such as emphasizing the border of the selected graphical object, changing the color or transparency of the selected graphical object, etc.","The graphical objects may be displayed in various different ways. In one embodiment, different colors may be used to display the graphical objects such that the containment relationship is clearly visible. The colors that are used may be based upon a user-configured color scheme. The colors may also be automatically chosen to increase the aesthetic value of the display. In one embodiment, a graphical object for a non-collection element may be displayed such that the display provides a visual indication of the nature or contents of the element. For example, if the element is a document, a graphical object displayed for the document may display a visual representation generated based upon the contents of the document. For example, a thumbnail may be created based upon the contents of the document and the thumbnail may be displayed as part of the graphical object representing the document.","The grid associated with a graphical object representing a collection and used for displaying the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection (as done in step  of ) may comprise tiled regular-shaped cells or non-regular shaped cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","100","500"]},"As depicted in , input parameters to be used by the display process are determined (step ). According to an embodiment of the present invention, the following parameters are determined:","(1) Collection information\u2014This information identifies a collection and a list of elements within the collection;","(2) An area defined by an outer bounds of the graphical object representing a collection of elements. The area is defined as a rectangular region with the corners (OB, OB), (OB+OB, OB), (OB+OB, OB+OB), (OB, OB+OB) in the coordinate system of the inner bounds of the graphical object (C) in which the graphical object representing the collection is being rendered. OBrepresents the width and OBthe height of the graphical object representing the collection (i.e., the width and height of the outer bounds of the graphical object).","(3) Information for determining an inner bounds for the graphical object representing the collection. In one embodiment, two different kinds of margins are provided, namely, a grid gutter parameter and a table fringe parameter. The grid gutter parameter specifies the margin between the edge or outer bounds of the graphical object representing the collection (the collection graphical object) and the start of the grid lines associated with the collection graphical object. For example, reference  in  points to a grid gutter parameter margin for a graphical object  having an associated grid  and an outer bounds . In one embodiment, the grid gutter parameter defaults to 3% of either the width or height of the outer bounds of the collection graphical object, whichever has a lower value. The table fringe parameter specifies the margin between the start of the displayed portion of the grid and the first occupied cell. For example, reference  in  points to a table fringe parameter margin for graphical object  having an associated grid  and an outer bounds . This margin insures that a \u201cfringe\u201d of the edges of empty cells surround the main area, creating the impression that the user is seeing just a small part of an infinite grid. In one embodiment, this defaults to 5% of either the width or height of the outer bounds of the collection graphical object, whichever is smaller. In one embodiment, the inner bounds for the collection graphical object is calculated as the outer bounds minus these two margins. In , the inner bounds of graphical object  is depicted by dotted line . The values for grid gutter and table fringe parameters may be specified by a user or automatically determined based upon the dimensions of a graphical object.","(4) Information related to a grid associated with the graphical object representing the collection. In one embodiment, the grid is defined as an infinite tiling of non-overlapping square cells, all cells being the same height and width, and in the same orientation as the rectangular outer bounds. In one embodiment, cell positions are defined in the grid's own coordinate system (C) as an (x,y) coordinate where x and y are integers representing the location of the top-left corner of a single 1\u00d71 cell in the grid. Coordinates in Cspace may be converted into the coordinate space (C) of the inner bounds of the graphical object representing a collection by applying the transformation T, the transformation comprising of a scaling component S, a horizontal translation component Xand a vertical translation component Y. If the grid is neither scaled nor repositioned relative to C(that is, if S=1 and Xand Yare both 0) then each cell of the grid will be at the same location as the point in Cwith the same corresponding coordinates.","(5) For each element of the collection, information identifying a list of one or more cells from the grid of the collection graphical object that are associated with the element. In one embodiment, the information for each element identifies position information and span information, where the position of an element E of the collection is the x,y coordinate (E, E) of the top-left cell of the grid associated with the element and span is (E, E) as measured in integer numbers of cells of the grid. The area defined by the union of cells that are associated with elements of a collection is called the occupied area of the grid.","After determining the input parameters, a minimum bounding box of the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection is determined (step ). The inner bounds of the collection graphical object may be calculated as follows:\n\nGrid-Gutter ()=*Minimum()\n","where Kis some user-configurable constant which defaults to 0.03 and OBand OBare width and height parameters of the outer bounds of the collection graphical object.\n\nTable-Fringe ()=*Minimum()\n\nwhere K2 is some user-configurable constant which defaults to 0.05\n\nThe minimum bounding box of the inner bounds is defined in Cas the rectangular region with top-left corner at (IB, IB) and dimensions (IB, IB), where:\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n","A minimum bounding box of the occupied area in both Cspace (OA) and Cspace (OAIB) is then calculated (step ). As previously indicated, the occupied area is the area corresponding to the union of all cells in the grid that are associated with at least one element of a collection. As part of , first the minimum and maximum x and y coordinate values for the occupied area are determined using the following algorithm:\n\nSet min=+Infinity\n\nSet max=\u2212Infinity\n\nSet min=+Infinity\n\nSet max=\u2212Infinity\n\nLoop for each element, E, in the collection:\n\nSet min=Minimum(E, min)\n\nSet max=Maximum(, max)\n\nSet min=Minimum(, min)\n\nSet max=Maximum(, max)\n","The minimum bounding box of the occupied area is defined in Cas the rectangular region on the grid starting with the top-left cell at (OA, OA) where\n\nOA=min\n\nOA=min\n\nand with dimensions:\n\n=max\u2212min\n\n=max\u2212min\n","The minimum bounding box of the occupied area is defined in Cas\n\nOAIB=OA transformed into Cby T\n\nIf the grid's current scaling Sis 1 and position offsets (Xand Y) are both zero then OAIB=OA.\n","The grid is then scaled and positioned such that the occupied area is centered inside the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection (step ). This may be done as follows. Given a current scaling for the grid \u201cold S\u201d, a new scaling for the grid is selected as\n\n=Minimum()*(old )\n\nIn one embodiment, the positioning is done as follows:\n\nset -mid+(\/2)\n\nset -mid+(\/2)\n\nset -mid+(\/2)\n\nset -mid+(\/2)\n\nset Offset-mid-mid\n\nset Offset-mid-mid\n\nset Xsuch that the grid is moved by Offsetto the right\n\nset Ysuch that the grid is moved by Offsetdown\n\nThe processing performed in  is iterative, and takes into account the previous scaling and position. The iterative scaling and reposition is performed until the occupied area is centered inside the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.\n","Upon completion of step , the grid of the collection graphical object has a scale and position determined by a new Tand all grid cells of the graphical object associated with the collection elements are fully contained within the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. A graphical object is then displayed for each element of the collection such that the graphical object for an element occupies one or more cells of the scaled and positioned grid of the collection graphical object that are associated with the element represented by the graphical object (step ). Since the cells associated with elements are all positioned within the inner bounds of the collection graphical object (as a result of the processing performed in ), the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection are automatically displayed within the inner bounds of the collection graphical object.","In one embodiment, an additional margin is added between the edge of each graphical object representing an element of the collection and the grid lines of a cell. In one embodiment, this additional margin defaults to 7.5% of the width and height of a single cell in the grid. This ensures that some spacing exists between the outer bounds of graphical objects and the grid lines when the graphical objects are displayed. This additional element margin ensures that graphical objects representing two elements that nominally are associated with adjoining grid cells will be rendered with a small space between them.","The method depicted in  and described may be used to display various collection graphical objects and graphical objects for collections and their elements at different levels of the collection hierarchy.

This area is defined as a set of one or more finite 2-dimensional regions defined in the coordinate system (C) in which the graphical object representing the collection is being represented.","(3) Description of a grid associated with the graphical object representing the collection. The grid associated with a graphical object representing a collection is defined as an area completely covered by non-overlapping cells. The cells of the grid may be of different sizes and shapes, and the area covered may be infinite (as is the case of a simple tiling of squares in an infinite matrix) or finite. Cell positions in the grid are defined in the grid's own coordinate system (C).

The graphical object for an element is drawn in the one or more cells of the grid associated with the element. Since the grid is scaled and positioned such that all cells associated with elements of the collection are positioned within the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection, all the graphical objects for the elements are positioned and displayed within the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection.","In the previous description, the graphical objects representing elements of a collection are displayed within the inner bounds of the graphical object representing the collection, where the inner bounds is determined based upon the outer bounds of the graphical object representing the collection. As previously described, the inner bounds of a graphical object may be the same as or less than the outer bounds, In embodiments where the inner bounds is the same as the outer bounds, either the inner bounds or the outer bounds of the collection graphical object may be used for the various calculations.","The displayed graphical objects, including the graphical object representing the collection and the graphical objects representing elements of the collection, are individually selectable. One or more graphical objects may be selected at a time. When a selection is made using an input device such as a mouse, there may be one or more graphical objects representing elements or collections under the cursor of pointing device. In such a scenario, in one embodiment, the graphical object representing the most deeply-nested element (which may be a collection or a non-collection) under the cursor and that is also available for selection is selected. This is usually the visible, or \u201con top\u201d element, though it may be that the most on-top element is not available for selection at which time selection will cascade to the element's parent. The most common example of such a case is when selecting a graphical object representing a collection into which an element is to be dropped: the graphical object representing the element being dragged is not available for selection (even though it is, by definition, under the cursor) and there might be a graphical object representing a non-collection directly under the cursor, but what gets selected for the drop-zone is the graphical object representing the top-most available collection.","One or more operations may be performed using the selected graphical objects. Operations performed on a graphical object generally cause the operation to be performed on an element or collection represented by the graphical object. For example, double clicking a graphical object may open the element (e.g., a document) represented by the graphical object. Operations may be also performed that affect the manner in which the graphical objects are displayed without affecting the elements represented by the graphical objects. Examples of some operations are provided below.","(1) Resizing a graphical object displayed within a collection graphical object: A graphical object representing an element of a collection may be resized. The resize operation may cause a change in the cells of the grid associated with the element represented by the resized graphical object. This may cause a change in the display of other graphical objects representing other elements within the collection. In one embodiment, the method depicted in  and described above is then re-executed to redisplay the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection. In the re-execution, the \u201cnew\u201d cells associated with the element represented by the resized graphical object are used for the calculations. If the resized graphical object itself represents a collection (a second collection), then the graphical objects that have been displayed representing elements of the second collection may be affected by the resizing. In one embodiment, the method depicted in  and described above is then rerun to redisplay the graphical objects representing the elements of the second collection.","(2) Repositioning a graphical object within a collection graphical object: The location of a graphical object representing an element of a collection may be changed within the bounds of the collection graphical object. The reposition operation may cause a change in the cells of the grid associated with the element represented by the repositioned graphical object. This may cause a change in the display of other graphical objects representing other elements within the collection. In one embodiment, the method depicted in  and described above is then rerun to redisplay the graphical objects representing the elements of the collection. In the rerun, the \u201cnew\u201d cells associated with the element represented by the repositioned graphical object are used for the calculations.","(3) Adding an element to a collection: An element may be added to a collection. A graphical object representing the newly added element is then displayed. The display of the new graphical object may cause a redisplay of all the other graphical objects representing other elements of the collection. In one embodiment, the method depicted in  and described above is re-executed, now with the newly added element. As part of the processing, one or more cells of the grid associated with the newly added element are determined and used for the calculations.","(4) Deleting an element from a collection: An element may be deleted from a collection. After a deletion, the graphical object displayed for the element is no longer displayed. In one embodiment, the method depicted in  and described above is re-executed, now without the deleted element.","As previously described, a graphical object is individually selectable. One or more graphical objects may be selected at a time and operations performed on the selected set of graphical objects. Drag and drop operations may be performed using a selected graphical object. For example, an element may be deleted from a first collection and added to a second collection by selecting the graphical object representing the element, dragging the selected graphical object from the graphical object representing the first collection and dropping it into a graphical object representing the second collection. When the selected graphical object is dropped into the graphical object representing the second collection, the selected graphical object may snap to one or more cells of the grid of the graphical object representing the second collection. The cells to which the selected graphical object snaps to are then associated with the element represented by the selected graphical object. In a grid comprising rectangular cells, a dragged graphical object's drop zone may be calculated as the nearest patch of empty cells of the grid that are large enough to hold the selected graphical object. The graphical objects representing elements of the first collection and the second collection may be redrawn after the drag and drop operation as previously described.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, when the graphical objects representing elements of a collection are redisplayed, the position of each graphical object displayed within the bounds of the collection graphical object relative to other graphical objects displayed within the bounds of the collection graphical object is the same as prior to the redisplaying operation. The size of each graphical object displayed within the bounds of the collection graphical object relative to other graphical objects displayed within the bounds of the collection graphical object is the same as prior to the redisplaying. Further, in one embodiment, the aspect ratio of each graphical object is the same as the aspect ratio of the graphical object prior to the redisplaying.","The techniques described above may be used to display graphical objects representing collections and non-collections at different collection hierarchies. In situations where the collection hierarchy is very deep (e.g., tens or hundreds of nested collections), if the techniques previously described were followed, then a lot of time could be wasted in rendering graphical objects representing elements that wind up being displayed less than a single pixel in size. Several techniques may be used to reduce such an occurrence. In one embodiment, the display techniques are modified such that if a graphical object representing a collection is computed as having a width or height smaller than a certain threshold, then the graphical object is rendered as an empty collection and the collection treated as an empty collection for purposes of displaying the collection hierarchy. In this manner, the display computation is stopped at the level of the \u201cempty\u201d collection.","Further, displayed graphical objects that are very small in size may become difficult to select using an input device such as a mouse. Due to this, a size limit or threshold may be set for performing selection tasks. If a graphical object representing an element in a collection that is being rendered is smaller than a threshold size (e.g., a threshold width or height) then the graphical object is not considered available for selection.","Embodiments of the present invention may also be used to represent collections that represent not just nested hierarchies (i.e., trees) but also webs (directional graphs) where a particular object might appear as an element in multiple collections. One such example is a visualization of a web site, where every page is a collection and every page linked to by that page is represented as an element within the collection. Such a visualization might even have infinitely-nested collections, where A contains B and B contains A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8C"],"b":["8","8","8","8","8","8","8","8","8","8","800","802","800","804","802","804","802","802","804","800"]},"In , a second element has been added to the collection.
