Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to display control apparatuses and storage mediums, and more particularly to a display control apparatus which displays an image downloaded from a server and to a computer-readable storage medium which stores a program for causing a computer to display a downloaded image.","The use of the World Wide Web (WWW) has become very popular, and there are increasing number of operating business systems which carry out various kinds of business processes by use of a WWW browser to download and display an image from a WWW server.","In such an environment, there are demands to realize a large-scale business system including several hundred to several thousand clients, that is, WWW browsers, wherein the system maintenance can be made from the WWW server. In other words, there are demands to manage such a large-scale business system by the WWW server, to quickly display a large number of images moving on the WWW browsers of the clients, and to exchange data among the displayed images at the clients.","2. Description of the Related Art","According to the conventional system, a plurality of images, such as pages of pictures, menus and messages, are stored in the WWW server. The stored images are successively downloaded from the WWW server and successively displayed on the WWW browser of the client. The client carries out various business processes by interacting with the displayed images.","However, in order for the client to successively download and display the images from the WWW server, it is necessary to carry out the following series of processes which are troublesome and time-consuming. In other words, an image which is written in the form of a HTML document and stored in the WWW server is downloaded by the WWW browser of the client, and the downloaded HTML document is analyzed and displayed on a display unit of the client. Then, based on the image which is presently being displayed, a HTML document corresponding to the next image is downloaded from the WWW server, analyzed and displayed on the display unit of the client. Such an operation is repeated for all of the images to be downloaded from the WWW server.","For this reason, it takes time to download the HTML document and to analyze and display the HTML document each time, thereby making it difficult to carry out a series of business processes by quickly downloading the images and quickly switching the images which are displayed.","Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a novel and useful display control apparatus and storage medium, in which the problems described above are eliminated.","Another and more specific object of the present invention is to provide a display control apparatus and storage medium, which download a display control program and image information from a server, develop the image information in a memory at a client by generating a control block by the display control program, and control display and non-display states of the image and exchange of data among displayed images based on the developed image information. According to the display control apparatus and storage medium of the present invention, it is possible to shorten the time conventionally required to download and analyze a HTML document and to generate an image which is to be displayed. As a result, it is possible to quickly display the image, to quickly switch the displayed image, and to quickly exchange data among the displayed images.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a display control apparatus comprising a memory, display control means for generating a plurality of control blocks based on downloaded image information and program, where the control blocks develops images in the memory based on the image information, and display means for displaying an image developed in the memory and corresponding to a business which is selected from another image which is being displayed. According to the display control apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to shorten the time conventionally required to download and analyze a HTML document and to generate an image which is to be displayed. As a result, it is possible to quickly display the image, to quickly switch the displayed image, and to quickly exchange data among the displayed images.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a computer-readable storage medium which stores one or more programs for causing a computer which includes a memory to control display, comprising display control means for causing a computer to generate a plurality of control blocks based on downloaded image information and program, where the control blocks cause the computer to develop images in the memory based on the image information, and display means for causing the computer to display an image developed in the memory and corresponding to a business which is selected from another image which is being displayed. According to the storage medium of the present invention, it is possible to shorten the time conventionally required to download and analyze a HTML document and to generate an image which is to be displayed. As a result, it is possible to quickly display the image, to quickly switch the displayed image, and to quickly exchange data among the displayed images.","Other objects and further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , a client  receives image information and programs downloaded from a server . Both the server  and the client  are data processing apparatuses such as computer systems. This client  includes a browser , a display control program , a plurality of control blocks , a memory  and a display unit . Of course, the server  may also include a display unit similar to the display unit .","The client  forms this embodiment of the display control apparatus.","The browser  connects to the server , and downloads a predetermined URL HTML document which is analyzed and displayed. In this embodiment, the browser  functions as a platform for downloading an applet  from the server  and operating the applet . The applet  is written in Java language, and displays a business list (or work list) and the like on the browser .","The display control program  is downloaded from the server , and carries out various kinds of display control when started. In this embodiment, the display control program  starts a program which is downloaded from the server , and generates a control block  for each image which is displayed.","The control block  carries out operations such as developing the image in the memory  within the client  based on image information , and exchanging data among two or more displayed images. One control block  corresponding to one image can exchange data between another control block  corresponding to another image.","On the other hand, the server  includes functions of a WWW server. This server  centrally manages a large amount of image information , programs which are downloaded to the client  and generate the control blocks  when started, the display control program , programs which operated under the browser  such as the applet .","The image information  includes information related to an image which is to be displayed, such as an image defining body, generation timing information, and deletion timing information.","The display control program  downloads the image information  and the program from the server , and generates the control block  based on the downloaded program and image information . The generated control block  develops the image in the memory  based on the image information . In addition, the applet  displays the business list, and reads from the memory  and displays the developed image which corresponds to a business which is selected from the business list.","An ID is added to each control block . Hence, it is possible to specify the ID to display the image, put the image which is being displayed to a non-display state, or to put the image which is being displayed to the non-display state and display another image instead.","By adding to the image information  the generation timing information which indicates the timing with which the image is developed in the memory , it becomes possible to develop the image of the image information  in the memory  depending on the generation timing information.","Furthermore, by adding to the image information  the deletion timing information which indicates the timing with which the image in the memory  is deleted, it becomes possible to delete the developed image in the memory  depending on the deletion timing information.","Therefore, by downloading the display control program  and the image information  from the server , developing the image of the image information  in the memory  at the client  by generating the control block  by the display control program , and controlling the display and non-display states of the image and exchanging of the data among displayed images based on the developed image, it becomes possible to shorten the time conventionally required to download and analyze a HTML document and to generate an image which is to be displayed. As a result, it is possible to quickly display the image, to quickly switch the displayed image, and to quickly exchange data among the displayed images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["2","18","1","1","3","17","19","23","3"]},"In , the client  requests a page (URL) of a business list menu in a step S, with respect to the server .","The server  which receives the request from the client  sends, that is, downloads the following program and information in a step S, to the client .","applet","display control program","image information and program (control block)\n\n","etc.","In this embodiment, the downloaded applet is a program written in the Java language, and more particularly, is the applet  which operates on the browser  of the client . The display control program is the display control program  described above which operates in the client . The image information and program (control block) respectively are the image information  related to the image which is to be developed in the memory , and the program which is to start and operate in the client  as the control block . The generation timing information indicates the timing with which the image is developed in the memory , and may be added to the image information . The deletion timing information indicates the timing with which the image in the memory  is deleted, and may be added to image information .","In response to the information downloaded from the server , the client  starts the program received by the display control program  and generates the control block  for each image information , in a step S. In a step S, the applet  creates and displays the business list on the browser . The user selects a business from the business list displayed on the browser , in a step S.","A control  which corresponds to the selected business is retrieved from a control block information table S in a step S, based on a name or index S. A step S decides whether or not the control block  which corresponds to the selected business is retrieved, and the process ends if the decision result in the step S is NO.","On the other hand, if the decision result in the step S is YES, the image which is presently being displayed is put into a non-display state in a step S. In addition, the deletion timing of the control block  corresponding to the image which is put into the non-display state is checked in a step S, by checking the deletion timing information of this control block . Further, a step S decides whether or not the non-display state is to be deleted. If the decision result in the step S is YES, a step S deletes from the memory  the image which is put into the non-display state, and the process advances to a step S. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step S is NO, the process advances directly to the step S.","The step S decides whether or not the control block  retrieved in the step S manages an image in the memory . If the decision result in the step S is YES, the image managed by this control block  is displayed in a step S, and the process advances to a step S. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step S is NO, a step S decides whether or not the image information  is already read by the client .","If the decision result in the step S is YES, an image is developed in the memory  in a step S based on the read image information , and the image managed by the control block  is displayed in the step S before the process advances to the step S. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step S is NO, it is judged that the image information  is not yet read by the client , and a request for the image (business name, image name or the like) is made with respect to the server  in a step S.","In a step S, the server  sends the image information  corresponding to the image which is requested by the step S. Then, at the client  which receives the image information  from the server , the control block  develops the image of the received image information  in the memory  in the step S, and the image managed by the control block  is displayed in the step S before the process advances to the step S.","Accordingly, when the image which is presently being displayed is switched to the non-display state, this image is deleted from the memory  if the deletion timing information is ON or active. If the image which is to be displayed next is developed in the memory , this image is read from the memory  and displayed. On the other hand, if the image which is to be displayed next is not developed in the memory  but is already read by the client , this image is developed in the memory  and is then read from the memory  and displayed. Furthermore, if the image which is to be displayed next is not yet read by the client , this image is requested with respect to the server , the image of the image information  downloaded from the server  is developed in the memory , and the image is read from the memory  and displayed.","The number of control blocks  managing the images developed in the memory  is checked in the step S. In addition, a step S decides whether or not the number of control blocks  managing the images developed in the memory  exceeds a predetermined managing number. More particularly, the display control program  checks whether or not the number of control blocks  managing the images developed in the memory  exceeds a predetermined value. The process ends if the decision result in the step S is NO.","On the other hand, if the decision result in the step S is YES, a step S deletes from the memory  the images corresponding to the number of control blocks  exceeding the predetermined managing number, by referring to a control block information table S which is the same as the control block information table S described above. For example, the image managed by the control block  which is set to be deleted by the deletion timing information when the predetermined managing number is exceeded, is deleted starting from the top of the list which is managed by the display control program . In this embodiment, the control block  is not deleted from the memory , and only the image managed by the control block  is deleted from the memory . Of course, it is possible to also delete the control block  from the memory  when the free storage space within the memory  becomes small, for example. The process ends after the step S.","Therefore, it is possible to restrict the number of control blocks  to a prescribed number, by deleting only the images and the control blocks  which are set to be deleted by the deletion timing information. On the other hand, the control blocks  which are not set to be deleted and the corresponding images are constantly stored in the memory . In other words, the images which are frequently displayed are constantly stored in the memory , so that it is possible to immediately display such images at an arbitrary time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["7","8","23"]},"business name\/image name: business ","object ID: object ID=1","image ID: image ID=1","generation timing information: image transition timing","deletion timing information: end timing of applet","history information: 5","automatic timing set: true","data region: name(A), age(30),","etc.","In , the business name\/image name indicate the name of the image information .
