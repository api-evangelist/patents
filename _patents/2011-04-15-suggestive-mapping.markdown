title: Suggestive mapping
abstract: A suggestive mapping device may predict, suggest, and/or provide potential destinations to a user. Additionally, the device may store historical location data of the user, determine a travel vector of the user, and predict the destination of the user based at least in part on the historical location data and/or the travel vector. Further, the device may provide hands-free maps to destinations when the user does not know the address at least by receiving contextual data of the user and/or contextual data of the user's contacts. Such hands-free, suggestive mapping devices may facilitate more effective navigation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Generally, navigation devices present maps from a user's current location or a user-selected starting point to a user-selected destination. For example, with most navigation devices, such as mobile Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, a user may input a starting point and a destination in order to receive a map. Additionally, a user may input a destination and the device may prepare a map from the user's current location to the entered destination. However, in most cases, a user must either input a destination manually or by providing a voice command. However, requiring user input, current navigation devices may be unsafe, or even unlawful, to operate while driving.","Additionally, navigation devices may be most useful when a user is running late or does not know the address of the destination. For example, a user who is running late to a meeting, whether or not they know the meeting location, may not have time to look up the address or enter the address into their navigation device. Unfortunately, current navigation devices are inadequately equipped to handle these and other navigation device deficiencies.","This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts for suggestive mapping devices, which are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Generally, the suggestive mapping devices and services described herein involve using a mobile device to provide suggestions regarding a user's destination based on historical location data, current location data, and\/or communication inputs to and\/or from the user's device.","In one embodiment, a suggestive mapping device may store historical data, including historical and\/or current location data, historical and\/or current location data of friends and\/or contacts of the user, and\/or contextual data such as the time of day and\/or the day of the week, and determine a travel vector of the user. The device may then predict a destination of the user based on some combination of the historical location data and the travel vector and prepare for display a suggested map depicting the route to the predicted destination. In some aspects, the device may display all or part of the suggested map as well. Additionally, in some aspects, the device may send a suggested map to a user's mobile device for display, for example when the device is a Web server of a Web based system or of an in-cloud system. The device may also prepare different maps for display, each with a different number of travel instructions, and may display or send for display a respective map that corresponds to an appropriate travel vector of the user. Further, in some aspects, the device may prepare or display alternative suggested maps in response to an indication, such as selection of a \u201cmore suggestions\u201d button, shaking of the device, nodding of the user, denying the current suggestion by asking for more suggestions, or the like.","In another embodiment, a suggestive mapping device may store historical location data of a user, determine a travel vector of the user, predict a destination of the user based on some combination of the historical location data and the travel vector, and prepare a map depicting one or more travel instructions to the predicted destination. In some aspects, the device may present a different number of travel instructions to the user based at least in part on a portion of the travel vector. For example, the device may be configured to prepare or present an increasing number of travel instructions at one time to the user as the user's speed increases.","Overview","This disclosure is directed, in part, to techniques for implementing a suggestive mapping device or service. This disclosure is also related to providing a hands-free, network interfaced device that may predict, and either provide or display a destination of a user based on historical location data of the user, contextual data of the user and\/or historical and\/or contextual data of the user's contacts. Additionally, this disclosure describes devices that may suggest a destination or multiple destinations to a user with or without user input. As such, the device may provide transient\/ambient mapping such that the device may perpetually update the user with the next travel instruction(s) regardless of whether the user has input a destination or even knows the address of the destination. In this way, when a user is running late, cannot remember a destination's address, and\/or is directionally challenged, the device may help the user effectively, effortlessly, and safely arrive at the intended destination.","In one aspect, a suggestive mapping device may predict one or more locations of where a particular user plans to go and present, to the user, a suggested map and\/or directions of how to get to the predicted location(s). For instance, the suggestive mapping device may store historical location data of the user (at the consent of the user) to develop a pattern regarding a user's typical travel schedule. The device may then use this historical location data coupled with real-time or contextual data (e.g., locations of contacts, a time of day, or a user's travel vector which may include some combination of the current location, travel direction, and velocity of the user) and other signals (e.g., future calendar appointments of the user or contacts of the user) to predict where the user may go at a particular time. In response to this prediction, the device may prepare and\/or render a suggested map to the user or provide the suggested map to a mobile device of the user. Further, in some examples, the suggestive mapping device may automatically assign friendly names (e.g., \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cRestaurant to meet Bill,\u201d \u201cPick up Dry Cleaning,\u201d etc.) to the predicted destinations and\/or the suggested maps. These friendly names may be assigned based on context (e.g., a subject and\/or an attendee name for a meeting request), based on a name associated with the destination location in a reference data store (e.g., a point of interest database), based on names other users have associated with the destination location, a combination of these or other approaches, or additional\/alternative approaches. Names employed as tags may be confirmed in a current or prior session with the user, where a user is offered the option of selecting from or modifying guessed names, or adding a new label to refer to a destination.","For instance, a suggestive mapping device may help a user navigate on a given day to one or more locations without the user providing any inputs. In one hypothetical example, a user (\u201cRisa\u201d) often goes for a walk around Riverfront Park on Saturday mornings, as tracked by her mobile navigation device. Additionally, Risa's calendar indicates that she is planning on meeting her sister Tali for lunch at a South Hill restaurant where Risa has never eaten. In this example, Risa's suggestive mapping device may automatically, at least without being requested by Risa, determine the most optimal route to the park and then to the restaurant to meet Tali, taking into account traffic, the time of day, potential construction, weather, and the like.","In one aspect, the suggestive mapping device may render a suggested travel map and\/or directions to the park and then to the restaurant as soon as Risa turns, unlocks, or otherwise activates the device. Alternatively, or in addition, the suggestive mapping device may not render any maps to Risa until she begins travelling towards one of her destinations. Thus, either way, the device may provide the suggested map and\/or directions without Risa's input (and\/or with Risa's input limited to selection information wherein Risa selects a destination from a collection of suggested destinations). This may be particularly useful when Risa is not at home and the directions to the park may be different from her usual Saturday morning route. Additionally, if Risa does not know the address or location of the South Hill restaurant, the suggestive mapping device may be able to determine the location based on an Internet search using information found in Risa's calendar appointment or based on real-time contextual data such as Tali's location, as tracked by Tali's mobile phone or navigation device (assuming Tali consents to her location being tracked). Additionally, in some aspects, the suggestive mapping device may also use other contextual data of Tali's, such as data from her email applications, search and\/or browsing histories from her Web browser(s), call histories from her cell phone, and the like.","In another aspect, the suggestive mapping device may take into account other signals when predicting a user's travel schedule and generating a corresponding map and\/or directions. For example, the device may leverage an explicit and\/or ad hoc social network to determine locations of the user's contacts, or any other information that may be pertinent in predicting where the user may travel to at a particular time. For instance, if Risa's mother (\u201cToni\u201d) calls, texts, instant messages (\u201cIMs\u201d), tweets to the public, or otherwise digitally contacts Risa while Risa is traveling to either location described above, the suggestive mapping device may appropriately change. In this example, Toni's cellular telephone, navigation device, or other mobile device may indicate that Toni is only a few blocks from the park, the South Hill restaurant, or Risa's current location. As such, Risa's suggestive mapping device may re-render the suggested map to include stopping by to see Toni at some point during Risa's Saturday travels. In other words, the travel prediction and the corresponding predictive map and\/or directions may change based on real-time inputs.","In another aspect, the suggestive mapping device may have access to information about the short- or long-term goals and needs of Risa, and may suggest other waypoints on a current trip, with the bounds of the waypoint adding less than some number of miles or some amount of time to getting to the predicted destination. For example, the suggestive mapping device may have access to knowledge from an interface to an onboard computer that Risa's car is low on fuel and to add a fueling station as a suggested point to route through on the way to Tali. Likewise, the suggestive mapping device may have knowledge about Risa's lunch-time food preferences based on a consideration of the stops that Risa has made for approximately 1-2 hour periods of time around the noon hour during the week, via a reverse look up and mapping of the stops to a database of shops and the details of what they sell. A database of menus at restaurants associated with Risa's stops, along with ratings of the quality of food, d\u00e9cor, and service might be stored by a mobile device and\/or cloud service, and used to generate recommendations about places to eat lunch near a destination or along the way to a destination. Such information and possibility for making suggestions based on routes might be added to an advertising service, with bidding for alerts and electronic coupons as incentives.","Additionally, in another aspect, the suggestive mapping device may predict multiple suggested locations. Further, the device may compute an ordering of the multiple suggested locations based, in some examples, on an estimation of the probability of the desirability or helpfulness of the suggested locations. The ordered list may then be provided in a rank-ordered list, or revealed in a sequence by likelihood when a user asserts interest in seeing the next location. In two non-limiting examples, the suggested locations may be utilized as alternative destinations or as waypoints to a current destination or can be made during the time that directions are being explicitly searched for, either on mobile devices or on a desktop system. Additionally, suggested locations can be within some distance or time to other destinations, e.g., named destinations or predicted destinations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","102","102","102","106","108"]},"Network interface  may be any type of device or transmission tower that may provide network access to network accessible devices, such as the suggestive mapping device . Additionally, other network accessible devices, such as other mobile devices () through (N), where N is an integer greater than zero, and remote server  may interact with the suggestive mapping device  via the network . In at least one instance, other remote devices (collectively ) may be devices operated by the user . For example, suggestive mapping device  may be the user's GPS device, while other mobile devices () and () may be a laptop computer and a cellular telephone of the user , respectively. In this way, the devices  and\/or  of the user  may share location, calendar, and other historical and\/or contextual data about the user  amongst each other.","Additionally, by way of example only, the suggestive mapping device  may store such location, calendar, historical and\/or contextual data in user data store . In one example, the user data store  may reside within the suggestive mapping device . However, in other examples, the user data store  may reside within one or more of the other mobile devices  or even the remote server  (e.g., implemented as an in-cloud service). Alternatively, or in addition, separate user data stores, such as user store  may reside individually in each device. In other words, user data store  may reside within the suggestive mapping device , while user data store  resides within one of the other mobile devices  of the user , such as mobile device (). In this example, a different user data store may reside within the remote server .","In one non-limiting example, user  may regularly be at home after 6:30 pm on weeknights. In this example, this location data may be stored in the user data store  of the user's handheld GPS device , in the user data store  of the user's cellular phone (), in the remote server , or in any combination of these locations. Further, if the user  is out to dinner late one evening (i.e., after 6:30 pm), the user's suggestive mapping device  or cellular phone () may provide a suggestive map, such as predictive map , with directions to the user's home. In this way, the user  need not provide input to the suggestive mapping device . Alternatively, based on the earlier example, user data store , user data store , and\/or remote server  may store location data about Risa's Saturday morning habits. This data may then be used to aid in preparing a predictive map  for Risa. As used herein, the phrases \u201cpredictive map\u201d and \u201csuggestive map\u201d are synonymous.","In some instances, a contact  of the user  may operate contact's device , which may access the network , or some other network, via network interface  as well. For example, user's contact  may be able to call, text, IM, email, or otherwise contact the user  over the network , or some other network, via network interface . Additionally, with the consent of contact , the suggestive mapping device  of user  may access the location data of contact  identified by contact's device . Thus, the predictive map  provided to user  may, in some instances, be based at least in part on the location of contact . User data stores  and\/or , and remote server , may also store user application data, such as information gathered from a user's calendar, email, text-messaging, IM, voicemail, or other application that may contain contextual and\/or historical location data.","In one example, where the suggestive mapping device  and\/or the contact's device  shares user and\/or application data, the suggestive mapping architecture  may provide opt-in and\/or opt-out functionality. Additionally, in one instance, prior to any user information being collected and\/or shared amongst the devices, the user whose information is to be collected will be notified and given the ability to opt-out prior to any data collection. Further, in one aspect, enhanced security measures will be employed in order to protect the user and\/or application data.","In one aspect, the suggestive mapping device  may also provide suggestions for particular tasks based on the user information stored in user data stores  and\/or , or remote server . For example, the suggestive mapping device , while providing a map to a user's school, may also remind the user to drop off his or her dry-cleaning on the way. Additionally, the suggestive mapping device  may also re-route the user  to the dry-cleaners on the way to or from school. In one example, if the user  is running late to school, and the suggestive mapping device  has stored in user data  the historical times that the user  attends school, the suggestive mapping device  may suggest dropping off the dry-cleaning and provide the re-routed map after the user  attends classes. Alternatively, in one example, the suggestive mapping device  may be able to determine the route time to the dry-cleaners, the total additional time required to get to the dry-cleaners on the way to school, and\/or how much time remains between the current time and the historical start time of school, and provide a predictive map  that directs the user  to the dry-cleaners on the way to school such that the user  will still make it to class on time.","Additionally, in one aspect, the suggestive mapping device  may provide a predictive map , with a suggested destination or task, \u201cx\u201d minutes before the predicted arrival to that destination. Additionally, \u201cx\u201d may be some time \u201cy\u201d plus the total route time to get to the destination. Further, the user  may be able to set \u201cy\u201d on the fly or prior to receiving the predictive map . As such, using the dry-cleaning example, the user  may set a \u201cy\u201d of 15 minutes, meaning that it takes approximately 15 minutes to park, take the clothes in, pay, and get out of the parking lot at the dry-cleaners. In this way, if \u201cy\u201d equals 15 minutes and the user  has 30 minutes until school starts, the suggestive mapping device  may only re-route and\/or suggest a map to the dry-cleaners when the route to the dry-cleaners and then to school is estimated to be under 15 minutes. Alternatively, or in addition, \u201cy\u201d could be pre-set or could be suggested by the dry-cleaner and stored in the remote server  for all dry-cleaner customers.","In some instances, the suggestive mapping device  may be configured to predict a different route based at least in part on an intentional change of direction of a user  and\/or other inputs to the device , one of the other mobile devices , and\/or the remote server . For example, using Risa's Saturday morning example from above, if while driving to the park, Risa receives a telephone call, or other network communication, from her father, Jesse, and subsequently changes directions, the suggestive mapping device may provide a re-routed predictive map  based on Jesse's current location. In this example, the suggestive mapping device  may suggest that Risa's new destination is Jesse's current location, as provided by Jesse's mobile device or the remote server .","In one example, if this new predictive map  to Jesse's location is correct, Risa may do nothing (i.e., no user input to the device is needed); however, if the predictive map  is incorrect (e.g., she is not actually changing her direction to meet Jesse), Risa may request a new predictive map  (or the next predicted map). In some instances, Risa may request the new map by shaking, pushing a button of, selecting a GUI icon of, or speaking into the suggestive mapping device . However, other methods of requesting a new map are envisioned as well, including gesturing or otherwise motioning on or near a touch-screen of the suggestive mapping device .","Alternatively, rather than automatically providing the new predictive map  to Jesse's location, the suggestive mapping device  may provide several suggestions for a new destination and allow Risa to select the correct one. As noted above, selection of the correct map, or of a next predicted map in a list of potential predictive maps, may be implemented in many different ways. Additionally, the suggestive mapping device may also provide a list of possible destinations, each being predicted and potentially carrying a respective probability of correctness, when the device is first turned on, or at any time during operation, rather than only when a user changes direction. Further, in one aspect, shaking the device  while the device  is unlocked may trigger the device  to advance the displayed predictive map to a next predictive map  in a ranked list of predictive maps . Alternatively, if the device  is locked, shaking the device may trigger the display of the already displayed predictive map .","Further, in yet another non-limiting example, the suggestive mapping device  may render newly predicted destinations as a trip progresses. In this way, a user  may defer selecting from among predicted destinations until after a part of the trip is complete. For instance, the user  may drive in the general direction of his or her intended direction, with or without knowledge of the exact route. In this example, the suggestive mapping device  may be able to eliminate potential destinations and predict a more accurate (or more probable) destination by eliminating some destinations that may have otherwise been predicted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112","122","112","122","122","122"]},"Illustrative Architectures",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","102","200","202","200","204","202","202","204","202","200"]},"In one aspect, the suggestive mapping system  may include a destination prediction module , a map generation module , and a map output module . Destination prediction module  may, in some examples, receive information regarding a travel vector and\/or other location related information about user  or contacts of the user , and may predict a destination for user  based on this received information. For example, the destination prediction module  may receive social network data  from a social networking Web site, from a remote suggestive mapping server (e.g., from a cloud service), or directly from contacts of the user . As such, the system  may leverage an explicit and\/or ad hoc social network to determine locations of the user's  contacts, or any other information that may be pertinent in predicting where the user may travel to at a particular time. Social network data  may include, but is not limited to, location data of friends or contacts of user  and\/or appointments, events, or schedules organized or stored on a social networking Web site or other server. Additionally, in one aspect, social network data  may be stored in a shared database that may be accessed by the user  or other contacts and\/or friends of the user .","Additionally, the destination prediction module  may also receive real-time input data . Real-time input data  may include a travel vector of the user , the current time, and\/or the current location of the user . Additionally, in some instances, real-time input data  may include communications with friends or contacts of user , such as telephone calls (including voicemails), text messages, IMs, and the like. As such, the destination prediction module  may make predictions, or update predictions, about the intended destination of user  based on real-time communications that may influence the route of user .","Further, the prediction destination module  may receive appointment data  and\/or historical location data  about user . As noted above, this information may be stored in memory such as user data store  of device  or it may be stored in a remote server. Either way, appointment data  may include location and\/or time information from a calendar application of user  or contacts of user . As such, if user  has an appointment scheduled in a calendar application or other user application that organizes appointments, the destination prediction module  may predict the intended destination of the user  based on this information. In some instances, however, the communications received from and\/or sent to a user's contacts (e.g., voicemails, text messages, etc.) and\/or the calendar appointment data  may not include an actual address to which a route may be predicted. For example, the communication and\/or appointment may simply list a place with a common name or other identifier (e.g., \u201cPiano lesson at 2 p.m.\u201d). In this case, the prediction destination module , alone or in conjunction with another module of the suggestive mapping system , may automatically associate a location with the common name or other identifier by observing where the user normally goes at this time and\/or by searching the Internet or other data of the user. As such, the suggestive mapping system  may use machine learning algorithms or other methods of training to learn locations of a user and provide a suggested map and\/or route with or without an explicit address entered by a user or found in a communication or appointment.","Additionally, historical location data  may include previous locations that user  has visited and the associated dates and times of the visits. In one instance, a user's habits may directly affect the destination prediction module . For example, if user  is usually at work from 9 am to 5 pm, at the same location, and user  is traveling from his or her house at 8:30 am, the destination prediction module  may predict that user  is traveling to work. In one aspect, the destination prediction module  may make several predictions and rank each prediction based on probabilities. Additionally, these probabilities may be weighted by user-defined priorities or by a machine-learning algorithm that learns over time. Further, historical location data  may include a user's  recent queries or a history of queries to a search engine, both independent of location and\/or by location as determined by GPS. Additionally, the historical location data  may be used to aid in the prediction of destinations and\/or the labeling of the predictions.","In some aspects, historical location data  may be created by monitoring a user's  context based on traversing through locations and\/or stopping and dwelling at locations, e.g., as an indication that a user is interacting with a service or people at a location. This data  may, in some instances, be leveraged in the generation of predicted locations during a current session or at future sessions. In some examples, stopping or dwelling can be observed through location signals (e.g., GPS, Wifi, etc.) or the periods of time that such signals are absent, e.g., based on the loss of signals associated with a device being turned off or being blocked from the signals associated with a structure being entered (e.g., a parking garage).","Additionally, in one aspect, the destination prediction module  may create predicted destination\/time pairs . Predicted destination\/time pairs  may include respective predicted destinations for each time of day. That is, the destination prediction module  may automatically predict destinations for each point in time of each respective day based on the historical location data of user . For example, based on historical location data, the destination prediction module  may predict that user  will be at home from 7 pm until Sam every weekday. In such an instance, the destination prediction module  may predict that user  will be at home during each period of time between 7 pm and Sam the next day (during weekdays). That is, the following predicted destination\/time pairs  may exist: home\/7 pm, home\/8 pm, home\/9 pm, and so on. Further, the destination prediction module  may supplement or otherwise alter the time pairs  based on social network data , real-time input data , appointment data , and\/or other historical location data . By way of example only, with the time pairs  described above, if user  were traveling towards his or her home at 10 pm on a weekday, at least one predicted destination (and possibly the predicted destination with the highest probability of being correct) will be the home of user . Alternatively, regardless of the direction of travel of user , at 10 pm, the destination prediction module  may predict that user  is traveling home.","Additionally, in some aspects, the destination prediction module  may utilize real-time location information from friends or contacts of user  to predict destinations. Alternatively, or in addition, the destination prediction module  may be configured to operate in multiple different modes. For example, in one non-limiting mode, the destination prediction module  may be configured to predict a single destination prediction. In another non-limiting mode, however, the destination prediction module  may be configured to predict a list of destinations and then apply a ranking algorithm to order the list for consumption.","As noted above, the suggestive mapping system  may also include a map generation module . Map generation module  may receive the predicted destination\/time pairs  from the destination prediction module . Additionally, map generation module  may also receive information  regarding traffic, time of day, weather, etc. from any source that may provide such information. In one aspect, information  may be included in real-time input data ; however, in other aspects, it may be received separately as other real-time input data , such as from a traffic service, weather service, and\/or GPS service provider. In one aspect, the map generation module  may produce maps for each predicted destination\/time pair  created by the destination prediction module . In other aspects, however, the map generation module  may only prepare a map for the prediction with the highest probability, or a predetermined number of highest probabilities.","The suggestive mapping system  may also include a map output module . In one implementation, the map output module  may receive predictive maps  prepared by the map generation module . As noted above, in one aspect, the suggestive mapping system  may reside within device . In this example, the map output module  may prepare and render the predictive map . Alternatively, the map output module  may prepare and render multiple predictive maps . Either way, in this example, the rendering of the predictive map(s)  by the map output module  may include displaying the predictive map(s)  on a display device of device . Alternatively, in other aspects, the suggestive mapping system  may be implemented as an in-cloud service residing on a remote server. In this alternative aspect, the map output module  may transmit the predictive map(s)  to device  over a wired or wireless network.","Additionally, the suggestive mapping system  may also include an advertisement module. The advertising module may be configured to allow bidding for users based on their interests, history, and context. In some examples, the advertisements may be linked to the suggested locations that drive them. In some aspects, when there are two (or more) potentially valuable suggested locations, per user interests, trajectory, location, etc., the advertisement module may take bids or payments about which location to display, or the specifics of the sequence to display the suggestions to the user. Current traffic can be considered in the suggested locations, as well as in the bidding model above.","Further, in some aspects the suggestive mapping system  may suggest maps or directions based on information about sensed or shared information regarding the destinations of friends or contacts (e.g., as revealed via information in a social graph, buddy list, email header, texting activity, or phone activity) over time. For example, information that a close friend or colleague of Risa (e.g., as revealed by an analysis of the interaction of the friend with Risa by email\u2014with frequency of x and recency of y), has frequented a restaurant that Risa may be passing, but (via detection of location trails) has never experienced, may be used in the formulation and ranking of a suggested map, location, and\/or directions to a location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["210","210","210","300","302","304","300","302","304","300","302","304"]},"More specifically, map  may display the next travel instruction. In this example, the next travel instruction is to exit the highway to the right, or simply turn right at the next road. This map may be most appropriate when driving a vehicle at a relatively slow speed. That is, the next travel instruction may be the only instruction that the driver is interested in due to the relatively long amount of time that may pass before needing the next instruction. On the other hand, map  may display the next few travel instructions. Here, the next few instructions are to (1) turn slight left , then (2) go straight , and then (3) make a hard right . Much like map , this map may be most appropriate at specific relative speeds. For example, map  may be more appropriate when driving or walking at a relatively faster speed than that described above for map . That is, the next few travel instructions may be more appropriate due to the relatively shorter amount of time between instructions. Finally, map  may be more appropriate at relatively fast speeds or when not moving. That is, when driving at highway speeds, seeing the entire map, or at least most of the instructions, may be more appropriate. Alternatively, or in addition, when not moving at all, a user may wish to see the entire route as well.","In one aspect, a travel vector  may include a user's velocity, current location, and current direction of travel. As such, the map output module  may determine which map , , or  to prepare, transmit, or display to a user based at least in part on the calculated travel vector of the user.

As discussed above, historical location data may include location\/time pairs for places where a user has been, and the respective dates and times for when the user was there. At block , the process  may determine a travel vector. In one example, a travel vector may include a velocity, a current location, and a direction of travel for a particular user. Determining the travel vector may include receiving real-time inputs from a user device (with the user's consent) or determining the real-time data at the user device, such as a handheld GPS device. In one example, the destination prediction module  described as part of device  of  may receive and\/or store the historical location data and\/or the real-time inputs.","At block , the process  may predict a destination of the user based at least in part on the historical location data and\/or the travel vector. In one example, the prediction may be carried out by the destination prediction module  of FIG. Additionally, in one example, the travel vector may aid in the prediction, or at least aid in ranking the predictions. For example, if the process  predicts three destinations at block ; however, the user is traveling in a direction that would take the user to the second of the three predicted destinations, the process  may rank the second destination highest. Alternatively, if the user does not have time to reach one of the three predicted destinations, that destination may be ranked the lowest.","At block , the process  may prepare an entire route to each predicted destination, one or more travel instructions to each predicted destination, and\/or multiple predicted destinations that may be ranked for consumption. Alternatively, the process  may prepare an entire route and\/or one or more travel instructions to the highest ranked predicted destination at block . In one example, the map generation module  described as part of device  of  may prepare the map(s). Further, at block , the process  may display or serve the appropriate prepared map based at least in part on the travel vector. That is, as discussed above, a map may be appropriate based on the velocity of the user. Thus, the travel vector may be used to determine which map to display. Additionally, in some instances, the appropriate map may be served to a user device from a remote server.","At decision block , the process  may determine whether an indication of a request for a different map has been received. In some instances, a user may shake the device, such as, for example, suggestive mapping device  of , to indicate a request for a different map. In other instances, however, a user may select a GUI item, press a physical button, or use a voice command to indicate a request for a different map. When an indication of a request for a different map is received (e.g., the user shakes the device), process  may display or server a different, yet appropriately scaled, map to the user device at block . In this way, process  may either display the next highest ranked map on the user device or serve it to the user device (e.g., in the cloud computing example). Alternatively, when an indication of a request for a different map is not received, process  may maintain the display of the appropriately scaled, map to the user device at block . In this way, process  may have predicted the actual destination of the user and a different map may not be helpful or requested.","Illustrative Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-4"],"b":["500","500"]},"In one illustrative configuration, the computing environment  comprises at least a memory  and one or more processing units (or processor(s)) .

Depending on the configuration and type of computing device, memory  may be volatile (such as random access memory (RAM)) and\/or non-volatile (such as read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, etc.). The computing device or server may also include additional removable storage  and\/or non-removable storage  including, but not limited to, magnetic storage, optical disks, and\/or tape storage. The disk drives and their associated computer-readable media may provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the computing devices.

In one example, static contextual data (e.g., calendar appointments) may trump other contextual data (and maybe even historical data) in ranking the predictive maps. As such, a predictive map to a location of a meeting found in a calendar appointment may be ranked the highest of a set of predictive maps. Alternatively, in other examples, contextual data that is most recent may trump other contextual data such that the most recent telephone call, text message, IM, etc. may provide the location data that directs the destination prediction module  to predict and rank a destination.","Finally, the memory  may also include a map display module  for preparing, displaying, and\/or serving the predictive maps generated by the destination prediction module .
