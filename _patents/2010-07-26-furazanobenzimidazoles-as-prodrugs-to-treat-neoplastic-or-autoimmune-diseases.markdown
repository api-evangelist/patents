{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a National Stage Application of PCT\/EP2010\/060803 filed Jul. 26, 2010, which claims priority from European Patent Application 09166469.8 filed on Jul. 27, 2009. The priority of both said PCT and European Patent Application is claimed.","The invention relates to prodrugs of substituted furazanobenzimidazoles, processes for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, the use thereof optionally in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds for the therapy of neoplastic diseases and autoimmune diseases.","Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in humans. Although a variety of drugs against neoplastic diseases have been developed and techniques are available such as surgery and radiation therapy, there is still a need for alternative and improved methods of treatment of neoplastic diseases.","Autoimmune diseases are associated with abnormal lymphoproliferation as a result of defects in the termination of lymphocyte activation and growth. Often, such diseases are associated with inflammation like rheumatoid arthritis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and the like. The treatment of such diseases is focused on anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs which in numerous cases show severe side effects. Hence, there is a need for alternative drugs with a new mode of action showing less side effects.","Apoptosis is a term used to describe a series of cellular events which occur to bring about programmed cell death. There are various apoptotic pathways, some of which have been characterized, whereas others remain to be elucidated. If the balance between cell division and apoptosis is disturbed, life-threatening diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases may occur.","In recent years it has become evident that programmed cell death (apoptosis) is as important to the health of a multicellular organism as cell division. By repeated cell division and differentiation throughout development or tissue repair, surplus or even harmful cells are generated. In order to maintain tissue homeostasis these cells have to be removed or killed. The delicate interplay between cell growth and apoptosis in an organism is mirrored in the complex molecular balance that determines whether an individual cell undergoes division, arrests in the cell cycle or commits to programmed cell death.","Dysregulation of cell proliferation, or lack of appropriate cell death, has wide ranging clinical implications. A number of diseases associated with such dysregulation involve hyperproliferation, inflammation, tissue remodeling and repair. Familiar indications in this category include cancers, restenosis, neointimal hyperplasia, angiogenesis, endometriosis, lymphoproliferative disorders, transplantation related pathologies (graft rejection), polyposis, loss of neural function in the case of tissue remodeling and the like. Such cells may lose the normal regulatory control of cell division, and may also fail to undergo appropriate cell death.","As apoptosis is inhibited or delayed in most types of proliferative, neoplastic diseases, induction of apoptosis is an option for treatment of cancer, especially in cancer types which show resistance to classic chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy (Apoptosis and Cancer Chemotherapy, Hickman and Dive, eds., Blackwell Publishing, 1999). Also in autoimmune and transplantation related diseases and pathologies compounds inducing apoptosis may be used to restore normal cell death processes and therefore can eradicate the symptoms and might cure the diseases. Further applications of compounds inducing apoptosis may be in restenosis, i.e. accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of arteries, and in persistent infections caused by a failure to eradicate bacteria- and virus-infected cells. Furthermore, apoptosis can be induced or re-established in epithelial cells, in endothelial cells, in muscle cells, and in others which have lost contact with extracellular matrix. These cells are potentially able to colonize other organs and therefore can develop into pathologies like neoplasias, endometriosis and the like.","WO2004\/103994 discloses furazanobenzimidazole compounds of formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"38.35mm","wi":"59.35mm","file":"US08802858-20140812-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","6 "]},"The reference furthermore discloses that these compounds can be administered in the form of prodrugs which are broken down in the human or animal body to give the corresponding compound of formula (I) and mentions that among other types of prodrugs amides of naturally occurring amino acids, e.g. amides formed from the acid function of the amino acid and suitable amino groups of the compound of formula (I), are suitable as prodrugs.","The aqueous solubility of furazanobenzimidazoles like those exemplified in WO2004\/103994 is generally low. This is a problem for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, especially compositions for parenteral administration. The reference suggests only very general to use an aqueous solution of a water-soluble salt of the compounds of formula (I) for parenteral administration.","It has now been found that selected amides derived from furazanobenzimidazoles of the afore-mentioned formula (I), wherein R represents an aryl or heteroaryl group substituted by at least one amino group, and a natural amino acid selected from glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala) and lysine (Lys) display significantly improved aqueous solubility and are cleaved in vivo to the parent aromatic or heteroaromatic amine, thereby acting as prodrugs. The increased aqueous solubility simplifies the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions and reduces the need for solubility enhancing excipients compared to the parent drug. This is of special advantage since these excipients can cause unwanted toxic effects (Excipient Toxicity and Safety; Weiner, Myra L.; Kotkoskie, Lois A.; Editors. (2000), Publisher: Dekker, New York, USA. Pharmacological effects of formulation vehicles: implications for cancer chemotherapy; ten Tije; Albert J.; Verweij, Jaap; Loos, Walter J.; Sparreboom, Alex; Clinical Pharmacokinetics (2003), 42(7), 665-685).","Specifically for the lysine (Lys) derived prodrug, a very strongly increased solubility is observed over an especially broad pH range and even at only slightly acidic conditions. These specific solubility properties of the lysine derivative also at higher pH values provide a particularly excellent flexibility in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. It was furthermore found in pharmacokinetic studies in mice, that the amide prodrugs derived from glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala) and lysine (Lys) provide significantly higher exposure of the animals to the parent drug (expressed as AUC (area under the curve) value) than those derived from other natural amino acids. For example, AUC values are more than 50 percent higher than the AUC values found after administration of amide prodrugs derived from other very similar natural amino acids like asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln) or arginine (Arg).","Additionally, it was found that the specific Lys derived prodrug of Example 1 of this application is better tolerated, provides longer exposure of tumors to the drug and has a higher efficacy in animal tumor models at the maximum tolerated dose than the corresponding parent drug. These surprising effects suggest also a higher efficacy of this prodrug in the therapy of neoplastic diseases and autoimmune diseases.","In a full blood in vitro assay, an amino acid amide derived from the amino group at the furazane ring is converted less efficiently into the parent drug than the corresponding derivative with the amino acid amide being a substituent of the residue R in the afore-mentioned formula (I). This shows that not all amides derived from an amino group of the compound of formula (I) and a natural amino acid are equally well suited as prodrugs.","Various other types of amine prodrugs are described in the literature (e.g. A. L. Simplicio, J. M. Clancy, J. F. Gilmer, Molecules 2008, 13, 519-546; Prodrugs: Challenges and Rewards, [in: Biotechnol.: Phalli'. Aspects, 2007; 5(Pt. 2)] V. J. Stella, R. T. Borchardt, M. J. Hageman, R. Oliyai, H. Maag, J. W. Tilley, Editors, USA. 2007, pages 102-131, Publisher: (Springer, New York, N.Y.); J. Rautio, H. Kumpulainen, T. Heimbach, R. Oliyai, D. Oh, T. Jarvinen, J. Savolainen, Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 2008, 7, 255-270). However, not every potential prodrug is sufficiently converted into the parent drug in every case, which is exemplified with an amidine and a sulfamate derivative of the furazanobenzimidazoles, which do not give quantifiable plasma levels of the parent drug after administration in animal studies. This underscores further the challenge to identify for a given drug suitable prodrugs combining all required properties.","The present invention accordingly relates to compounds of formula (II)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"46.48mm","wi":"56.64mm","file":"US08802858-20140812-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"13.97mm","wi":"13.55mm","file":"US08802858-20140812-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"41.74mm","wi":"56.05mm","file":"US08802858-20140812-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The furazanobenzimidazoles of formula (II) are prodrugs with improved aqueous solubility and are cleaved in vivo to provide the corresponding parent drug of formula (I-II):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0023"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"111.51mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08802858-20140812-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"1 "},"The furazanobenzimidazoles of formula (II) have accordingly the same medicinal uses of the corresponding parent drugs which are described in detail in WO2004\/103994.

Prior to the efficacy experiment, a determination of the MTD of each compound administered once weekly is performed in non-tumor-bearing nude mice of the same strain. Administration of 24.5 mg\/kg prodrug and 10 mg\/kg parent drug, given as an i.v. bolus once weekly, results in body weight losses >10% in a few animals in both groups. The MTDs in tumor-bearing mice are, therefore, determined to be 15-20% lower, resulting in doses of 21 mg\/kg prodrug and 8 mg\/kg parent drug. Human colorectal carcinoma cells (SW480) are injected subcutaneously (4\u00d710cells) into the back of 4-8-week old athymic nude mice. Tumor volumes are determined from calliper measurements of tumor length (L) and width (1) according to the formula (L\u00d7l)\/2. Tumors are allowed to expand to a volume of 200 mm(\u00b110%) before treatment start. The prodrug and parent drug are administered i.v. for 24 days, either once per week at 21 mg\/kg and 8 mg\/kg, respectively, or three times a week (d1\/4\/7) at 7.1 mg\/kg and 2.7 mg\/kg, respectively (both schedules represent the same total weekly dose). Tumor volume and body weight are monitored daily.","Using the once weekly schedule (cf. ), the prodrug elicits a final T\/C (ratio of tumor volume in the treatment group vs. the control group) at day 24 of 34% (p<0.001 vs controls) in comparison to 45% for the parent drug (p<0.001 vs controls). Using the three times per week schedule (cf. ), the prodrug elicits a final T\/C (day 24) of 26% (p<0.001 vs control) in comparison to 54% for the parent drug (p=0.002 vs control). The body weight changes observed were minor in all treatment groups. However, one animal in the parent drug-group (three times per week treatment) died at day 10.","The three times per week administration of prodrug provides a significant better efficacy in the mouse xenograft cancer model than a corresponding administration of the parent drug (p<0.05).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0247","num":"0246"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0247"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Comparison of the Prodrug-Drug Conversion of the Prodrug According to Example 12 (Present Invention) and the Prodrug According to Example 13 (Comparison) in Full Blood","Procedure:","495 \u03bcL fresh heparinised rat blood are spiked with 5 \u03bcL of a 1 mg\/mL DMSO solution of the analyte (prodrug) at 37\u00b0 C.
