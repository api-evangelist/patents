For example, the processing module  may identify the vehicle information  in the garage information  in the user profile information  based on the vehicle identification information  in the maintenance message . In addition, the processing module  may identify the appropriate part description information  in the identified vehicle information  based on the part identifier  or part type identifier  in the maintenance message . Finally, the processing module  may copy the characterization information  and the timestamp  from the maintenance message  to next available location in the part log information  in the identified part description information . In one embodiment, the processing module  may create the vehicle information  in the garage information  responsive to receipt of the maintenance message .","At decision operation , the processing module  may identify whether a part  has not previously been registered in the garage information . For example, a part  that is not registered in the garage information  may include replacing a part  that is old with a part  that is new for a particular part type identifier . If the part identifier  in the maintenance message  is not found in the garage information  then processing continues at operation . Otherwise, processing continues at operation .","At operation , the processing module performs multiple steps to register the part . First, the processing module  may identify an existing part  in the garage information  with a part type identifier  that matches the part type identifier  in the maintenance message . If found, the processing module  may utilize the existing entry by overwriting the part identifier  that is old with the part identifier  that is new. Otherwise, the processing module  may create a new entry of part description information  in the vehicle information . Second, the processing module  may update the maintenance history information  for the part type identifier  by recording an entry chronicling the replacement of the part  that is old with the part  that is new. For example, the brand names of the two parts , the part identifiers , the part type identifier , the current date, odometer reading, vehicle identification information , and part log information  for the part  that is old may be stored in the maintenance history information . Third, the part identifier  for the part  that is being registered may be compared with the part identifiers  in the OEM tracking information. If a match is found, then the part  is validated as an authentic OEM part. Otherwise the part is not validated as an authentic OEM part. In either instance, at operation , the processing module  may store the appropriate status in the OEM authentic information  in the part description information  for the part  and communicate the status to the associated client machine  or mobile device . Fourth, the processing module  may communicate a recall\/bulletin triggering event to the smart component engine  to identify whether recall\/bulletin notices are available for the part  and, responsive to such an identification communicate an alert to the mobile device  or client machine  that includes a notice of the recall\/bulleting for the part .","At operation , the processing module  may compute a derivative of part log information  over time. The processing module  may compute multiple derivatives of the part log information  including a first-derivative to generate first-derivative information (e.g., a simple change over time (e.g., the average wear rate)), a second derivative to generate second derivative information (e.g., an acceleration over time (e.g., the rate at which the rate is changing\u2014acceleration may indicate partial failure, failure in related parts, conditions exceeding some \u2018elastic\u2019 threshold, etc.)), and\/or a third derivative to generate third derivative information (e.g., a \u2018jerk\u2019\u2014the rate at which the acceleration is changing\u2014a sudden \u2018jerk\u2019 possibly indicating a catastrophic failure or other transient but significant change not following the \u2018usual\u2019 degradation). For example, processing module  may generate first-derivative information for an aggregate often entries of characterization information . The quantity of time may be computed by subtracting a timestamp  associated with the first entry (e.g., earliest) in the aggregate from the timestamp  associated with the last entry (e.g., latest) in the aggregate. Further, the quantity of wear may be computed by subtracting the characterization information  associated with the first entry (e.g., earliest) in the aggregate from the characterization information  associated with the last entry in the aggregate. Further, where the first-derivative is computed by dividing the quantity of wear by the quantity of time and, optionally, by smoothing the resulting derivative.","At decision operation , the processing module  may compare the first derivative information and\/or the second derivative information and\/or the third derivative information with respective threshold information  in the part maintenance information  associated with the part type identifier  to identify whether a threshold has been exceeded. If a threshold is exceeded then processing continues at operation . Otherwise, processing continues at operation . In one embodiment, the threshold may be calculated dynamically at the time operation  is executed by the processing module . At operation , the processing module , may register the one or more thresholds that have been exceeded.","At operation , the processing module  may interrogate the part log information  to identify anomalous part log information . The processing module  may identify anomalous part log information  in many different ways. For some part types (e.g., part type identifier(s) ), the processing module  may expect the part log information  to represent a discrete approximation or sampling of a continuous set whose ideal trend is expected to progress in one direction, after accounting for measurement noise due to sensor  and extreme environmental conditions. For example, brake wear is ideally expected to trend smoothly from 0% to 100% wear. In this instance it is reasonable to apply averaging or outlier elimination to obtain a more accurate approximation of actual wear level. Consequently, a single anomalous reading may not be considered actionable. In contrast, other parts  may supply measurements that result in part log information  that is largely uncorrelated to other measurements except in very close temporal proximity. For example, the part log information  for boost pressure is expected to vary rapidly with no intrinsic trend. While for some measurement error is still expected, a single reading that falls out of expected range by more than some value can indicate a gasket failure, blowoff malfunction, etc. The processing module  may evaluate these measurements individually for such characteristics. According to another embodiment the processing module  may evaluate the part log information  for boost pressure relative to a continuous function derived from other contemporaneous readings such as throttle, engine speed, gear ratio, etc. Yet according to another embodiment, the processing module  may identify sequences or combinations of individually-valid values that are recognized as aberrant when evaluated together (e.g., correlation of simultaneous or sequential signals vs. covariance models). For an example of a sequence of values that might be recognized as aberrant, consider a leaf spring capable of reporting the apparent load on the spring as determined by the degree of deformation. Values may range freely between some well-known extremes, but are expected to maintain a constant average given a constant load. While the vehicle  is in motion, deflections in the spring should return (via damped motion) to a reasonable and stable center-point. If an extreme (but normal) inflection returns to a stable center significantly different than the center prior to the inflection, it may be an indication that a crack in the leaf spring has reduced the ability of the spring to hold a load. For an example of a sequence of values that might be recognized as aberrant, when correlated to other values, consider deflection\/compression measurements as reported by brake calipers. If a hydraulic line is faulty, one caliper may experience considerably less deflection than the opposed caliper, even though both deflection measurements are individually within tolerance. Similarly, various signals could be correlated with those from related smart components , with engine speed, etc. . . . . In one embodiment, the processing module  may identify the lack or unexpected rate of appearance of an expected signal. For example, if a previously-recorded sensor  fails to report a signal altogether, the processing module  may determine the part  has failed catastrophically, but may more plausibly be a signal that the sensor  itself has failed, or the part  was replaced.","At decision operation , the processing module  may compare the anomalies in the part log information  with threshold information  in the part maintenance information , as described above, to identify whether any thresholds have been exceeded. If a threshold is exceeded, then processing continues at operation . Otherwise, processing continues at operation . In another embodiment, the processing module  may branch to operation  based on an identification of one or more anomalies without making a comparison with the threshold information . At operation , the processing module , may register threshold(s) that have been exceeded. In another embodiment, the processing module  may register one or more anomalies that were identified notwithstanding the threshold information .","At operation , the processing module , may register the service level (e.g., \u201cOK,\u201d \u201cSUGGEST,\u201d \u201cWARN,\u201d \u201cREPLACE\u201d) for the part  in the service level information . For example, the processing module  may generate the service level based on identifying the one or more thresholds that were registered as exceeded in operations  and . In one embodiment, the processing module  may identify the service level based on one or more thresholds that have been exceeded as registered in operation  and\/or based on the identification anomalous part log information .","At operation , the processing module  may send a triggering event to the smart component engine .

Processing that is reactive may include modifying dynamically selected content based on a virtual part. For example, the virtual parts for a particular user may be input to a mechanism that dynamically selects and ranks content. For example, a search mechanism executing a search on behalf of a user is configured to receive virtual parts as input to select and rank listings that are returned in a search result to the user. Further, for example, an automatically invoked merchandising mechanism (e.g., shopping cart being displayed) is configured to receive virtual parts as input to select and rank listings that are merchandised in association with the shopping cart to the user. In both instances a user's implicit interest in a part  is accommodated by utilizing the corresponding virtual part. Processing token parts may be proactive or reactive.

Processing of token parts that is reactive may include evaluating whether token parts are compatible with a vehicle  that is added to a garage that is associated with a user. For example, a vehicle  may be added to vehicle garage information  (not shown) that is associated with a user and responsive to the addition of the vehicle  an analysis is performed to identify whether any of the token parts are compatible with the vehicle (e.g., for repair).

The tables  may include the OEM tracking information , the maintenance information , and the smart component processing information , as previously described.","Machine",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0302"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":["1300","1324","1322","1300","1324","1300","1300","1300","1300","1324","1324"]},"The machine  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a radio-frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), or any suitable combination thereof), a main memory , and a static memory , which are configured to communicate with each other via a bus . The processor  may contain microcircuits that are configurable, temporarily or permanently, by some or all of the instructions  such that the processor  is configurable to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein, in whole or in part. For example, a set of one or more microcircuits of the processor  may be configurable to execute one or more modules (e.g., software modules) described herein.","The machine  may further include a graphics display  (e.g., a plasma display panel (PDP), a light emitting diode (LED) display, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a projector, a cathode ray tube (CRT), or any other display capable of displaying graphics or video). The machine  may also include an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard or keypad), a cursor control device  (e.g., a mouse, a touchpad, a trackball, a joystick, a motion sensor, an eye tracking device, or other pointing instrument), a storage unit , an audio generation device  (e.g., a sound card, an amplifier, a speaker, a headphone jack, or any suitable combination thereof), and a network interface device .","The storage unit  includes the machine-readable medium  (e.g., a tangible and non-transitory machine-readable storage medium) on which are stored the instructions  embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions  may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory , within the processor  (e.g., within the processor's cache memory), or both, before or during execution thereof by the machine . Accordingly, the main memory  and the processor  may be considered machine-readable media (e.g., tangible and non-transitory machine-readable media). The instructions  may be transmitted or received over the network  via the network interface device . For example, the network interface device  may communicate the instructions  using any one or more transfer protocols (e.g., hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)).","In some example embodiments, the machine  may be a portable computing device, such as a smart phone, tablet computer, or wearable device (e.g., Google Glass), and have one or more additional input components  (e.g., sensors or gauges). Examples of such input components  include an image input component (e.g., one or more cameras), an audio input component (e.g., a microphone), a direction input component (e.g., a compass), a location input component (e.g., a global positioning system (GPS) receiver), an orientation component (e.g., a gyroscope), a motion detection component (e.g., one or more accelerometers), an altitude detection component (e.g., an altimeter), and a gas detection component (e.g., a gas sensor). Inputs harvested by any one or more of these input components  may be accessible and available for use by any of the modules described herein.","As used herein, the term \u201cmemory\u201d refers to a machine-readable medium able to store data temporarily or permanently and may be taken to include, but not be limited to, random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), buffer memory, flash memory, and cache memory. While the machine-readable medium  is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, or associated caches and servers) able to store instructions . The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any medium, or combination of multiple media, that is capable of storing the instructions  for execution by the machine , such that the instructions , when executed by one or more processors of the machine  (e.g., processor ), cause the machine  to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein, in whole or in part. Accordingly, a \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d refers to a single storage apparatus or device, as well as cloud-based storage systems or storage networks that include multiple storage apparatus or devices. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, one or more tangible (e.g., non-transitory) data repositories in the form of a solid-state memory, an optical medium, a magnetic medium, or any suitable combination thereof.","Furthermore, the machine-readable medium is non-transitory in that it does not embody a propagating signal. However, labeling the tangible machine-readable medium as \u201cnon-transitory\u201d should not be construed to mean that the medium is incapable of movement\u2014the medium should be considered as being transportable from one physical location to another. Additionally, since the machine-readable medium is tangible, the medium may be considered to be a machine-readable device.","Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement components, operations, or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.","Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules may constitute software modules (e.g., code stored or otherwise embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission medium), hardware modules, or any suitable combination thereof. A \u201chardware module\u201d is a tangible (e.g., non-transitory) unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone computer system, a client computer system, or a server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In some embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically, electronically, or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware module may be a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the phrase \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, and such a tangible entity may be physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein, \u201chardware-implemented module\u201d refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where a hardware module comprises a general-purpose processor configured by software to become a special-purpose processor, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special-purpose processors (e.g., comprising different hardware modules) at different times. Software (e.g., a software module) may accordingly configure one or more processors, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein, \u201cprocessor-implemented module\u201d refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented, a processor being an example of hardware. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented modules. As used herein, \u201cprocessor-implemented module\u201d refers to a hardware module in which the hardware includes one or more processors. Moreover, the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), with these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., an application program interface (API)).","The performance of certain operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.","Some portions of the subject matter discussed herein may be presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory (e.g., a computer memory). Such algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein, an \u201calgorithm\u201d is a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context, algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, but not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, accessed, transferred, combined, compared, or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals using words such as \u201cdata,\u201d \u201ccontent,\u201d \u201cbits,\u201d \u201cvalues,\u201d \u201celements,\u201d \u201csymbols,\u201d \u201ccharacters,\u201d \u201cterms,\u201d \u201cnumbers,\u201d \u201cnumerals,\u201d or the like. These words, however, are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.","Unless specifically stated otherwise, discussions herein using words such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d \u201cpresenting,\u201d \u201cdisplaying,\u201d or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine (e.g., a computer) that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within one or more memories (e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or any suitable combination thereof), registers, or other machine components that receive, store, transmit, or display information. Furthermore, unless specifically stated otherwise, the terms \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are herein used, as is common in patent documents, to include one or more than one instance. Finally, as used herein, the conjunction \u201cor\u201d refers to a non-exclusive \u201cor,\u201d unless specifically stated otherwise."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["Various ones of the appended drawings merely illustrate example
