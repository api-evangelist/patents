No. 61\/348422 filed May 26, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention pertains to water soluble compounds which inhibit the activity of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treating diseases during which anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are expressed.","Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are associated with a number of diseases. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which inhibit the activity of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.","Overexpression of Bcl-2 proteins correlates with resistance to chemotherapy, clinical outcome, disease progression, overall prognosis or a combination thereof in various cancers and disorders of the immune system.","Involvement of Bcl-2 proteins in bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, bone marrow cancer, cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, lymphoblastic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoid malignancies of T-cell or B-cell origin, melanoma, myelogenous leukemia, myeloma, oral cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, spleen cancer, and the like is described in commonly-owned PCT US 2004\/36770, published as WO 2005\/049593, and PCT US 2004\/37911, published as WO 2005\/024636.","Involvement of Bcl-2 proteins in immune and autoimmune diseases is described in 2003, 3, 378-384; 2000, 110(3), 584-90; 2000, 95(4), 1283-92; and 2004, 351(14), 1409-1418.

Drugs with poor dissolution rates are associated with low and variable bioavailability, higher potential for food effects, and inability to deliver high doses for toxicity studies, and difficulty in developing parenteral formulations. Therefore, increasing the solubility of compounds may alleviate these risks associated with low solubility and, moreover, constitute an advantage.","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts, which are useful as selective inhibitors of one or more than one anti-apoptotic protein family member, the compounds having Formula (I), (II), or (III)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"150.54mm","wi":"72.64mm","file":"US09006247-20150414-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein","Ais N or C(A);","Ais H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;","Bis H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R)C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;","Dis H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;","Eis H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;

Compounds of this invention may contain carbon-carbon double bonds or carbon-nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration, wherein the term \u201cE\u201d represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen double bond and the term \u201cZ\u201d represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of \u201cE\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore, the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuration. For examples, see C. D. Jones, M. Kaselj, R. N. Salvatore, W. J. le Noble 1998, 63, 2758-2760 and E. L. Eliel, and S. H. Wilen. (1994) . New York, N.Y.: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Compounds of this invention contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration, in which the terms \u201cR\u201d and \u201cS\u201d are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem. (1976) 45, 13-10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount, preferably an excess of about 85%-90%, more preferably an excess of about 95%-99%, and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99%. Accordingly, this invention includes racemic mixtures, relative and absolute stereoisomers, and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.","Compounds of this invention containing NH, C(O)OH, OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug-forming moieties.

Isotopes can be radioactive or non-radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine include, but are not limited to H, H, C, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and\/or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.","In another embodiment, the isotope-labeled compounds contain deuterium (H), tritium (H) or C isotopes. Isotope-labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope-labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope-labeled reagent for a non-labeled reagent. In some instances, compounds may be treated with isotope-labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope, for example, hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO\/DO. In addition to the above, relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance, in Lizondo, J et al., 21(11), 1116 (1996); Brickner, S Jet al., 39(3), 673 (1996); Mallesham, B et al., 5(7), 963 (2003); PCT publications WO1997010223, WO2005099353, WO1995007271, WO2006008754; U.S. Pat.

Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. 64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., J. 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., 77, 79-88 (1999).","In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called \u201cheavy drugs,\u201d can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl-2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci 1960 84: 736; Czakja D Metal., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic N et al. in \u201cDosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy\u201d, Zamenhof R, Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp. 125-134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).","Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmcokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-istopic compound.","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts, which are useful as selective inhibitors of one or more than one anti-apoptotic protein family member, the compounds having Formula (I), (II), or (III)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0133"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"150.54mm","wi":"72.64mm","file":"US09006247-20150414-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein","Ais N or C(A);","Ais H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;","Bis H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SO RC(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;","Dis H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;","Eis H, R, OR, SR, S(O)R, SOR, C(O)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, NHR, N(R), C(O)NHR, C(O)N(R), NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)NH, NHC(O)NHR, NHC(O)N(R), NRC(O)NHR, NRC(O)N(R), SONH, SONHR, SON(R), NHSOR, NRSOR, NHSONHR, NHSON(R), NRSONHR, NRSON(R), C(O)NHNOH, C(O)NHNOR, C(O)NHSOR, C(NH)NH, C(NH)NHR, C(NH)N(R)NHSONHR, NHSON(CH)R, N(CH)SON(CH)R, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, NO, N, OH, C(O)H, CHNOH, CH(NOCH), CF, C(O)OH, C(O)NHor C(O)OR;

The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032-OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand. For example, siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT-263, (i.e., N-(4-(4((2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1-cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(morpholin-4-yl)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide) or ABT-737 (i.e., N-(4-(4-((4\u2032-chloro(1,1\u2032-biphenyl)-2-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide) in multiple tumor cell lines (Tse et. al, 2008, 68(9), 3421 and references therein).","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF, or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.","Alkylating agents include altretamine, AMD-473, AP-5280, apaziquone, bendamustine,
