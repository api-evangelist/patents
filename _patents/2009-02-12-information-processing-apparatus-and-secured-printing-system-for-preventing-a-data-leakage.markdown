Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a printing system and an information processing apparatus capable of performing secured printing. More specifically, preventing document data encrypted by an application from leakage.","2. Description of the Related Art","When a user generates a document by an application and prints the document by a printing apparatus, it is essential to prevent the document from being browsed\/printed illegally by a third person. Such a printing technology is referred to as secured printing.","For example, Adobe Acrobat that is an application for generating a Portable Document Format (PDF) file adopts a system in which document is encrypted and can be printed only when a password for permitting printing is presented. When such an application receives a printing instruction from a user, the application requests the password from the user. Upon obtaining the password, the application encrypts document by the application and passes the data to a spooler for printing.","Further, a unit method is used in which, when a printer driver in a printing system receives data via the application\/spooler, the print driver encrypts and transmits the data provided with password information to a printer. Thus, secret information can be prevented from leakage that may occur between the printer driver and the printer (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-342061).","As another method, a printer driver receives certificate information and document encrypted by an application. Subsequently, the encrypted document provided with certificate information including a password is transmitted to a printer as print data, and the printer performs print processing on the decrypted data (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-287824).","However, in an environment where an application is connected with a printing system via a network, it is likely that secret information is leaked when the data is transmitted from the application to a spooler. In order to address this problem, for example, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-287824, a unit method is discussed where the data that is encrypted by the application and provided with the certificate information is transmitted to the printing apparatus.","However, this method cannot be employed in the printing performed by a host rendering printer that requires a host computer to perform rasterization processing. The host rendering printer requires decryption prior to rasterization so that the printer driver can perform rasterization. At this point, a spooler could decrypt document data. However, if the document data is decrypted before a spool file is generated, the document data can be browsed by extracting the spool file in the printing system.","Supposing that, in a printing system, the document data is encrypted immediately before being transmitted from the spooler to the printer driver, and a printer driver has a filter configuration. In this case, it is likely that the document data is leaked when the decrypted data is transmitted to the printer driver.","An object of the present invention is directed to secured printing in which document data encrypted by an application is prevented from leakage via at least a spooler or a printer driver during print processing.","Further, an object of the present invention is directed to secured printing in which the document data encrypted by the application is prevented from leakage via the processing by the spooler, the printer driver and overall printing apparatus.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling an information processing apparatus that includes a storage unit configured to store a program that realizes a spooler for managing a print command based on a print instruction about document data via an application from a user, and a program that realizes a printer driver which transmits print data for printing the document data to a printing apparatus, the method includes, obtaining a public key of the spooler from the spooler and encrypting the document data using the obtained public key of the spooler by the application, upon receiving the print instruction about the document data from the user, obtaining the encrypted document data via the application and temporarily storing the encrypted document data that is obtained, by the printer driver, obtaining a secret key of the spooler from the spooler and decrypting the encrypted document data using the obtained secret key of the spooler, and generating print data based on the decrypted document data.","Further features and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Various exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"First, a configuration of a hardware in the information processing apparatus will be described.","In , a central processing unit (CPU)  performs programs such as an application and an operating system (OS) recorded in a read-only memory (ROM) for a program in a ROM , or loaded from a hard disk (HD)  to a random access memory (RAM) . Processing illustrated by each flowchart can be realized by performing the program. The RAM  functions as a primary memory and a working area of the CPU . A key board controller (KBC)  controls a key input from a key board  or a pointing device (not illustrated).","A cathode ray tube (CRT) controller (CRTC)  controls a display on a CRT display . A disk controller (DKC)  controls data access to the HD  and a floppy disk (FD) that record various data. A printer controller (PRTC)  controls communication of signals between the information processing apparatus and the printing apparatus connected with each other. Various connection types such as a local area network (LAN) and a universal serial bus (USB) can be applied to a connecting line . A network controller (NC)  is connected to the network to perform communication control for communicating with other devices connected to the network. The information processing apparatus may be configured to connect to other printing apparatuses and peripheral apparatuses via the network.","Next, a configuration of a hardware in the printing apparatus will be described.","In the printing apparatus, a CPU  controls each block connected to a system bus  according to a control program recorded in a ROM  and an external memory . An image signal generated by the CPU  is output to a printing unit (printing engine)  via a printing unit interface (I\/F)  as output information. Further, the CPU  can perform communication with the information processing apparatus via an input unit  to notify information about the printing apparatus to the information processing apparatus.","A program ROM in the ROM  records a control program of the CPU . A font ROM in the ROM  records font data used to generate output information. A data ROM in the ROM  records information used by the information processing apparatus when the printing apparatus does not include an external memory  such as a hard disk.","A RAM  functions as a main memory and a working area of the CPU  and is configured so that a memory capacity can be expanded by an option RAM that can be connected to an expanded port (not illustrated). Further, the RAM  is used as a region for expanding output information, a region for storing environment data, and a non-volatile RAM (NVRAM).","A memory controller (MC)  controls the access of the external memory  to the printing apparatus. The external memory  is connected to the printing apparatus as an option and stores font data, emulation program, and form data. Further, an operation switch  includes a switch and a light-emitting diode (LED) display for performing an operation.","A scanner unit I\/F  performs compensation, processing, and edition on image data received from a scanner unit . The scanner unit  inputs reflection light generated by exposing and scanning an image of a document to a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor to convert image information into electric signals.","Further, the scanner unit  converts the electric signals into brightness signals formed of each color of RGB and reads the brightness signals as image data. When a user issues an instruction to start reading via the operation unit , the scanner unit  is instructed via the scanner unit I\/F  to read a document. Upon receiving the instruction, the scanner unit  operates to read the document.","Reading of the document may be performed by an automatically feeding method in which the document is set on a document feeder (not illustrated), or by a method in which the document is placed on a glass surface (not illustrated) and an exposure unit is moved for scanning the document.","In , the printing apparatus including the scanner unit is described. However, if the printing apparatus includes at least the printing unit, the present invention can be applied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","100","102","103","101","102"]},"A spooler  controls a print instruction generated in the information processing apparatus . Even when a plurality of print instructions is simultaneously issued, the document data is temporarily stored as a spool file  and the print instructions can be sequentially performed. The spooler  obtains a public key  that is an encryption key used for encrypting data and a secret key  used for decrypting the data encrypted by the public key .","A printer driver  is a printer driver set provided by a printer vendor and is stored in a recording apparatus in the information processing apparatus . The printer driver  generates print data to be transmitted to a printing apparatus  and performs processing for transmitting the data to the printing apparatus .","A decryption processing unit  is a module that performs decryption processing on the spool file  received from the spooler . A raster generation processing unit  is a module that generates an image from information in a vector form or outline font form to generate page description language (PDL) data. A PDL generation processing unit  is a module that converts the image into a data form that the printing apparatus can interpret and includes a printer control command such as a finisher added to a compressed image data. An encryption processing unit  is a module that again encrypts the PDL data and transmits the encrypted data.","The printing apparatus  receives the print data and performs print output. A decryption processing unit  is a module that decrypts the encrypted data received from the printer driver . A public key  and a secret key  are used respectively for encryption processing by the printer driver  and decryption processing by the printing apparatus  and are held in the printing apparatus .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"A network  is used for a local area network (LAN) inside an office, and a plurality of apparatuses such as a client apparatus  and a server apparatus  are connected to each other via the network .","The application  may be included in either of the client apparatus  and the server apparatus .","According to the present exemplary embodiment, the server apparatus  includes the spooler  and the printer driver . Both of the applications  and  included respectively in the client apparatus  and the server apparatus  that are connected to each other via the network  are a subject of the present exemplary embodiment.","A printing apparatus  corresponds to the printing apparatus . A printing apparatus  may be connected to the server apparatus  via an interface such as the network and the USB, or may be directly connected to the network .","Referring to a flowchart of , a flow of processing in the application  will be described.","In step S, upon receiving a print instruction from the user, the application  generates the document data  to be printed, using a graphic function, for example. Detailed generation processing of the document data  depends on the application  and the OS. For example, PDF is generated as a document for Mac OS, and PostScript is generated for Linux.","In step S, the application  requests the public key  from the spooler  in the information processing apparatus .","In step S, it is determined whether the public key  requested in step S is obtained. When the public key  described in step S can be obtained in step S (YES in step S), the encryption processing unit  encrypts the document data  using the public key  in step S. Since the encryption is performed according to a known method using a public key, details of encryption processing are not described here. In step S, the application  transmits the document data encrypted in step S to the spooler .","When the public key  cannot be obtained due to an occurrence of an error or the like in step S (NO in step S), the application  displays a screen to notify the user that printing is stopped and ends the printing processing in step S. The display processing in step S is displayed in a message dialog by the application .","Referring to a flowchart of , processing by the spooler  will be sequentially described. The spooler  holds the public key  for encryption performed by the application  and the secret key  for decryption performed by the printer driver .","In step S, the spooler  receives the document data to be printed from the application . The reception processing varies depending on the spooler . For example, the spooler  may receive the document data simply via a local path, or via the network according to Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).","In step S, the spooler  generates the spool file  and temporarily stores the document data in the recording apparatus in the information processing apparatus .","In step S, the spooler  obtains information about the secret key  to be held and records the information about the secret key  in a memory accessible only by the spooler .","In step S, the spooler  activates the printer driver  that generates the print data which is an object to be printed by the printing apparatus . Regarding activating of the printer driver in step S, the spooler  activates the printer driver  as one of the processes and further as a child process of the spooler . At this point, the spooler  provides a path of the spool file  as an argument for activating.","If the spooler  provides the path of the spool file  as an argument for activating, other users can easily confirm a status of a process in the information processing apparatus  using a system command. Therefore, it is possible to refer to the spool file . However, since the spool file  is encrypted, the spool file  cannot be decrypted without the information about the secret key . Thus, other users cannot browse the document.","The spooler  transmits the secret key  to the printer driver  when activating the printer driver  in step S. Accordingly, a pipe is generated to connect a process of the spooler  to that of the printer driver .","In step S, the spooler  provides information about the secret key  developed in a memory space which is accessible only by the spooler , to the printer driver  which is instructed by the spooler  to activate. The spooler  writes the information into the pipe connected to the printer driver . Since only the spooler  delivers and the printer driver  receives the secret key  via the pipe, other users or other processes cannot obtain the information about the secret key . Accordingly, even if the encrypted data should be leaked, the data cannot be decrypted by anything but the printer driver , resulting in preventing the secret information from leakage.","Referring to a flowchart of , processing for generating print data by the printer driver  will be described in detail.","In step S, the printer driver  activated by the spooler  as the child process of the spooler  opens the spool file  using the information about the path of the spool file  provided as an activating argument by the spooler .","In step S, a decryption processing unit  of the printer driver  performs decryption processing. In the decryption processing performed in step S, the secret key  is read from the pipe connecting the spooler  to the printer driver  and developed in the memory space accessible only by the printer driver . Further, the spool file  opened in step S is read into the same memory space accessible only by the printer driver .","The decryption processing by the decryption processing unit  is performed according to a known decryption method using secret key information. The decryption processing unit  stores the data decrypted in step S in a memory space accessible only by the printer driver . In step S, the raster generation processing unit  in the printer driver  refers to the document data that is decrypted in step S and stored in the memory space and performs raster generation processing for converting the data into bitmap data.","The raster generation processing is generally referred to as rendering and a module that performs the raster generation processing is referred to as a renderer. The raster generation processing performed in step S may use a unique renderer provided by a printer vender as well as a renderer called out from the system.","However, when the system renderer is used, for example, the raster generation processing unit  directly calls out the system renderer via an application programming interface (API) of the system renderer so that the document data cannot be referred from an outside. The raster generation processing unit  stores the raster data in the memory space accessible only by the printer driver .","In step S, the PDL generation processing unit  in the printer driver  refers to the data that is converted into the raster data in step S and stored in the memory space and performs PDL generation processing for converting the data into PDL data appropriate for the printing apparatus . The PDL generation processing unit  stores the PDL data in the memory space accessible only by the printer driver .","In step S, the encryption processing unit  in the printer driver  requests the public key  in order to again encrypt the data converted into the PDL data in step S.","In step S, if the public key  can be obtained by the processing in step S (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S, and the encryption processing unit  refers to the data that is converted into the PDL data in step S and stored in the memory space and performs decryption processing using the public key .","Decryption in step S may be performed according to a known method of decryption using a public key as well. In step S, the encryption processing unit  transmits the data encrypted in step S to the printing apparatus . When the data is transmitted in step S, for example, the encryption processing unit  sets a flag indicating the encrypted data at a head portion of the data to be transmitted, so that encrypted data can be discriminated.","A transmission method varies depending on a form of connection between the information processing apparatus  and the printing apparatus . For example, when the network is used for the connection, a protocol such as line printer daemon (LPD) is used for transmission. On the other hand, when the USB is used, a method is determined based on a specification of the interface.","In step S, when the public key  cannot be obtained for some reason, for example, when the printing apparatus  is not adapted to receive the encrypted data, the encryption processing unit  proceeds to step S without performing the encryption processing in step S.","In step S, the encryption processing unit  transmits the unencrypted data as it is to the printing apparatus  and the printer driver  ends the processing. At this point, the flag indicating the decrypted data is not set at the head of the data to be transmitted.","When the public key  is not obtained in step S, a screen indicating that printing is stopped, may be displayed for the user, and the print processing is ended. In display processing, a message dialog is displayed on the information processing apparatus that includes the application.","The printing apparatus  holds the public key  for encryption by the printer driver  and the secret key  for decryption by the printing apparatus . Referring to a flowchart of , a flow of processing performed by the printing apparatus  will be specifically described.","In step S, the printing apparatus  receives the print data transmitted from the printer driver .","In step S, the decryption processing unit  of the printing apparatus  determines whether the print data received in step S is the encrypted data. The encrypted print data can be determined in step S according to whether the flag indicating the encrypted data is set at the head portion of the received print data.","In step S, if the flag indicating the encrypted data is set at the head of the received print data, the decryption processing unit  determines that the received print data is encrypted. In step S, the decryption processing unit  performs the decryption processing using the secret key  held by the printing apparatus  itself. The decryption processing is performed in step S according to a known decryption processing using a secret key. In step S, the print processing unit  of the printing apparatus  performs the print processing on the data decrypted by the decryption processing unit .","When the received print data is checked in step S, if it is determined that the print data is not the encrypted data, the processing proceeds to step S without performing the decryption processing in step S.","In step S, the print processing unit  performs the print processing and ends the print processing in the printing apparatus .","According to the exemplary embodiment as above described, the application  encrypts the data using the public key  obtained from the spooler . The printer driver  activated by the spooler  decrypts the encrypted document data using the secret key  held by the spooler . Further, the printer driver  encrypts the PDL data using the public key  obtained from the printing apparatus . The printing apparatus  decrypts the data using the secret key  and prints out the decrypted data.","In the configuration as described above, the secured printing system can be established in which the document data is not illegally browsed during the printing process performed by the application in the printing apparatus.","While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments.
