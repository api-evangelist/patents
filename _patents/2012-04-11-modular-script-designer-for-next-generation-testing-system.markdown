{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/475,057 filed Apr. 13, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to software testing, and in particular, this disclosure relates to an integrated platform for developing, debugging, and executing tests to insure the integrity and functionality of software systems.","2. Background","The development of computer software involves a rigorous testing process to insure that the software functions as intended. During the testing process, testers write various test scripts or software test modules for performing different types of tests necessary to ensure that the computer software is functioning as designed. The testers also set up and run the test scripts while tracking the results, and report the test result to appropriate personnel. This process is inefficient and time consuming, and requires significant tester involvement.","Further, as businesses continue to rely on computer software and complex software packages, an increasing number of highly complex computer software has been developed to meet business demands. Due to the increased complexity and scale, such software programs require a large-scale testing process involving far more testers and test scripts than were required previously. Such increases are related to organizations centralizing their testing and moving to an outsourced testing model. Traditionally testing was \u2018embedded\u2019 into the software development life cycle for each project, but now central \u2018discrete\u2019 testing functions exist within organizations, which test across multiple projects and releases.","Testing tools have been developed to assist the testers in performing the various steps of the testing process. However, existing testing tools are not able to provide the required functionality and efficiency to overcome the challenges posed by the large-scale testing process.","Testing of various products and\/or software products has increased in complexity and scope. In the past, relatively small groups of designers and developers, perhaps 10 to 30 in number, developed various tests for testing and verifying the function of software modules or code segments. Such small groups of individuals have been manageable. However, as the number of individuals contributing to the project becomes large, redundancy and complexity increase, which contributes to increased cost and an increase in the number of errors. Therefore, a need exists to address the above.","A method for modular script design includes receiving, at a modular script designer component, script information for a modular script from a user, generating a list of suggested modules based on the script information, and receiving, at the modular script designer component, a selection of a next module from the user. The selection of the next module includes a selection of the next module from among the list of the suggested modules or a request for a new module. If the selection of the next module includes the request for the new module, the method further includes generating the new module.","Other embodiments of systems, methods, features, and their corresponding advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","As shown in , a system  for next generation testing (\u201cNGT system\u201d) using automation controller provides a platform allowing increased efficiency and functionality for testing computer software. The system  may be embodied as a system cooperating with computer hardware components and\/or as a computer-implemented method.","The NGT system  may include a unified desktop  which includes a test planning tool , a modular script designer , an execution toolbar , and a defect management component . The NGT system  may also include a prioritization and assignment manager , an automation controller , a data supply chain controller , an integration layer , and a reporting portal . The integration layer may link to an existing testing tool , such as Hewlett Packard's HP Quality Center\u2122, an existing test management and quality management tool , such as IBM Rational Quality Manager, and a database or server , such as a Microsoft SQL Server with SQL Integration Services and SQL Analysis Services. The NGT may also include virtual machines,  which interface with the automation controller . The virtual machines  may run a functional test automation tool, such as functional and regression test software , such as Hewlett Packard's HP QuickTest Professional (QTP). Other types of testing tools may also be used.","The NGT system  provides a suite of \u201cwrapper\u201d tools for a testing process. The NGT system  may consist of a set of tools that integrate with existing test tools, and extend their functionality. The NGT system  allows functional testing at a larger scale by delivering tools to reduce the testing effort and increase the quality of testing. The NGT system  may reduce testing effort by more than 20% as compared to existing testing tools , such as HP Quality Center\u2122. Further the NGT system  may be extendible for use across multiple clients. The NGT system  may be built as an internal set of assets for use across clients and may be designed to allow client specific functionality to be handled through configuration and extension.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","202","204","206","100","202","204","204","206","208","202","210","212","214","204","222","224","226","228","206","232","234","236","238","100","240"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","104","106","112","108","114","116","120","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","100","402","414","416","418","420","422","426","402","428","428"]},"The memory subsystem  may include any suitable storage components, such as RAM, EPROM (electrically programmable ROM), flash memory, dynamic memory, static memory, FIFO (first-in, first-out) memory, LIFO (last-in, first-out) memory, circular memory, semiconductor memory, bubble memory, buffer memory, disk memory, optical memory, cache memory, and the like. Any suitable form of memory may be used, whether fixed storage on a magnetic medium, storage in a semiconductor device, or remote storage accessible through a communication link. A user or system interface  may be coupled to the computer  and may include various input devices , such as switches selectable by the system manager and\/or a keyboard. The user interface also may include suitable output devices , such as an LCD display, a CRT, various LED indicators, a printer, and\/or a speech output device, as is known in the art.","To facilitate communication between the computer  and external sources, a communication interface  may be operatively coupled to the computer system. The communication interface  may be, for example, a local area network, such as an Ethernet network, intranet, Internet, or other suitable network . The communication interface  may also be connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  or POTS (plain old telephone system), which may facilitate communication via the Internet . Any suitable commercially-available communication device or network may be used.","Description of the modular script designer (\u201cMSD\u201d)  follows. MSD  combines a simple interface for developing scripts, or facilitating script creation, using a modular approach along with an approvals framework. Modularization is the process of grouping test steps into small modules that describe a piece of functionality. These modules combine together to form test scripts or cases. The MSD  provides intelligent module suggestions for developing test scripts. Test scripts may include one or more modules. When a module is added to a script, a list of likely \u2018next modules\u2019 is displayed to the user. Therefore, the MSD  may improve knowledge management and decrease duplicated efforts in creating modules. Users can also search for modules with an in-line search function.","The MSD  also allows for meta-tagging and indicating parameters in the modules. Metadata is added to modules so that the system can understand how and where the module is used. Input and output parameters are specified to enable re-use of modules and data-driven approaches. The MSD  also allows the specification of skills and pre-requisites associated with a module. Skills are assigned to the tests so that the system knows who will be able or qualified to execute the script. Pre-requisites (including data) are specified to track the readiness of a test for execution. The MSD  also provides automated approvals workflow. A centralized workflow system is used to enable modules to be approved or rejected. After a module is created or modified, the approver is notified. The approver may approve the module to be used in all scripts, for a subset of scripts, or for a single script.","Description of the test execution toolbar  follows. The test execution toolbar  may be a unified toolbar incorporating all of the tools that a tester requires. The test execution toolbar  may provide in-line test execution. Test scripts can be opened directly within the toolbar, which saves room on a tester's desktop and avoids certain keystrokes, such as ALT-Tabbing, between screens. Defect raising and screen capture may be part of the process. The text execution toolbar  may also provide an embedded approvals lists. All module\/script approvals may be shown in the toolbar, and an approver can quickly open the relevant script\/module for approval. The test execution toolbar  also allows quick access to all NGT tools. A quick launch bar may be provided to enable the tester to quickly access all of the NGT tools. The toolbar may also handle login management for NGT. A user profile section is available to change user information. The test execution toolbar  is also dockable with an auto-hide function. The test execution toolbar  may be docked to the left hand side of the screen, and it can be selected to be visible or auto-hide. An extendable framework allows additional panels to be added to the toolbar.","Description of the prioritization and assignment manager (\u201cPAM\u201d)  follows. The PAM  provides a centralized automated prioritization of test scripts with real-time assignment logic. The PAM  provides configurable prioritization factors. Test scripts are prioritized based on a centralized set of factors, and the factors can be configured centrally to influence the entire test operation (for example, to improve performance against contractual key performance indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d)). The PAM  further provides a skill based assignment\u2014it provides a pull, rather than push, approach. Testers may click \u2018Get Next\u2019 via a user interface to get assigned the next script to execute. The best script is chosen in real-time based on weighted assignment factors. Managers may control the skills as compared against the skills of their team members. The PAM  may also provide manager overrides. Managers are given a view of the scripts planned for execution by their team. They are able to change the factors of specific scripts (for example, business priority) to re-prioritize the queue and force scripts to be assigned to specific individuals. The PAM  may also provide a pluggable framework for new factors. New decision factors can be added by defining a new factor class. The factor may be presented through the user interface and can be weighted in the decision logic. This could be used to enable advanced \u2018Applied Statistic\u2019 decision models.","Description of the automation controller  follows. The automation controller  may be an automation framework for resilient off-line automation on a virtual farm, such as a computing machine in a \u201ccloud environment.\u201d The automation controller  provides remote execution of test scripts. An automation controller agent may run on virtual machines (\u201cVM's\u201d) to manage the execution of test scripts. A logging framework is used to support the execution. The automation controller  also may communicate with the PAM  to get the next script. This allows the centralized factors to apply to both manual and automated execution.","The automation controller  also provides intelligent selection of modules to maximize the \u201creturn on investment\u201d or \u201cROI\u201d associated with each test script that is run automatically. The automation controller  selects for automation the test scripts that provide the greatest ROI collectively. The choice whether to automate a particular test script using the automation controller  may be based on the ROI associated with the test script. For example, a particular test script may be a test script that handles initial login by a user. Because a test script that handles initial login by user may be used by hundreds of different test scripts without variation, this testing script provides a high ROI, and as such, may be a good candidate for automation. The ROI essentially is a measure of increased efficiency attained by automation of the test script. A prioritization workflow aids the automation team in assessing the next module to be automated. The user interface allows the automation team to \u2018check-in\u2019 and \u2018upgrade\u2019 automated modules.","The automation controller  further provides modular design and partial automation. Automation scripts may be developed as modules, and each automation module may have one or more manual modules mapped against it. Partial automation enables rapid execution of automated parts of scripts. Essentially, the automation control  is used where applicable to automate the execution of test scripts.","Description of the reporting portal  follows. The reporting portal  provides an automated reporting capability accessible through a central on-line portal. The reporting portal  may include a full Microsoft\u2122 Business Intelligence (\u201cBI\u201d) suite. The solution makes use of SQL Server Integration Services, SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services, which are available from Microsoft Corporation. A custom SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) component directly communicates with external testing tools  such as an HP Quality Center\u2122 which is available from Hewlett-Packard Corporation.","The reporting portal  also includes an off-line data warehouse to avoid testing tool degradation. An off-line data warehouse may be maintained to avoid queries directly on the external testing tool. A dimension based data model is used for simplified reporting. Further, data is pre-aggregated in a multidimensional online analytical processing (\u201cMOLAP\u201d) database to provide quick analysis. The reporting portal  further provides cube-based metrics and KPIs (key process indicators). Using SS Analysis Services, measures and targets may have been pre-defined, which can be included into reports. PowerPivot, a spreadsheet add-in available from Microsoft Corporation, allows data to be quickly analyzed in spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel\u2122 for ad-hoc reports. Further, the reporting portal  provides integration with solutions, such as Microsoft SharePoint\u2122. Where data from systems other than the HP Quality Center\u2122 is required (for example, financial\/production data), the solution can receive data from solutions, such as Microsoft SharePoint\u2122. The SSIS component allows the solution to be easily extended to direct data sources where required.","Description of the defect management tool  follows. The defect management tool  may simplify the process for raising, tracking and updating defects. The defect management tool  may provide a defect watch list. Toolbar based list of defects with real-time Red, Amber or Green (RAG) status indicators may be provided. Red status indicates high risk or serious project issues, amber status indicates medium risk, and green status indicates low risk. The defect management tool  may allow quick access to full information of the defects to see the latest status. The defect management tool  may also provide in-line defect raising with test history. While executing a test through the toolbar, screenshots and test steps may be captured. When a defect is raised, this information is pre-populated in the defect. Screenshots and other attachments can be uploaded directly. The defect management tool , also reduces \u201calt-tab\u201d operations. By including core defect management in the toolbar, the defect management tool  is able to reduce the need to \u201calt-tab\u201d into an external testing system , such as the HP Quality Center\u2122. The defect management tool  also enables automated un-blocking of scripts to further avoid time spent in the external testing system. The defect management tool  further provides team based views. Managers have a \u2018team view\u2019 to enable them to see the defects currently impacting their team with the relevant size and status.","Description of the test planning tool  follows. The test planning tool  provides an intelligent interface for estimating, planning, selecting regression and assigning prep work. The test planning tool  provides assisted estimation. A three stage process is used to provide estimation at increasing levels of accuracy. Information is used from previous testing releases to improve estimates. Pluggable architecture for client-specific calculations may be used. The test planning tool  also provides deconstruction of requirements into tests. The test planning tool  assists the user in breaking down requirements into a manageable number of tests. Collaborative working capabilities allow a \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 approach. The test planning tool  further provides resource forecasting by skill. Early foresight of skills required to support the testing activities is made possible, and graphical display of availability versus demand may be presented on the user interface. The test planning tool  further helps to shape the test organization by promoting cross-skilling. The test planning tool  also provides regression pack suggestions. Using a meta-data driven approach, the system will suggest an appropriate regression pack. Risk-based testing scores can be used to size the pack accordingly.","Description of the test data supply chain  follows. The test data supply chain  automates the demand management and supply of test data. The test data supply chain  may provide a data catalogue. Data types are modeled and stored in a database. The test data team can check data in and out of the catalogue. Also, rules can be specified to enable basic data mining. The test data supply chain  also provides mapping data to test scripts. During preparation, the data type required is selected against the script. Also, using the modular script designer , data parameters can be mapped directly to script parameters to allow automated assignment at run-time. The test data supply chain  further provides monitoring of \u2018stock levels\u2019 and re-ordering. The test data supply chain  can monitor demand versus capacity for all types of data, and as data gets \u2018used\u2019 by test scripts, the levels are updated. The test data supply chain  can order additional data from the data team or via an automated provision. The test data supply chain  may also be integrated with the PAM . The stock levels can be used during prioritization to avoid running scripts that do not have available test data or where stock levels are low.","For example, if fifty specific test scripts require input data type \u201cA\u201d and twenty-seven specific test scripts require input data type \u201cB,\u201d the test data supply chain  organizes the required data types for each script and provides the data to the test script in a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manner to avoid redundancy and reduce complexity. Further, such test data may change throughout the lifecycle of the testing process based on the results of a particular test. Accordingly, the test data supply chain  tracks the required changes and updates the data sets required for the corresponding test scripts so that as the test scripts are being executed, up-to-date test data is available to the test script.","The MSD  may provide the following functionalities: Define New Script: The user is able to create a new test script and enter key information about that script; Edit Existing Script: The user is able to load, or load, an existing script and edit the information\/modules in that script; Select Test Data: The user is able to select test data types from the data catalogue to associate to the script; Search for Modules: The user is able to search for existing modules; Top 10 Next Modules: The MSD  may suggest the most likely next modules, which may be ten modules or any other number of modules, to the tester based on the existing scripts within the repository; and Create New Module: The user is able to design a new module when required.","The Create New Module may include the following sub-functionalities: Define Test Steps: Test steps may be captured against the module; Define Expected Results: Expected Results may be captured against the Test Steps; Define Input Variables: The tester may be able to define the input variables for the module and include these as required in the test steps\/results; Define Output Variables: The tester may be able to define the output variables for the module and include these as required in the test steps\/results.","The MSD  may further provide the following functionalities: Map Module Input Variables: The Input of the modules is mapped to the output of previous modules, entered by the tester at run-time or mapped to a test data field; Module Metadata: The MSD  allows additional configurable metadata to be specified against each module; Skill Capture: The tester is able to enter the skills required to execute the test; Pre-Requisite Capture: The MSD  allows the tester to enter any required pre-requisites against the script; Priority and Risk Capture: The user is able to enter the business priority, likelihood of failure and impact of failure against the test script.","MSD  may further provide functionalities, such as allowing users to: clone test scripts, save scripts as drafts, view legacy steps, easily re-order modules in the script, mark modules as favorite, view favorite modules, submit modules to module approvers, save modules as draft, define source of input and output variable as a fixed value, mark scripts as not requiring review, attach documents or images to scripts, and cancel creation of a script. The MSD  may also ensure no modules are created with the same name. The MSD  may provide fewer, additional, or other functionalities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["106","106","501","510","106","501","520","501","106","501","511","501","510","501","106","501","106"]},"The MSD  may further allow the tester  to create new scripts . To create a new script  in the MSD , the tester  may enter script details , including a unique script name, a brief description of script capabilities and skill details. Skill details may include the skills required to execute the script successfully. At , the tester  may specify, in the MSD , input and output variables for the script, and review all data that the tester  inputted for the script, select an approver for the script and attach any data that the script may require. The tester  may submit the script to a testing tool , such as the HP Quality Center\u2122.","The MSD  also allows the tester  to input modules into the test script. The MSD  may suggest to the tester  modules to be added to the script. At , the tester  may also use the MSD  to search for other modules to add to the script, create a new module, edit existing modules, or clone existing modules. The MSD  may also store the tester's  favorite modules. The MSD  may allow the tester  to add selected, newly created, edited, or cloned modules to the script. The tester  may optionally submit a module  to an approver , who may be a peer reviewer, such as a test lead. The approver  may provide comments for the script and may approve the module  or reject the module . If the approver  rejects the module , the approver  may distribute the module back to the tester for editing , and the module may only be edited from the point where the module was submitted . A rejected module is inactive, which means that the module cannot be searched for and cannot be used. The tester  may edit the script  based on comments from the approver . If the approver  accepts the module , the module is marked as ready for test, which means the module is ready for execution, and added to the script.","In a specific embodiment, the MSD  may provide the following approval process for approving a newly created module. When the tester  submits a module for approval, the MSD  may set a status indicator of the module to pending approval and alert an approver  to review the module. The tester  may designate an individual to be the approver , or the MSD  may select an approver  based on a role of the approver and skills required for the module. When the approver  approves the module, the MSD  may set the status indicator of the module to approved for use and the module is then available for use in other scripts and is searchable by users of the MSD . The approver may also amend the module before approving the module. When the approver  rejects a module, the MSD  may prompt the approver to enter a reason for rejection and sets the status indicator of the module to rejected, and alerts the tester that the approver rejected the module. The tester  may edit or update the rejected module in the MSD . The tester  may edit or update the rejected module and submit the module for review again, or the tester  may remove the rejected module from the script, in which case the MSD  sets the status indicator of the rejected module to inactive or deletes the rejected module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 6, 7, 8 and 9","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["106","106","601","602","106","610","620","630","640","604","605","620","106","622","623","624","106","106","625","626","627","606","626","106","700","630","106","604","605","162","640","106","641","642","643","606","643","106","604","605","605","106","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["106","626","106","700","710","106","720","106","721","900","106","722"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["106","605","106","800","106","801","801","802","106","803","804","106","805","806","106","808","803","106","810","810","106","811","810","106","812","813","106","814","106","900"]},"The MSD  may allow the user to search for a module  by prompting the user to enter search details , perform the search  and display the search results to the user.

The user may also input data regarding a module, including, for example, a module name , a status of the module , a version of the module , and a module description . The user interface may further display to the user a plurality of options in panes, including suggested modules  to include in the script and the option to search for modules .","The user may select a module from the suggested modules  by clicking and dragging a module of choice into a Current Script field . The user may input additional information regarding the module, including components to which the module is linked (pulled from a configuration management database (CMDB) and any other metadata). The user interface may display to the user other information regarding the script, including for example, module steps , test steps for each module step , expected results for each module step , current script steps , attribute names , attribute values , and parameters . The user may click the \u201cAdd to Script\u201d button  to add a module to the script.","The MSD  updates the list of suggested modules based on the last module in the script. If the script has no modules, the MSD  may provide a list of the most popular modules to be used as the first step in the script. For example, the MSD  may suggest a popular first module such as \u201cLog in to App.\u201d If one or more modules are in the script, the MSD  may suggest popular modules that follow the last module listed in the script. The MSD  may add the user selected module from the list of suggested modules to the script, and display the details of the selected module to the user for review and modification. The details may include, for example, the steps in a given module, the attributes for that module and the module's parameters. Attributes can be hidden to allow more space to review the steps. After reviewing the details, the tester can add the selected module to the test script by clicking \u201cAdd to Script\u201d. The details of each step in the current script may be shown in a pane, such as a Current Script pane , for the tester to view the entire script as the tester progresses. After the tester adds the selected module to the script, the MSD  may update the suggested module panes to show the most likely next steps, or modules, in the script. The MSD  may determine, based on the order of modules in other existing scripts, which modules are commonly added after the selected module. The MSD  allows the tester to develop the script by adding modules to the script, changing the order of modules in the Current Script pane , or removing modules from the Current Script pane .","On the Input\/Output tab , the MSD  may display a list of all input\/put parameters associated with the test script. The tester may amend the source for the input\/output parameters by selecting a parameter to change. For example, the tester may change an input parameter to a fixed value.

Alternatively, the user may change the source of the input parameter to \u201cUser Defined.\u201d","On the Finish tab , the MSD  displays to the tester a summary of the details for the test script. The MSD  may present the new module to the tester so that the tester can add the new module to the current script. The user may select one of their peers to review the script. When the script is submitted for review, the MSD  triggers an approval workflow to ensure that modules of the script are not incorrectly created. The user may also browse the test tool to decide where to store the script that has been developed. The MSD  allows the tester to add attachments to the script and submit the script for peer review. The MSD  may allow the tester to enter a reason for no review and proceed with submitting the test script.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["106","106","1300","1300","1114","1320","1330","1114","1300"]},"The Step Design tab  may guide the tester through adding steps to the module. The Step Design tab  may prompt the tester to input information regarding a description, parameters and expected results for each step in the module. Parameters may be embedded in the steps using notations, such as \u201c>>>Input<<<\u201d for inputs and \u201c<<<Output>>>\u201d for output parameters. The list of parameters may be updated as each step is entered. The user continues to enter the expected result for the step and specify whether test evidence should be captured for that step. This process is repeated for the remaining steps in the module. The tester may also insert steps and add steps using the Step Design tab . The Finish tab  may display to the user a module summary page and allows the tester to submit the module, save a draft of the module, add the module as a favorite, or cancel creation of the module. A module saved as a draft may not be added to any scripts.","An exemplary module may be a \u201cView Billing\u201d module that allows a user to view information or details regarding the user's account.

For example, the user may describe the likelihood of failure and impact of failure for the script, and based on the user's description, the system may calculate a risk based testing score for the script. For example, a user may select from among Low, Medium, High and Very High drop down choices on a drop down menu for \u201clikelihood of failure\u201d and from among Low, Medium, High and Very High drop down choices on a drop down menu for \u201cimpact of failure.\u201d A configurable list of attributes is then completed. These attributes can be directly linked to an underlying test tool (e.g. HP QC fields).","In yet another embodiment, a tester may search for the type of test data that will be required for the script. The user may select test data that is required to execute the test, input a description of the required test data, and input additional comments about the data type. The user may input additional comments about the specific configuration of the test data required. For example, the user may specify \u201cCustomer must have an open order.\u201d The MSD  may further require the tester to input certain data for the script. The required data may include, for example, customer type (e.g., business or consumer), address type, and product (e.g., landline, broadband, or mobile phone.

The MSD  associates, or adds, the new cloned module to the subset of scripts selected by the approver. The approver may choose whether the scripts require review following addition of the new module to the selected subset of scripts.","When the approver rejects a module, the MSD  prompts the approver to enter a reason for rejection, marks the module as rejected, and allows the approver to suggest a replacement module to the testers. Then, the MSD  sends a notification, for example, by email, to the tester to notify the tester that the module is rejected. Then, the MSD  may allow the tester to update and resubmit the module, or remove the module from the script.","The MSD  also provides a script approval process. When a new script is created, the MSD  sets the status indicator of the new script to pending review. The MSD  assigns a reviewer to review the script.
