{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Various Embodiments"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/847,940, filed on Jul. 18, 2013, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Much research has been devoted to the automatic detection of objectionable imagery. A common focus of such research is detection of pornographic images through the use of certain image analysis techniques, such as support vector machines, shape region techniques or pixel-based detection. Typically, these techniques are particularly tuned to the specific use case of pornographic images. For example, the goal of many systems developed based on such techniques is to identify pornographic images from among images available from a network resource, present on a webpage or submitted to a data store or service. Typically, systems that are designed to identify pornographic images are not well suited to detect other types of images that are not necessarily pornographic, but that may be objectionable to a certain audience or for a certain use or purpose.","Much research has been devoted to the automatic detection of objectionable imagery. In those situations where image safety is directly tied to revenues, the minimization of false alarms rates is of primary importance. Skin detection algorithms that seek to classify images as being safe or unsafe based upon a priori skin content thresholds have been found to have unacceptably high false alarm rates in classifying images as being objectionable. While improved trained classifiers have been introduced which provide good results, they require large training sets and great care must be exercised in the selection of the classification parameters in order to provide the best performance. Aspects of the present disclosure relate to a system that utilizes heuristics based on anthropometry to create a robust system for determining image safety with very low false alarm rates. The meaning of a \u201csafe\u201d image, as used herein, may generally refer to an image that is not likely to be considered objectionable for (or that is considered appropriate for) a given audience, a given use and\/or a given context. For example, aspects of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for analyzing image data to determine whether a given image is appropriate for a given use, such as to be viewed by a child, to be used for a given advertisement, to be displayed in a given location, and\/or other uses potentially desired by a publisher, advertiser and\/or other individual, entity or system.","Generally described, aspects of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for heuristically based automated image safety determinations. In some embodiments, image safety determinations may be utilized to pair advertisements with contextually relevant images. For example, if an image is determined to be safe for a given advertising campaign, an advertisement or other marketing message may be placed within the image, overlaid over the image, placed near the image on a page or be otherwise associated with the image. Advertisers may be sensitive not only to the topical content of the images they use, but whether those images are considered by the advertiser to be safe. In addition, aspects of the present disclosure may be implemented in whole or in part to expand avenues for revenue generation that utilize image features, such as adding a moustache to digital images or otherwise altering an image in association with an advertisement, a user request and\/or for another purpose. In order to determine appropriate and\/or desirable monetization techniques for a given image or library of images, it would be beneficial to discover and retain as much information as possible regarding each image.","Determining image safety has generally concentrated on the detection of pornography through the use of, for example, certain support vector machines shape region techniques and pixel based detection. While these techniques have been shown to be at least somewhat effective for certain purposes, they have generally been developed with a goal of detecting pornographic images. Because pornographic images as a type of target imagery is deemed extremely unsafe, the probability of a Type  error is often allowed to rise in order to provide the lowest possible Type  error. Accordingly, such techniques are not well-suited for applications in which a high level of accuracy is desired in order to minimize both false positives and false negatives. In addition, many known techniques are particularly tuned to detect pornographic images, an image type which is generally associated with a widely accepted definition of image safety. Such techniques do not lend themselves well to analyzing image types for which a flexible and\/or context-specific notion of image safety is to be applied.","In some instances, in order to be suitable for purposes of image safety analysis for in-image advertising or a variety of other potential uses, the definition of an unsafe image in a given embodiment may be broadened to include those images which are unacceptable to one or more client advertisers (such as being in violation of certain criteria or rules associated with an advertiser) and\/or those images which might be deemed inappropriate due to specific marketed viewers (such as a viewers of a given age, geography or other demographic element). For example, a specific ad for children's toys might be deemed safe to select for display in association with an image of a woman wearing a bikini bathing suit, but not an image of a woman wearing bra and panties. Similarly, an ad for a travel service to a Muslim country might be deemed unsafe to display in associated with an image of a woman with any skin exposure other than the face. In addition, these thresholds of safety or safety rules might vary from one client to the next, in some cases even within the same product target.","Aspects of the present disclosure may allow for simple and rapid definitions of image safety or video safety that may be tailored by or based at least in part on input from (or information associated with) an administrator, advertiser, publisher or other user, and\/or based on an intended use of the image(s) or video(s) subsequent to performing the image safety analysis. Additionally, a computing system as described herein may determine and retain anthropometric and\/or feature data for possible further image data exploitation, such as advertising use of the image, modifications to the image, use of the image in a given context or environment, cataloging or labeling the image, and\/or other use. While the example of still images is often used herein, the image analysis and other features described herein, in some embodiments, may be equally applied to moving imagery or video data. In some embodiments, various media or content, such as a game, webpage or user interface, may be classified as safe or unsafe based at least in part on analysis of image data or other visual data included therein or associated therewith.","Example Methods",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["150","203","100","164","162","160","100","150","203"]},"Determine Skin","At block  in the illustrative method, the image analysis module  determines or identifies the pixels or other portions of the image that likely correspond to human skin of a subject in the image (such as a photographed human model). For example, according to one embodiment, the entire target image, T, with center (X, Y) is searched to find all pixels corresponding to skin. This skin detection may be conducted utilizing any of a variety of methods for detecting skin. As an example, in some embodiments, skin detection may be conducted utilizing a facial skin color model based at least in part on the RGB-H-CbCr Skin Colour Model for Human Face Detection developed by Abdul Rahman, Wei and See. This skin model, although targeted at the detection of faces, performs well in detecting body skin. This body area detection, while considered undesirable in the face detection context for which the Rahman model was originally developed, is well suited for aspects of the image safety system disclosed herein.","The Abdul Rahman, Wei and See skin color model consists of three rules (referred to below as Rule A, Rule B and Rule C) which must all return TRUE for a given pixel in order for the pixel to be declared skin. In other embodiments, the model may be modified to include more or fewer rules and\/or may not require that every rule be fulfilled in order for a given pixel to be declared skin.","Two rules are defined to model skin in the RGB color space. One for skin under uniform daylight given as\n\n(95) AND (40) AND (20) AND (max{}\u2212min{15) AND (|15) AND () AND ()\u2003\u2003 (1)\n\nand the second for skin under flash or daylight lateral lighting given by\n\n(220) AND (210) AND (170) AND (|15) AND () AND ()\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In one embodiment, a logical OR is then used to combine rule (1) and rule (2). This RGB rule is denoted as Rule A.","Next, 5 bounding rules enclosing the Cb-Cr color region may be formulated as below:\n\n1.5862\u00d720\u2003\u2003(3)\n\n0.3448\u00d776.2069\u2003\u2003(4)\n\n4.5652\u00d7234.5652\u2003\u2003(5)\n\n1.15\u00d7301.75\u2003\u2003(6)\n\n2.2857\u00d7432.85\u2003\u2003(7)\n","A logical AND may then be used to combine rules (3) to (7). This CbCr rule is denoted as Rule B.","Finally, two cutoff levels are defined in the HSV color space as below:\n\n25\u2003\u2003(8)\n\n230\u2003\u2003(9)\n","A logical OR may then be used to combine rules (8) and (9). This HSV rule is denoted as Rule C.\n\nRule : Equation(1)\u222a\u00b7Equation(2)\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nRule : Equation(3)\u2229Equation(4)\u2229Equation(5)\u2229Equation(6)\u2229Equation(7)\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nRule : Equation(8)\u222a\u00b7Equation(9)\u2003\u2003(12)\n","In this embodiment, each pixel that fulfills Rule A, Rule B and Rule C is classified as a skin pixel,\n\nRule \u2229Rule \u2229Rule \u2003\u2003(13)\n","In some embodiments, the image analysis module may further process the image based on the skin analysis in order to segment skin regions and\/or fill holes in regions. According to other embodiments, beyond the classification of each image pixel as \u201cskin\u201d or \u201cnot skin\u201d (or an indication of the likelihood or confidence that a given pixel corresponds to skin), no further processing is performed to segment the skin regions or to fill holes in regions (as represented in , according to one embodiment). Skin related data statistics may be generated and stored by the image analysis module , such as one or more of the following.","The percentage, P, of skin pixels, in the image as a whole\n\n=#skin pixels\/total #pixels\u2003\u2003(14)\n","Given a pixel, P, at location x,yThe spatial moment or order (m,n) may be determined as\n\n()=\u03a3\u03a3\u2003\u2003(15)\n","The center of mass of the skin area C=(C, C) may be determined as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","x"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","0"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["0","0"],"mo":","}}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"16"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","y"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["0","1"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["0","0"],"mo":","}}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"16"}}]}]}}}},"The area of the skin may be defined as the zeroth spatial moment of the skin mass, M(0,0) and the skin pixel density, D, of the skin given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"D","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["0","0"],"mo":","}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"17"}}]}}}}},"Finally, the convex hull of the skin pixels may be determined and a standard linear least squares fit to the convex hull in order to create a best-fit line to the skin area (as represented in , according to one embodiment).","According to some embodiments, once one or more of the above data have been generated or determined, an early threshold may be applied to determine if the percentage of skin in the image is too small to allow for a discernible human body and\/or if the skin pixel density is so low that no human form is likely to exist in the image. According to one embodiment, the lower bound of skin percentage for declaring that a human form might be possible may be 0.095 and a density value of 0.12 may be used as the lower bound on skin pixel density. In some embodiments, if the target image is found to be below either of these values, the image is determined by the image analysis module to be safe due to it most likely being non-human, and no further processing is performed in some such embodiments.","In some embodiments, the image analysis module may utilize one or more texture analysis techniques when determining skin areas. For example, the texture value of an area of an image may be determined and then used to segment the image into areas of similar texture. A determination of a texture value corresponding to skin in an image may be made and this texture value may be used to segment an image into areas of skin and not skin. Similarly, a determination of texture value may be used to classify an image area as hair, a specific clothing fabric and\/or other texture.","Locate Faces or Other Reference Body Part(s)","At block  in the illustrative method, the image may be analyzed to detect and identify the location within the image of one or more faces or other reference body parts. While the illustrative method will be described below with reference to embodiments in which a face is used as the anchor or reference body part located at block , one or more other body parts may alternatively or additionally be located and used as the anchor or reference body part in other embodiments. A reference body part may generally be considered a body part which may serve as an initial landmark for the location of other body parts. Reference body parts which may serve as an initial landmark include, but are not limited to, a face, one or more eyes, one or more ears, nose, mouth, head, one or more hands, one or more feet, navel, one or more breasts, one or more fingers, one or more toes, one or more shoulders, one or more wrists, one or more buttocks, one or more knees, one or more nipples, genitals, crotch area, waist, one or more hips, neck, midline of the back, and\/or one or more elbows.","According to some embodiments, if the percentage of skin and the skin density indicate a possible human form, one or more facial classifiers may be implemented by the image analysis module. For example, according to one embodiment, a facial classifier such as that defined by Viola and Jones (described in ) may be utilized to detect all faces within the image. In some embodiments, a frontal face classifier (such as, for example, a face detector similar to that described by Rainer Lienhart et al., which utilizes the Gentle AdaBoost algorithm) and\/or a profile face classifier (such as, for example, the \u201c20\u00d720 profile face detector\u201d developed by David Bradley) may be utilized to detect face candidates. According to one embodiment, face detections that exceed a given skin pixel threshold, such as 0.13 or other value, are determined to be a candidate face. In some embodiments, as each face candidate is discovered, duplicate faces may be removed. Removal may be accomplished by a simple region-overlapping test, as one example. Given a set of n rectangular regions R={R, R, . . . R}, with rectangular region Rhaving a center given by (m, m), width given by wand height given by w, and a candidate region R, the system may declare Rto be a duplicate if\n\n()\u2229)\u2260\u00d8\u2200\u2003\u2003(18)\n","In some embodiments, frontal faces may be detected first followed by profile faces as the probability of detection of faces in three-quarters profile by the frontal detector exceeds the probability of detection by the profile detector. The order of detection may be specific to the choice of detectors implemented in a given embodiment and may differ among embodiments that utilize different detectors. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the specific ordering of detection and\/or the number of facial detector(s) employed by the image analysis module  varies depending on the embodiment.","Once the set of one or more detected faces F={R, R, . . . , R}, has been formed from the set of candidate facial regions R, a set of one or more facial feature detectors may be implemented by the analysis module  to determine the location of one or more eyes, noses, mouths and\/or other facial features within each facial region, R(as represented in , according to one embodiment). A variety of different facial feature detectors that are known in the art may be employed, in some embodiments. For example, a different facial feature detection method may be utilized for identifying each of a mouth, eyes, a nose and\/or other facial features.","In some embodiments, each feature detector may analyze only the image data contained within the facial region of interest, R. As each feature set\n\n},\n\nwith eye region detections E, N, M; (j,k,m\u03b5I),\n\na set of heuristics based on anthropometric data may be utilized to assemble complete faces, and rejecting false alarms for each feature. In particular, because of the various expressions which can be made with the human mouth, it is often confused for an eye by mouth detectors and vice-versa. It is known, for example, that a pair of eyes cannot be located below a nose or mouth except if a person is upside down, in which case a frontal face detector will not have made a detection. The analysis module  may base its facial feature detection at least in part on anthropometric data from the United States Department of Defense and\/or other sources, and\/or based on fundamental anatomy. For example, an upright or tilted and\/or rotated head position may rule out the location of the mouth at the top of the face, even in the presence of no other feature detections.\n","Determine Key Body Areas","At block  in the illustrative method, the image analysis module determines key body areas in the image. Depending on the embodiment, key body areas may include one or more of hair, chest area, face area, midriff area, crotch area, one or more buttocks, buttock area, one or more arms, one or more legs, one or more hands, one or more feet, torso, one or more shoulders, one or more eyes, one or more ears, nose, mouth, neck, waist, one or more hips, one or more thighs, and\/or other distinct regions, anatomical features or set of features. In some embodiments, the set of detected faces F is utilized to generate a set of probable search rectangles S, centered at m*=(m, m) with width w, height hand rotation angle \u03b8for body location. Sample search rectangles are represented in , according to one embodiment.","Key body areas may be determined, in some embodiments, based at least in part on anthropometric measurement of the image. Anthropometric measurements may be generated based at least in part on published anthropometric studies, novel physical measurements, probabilistic determination applied to a plurality of existing imagery, photogrammetric determination applied to a plurality of existing imagery and\/or other methods. In some embodiments, anthropometric data may be used to generate a set of heuristics for these search rectangles, such as in the following manner:\n\n\u2200, calculate , centered at *=(),\n\n\u00d71.5, \u00d72.0, =90.\n","In some embodiments, the system may determine the skin pixels utilizing equation (13) and determine the image moments of these pixels utilizing equation (15), then calculate the least squares linear fit to the convex hull and its angle \u03b2.\n\nIf } and ()\u2248(), then \u03b8=90, \u00d71.5, \u00d73.0\u2003\u2003(H1)\n\nIf } and ()() and )\u00d71.5, \u00d73.0 and calculate \u03b8as angle from () to ()\u2003\u2003(H2)\n\nIf } and ()() and )\u00d71.5, \u00d73.0, \u03b8=\u03b2.\u2003\u2003(H3)\n\nIf }, then \u2200, calculate , centered at (), \u00d71.5, \u00d72.0, \u03b8=\u03b2.\u2003\u2003(H4)\n","Once the angle \u03b8 has been determined, one or more body area rectangles Bmay be generated by the analysis module , which may correspond to the key body areas to be identified in a given embodiment. For example, in the embodiment represented in , three key body area rectangles are determined, specifically, B=chest area, B=midriff area and B=crotch area. According to one embodiment, Bmay be centered at b*=(b, b), with height h, width wand rotation angle \u03c1. (b, b) may be calculated as\n\n*=(()\/\u221a{square root over ()})\u00d7(\u00d7(\u221a{square root over ()}) where 95percentile distance from face to chest\u2003\u2003(19)\n\n\u00d7\u03b3 where \u03b3=95percentile face height\u00d7a scale factor\u2003\u2003(20)\n\n\u00d7\u03b4 where \u03b4=95percentile face width\u00d7a scale factor\u2003\u2003(21)\n\n\u03c1tan()\u2003\u2003(22)\n\n*=(()\/\u221a{square root over ()})\u00d7(\u00d7(\u221a{square root over ()}) where 95percentile distance from face to midriff\u2003\u2003(23)\n\n\u00d7\u03b3 where \u03b3=95percentile face height\u00d7a scale factor\u2003\u2003(24)\n\n\u03c1=\u03b8\u2003\u2003(25)\n\n\u00d7\u03b4 where \u03b4=95percentile face width\u00d7a scale factor (26)\n\n*=(()\/\u221a{square root over ()})\u00d7(\u00d7(\u221a{square root over ()}) where 95percentile distance from face to crotch\u2003\u2003(27)\n\n\u00d7\u03b3 where \u03b3=95percentile face height\u00d7a scale\u2003\u2003(28)\n\n\u00d7\u03b4 where \u03b4=95percentile face width\u00d7a scale factor\u2003\u2003(29)\n\n\u03c1=\u03b8\u2003\u2003(30)\n","Key body areas may be determined based at least in part on one or more of shape, relative mathematical area, anthropometric measurements, and\/or probabilistic detection utilizing one or more machine vision learning algorithms. The key body area determination may include determining key body area location in an image, key body area measurements in an image, key body area skin percentage, key body area orientation in an image, key body area skin density, key body area color, and\/or key body area affine hull.","In some embodiments, individual key body area scores and\/or other key body area determinations may be stored by the image analysis module  in a storage device, such as mass storage device  (discussed below), may be made available for processing by a computer program, and\/or may be presented to a human for a decision, such as via one or more user interfaces. Individual key body area scores and\/or other determinations may be made available to a computer program to present the individual key body area scores to a human for a decision. The decision of the human may be to determine if one or more of a plurality of images may be used for a purpose, such as for use in association with an advertisement. According to some embodiments, as further discussed below, the image analysis module  may determine (based at least in part on the individual key body area scores) a clothing style, clothing color, clothing fabric, and\/or an amount of body area covered by clothing in the image.","In some embodiments, the image analysis module  may alter the image based at least in part on the determined key body area data. Alterations of the image may include, for example, censoring the image by blurring out or overlaying content on portions of key body areas that include a high percentage of skin exposure. Alterations of the image may additionally or alternatively include overlaying or otherwise incorporating image content within the image in order to give the appearance that a human subject in the image is wearing certain clothing or accessories, has body hair, facial hair, skin coloring or tattoos not present in the original received image, and\/or other image changes.","Determine Safety","At block  in the illustrative method, an amount of skin may be determined within the key body areas. For example, at each key body search area, the percentage of skin pixels (\u03bb, i=1, 2, 3) may be calculated. For example, equation (13), as discussed above, may be applied to each pixel within each key body area in order to determine the percentage of pixels within the key body area that correspond to exposed skin. In other embodiments, as discussed above, skin determinations may be made based at least in part on texture analysis. A key body area score may be determined for each key body area based at least in part on the skin area percentage in the key body area. In some embodiments, the key body area score may be based at least in part on a comparison of the determined skin percentage to one or more predetermined thresholds or bands, which may have been previously determined based on acceptable standards and\/or averages of skin exposure present in specific body areas across a number of different images.","At block , an overall image safety score, safety level or other safety result may be determined. The image safety score may be determined, in some embodiments, by combining the key body area scores (which may have been determined at block ) to produce an overall safety score for the image. The key body area scores for one or more specific key body areas may be weighted higher than others in generating the overall safety score. For example, according to one embodiment, the key body area score corresponding to the chest area and buttock area may be given a greater weight than the midriff area. In some embodiments, safety may be determined by a changeable set of heuristics that determine the state of clothing as shown in Table 1. The clothing state \u0394, in some embodiments, may be the logical AND of the key body areas:\n\n\u0394=\u03bb\u2229\u03bb\u2229\u03bb\u2003\u2003(31)\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Safety Rules, according to one embodiment"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"% of skin in key body area"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Clothing State","Chest Area Skin","Midriff Area Skin","Crotch Area Skin"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Clothed","<0.10","<0.01","<0.01"]},{"entry":["Naked",">0.70",">0.70",">0.70"]},{"entry":["Naked or very",">0.85",">0.4","<0.4"]},{"entry":["skimpy",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Topless",">0.85","<0.4","<0.4"]},{"entry":["Lowcut","0.15 < \u03bb\u2266 0.85","<0.10","Any"]},{"entry":["Bikini or",">0.10",">0.0","<0.60"]},{"entry":["bra\/panties",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Bikini top",">0.10","0.0 (e.g. midriff","<0.60"]},{"entry":["or bra",{},"not in image)",{}]},{"entry":["No pants or",">0.10",">0.0",">0.67"]},{"entry":["panties or",{},{},{}]},{"entry":"\u201cmicrobikini\u201d"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A single safety score (or unsafe score, depending on the embodiment) may be stored in a storage device, made available for processing by a computer program and\/or made available to a human for a decision.

In some embodiments, this value may be based at least in part on a determination of the type of clothing being worn in the image (for example, a determination that a bikini is being worn by a human model in the image). In some embodiments, an overall safety score may be compared to an acceptable risk threshold or safety threshold that is specific to a given advertising campaign or other intended potential use of the image. For example, a much stricter safety threshold may be employed when the determination is whether an image is safe for use on a children's website (or for advertising a children's product) than when the determination is whether an image is safe for use on a sports website (or for advertising sporting goods). The given thresholds, heuristics or rules employed by the image analysis module  in a given instance, according to some embodiments, may depend at least in part on a given advertiser interested in placing an advertisement on or near the image, a publisher that hosts the image on a page, a rights holder associated with the image, a specific viewing user, a country or region associated with the given potential user, and\/or other factors.","Sample Image Data Determinations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIGS. 2-6","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","203","150","200","150","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"],"b":["202","200","202","200","150","204","200","202","150","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","302","200","302","150","150","302","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["402","150","404","406","408","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["502","200","502","150","208","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["604","606","608","200","604","606","608","150","150","604","606","608","208","210"]},"Sample Results and Uses","A set of 11,621 random images from the Internet were inspected manually and classified as safe if clothing state=\u201cclothed\u201d or no human form, unknown if clothing state=\u201clowcut\u201d or \u201cbikini or bra\/panties\u201d or \u201cbikini top or bra\u201d and unsafe if clothing state=\u201cNaked\u201d or \u201cTopless\u201d or \u201cnaked or very skimpy\u201d or \u201cno pants or panties or microbikini\u201d. 9483 were deemed safe, 202 were deemed unsafe and 1694 were deemed unknown. A computing system similar to that described herein correctly classified 9453 safe images as safe and classified 30 safe images as unsafe. The computing system correctly classified 1581 images as unknown and classified 113 unknown images as unsafe. The computing system correctly classified 192 unsafe images as unsafe, and classified 10 unsafe images as safe. The probability of false classification as an unsafe image was only 1.3%.
