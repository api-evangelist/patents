Cartridges containing N Fmoc-amino acids (1 mmol) with side chain protection (Arg: 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl; Asp and Glu: tert butyl ester; Asn, Cys, Gln, and His: trityl; Lys and Trp: tert butyloxycarbonyl; Ser, Thr, and Tyr: tert-butyl ether were activated with O benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (1 mmol), 1 hydroxybenzotriazole (1 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (2 mmol) in N methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The activated amino acid was coupled for 30 minutes following removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group with 20% piperidine in NMP. Labeling was accomplished by suspending the resin-bound, N terminally deprotected side-chain protected peptide resin (0.04 mmol) and 6 carboxyfluorescein-NHS ester (57 mg) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (2 mL) containing 0.02 mL diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) and shaking at ambient temperature overnight.

Then, 120 \u03bcL of a mixture containing 10 nM fluorescent Noxa BH3 peptide and 80 nM Mcl-1 protein was added to each well. For each assay, free peptide controls (fluorescent peptide only) and bound peptide controls (fluorescent peptide in the presence of Mcl-1) were included on each assay plate. The plate was mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes. The polarization (in mP) was measured at room temperature with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 530 nm using an Analyst (LJL, Molecular Dynamic, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The percentage inhibition was calculated by % inhibition=100\u00d7(1\u2212(mP\u2212mP)\/(mP\u2212mP)) in which mPis the free peptide control and mPis the bound peptide control.

H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d) \u03b4 8.55 (d, J=5.22 Hz, 1 H), 8.23-8.28 (m, 1 H), 7.85-7.90 (m, 1 H), 7.80-7.85 (m, 2 H), 7.49-7.57 (m, 3 H), 7.45-7.49 (m, 1 H), 7.38-7.43 (m, 1 H), 7.19 (d, J=7.67 Hz, 1 H), 7.10-7.15 (m, 1 H), 6.92 (t, J=7.67 Hz, 2 H), 5.65 (d, J=17.49 Hz, 1 H), 5.44 (d, J=17.80 Hz, 1 H), 4.26 (t, J=5.98 Hz, 2 H), 3.62 (s, 3 H), 3.35-3.49 (m, 2 H), 2.24-2.32 (m, 2 H), 1.67 (s, 3 H), 1.59 (s, 3 H).","To a solution of ethyl 7-bromo-3-(3-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)propyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (2.39 g, prepared in a similar manner as described herein) in N,N-dimethylamide (20 mL) was added 1-(chloromethyl)-4-methoxybenzene (1.0 g) and CsCO(5.16 g). The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with ether (300 mL) and water (200 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ether. The combined extracts were washed with water (\u00d73), brine and dried over NaSO. Concentration gave Example 581A.","To a solution of EXAMPLE 581A (1 g) in oxalyl chloride (10 mL) was added a few drops of N,N-dimethylamide. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml) and added to cooled (0\u00b0 C.) concentrated NHHO (30 ml). After the addition, the mixture was stirred for 2 hours before extraction with ethyl acetate (200 ml). The organic extract was washed with water, brine and dried over NaSO. After filtration, evaporation of solvent gave Example 581B.","To a cooled (0\u00b0 C.) solution of EXAMPLE 581B (545 mg) in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) and dichloromethane (1 ml) was added triethylamine (1 ml) followed by trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml) dropwise. After the addition, the mixture was stirred for 3 hours at 0\u00b0 C. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and water (80 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ether. The combined organic extracts were washed with water (\u00d73), brine and dried over NaSO. After filtration, concentration of the solvent gave Example 581C.","To a mixture of EXAMPLE 581C (300 mg) and o-tolylboronic acid (93 mg) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (10 ml) and methanol (5 ml) was added tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (33 mg) and CsF (260 mg). The mixture was stirred at reflux under nitrogen for 4 hours. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate (300 mL) and water (100 ml). The aqueous layer was further extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts were washed with water, brine and dried over NaSO. After filtration, concentration of the solvent and column purification (5 to 10% ethyl acetate in hexane) gave Example 581D.","To a mixture of EXAMPLE 581D (232 mg) in N,N-dimethylamide (10 ml) was added NaN(281 mg) and NHCl (231 mg). The mixture was stirred at reflux overnight. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate (200 ml) and water (60 ml). The organic phase was washed with brine and dried over NaSO. Concentration of the solvent gave crude product which was dissolved in dichloromethane\/trifluoroacetic acid (1:1, 4 ml) and heated to 125\u00b0 C. in a microwave (CEM Discover) for 20 minutes. The mixture was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimehtylsulfoxide\/methanol (1\/1,2 ml) and loaded on HPLC for purification.
