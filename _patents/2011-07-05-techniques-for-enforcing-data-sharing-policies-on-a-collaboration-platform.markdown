The second user may be subscribed to follow a third user, a link may be established from a node of the third user to the node of the second user to demonstrate a subscription relationship between the second user and the third user. Subsequently, the first user may be subscribed to follow the third user via the second user. The sharing graph may be formed in a chart display or a diagram display, comprising, but not limited to, organizational chart, tree chart or tree diagram, network diagram, flow chart, cartogram chart, pedigree chart, histogram chart, bar chart, pie chart, line chart, timeline chart, and other types of displays to demonstrate a subscription relationship between various users of an entity.","The enforcement module  may comprise at least one computer processor to enforce data sharing policies of the proxy policy enforcement system . The enforcement module  may enforce data sharing policies based at least in part on the data sharing policies stored in the data sharing policy module  and\/or user profiles stored in the asset and profile module . For example, the enforcement module  may provide approval or denial of a first user to follow a second user. The enforcement module  may receive a subscription request from a first user to follow a second user. The enforcement module  may access the user profile of the asset and profile module  to determine whether the first user may subscribe to follow the second user. The enforcement module  may approve the subscription request from the first user to follow the second user if the first user is authorized to access data that the second user is authorized to access. The enforcement module  may use the subscriber identification to identify and determine data sharing policies for the subscriber to the collaboration platform  via the proxy policy enforcement system . For example, the enforcement module  may identify data authorization associated with the first user and the second user from the user profile of the asset and profile module . The enforcement module  may approve the subscription request if the first user having management authorization is authorized to access general classification data that the second user having generalization authorization is authorized to access. The enforcement module  may approve the subscription request if the first user having administrative authorization is authorized to access administrative classification data that the second user having administrative authorization is authorized to access. The enforcement module  may deny the subscription request if the first user having management authorization is not authorized to access secret classification data that the second user having secret authorization is authorized to access. The enforcement module  may deny the subscription if the first user having administrative authorization is not authorized to access accounting classification data that the second user having accounting authorization is authorized to access.","The enforcement module  may determine whether pre-existing followers of a first user is authorized to access data that the second user is authorized to access. The enforcement module  may access sharing graph of the asset and profile module  to determine one or more pre-existing followers of the first user. For example, a first user (e.g., top secret authorization) may be approved to follow a second user (e.g., management authorization) because the first user is authorized to access management classification data that the second user is authorized to access.
