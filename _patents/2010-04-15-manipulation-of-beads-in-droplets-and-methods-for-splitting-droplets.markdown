The government has certain rights in the invention.","Droplet actuators are used to conduct a wide variety of droplet operations. A droplet actuator typically includes two substrates separated by a gap. The substrates include electrodes for conducting droplet operations. The space is typically filled with a filler fluid that is immiscible with the fluid that is to be manipulated on the droplet actuator. The formation and movement of droplets is controlled by electrodes for conducting a variety of droplet operations, such as droplet transport and droplet dispensing. There is a need for improvements to droplet actuators that facilitate handling of droplets with beads.","The invention provides a method of dispersing or circulating magnetically responsive beads within a droplet in a droplet actuator. The invention, in one embodiment, makes use of a droplet actuator with a plurality of droplet operations electrodes configured to transport the droplet, and a magnet field present at a portion of the plurality of droplet operations electrodes. A bead bead-containing droplet is provided on the droplet actuator in the presence of the uniform magnetic field. Beads are circulated in the droplet during incubation by conducting droplet operations on the droplet within a uniform region of the magnetic field. Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description of the invention.","As used herein, the following terms have the meanings indicated.","\u201cActivate\u201d with reference to one or more electrodes means effecting a change in the electrical state of the one or more electrodes which results in a droplet operation.","\u201cBead,\u201d with respect to beads on a droplet actuator, means any bead or particle that is capable of interacting with a droplet on or in proximity with a droplet actuator. Beads may be any of a wide variety of shapes, such as spherical, generally spherical, egg shaped, disc shaped, cubical and other three dimensional shapes. The bead may, for example, be capable of being transported in a droplet on a droplet actuator or otherwise configured with respect to a droplet actuator in a manner which permits a droplet on the droplet actuator to be brought into contact with the bead, on the droplet actuator and\/or off the droplet actuator. Beads may be manufactured using a wide variety of materials, including for example, resins, and polymers. The beads may be any suitable size, including for example, microbeads, microparticles, nanobeads and nanoparticles. In some cases, beads are magnetically responsive; in other cases beads are not significantly magnetically responsive. For magnetically responsive beads, the magnetically responsive material may constitute substantially all of a bead or one component only of a bead. The remainder of the bead may include, among other things, polymeric material, coatings, and moieties which permit attachment of an assay reagent. Examples of suitable magnetically responsive beads are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005-0260686, entitled, \u201cMultiplex flow assays preferably with magnetic particles as solid phase,\u201d published on Nov. 24, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for its teaching concerning magnetically responsive materials and beads.

For example, a droplet may be completely surrounded by filler fluid or may be bounded by filler fluid and one or more surfaces of the droplet actuator. Droplets may, for example, be aqueous or non-aqueous or may be mixtures or emulsions including aqueous and non-aqueous components. Droplets may take a wide variety of shapes; nonlimiting examples include generally disc shaped, slug shaped, truncated sphere, ellipsoid, spherical, partially compressed sphere, hemispherical, ovoid, cylindrical, and various shapes formed during droplet operations, such as merging or splitting or formed as a result of contact of such shapes with one or more surfaces of a droplet actuator.","\u201cDroplet Actuator\u201d means a device for manipulating droplets.

Methods of the invention may be executed using droplet actuator systems, e.g., as described in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2007\/009379, entitled \u201cDroplet manipulation systems,\u201d filed on May 9, 2007. In various embodiments, the manipulation of droplets by a droplet actuator may be electrode mediated, e.g., electrowetting mediated or dielectrophoresis mediated.","\u201cDroplet operation\u201d means any manipulation of a droplet on a droplet actuator. A droplet operation may, for example, include: loading a droplet into the droplet actuator; dispensing one or more droplets from a source droplet; splitting, separating or dividing a droplet into two or more droplets; transporting a droplet from one location to another in any direction; merging or combining two or more droplets into a single droplet; diluting a droplet; mixing a droplet; agitating a droplet; deforming a droplet; retaining a droplet in position; incubating a droplet; heating a droplet; vaporizing a droplet; condensing a droplet from a vapor; cooling a droplet; disposing of a droplet; transporting a droplet out of a droplet actuator; other droplet operations described herein; and\/or any combination of the foregoing. The terms \u201cmerge,\u201d \u201cmerging,\u201d \u201ccombine,\u201d \u201ccombining\u201d and the like are used to describe the creation of one droplet from two or more droplets. It should be understood that when such a term is used in reference to two or more droplets, any combination of droplet operations sufficient to result in the combination of the two or more droplets into one droplet may be used. For example, \u201cmerging droplet A with droplet B,\u201d can be achieved by transporting droplet A into contact with a stationary droplet B, transporting droplet B into contact with a stationary droplet A, or transporting droplets A and B into contact with each other. The terms \u201csplitting,\u201d \u201cseparating\u201d and \u201cdividing\u201d are not intended to imply any particular outcome with respect to size of the resulting droplets (i.e., the size of the resulting droplets can be the same or different) or number of resulting droplets (the number of resulting droplets may be 2, 3, 4, 5 or more). The term \u201cmixing\u201d refers to droplet operations which result in more homogenous distribution of one or more components within a droplet. Examples of \u201cloading\u201d droplet operations include microdialysis loading, pressure assisted loading, robotic loading, passive loading, and pipette loading. In various embodiments, the droplet operations may be electrode mediated, e.g., electrowetting mediated or dielectrophoresis mediated.","\u201cFiller fluid\u201d means a fluid associated with a droplet operations substrate of a droplet actuator, which fluid is sufficiently immiscible with a droplet phase to render the droplet phase subject to electrode-mediated droplet operations. The filler fluid may, for example, be a low-viscosity oil, such as silicone oil. Other examples of filler fluids are provided in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2006\/047486, entitled, \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006; and in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2008\/072604, entitled \u201cUse of additives for enhancing droplet actuation,\u201d filed on Aug. 8, 2008.","\u201cImmobilize\u201d with respect to magnetically responsive beads, means that the beads are substantially restrained in position in a droplet or in filler fluid on a droplet actuator. For example, in one embodiment, substantially immobilized beads are sufficiently restrained in position to permit execution of a splitting operation on a droplet, yielding one droplet with substantially all of the beads and one droplet substantially lacking in the beads.","\u201cMagnetically responsive\u201d means responsive to a magnetic field. \u201cMagnetically responsive beads\u201d include or are composed of magnetically responsive materials. Examples of magnetically responsive materials include paramagnetic materials, ferromagnetic materials, ferrimagnetic materials, and metamagnetic materials. Examples of suitable paramagnetic materials include iron, nickel, and cobalt, as well as metal oxides, such as FeO, BaFeO, CoO, NiO, MnO, CrO, and CoMnP.","\u201cWashing\u201d with respect to washing a magnetically responsive bead means reducing the amount and\/or concentration of one or more substances in contact with the magnetically responsive bead or exposed to the magnetically responsive bead from a droplet in contact with the magnetically responsive bead. The reduction in the amount and\/or concentration of the substance may be partial, substantially complete, or even complete. The substance may be any of a wide variety of substances; examples include target substances for further analysis, and unwanted substances, such as components of a sample, contaminants, and\/or excess reagent. In some embodiments, a washing operation begins with a starting droplet in contact with a magnetically responsive bead, where the droplet includes an initial amount and initial concentration of a substance. The washing operation may proceed using a variety of droplet operations. The washing operation may yield a droplet including the magnetically responsive bead, where the droplet has a total amount and\/or concentration of the substance which is less than the initial amount and\/or concentration of the substance. Other embodiments are described elsewhere herein, and still others will be immediately apparent in view of the present disclosure.","The terms \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d are used throughout the description with reference to the top and bottom substrates of the droplet actuator for convenience only, since the droplet actuator is functional regardless of its position in space.","When a liquid in any form (e.g., a droplet or a continuous body, whether moving or stationary) is described as being \u201con\u201d, \u201cat\u201d, or \u201cover\u201d an electrode, array, matrix or surface, such liquid could be either in direct contact with the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface, or could be in contact with one or more layers or films that are interposed between the liquid and the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface.","When a droplet is described as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cloaded on\u201d a droplet actuator, it should be understood that the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates using the droplet actuator to conduct one or more droplet operations on the droplet, the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates sensing of a property of or a signal from the droplet, and\/or the droplet has been subjected to a droplet operation on the droplet actuator.","The invention provides droplet actuators having specialized configurations for manipulation of droplets including beads and\/or for manipulation of beads in droplets. In certain embodiments, the droplet actuators of the invention include magnets and\/or physical barriers manipulation of droplets including beads and\/or for manipulation of beads in droplets. The invention also includes methods of manipulating of droplets including beads and\/or for manipulation of beads in droplets, as well as methods of making and using the droplet actuators of the invention. The droplet actuators of the invention are useful for, among other things, conducting assays for qualitatively and\/or quantitatively analyzing one or more components of a droplet. Examples of such assays include affinity based assays, such as immunoassays; enzymatic assays; and nucleic acid assays. Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing discussion.","7.1 Incubation of Beads","In certain embodiments, the invention provides droplet actuators and methods for incubating beads. For example, a sample including bead-containing antibodies may be incubated on the droplet actuator in order to permit one or more target components to bind to the antibodies. Examples of target components include analytes; contaminants; cells, such as bacteria and protozoa; tissues; and organisms, such as multicellular parasites. In the presence of a magnet, magnetic beads in the droplet may be substantially immobilized and may fail to circulate throughout the droplet. The invention provides various droplet manipulations during incubation of droplets on a droplet actuator in order to increase circulation of beads within the droplet and\/or circulation of droplet contents surrounding beads. It will be appreciated that in the various embodiments described below employing magnetically responsive beads, beads that are not substantially magnetically responsive may also be included in the droplets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , each step is illustrated on a path of electrodes . A magnet  is associated with a subset of electrodes . Magnet  is arranged relative to the electrodes  such that a subset of electrodes  are within a uniform region of the magnetic field produced by magnet . Bead clumping is reduced when the droplet is present in this uniform region.","In Step , droplet  is located atop magnet . Beads  are substantially immobilized in a distributed fashion adjacent to the droplet operations surface. The beads are generally less clumped than they would be in the presence of a non-uniform region of the magnetic field. In Step  droplet  is split using droplet operations into two sub-droplets A, B. During the splitting operation beads and liquid are circulated within the droplets , A and B. In Step  Droplets A and B are merged using droplet operations into a single droplet . This merging operation is accomplished within the uniform region of the magnetic field. During the merging operation beads and liquid are further circulated within the droplets , A and B.","In Step , droplet  is transported using droplet operations along electrodes  away from the magnet . As droplet  moves away from magnet , beads  are pulled to the edge of droplet  that nearest the magnet . Movement of beads  within droplet  provides further beneficial circulation of beads and liquid within the droplet . In Step , droplet  is transported using droplet operations back to the step  position. Beads  within the droplet  are again dispersed in the presence of the uniform magnetic field of magnet . This redistribution of beads, as droplet  returns to its position within the uniform region of the magnetic field provides further beneficial circulation of beads and liquid within the droplet .","These steps may be conducted in any logical order. Each step may be conducted any number of times between the other steps. For example, Steps - may be repeated multiple times before moving onto Step . Similarly, Steps - may be repeated multiple times before returning to Steps -. Moreover, all steps are not required. For example, in one embodiment, an incubation step in an assay is accomplished by repeating Steps -. In another embodiment, an incubation step in an assay is accomplished by repeating Steps -.","The incubation method of the invention is useful for enhancing circulation of magnetically responsive beads with the liquid in a droplet while the droplet remains in the presence of a magnetic field. Among other advantages, the approach may reduce bead clumping and permit tighter droplet actuator designs making more efficient use of droplet actuator real estate.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a droplet operations incubation scheme, that does not allow magnetically responsive beads to be introduced into a region of the magnetic field which is sufficiently non-uniform to cause bead clumping. In another embodiment, the invention provides a merge-and-split incubation scheme, that does not allow magnetically responsive beads to be introduced into a region of the magnetic field which is sufficiently non-uniform to cause bead clumping. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a droplet transport incubation scheme, that does not allow magnetically responsive beads to be introduced into a region of the magnetic field which is sufficiently non-uniform to cause bead clumping.","Any combination of droplet operations which result in effective mixing (e.g., substantially complete mixing) may be chosen. Mixing is complete when it is sufficient for conducting the analysis being undertaken. The droplet may be oscillated in the presence of the uniform region of the magnetic field by transporting the droplet back and forth within the uniform region. In some cases, electrode sizes used for the oscillation may be varied to increase circulation within the droplet. In some cases, droplet operations electrodes are used to effect droplet operations to transport a droplet back and forth or in one or more looping patterns. Preferably the oscillation pattern does not allow to be introduced into a region of the magnetic field which is sufficiently uniform to cause bead clumping.","In some cases, droplet operations are performed at an edge of the magnet to more equally redistribute the magnetically responsive beads.

This approach reduces, preferably entirely eliminates, the need to transport the magnetically responsive bead droplet over long distances to the detector and also reduces, preferably entirely eliminates, the possibility of loss of beads during the transport operation.","Alternatively the antibody-antigen-enzyme complex can be released from the bead by chemical or other means into the supernatant. The beads may then be substantially immobilized and the supernatant processed further for detection.","Additionally, the same split, merge, and transport strategies that are explained for incubating beads\/antibodies\/sample mixture may be employed here also for incubating substrate and assayed beads.","Bead based sandwich or competitive affinity assays, such as ELISAs, may be performed using the procedures described in this application in conjunction with various steps described in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US 06\/47486, entitled \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006. Further, after incubation, unbound sample material and excess reporter antibody or reporter ligand may be washed away from the bead-antibody-antigen complex using various droplet operations. A droplet of substrate (e.g., alkaline phosphatase substrate, APS-5) may be delivered to the bead-antibody-antigen complex. During incubation, the substrate is converted to product which begins to chemiluminesce. The decay of the product (which generates light) is sufficiently slow that the substrate-product droplet can be separated from the alkaline phosphatase-antibody complex and still retain a measurable signal. After an incubation period of the substrate with the bead-antibody-antigen complex (seconds to minutes), the magnetically responsive bead-antibody-antigen complex may be retained with a magnetic field (e.g., see U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/900,653, filed on Feb. 9, 2007, entitled \u201cImmobilization of magnetically-responsive beads during droplet operations,\u201d) or by a physical barrier (e.g., see U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/881,674, filed on Jan. 22, 2007, entitled \u201cSurface-assisted fluid loading and droplet dispensing,\u201d the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) and only the substrate\u2014product droplet may be presented (using droplet operations) to the sensor (e.g., PMT) for quantitation of the product.","The substrate-product droplet alone is sufficient to generate a signal proportional to the amount of antigen in the sample. Incubation of the substrate with the magnetically responsive bead-antibody-antigen complex produces enough product that can be quantitated when separated from the enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase). By measuring the product in this manner, the bead-antibody-antigen complex does not have to be presented to the PMT. There are no beads or proteins to \u201cfoul\u201d the detector area as they are never moved to this area. Also the product droplet does not have to oscillate over the detector to keep beads in suspension during quantitation. The droplet volume may also be reduced in the absence of beads. Detection of the bead-antibody-antigen complex may employ a slug of liquid (e.g., 4 droplets) to move the complex, whereas with the beadless method the droplet could be smaller (e.g., less than 4 droplets).
