{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE","BRIEF DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The exemplary embodiment relates to a system and method for secure federation of print devices in a cloud printing environment. While the systems and methods described herein relate to cloud print services, it will be appreciated that the described techniques may find application in other printing environments or other networks.","Traditionally, printing is done behind a firewall using either network connected or locally connected devices, where document submission, conversion and printing happen in the same environment. With the rapid emergence of cloud-based printing options, some or all of the activities are moving to a remote network of computers and servers, commonly referred to as \u201cthe cloud.\u201d For example, the cloud can perform document conversion, instead of having the device that submitted the print job perform the conversion. This can free resources, such as processing power, on the submitting device. Also, users of mobile devices (or other users that want to print to the cloud) would like to do so by connecting to a printer without installing a driver (e.g. by emailing a file, web submission of a file to a print device connected to the cloud).","Typically, mobile print providers expose a variety of options to access personal and commercial printing devices, as well as document submission methods. While doing so, mobile print providers may rely on application programming interfaces (APIs) that rely on proprietary and\/or custom interfaces. Also, each provider's cloud database may contain the complete list of devices and the respective capabilities of the devices. As a result, a given API is limited and locked to a specific print provider.","The following references, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, are mentioned:","1.

The method also includes receiving selection data corresponding to a cloud print service selected from among the federation of one or more additional trusted cloud print services, and retrieving, from the selected additional trusted cloud print service, data representative of at least one document processing device registered in accordance with the received identification data. In addition, the method includes receiving selection data corresponding to a selected document processing device associated with the selected cloud print service, and communicating job data representative of a document processing operation to the selected document processing device for processing.","In some illustrative embodiments disclosed as illustrative examples herein, a method for federating document processing devices among cloud print services includes, with a processor receiving a request to initiate cloud printing by a primary cloud printing service, the request comprising at least one of identification data and location data, and querying at least one additional trusted cloud print service in accordance with the received at least one of identification data and location data for at least one document processing device available in accordance therewith. The method also includes aggregating data representing one or more available document processing devices on each cloud printing service in response to the query thereof by the primary cloud print service, and receiving selection data corresponding to a selected document processing device from among the one or more available document processing devices. In addition, the method includes communicating job data representative of a document processing operation to the selected document processing device for processing thereon.","In some illustrative embodiments disclosed as illustrative examples herein, a system for federating document processing devices among cloud print services includes a processor, memory that stores data representing trusted relationships among one or more cloud print services, and a communications interface operative to communicate data among the one or more cloud print services. The memory is in communication with the processor, which stores instructions which are executed by the processor for establishing a trusted relationship with at least one additional cloud print service via the communications interface, and for receiving a request to initiate cloud printing, wherein the request includes at least one of identification data and location data.

According to one embodiment, the communications interface module  facilitates communication with one or more like systems, located across varying networks, clouds, communications links, and the like. The communications module  is configured, to communicate with one or more cloud printing services  with which the system  may be in a trusted relationship. The communications module  further facilitates the establishment of trusted relationships  via the exchange of security certificates , so as to enable secure communications therebetween.","The system  also includes registered device data  and publically available device data . The registered device data  corresponds to document processing devices associated with specific identification data , as discussed in greater detail below. According to one embodiment, the registered device data  may include the location and capabilities, as well as authorizations associated with a specific document processing device with which the system  is in data communication. The publically available device data , according to one embodiment, corresponds to an identification of one or more document processing devices in data communication with the system  which may be available for use by non-registered users, as discussed above. The memory  of the system  further stores location data  corresponding to a physical location the document processing devices associated with the registered device data  and the publically available device data . It will be appreciated that suitable location data  may include, for example and without limitation, GPS coordinates, address, floor, or other such information that indicates the location of such devices.","The communications module  is further configured to receive requests  from an associated user device (not shown) corresponding to the use of cloud printing services facilitated by the system . In accordance with one embodiment of the subject application, such request data  includes identification data associated with a user initiating the request and location data corresponding to the physical location of the user initiating the request. Upon receipt of the request via the communications module , the processor  analyzes the trusted service data  to ascertain those cloud services with which the system  has a trusted relationship. The processor  then enables an aggregation module  to aggregate all cloud services available for responding to the received request data . The aggregation module , via operations of the processor , generates federation data  representing a federated list of cloud services available for responding to the request data . The communications module  returns this federated data  to the requesting device for selection of one of the cloud services .","Once selection of a cloud service  has been received via the communications module , the cloud service  is contacted for a list of registered devices  associated with the identification data . The system  then facilitates, via the communications module , communicating the registered devices  to the requesting device for selection. After selection, the communications module  enables the communication of job data  to the selected device on the selected cloud service . Status data  is received during processing of the job data  and made available to the requesting device via operations of the communications interface module .","In the event that the request  corresponds only to a request for a document processing device that is proximate to the user, i.e., the user does not request a particular cloud service , the processor , via the communications module , queries each trusted cloud print service  using the received location data  for any corresponding document processing devices. According to one embodiment, the query also includes a request for those devices that are publically available for use in accordance with stored availability data . The device data returned in response to the query is then aggregated by the aggregation module  so as to generate federation data . The federation data  is then communicated to the requesting device via the communications module . Thus, the available document processing devise are presented to the requesting device independent of their respective association to any particular cloud service . Upon selection of a device, the processor , via operations of the communication module , communicates job data  to the cloud service  on which resides the selected device. The job associated with the job data  is then processed, with status data  returned via the communications module  and made available to the requesting device.","It will be appreciated that variants of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be combined into many other different systems or applications.
