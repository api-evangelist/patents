title: Producing a ranking for pages using distances in a web-link graph
abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for producing a ranking for pages on the web. In one aspect, a system receives a set of pages to be ranked, wherein the set of pages are interconnected with links. The system also receives a set of seed pages which include outgoing links to the set of pages. The system then assigns lengths to the links based on properties of the links and properties of the pages attached to the links. The system next computes shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each page in the set of pages based on the lengths of the links between the pages. Next, the system determines a ranking score for each page in the set of pages based on the computed shortest distances. The system then produces a ranking for the set of pages based on the ranking scores for the set of pages.

Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to techniques for ranking pages on the web. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for producing a ranking for pages on the web by computing shortest distances from a set of seed pages to each of the pages to be ranked, wherein the seed pages and the pages to be ranked are interconnected with links.","2. Related Art","The relentless growth of the Internet has been largely fueled by the development of sophisticated search engines, which enable users to comb through billions of web pages looking for specific pages of interest. Because a given query can return millions of search results it is important to be able to rank these search results to present high-quality results to the user.","A popular search engine developed by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. uses PageRank\u00ae as a page-quality metric for efficiently guiding the processes of web crawling, index selection, and web page ranking. Generally, the PageRank technique computes and assigns a PageRank score to each web page it encounters on the web, wherein the PageRank score serves as a measure of the relative quality of a given web page with respect to other web pages. PageRank generally ensures that important and high-quality web pages receive high PageRank scores, which enables a search engine to efficiently rank the search results based on their associated PageRank scores.","PageRank scores are computed based on the web link-graph structure, wherein the web pages are the nodes of the link-graph which are interconnected with hyperlinks. In this model, PageRank R for a given web page p can be computed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mi":["p","P"],"mo":"\u2208"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"d"}},{"mi":"d","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"q"}},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"q"},"mi":"out"}}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}],"mo":[",",","]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"out "},"However, the simple formulation of Equation (1) for computing the PageRank is vulnerable to manipulations. Some web pages (called \u201cspam pages\u201d) can be designed to use various techniques to obtain artificially inflated PageRanks, for example, by forming \u201clink farms\u201d or creating \u201cloops.\u201d","One possible variation of PageRank that would reduce the effect of these techniques is to select a few \u201ctrusted\u201d pages (also referred to as the seed pages) and discovers other pages which are likely to be good by following the links from the trusted pages. For example, the technique can use a set of high quality seed pages (s, s, s), and for each seed page i=1, 2, . . . , n, the system can iteratively compute the PageRank scores for the set of the web pages P using the formulae:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["s","i"]},"mo":"\u2260","mi":"p"},"mo":"\u2208","mi":"P"}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}},{"mi":"d","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"q"}},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"q"},"mi":"out"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}}}}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":[",",","]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["i","i"]},"Generally, it is desirable to use large number of seed pages to accommodate the different languages and a wide range of fields which are contained in the fast growing web contents. Unfortunately, this variation of PageRank requires solving the entire system for each seed separately. Hence, as the number of seed pages increases, the complexity of computation increases linearly, thereby limiting the number of seeds that can be practically used.","Hence, what is needed is a method and an apparatus for producing a ranking for pages on the web using a large number of diversified seed pages without the problems of the above-described techniques.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that produces a ranking for pages on the web. During operation, the system receives a set of pages to be ranked, wherein the set of pages are interconnected with links. The system also receives a set of seed pages which include outgoing links to the set of pages. The system then assigns lengths to the links based on properties of the links and properties of the pages attached to the links. The system next computes shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each page in the set of pages based on the lengths of the links between the pages. Next, the system determines a ranking score for each page in the set of pages based on the computed shortest distances.

Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

This includes, but is not limited to, magnetic and optical storage devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact discs), DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), or any device capable of storing data usable by a computer system.","Overview","One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that ranks pages on the web based on distances between the pages, wherein the pages are interconnected with links to form a link-graph. More specifically, a set of high-quality seed pages are chosen as references for ranking the pages in the link-graph, and shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each given page in the link-graph are computed. Each of the shortest distances is obtained by summing lengths of a set of links which follows the shortest path from a seed page to a given page, wherein the length of a given link is assigned to the link based on properties of the link and properties of the page attached to the link. The computed shortest distances are then used to determine the ranking scores of the associated pages.","a Link-Graph and Seed Pages",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"As illustrated in , the collection of pages is classified into two subsets of pages: a set of seed pages , and a set of non-seed pages . Seed pages (hereinafter referred to as \u201cseeds\u201d)  form the \u201croot\u201d nodes of link-graph , which comprise: seed , seed , and seed . Although for simplicity  is described in the context of three seeds, generally the present invention can use much more than three seeds. Note that seeds  are interconnected with link  and link .","Non-seed pages  include pages -, wherein each page is either directly or indirectly connected to one or more seeds through the links in the link-graph. In one embodiment of the present invention, seeds  are specially selected high-quality pages which provide good web connectivity to other non-seed pages.","More specifically, to ensure that other high-quality pages are easily reachable from seeds , seeds in seeds  need to be reliable, diverse to cover a wide range of fields of public interests, as well as well-connected with other pages (i.e., having a large number of outgoing links). For example, Google Directory and The New York Times are both good seeds which possess such properties. It is typically assumed that these seeds are also \u201ccloser\u201d to other high-quality pages on the web. In addition, seeds with large number of useful outgoing links facilitate identifying other useful and high-quality pages, thereby acting as \u201chubs\u201d on the web.","One approach for choosing seeds involves selecting a diverse set of trusted seeds. Choosing a more diverse set of seeds can shorten the paths from the seeds to a given page. Hence, it would be desirable to have a largest possible set of seeds that include as many different types of seeds as possible. However, because selecting the seeds involves a human manually identifying these high-quality pages, the total number of the seeds is typically limited. Moreover, having too many seeds can make the selected seeds vulnerable to manipulation. Consequently, the actual number of the selected set of seeds is limited.","As illustrated in , a link from a seed to a page is represented by an arrow pointing from the seed to the page. For example, seed  links to page  and page  through links  and , respectively. Such links assert a \u201csupport\u201d from the seed to the linked pages.","The set of non-seed pages  are also interconnected with links. For example, page  has three outgoing links , , and , which target at pages ,  and , respectively. Furthermore, page  has two outgoing links  and , which connect to pages  and , respectively. Additionally, page  links to page  through link  as shown.","Note that pages ,  and  form a loop, wherein these pages point to each other in a circular manner though links , , and . Furthermore, page  and page  also form a loop in which they point to each other through links  and .","Note that even though there is no direct link from seed  to page , page  is reachable from seed  via three distinct paths which are highlighted: (1) seed  <link > page  <link > page ; (2) seed  <link > page  <link > page ; and (3) seed  <link > page  <link > page  <link > page . We are interested in determining a \u201cshortest\u201d path from seed  to page  among all of these possible paths, wherein the shortest path will be subsequently used to determine a ranking score for page . Note however that, the illustrated lengths of the links in  are not related to the metric which is used to determine the \u201clengths\u201d of the links in computing the shortest path. We will discuss how to compute the lengths of the links below.","Using a Large Number of Seeds","In one embodiment of the present invention, a large number of reliable international seed pages s, s, . . . , sare used to compute the PageRank scores. For each i=1, 2, . . . , n, we would like to calculate PageRank Rbased on Equation (2), and set the final PageRank for a page p in the set of pages P to be:\n\n()=_max(),\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere k is a positive integer between 1 and n, and k_max represents the klargest value.\n","With a large set of seeds, one may want to promote some seeds and demote others. This can be done by assigning each seed san optional positive weight w(which has a default value of 1), and modifying (3) by:\n\n()=_max()\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Note that using the klargest ranking score facilitates suppressing unfairly high scores due to lack of proportionality at the vicinity of the seeds. In practice, it is sufficient to choose k to be a small integer, for example, 3, 4, 5, or 6.","So far, we have ignored the complexity issues from using the large set of seeds. Next, we will discuss how to reduce the complexity of Equation (3), or (4).","Converting Weight to Length and Distance","To compute distances between pages in link-graph , we need to assign a \u201clength\u201d to every link. The length of a link can be a function of any set of properties of the link and the source of the link. These properties can include, but are not limited to, the link's position, the link's font, and the source page's out-degree.","Referring to Equation (2), for each link q\u2192p, the contribution of page q to page p with respect to seed scan be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["C","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"q"}},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"q"},"mi":"out"}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"i "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["s","i"]},"mo":"\u2260","mi":"p"},"mo":"\u2208","mi":"P"}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mi":"max","mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":","}}}},{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"munder":{"mi":"max","mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"q"}},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"q"},"mi":"out"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}}},"mo":"."}}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}}},"Note that Equation (6) provides a reasonable approximation of the PageRank for p.","Let s, s, . . . , sbe a set of seed pages, and for every 1\u2266i\u2266n, let wbe an optional positive weight (with default value of 1), we can approximate the PageRank of page p in the set of pages P with respect to the set of seeds s as:\n\n\u22001()=;\u2003\u2003(7)\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2200","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2264","\u2264"],"mi":["i","n"]}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["s","i"]},"mo":"\u2260","mi":"p"},"mo":"\u2208","mi":"P"},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"p"}},{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"munder":{"mi":"max","mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"q"}},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"q"},"mi":"out"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}}}}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":";"}],"mo":[",",","]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"8"}}]}}}},"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["p\u03b5P, R","p","k","R","p"],"sub":["i=1, . . . n","i"]},"Next, for each link q\u2192p, we define the length of the link to be:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"L","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"d"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"q"},"mi":"out"},"mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","p"],"mo":"\u2192"}}}}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"10"}}]}}}}},"Note that the length equation (10) includes a term log(|q|), so that the length of the link increases as the number of outgoing links from the source page q increases.

Finally, the system produces a ranking for the set of pages based on the ranking scores for the set of pages (step ). Note that however, not all the pages in the set of pages receive ranking scores through this process. For example, a page that cannot be reached by any of the seed pages will not be ranked.","Note that the results from above ranking process can be used for seed tuning. Specifically, the ranking process produces lists of the nearest seeds and the lengths of the shortest paths for all the ranked pages. The system can process these results to extract information for each of the seeds with respect to the ranked pages. Next, the system can use this information to evaluate the quality and the contribution of the seeds, and then modify the list of seeds and\/or the weights of the seeds based on this information.","A Reduced Link-Graph","Note that the links participating in the k shortest paths from the seeds to the pages constitute a sub-graph that includes all the links that are \u201cflow\u201d ranked from the seeds. Although this sub-graph includes much less links than the original link-graph, the k shortest paths from the seeds to each page in this sub-graph have the same lengths as the paths in the original graph. For each page p, the maximum number of links to page p in this sub-graph is at most k. Furthermore, the rank flow to each page can be backtracked to the nearest k seeds through the paths in this sub-graph.","Crawling Ranking and Searching Processes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["304","302","308","304","305","308"]},"During a subsequent search process, a search engine  receives a query  from a user  through a web browser . This query  specifies a number of terms to be searched for in the set of documents. In response to query , search engine  uses the ranking information to identify highly-ranked documents that satisfy the query. Search engine  then returns a response  through web browser , wherein the response  contains matching pages along with ranking information and references to the identified documents.","Note that the application of the present invention is not limited to the web and web pages.
