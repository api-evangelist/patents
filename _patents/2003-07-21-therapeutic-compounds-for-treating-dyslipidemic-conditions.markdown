Low HDL levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and related conditions such as ischemic stroke. Therefore, increasing the expression of the ABCA1 gene would be expected to increase HDL levels and decrease the occurrence of atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and related conditions such as ischemic stroke. It has been reported that expression of the ABCA1 gene is increased by cholesterol loading of cells (Langmann et al., 257, 29\u201333 (1999)). LXR\u03b1 is a nuclear receptor that is required for the induction of cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase in mouse liver following cholesterol feeding (Peet et al., 93, 693\u2013704 (1998)). LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2 are activated by 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol and other oxysterols (Janowski et al. 96, 266\u2013271 (1999), Thomas A. Spencer et al. 44, 886\u2013897, (2001)). Some non-steroidal small molecule agonists of LYR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2 have been reported to affect circulating HDL levels, cholesterol absorption, reverse cholesterol transport and ABCA1 expression in vivo (J. R. Schultz, et al. & 14, 2831\u20132838, (2000), J. J. Repa et al. 289, 1524\u20131529, (2000)). It has been found that LXR\u03b1 and\/or LXR\u03b2 cause the induction or regulation of ABCA1 expression, and that small molecule ligands of LXR are useful as drugs to increase the expression of ABCA1, increase levels of HDL and thereby decrease the risk of atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and related conditions such as peripheral vascular disease and ischemic stroke.","The various dyslipidemic conditions, which are risk factors for atherosclerosis, are currently treated with several different classes of drugs, such as statins which are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine and colestipol), nicotinic acid (niacin), and fibrates. However, except for niacin, most of these treatments do not raise HDL as their primary effect. With favorable outcomes in many human studies, the statin class of drugs is used to modulate LDL and, to a lesser extent, HDL and triglycerides. Conditions principally characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides and low HDL are frequently treated with drugs belonging to the fibrate class. The fibrates are PPAR alpha agonists that lower triglycerides and raise HDL in many instances. There are no currently marketed drugs whose principal actions are mediated by LXR.","We have now discovered a new class of small molecules which are LXR ligands, i.e., LXR\u03b1 and\/or LXR\u03b2 ligands, and are therefore expected to be useful for modulation of HDL levels, ABCA1 gene expression and reverse cholesterol transport. The instant compounds have been shown to raise plasma levels of HDL in animal models and to increase cholesterol efflux from cells in vitro. These biological activities are critical for reverse cholesterol transport.","The novel compounds of this invention are intended as a treatment for dyslipidemias, especially low plasma HDL cholesterol levels, as well as for treatment and\/or prevention of lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques, which is an underlying cause or aggravating factor in atherosclerosis.","Compounds of Formula I are novel LXR ligands and are useful in the treatment of dyslipidemic conditions including below-desirable levels of HDL cholesterol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"28.19mm","wi":"58.17mm","file":"US07125865-20061024-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"One object of the instant invention is to provide a method for treating depressed plasma HDL cholesterol levels comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient in need of such treatment.","Another object is to provide a method for preventing or treating dyslipidemic conditions comprising administering a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount, as appropriate, of a compound of Formula I to a patient in need of such treatment.","As a further object, methods are provided for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, as well as for halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically evident, comprising the administration of a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount, as appropriate, of a compound of Formula I to a patient who is at risk of developing atherosclerosis or who already has atherosclerotic disease. The method of this invention also serves to remove cholesterol from tissue deposits such as xanthomas and atherosclerotic lesions by hastening the efflux of cholesterol from cells in those lesions.","Another object of the present invention is the use of the compounds of the present invention for the manufacture of a medicament useful in treating, preventing or reducing the risk of developing these conditions.","Other objects of this invention are to provide processes for making the compounds of Formula I and to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds.

Following labeling with H-cholesterol, cells were washed and incubated an additional 24 hours in serum-free media containing 1 mg\/ml BSA, to allow for equilibration of H-cholesterol with intracellular cholesterol. Cholesterol efflux was initiated by adding 10 \u03bcg\/ml apoA-I, with or without compound, in serum-free medium. Compounds were added to cell culture medium from DMSO solutions, and control cells received an equivalent amount of DMSO, never exceeding 0.1%. After 24 hours, media were harvested and cells dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH. Media were briefly centrifuged to remove non-adherent cells, and then aliquots of both the supernatants and the dissolved cells were subjected to liquid scintillation spectrometry to determine radioactivity.
