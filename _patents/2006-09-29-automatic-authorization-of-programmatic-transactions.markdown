title: Automatic authorization of programmatic transactions
abstract: Techniques are described for facilitating interactions between computing systems, such as via a third-party transaction authorization system that automatically authorizes transactions between parties. In some situations, the transactions are programmatic transactions involving the use of fee-based Web services by executing application programs, with the transaction authorization system authorizing and/or providing payments for transactions between Web service provider and consumer parties in accordance with private authorization instructions previously specified by the parties. The authorization instructions may include predefined instruction rule sets that regulate conditions under which a potential transaction can be authorized, with the instruction rule sets each referenced by an associated reference token. The transaction authorization system can then receive a reference token from each party to a potential transaction, and determine whether to authorize the transaction based on whether the instruction rule sets associated with the reference tokens are compatible or otherwise satisfied.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/894,347, filed Jul. 19, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The following disclosure relates generally to facilitating interactions between computing systems, and more particularly to automatically authorizing programmatic transactions between parties in accordance with predefined instructions of the parties, such as to authorize fee-based Web service programmatic transactions between executing application programs of the parties.","Various mechanisms exist to allow computers and executing software applications to programmatically interact. For example, remote procedure call (\u201cRPC\u201d) protocols have long existed that allow a program on one computer to cause a program on another computer to be executed, and various object-oriented architectures such as CORBA (\u201cCommon Object Request Broker Architecture\u201d) and DCOM (\u201cDistributed Component Object Model\u201d) provide similar capabilities. In addition, a variety of middleware programs have been implemented to connect separate applications (often of distinct types and from unrelated sources) to allow communication. For example, various EDI (\u201cElectronic Data Interchange\u201d) networks exist that provide standard mechanisms to allow a computer system of one user of the network to send data to a computer system of another user of the network.","The widespread popularity of the World Wide Web (\u201cWeb\u201d) has provided additional opportunities for computers to inter-communicate. For example, much current Web use involves users interactively requesting Web pages from Web servers (e.g., via executing Web browser applications of the users) and receiving the requested information in response. In addition to such interactive user specification of requested information, there is also growing use of the Web to support the programmatic interaction of remote applications to exchange information via defined APIs (\u201capplication program interfaces\u201d), such as via Web services.","Web services allow heterogeneous applications and computers to interact, and can be defined and implemented using a variety of underlying protocols and techniques. For example, some Web service implementations return data in XML (\u201cextensible Markup Language\u201d) format using HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d) in response to a Web service invocation request specified as a URI (\u201cUniform Resource Identifier\u201d), such as a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d) that includes a specified operation and one or more query parameters. In other implementations, additional underlying protocols are used for various purposes, such as SOAP (\u201cSimple Object Access Protocol\u201d) for standard message exchange, WSDL (\u201cWeb Services Description Language\u201d) for description of service invocations, and UDDI (\u201cUniversal Description, Discovery, and Integration service\u201d) for discovery of available services.","Although computing systems and programs can thus interact in various ways, various limitations exist in the ways in which transactions and other interactions between different systems and programs can be established. For example, while some providers of Web services or other programmatic services are willing to make their services available for free and to anyone, the most useful and reliable services are often not freely available. Unfortunately, the mechanisms for providers of programmatic services and potential consumers of those services to agree upon payment and other terms for transactions can be time-consuming and difficult to use, as well as very restrictive for at least some of the parties. In particular, while some transactions result from manual negotiations between parties for services or information, such techniques are time-consuming and greatly restrict the volume of transactions that can occur, and also typically require the exchange of significant information about the parties, which can create an additional impediment to such transactions in some situations.","However, other than through such manual negotiations, agreements about the use of programmatic services that are not freely available are typically restricted to non-negotiated transactions in which one party defines conditions related to use of a service and\/or information, with other potential parties limited to merely interactively and manually determining whether to accept those conditions (e.g., Internet access from a typical Internet Service Provider that is offered subject to various usage restrictions, or content that is offered subject to usage restrictions enforced by digital rights management software). In addition, while some techniques may allow a consumer to have at least limited control on how payments can occur on their behalf (e.g., by acquiring and using some form of e-cash with a specified value, which thus cannot be used by an unscrupulous third-party to cost the consumer more than that value), such techniques do not typically assist with the problems related to establishing transactions.","Thus, it would be beneficial to provide a solution that addresses these and other problems associated with the establishment of transactions related to programmatic services and\/or that otherwise facilitates the interaction of computer systems and executing programs.","A software facility is described that facilitates interactions between computing systems, such as by in some embodiments providing a third-party transaction authorization system to automatically authorize transactions between parties and\/or financial payments for such transactions in accordance with private authorization instructions that were previously specified by the parties. In some embodiments, some or all of the transactions are programmatic transactions conducted between executing computer programs, such as transactions involving the use of Web services of Web service providers by application programs affiliated with Web service consumers. In addition, in some embodiments the transaction authorization system further provides authorized payments to one or more of the parties on behalf of one or more other parties.","The transaction authorization system can be used to authorize transactions and\/or payments for a variety of types of interactions between parties, with  illustrating examples of some such interactions. In particular,  illustrates an example of a 2-party transaction in which a party requests a service to be provided by a party , with the providing of the service having an associated cost. A transaction authorization system uses information about the parties and (e.g., information received from one of the parties who makes a programmatic call to the transaction authorization system requesting the authorization) in order to determine whether to authorize the transaction and\/or the providing of a payment from the service requester to the service provider to cover the cost associated with the transaction. After the transaction and\/or payment is authorized, the transaction authorization system provides an indication of the authorization (e.g., as a response to the authorization request call), and may further in some embodiments actually make the authorized payment on behalf of the service requester. Details regarding how the authorization process may occur are discussed in greater detail below.","The illustrated authorization and payment techniques can be used in a variety of situations. For example, the provided service may involve a programmatic transaction between the two parties (e.g., invocation by the service requester party of a Web service provided by the service provider party), or instead could involve other types of transactions (e.g., a physical transaction between the parties, such as providing a physical product or service from one party to the other). The authorization interactions with the transaction authorization system can similarly be performed in various ways, such as during the transaction (e.g., such that the transaction will not be completed unless an appropriate authorization response is received), or instead in a manner separate from the transaction (e.g., after the transaction is completed in order to provide payment to the service provider). In addition, the information regarding the parties that is used in performing the authorization may similarly have a variety of forms, as discussed in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":["850","830","805","810","820","810","815"],"i":["b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8C","b":["830","860","860","815","820","840"],"i":["c ","a","n","c","c ","c "]},"As previously noted, the transaction authorization system can use various information about the parties to a transaction when determining whether to authorize transactions. In particular, users that are potential parties to such transactions may first define usage instruction rule sets of one or more types with the transaction authorization system for later use in authorizing the transactions, such as payment instruction rule sets for use in authorizing fee-based transactions and\/or the associated financial payments for such transactions. Each such payment instruction rule set for a party may include one or more specified rules that regulate the conditions under which the payment instruction rule set can authorize a potential transaction for the party and\/or its associated financial payment, as discussed in greater detail below.","For example, a potential Web service consumer (e.g., an application developer who would like their application program to be able to invoke Web services under specified circumstances) may specify rules for a payment instruction rule set that limits the financial exposure to the Web service consumer of the transactions that can be authorized by that payment instruction rule set (e.g., via a number of times that the payment instruction rule set can authorize a transaction, a maximum payment amount per transaction that the payment instruction rule set can authorize, a maximum total payment amount that the payment instruction rule set can authorize, an expiration date for the payment instruction rule set, etc.). Similarly, a potential Web service provider may specify rules for a payment instruction rule set that limits the liability to the Web service provider for the transactions that can be authorized by that payment instruction rule set (e.g., limitations on consumers that can purchase access to the Web service, limitations on types of payment that can be used to purchase access to the Web service, limitations on remedies available to consumers that are unhappy with their use of the Web service, etc.). In addition, a potential Web service caller (e.g., an end user of an application program supplied by an application developer that invokes one or more Web services) may specify rules for a payment instruction rule set that limits the liability to the caller for the transactions that can be authorized by that payment instruction rule set (e.g., limitations on types of programmatic transactions that the caller is authorized to initiate and\/or on types of payments that can be made to purchase access to a programmatic service, such as payments to providers of the services and\/or fees paid to a transaction authorization service and\/or other third-party service such as a payment service).","After receiving a specified usage instruction rule set for a user, the transaction authorization system stores the instruction rule set in a manner associated with the user (e.g., associates it with an account of the user with the transaction authorization system), optionally after first approving the instruction rule set (e.g., based on verification that the instruction rule set includes required information, if any, and\/or is in the correct form). The transaction authorization system also generates a reference token to refer to the instruction rule set, associates the reference token with the instruction rule set (e.g., by storing an indication of the reference token with the stored instruction rule set), and provides the reference token to the user for later use in referencing the instruction rule set. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, the reference tokens can be generated in a variety of ways and can take a variety of forms (e.g., a long random number guaranteed to be unique), and in some embodiments multiple reference tokens may be generated for and associated with a single instruction rule set. In some embodiments, the reference tokens are generated in such a manner as to allow anonymous and\/or private use of a reference token by a user, such as by lacking any identification information related to the user and\/or by lacking any information about the conditions of the instruction rule set associated with the reference token (e.g., to prevent other parties to a potential transaction that involves such a reference token from obtaining such information about the user and\/or associated instruction rule set).","After the usage instruction rule sets have been defined and associated reference tokens have been generated, they can then be used to allow automatic authorization of programmatic transactions in accordance with the previously defined conditions of the instruction rule sets. In particular, in some embodiments two or more parties to a potential programmatic transaction (e.g., a Web service provider party, a Web service consumer party, and optionally an end-user caller party) each supply a reference token for use in authorizing the potential transaction, as well as various information about the potential transaction. Those reference tokens and various information about the potential transaction can then be supplied to the transaction authorization system for automatic determination of whether the transaction is authorized (e.g., a dynamic determination, such as in a real-time manner). As discussed in greater detail below, in some embodiments the automatic determination by the transaction authorization system of whether a potential transaction is authorized based on the supplied reference tokens includes retrieving the instruction rule sets associated with those reference tokens and then determining whether the instruction rule sets are compatible.","The information about a potential transaction that is supplied to the transaction authorization system may vary in various embodiments and situations. For example, the information about the transaction may in some situations be limited to merely a transaction amount to be paid by one of the parties to another of the parties, while in other situations a variety of additional details about the transaction may be supplied (e.g., a type of the transaction). Furthermore, in some situations the call to the transaction authorization system can further specify details about what (if any) each of the two or more parties to the potential transaction are to pay, whether to another party and\/or as fees to the transaction authorization system.","The determining of whether usage instruction rule sets are compatible can be performed in various ways in various embodiments, such as by determining if each rule in each instruction rule set is satisfied for the current potential transaction. Such rule satisfaction can occur in various ways for different types of rules, such as based on information about the potential transaction (e.g., a type of transaction and\/or an associated payment amount for the transaction), information about one or more other parties to the transaction (e.g., whether the parties satisfy specified criteria), information about one or more other instruction rule sets specified for the potential transaction (e.g., whether one or more corresponding rules in the other instruction rule set(s) match or are otherwise compatible with the rule), etc. Conversely, in some situations instruction rule sets may be determined not to be compatible because one or more of them (and their associated reference tokens) are invalid for a current potential transaction based on conditions at the time of the potential transaction, such as if the instruction rule set is not currently available for use (e.g., it has expired or is otherwise not currently available for use, such as based on a total number of allowable uses or total allowable payment amount having been exceeded) and\/or if it cannot be used for the potential transaction.","When a potential transaction with one or more associated financial payments is automatically determined to be authorized, the transaction authorization system may in some embodiments further perform or facilitate the payment exchange between the parties as appropriate. For example, in some embodiments a payment providing user may have previously specified one or more payment instruments (e.g., a credit card, bank account, etc.), and if so a financial payment may be obtained from one or more of those payment instruments in an appropriate manner (e.g., from a payment instrument specified by a payment instruction rule set for the payment providing user). Similarly, a payment receiving user may have previously specified one or more payment repositories (e.g., a bank account, debit card, etc.), and if so a financial payment may be provided to one or more of those payment repositories in an appropriate manner (e.g., to a payment repository specified by a payment instruction rule set for the payment receiving user).","After the transaction authorization system authorizes a potential transaction and optionally performs any associated financial payments for the potential transaction, the parties to the transaction can then perform the transaction in an appropriate manner. For example, when the transaction is a fee-based Web service transaction, the Web service consumer can invoke the Web service and the provider of the Web service can provide the associated functionality for the Web service to the consumer.","In some embodiments, additional restrictions may be imposed by the transaction authorization system even after a potential transaction is authorized and\/or performed. For example, in some situations recipients of payments may not be allowed to immediately withdraw or receive those payments, such as by limiting access to an account of the transaction authorization system in which the payment has been deposited and\/or by delaying deposit of some or all of a received payment into another payment repository for the recipient. Such payment access restrictions may be performed for various reasons and in various ways, including to allow any disputes to be resolved and any refunds to be automatically made (e.g., as a chargeback to the payment recipient for the amount of the refund) during a specified period of time after the transaction is authorized and\/or performed. In some embodiments, additional related functionality may further be provided by the transaction authorization system or from a third-party, such as a fee-based underwriting or insurance service that guarantees or provides the funds for any such refunds, thus allowing a payment recipient to have immediate or more rapid access to any received payments.","In some embodiments, users of the transaction authorization system may more generally define other types of usage instruction rule sets for use in situations other than authorizing fee-based transactions, whether instead of or in addition to payment instruction rule sets. For example, such usage instruction rule sets can each include one or more specified rules that regulate the conditions under which the usage instruction rule set can authorize a potential transaction that does not include a fee, such as to determine whether to provide access to restricted information or a restricted service.","In addition, the rules in usage instruction rule sets can be specified and used in various ways in various embodiments, and further can have a variety of forms in various embodiments. For example, in some embodiments a rule may specify a type of information to examine, a type of evaluation to perform with respect to that information, and a test for determining whether the results of the evaluation satisfy the rule. More generally, in other embodiments a rule may reflect any condition or information that can be examined and\/or evaluated to determine whether it is satisfied in a specified situation. For example, in some embodiments a rule can be specified using XML format, and the instruction rule sets can further in some embodiments be specified and\/or stored as XML documents.","Furthermore, in some embodiments users may select from a variety of predefined types of rules when creating usage instruction rules sets, such as with each predefined type of rule specifying a type of condition related to use of an instruction rule set and with each user selection including specifying one or more parameter values to customize the predefined rule type so as to affect how or when its usage condition is satisfied for the instruction rule set being created. In addition, in some embodiments users may specify various user-specific rules, such as rules that each indicate a user-specified procedure for determining when a rule is satisfied (e.g., by providing executable code for the rule that when invoked provides an indication as to whether the rule is satisfied, or instead by indicating a way to automatically obtain a response indicating whether the rule is satisfied, such as by invoking an accessible user-specified Web service or other function using specified parameter values).","In some embodiments, an evaluation of a rule may further involve obtaining additional information to be used as part of the determination as to whether the rule is satisfied, such as in an automated manner and\/or in an interactive manner with respect to one or more users (e.g., by querying the user that created the instruction rule set to confirm an evaluation and\/or to provide additional information). Moreover, in some embodiments in which functionality related to security and\/or privacy for a usage instruction rule set is provided, one or more of the rules in the instruction rule set may be used to provide that functionality (e.g., by restricting who can access and\/or modify the instruction rule set), while in other embodiments such functionality may be provided in other manners (e.g., by controlling access to a user account with which one or more instruction rule sets can be associated).","In addition, usage instruction rule sets and their rules can be created in various ways in various embodiments, such as interactively via a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) provided by the transaction authorization system and\/or via invocation of one or more Web services provided by the transaction authorization system for that purpose. Such Web services may be implemented in various ways, such as using APIs based on XML over HTTP (e.g., as part of the REpresentational State Transfer, or \u201cREST\u201d, distributed interaction model that focuses on resources) and\/or on the use of SOAP and\/or other protocols related to Web services. Furthermore, after an instruction rule set has been created and associated with a reference token, the instruction rule set may in some embodiments not be allowed to be modified. Alternatively, in some embodiments such an instruction rule set may be modified, and a new reference token for the modified instruction rule set will be generated for the new instruction rule set (e.g., to replace the prior reference token). Moreover, in some embodiments reference tokens and\/or associated instruction rule sets may be dynamically created at the time of intended use (e.g., as part of or just prior to attempting to invoke a programmatic service and\/or to sending an authorization request to a third-party authorizer)\u2014as one example, one-time or single-use tokens and\/or instruction rule sets may be created and used (e.g., for a specific potential transaction) in some embodiments.","Furthermore, in some embodiments in which fee-based transactions are authorized and financial payments are handled, some or all of the users may further have an account with the transaction authorization system that facilitates such payments, such as an account that can be used by a user as a payment instrument and\/or a payment repository. Such accounts and\/or other financial instruments\/repositories may in some embodiments support micro-payments of very small amounts. In addition, in some embodiments the transaction authorization system may further provide aggregation of financial payments to be provided and\/or received (e.g., on a periodic basis, such as a month), such as to minimize fees associated with financial payment transactions and\/or to allow minimum payment amounts to be reached. As with other types of accounts, such user accounts may in some embodiments have various conditions and restrictions related to their use, such as a maximum allowed credit balance, as well as various security and access control (e.g., password-based).","In addition, while the transaction authorization system has been described above as providing a variety of functionality and capabilities in various embodiments, in some embodiments some of such functionality and capabilities may instead be split across one or more systems. For example, in some embodiments some or all users may already have user accounts with another system with which the transaction authorization system is affiliated or to which the transaction authorization system otherwise has access, and if so some or all of the account-related functionality may be provided by that other system in conjunction with the transaction authorization system (e.g., the storing of instruction rule sets, the generating of reference tokens, the providing of payment repository\/instrument functionality, etc.).","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments of the software facility are described below in which various specific types of capabilities and functionalities are performed by a specific embodiment of a transaction authorization system, and in which users define and use specific types of usage instruction rules sets in specific ways, such as payment instruction rule sets to authorize various types of fee-based programmatic transactions. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques of the invention can be used in a wide variety of other situations, including with services and items other than Web services and for purposes other than providing financial payment, and that the invention is not limited to the exemplary details provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","220","210"]},"In particular, in the illustrated embodiment a user (not shown) performing application development uses a computing system  to interact  with the PHS to enable later payment handling functionality on behalf of the application programs developed by the user. The application developer user's computing system  first interacts with the Account System to define a user account  for the application developer, such as via an interactive GUI  provided by the Account System or instead via one or more Web services APIs  provided by the Account System. In the illustrated embodiment, each such user account may include one or more usage instruction rule sets  that each specify various rules regarding how and when the usage instruction rule set can be used for payment purposes. In addition, each usage instruction rule set has an associated unique reference token  for later referencing of that usage instruction rule set. After the application developer user creates the account with one or more usage instruction rule sets, the user then includes one or more of the reference tokens  for the usage instruction rule sets within one or more application programs  that they create.","Similarly, one or more users (not shown) that provide Web services to others use a computing system  to interact  with the Account System via the interactive GUI and\/or Web services APIs of the Account System. As with the application developer, each Web services provider user can create an account with one or more usage instruction rule sets with the Account System. The Web services provider user can then associate one or more of their reference tokens  for their usage instruction rule sets as part of one or more Web services Provider Transaction Systems  with which the Web services provider provides Web services to others (e.g., for a fee).","When one of the application programs  is later being executed by an end user (not shown) on an end-user computing system , the application program invokes  one or more Web services provided by the Web services Providers Transaction System, such as via a Web services API . However, the Web services provider in the illustrated embodiment will provide the requested Web service only if appropriate payment is provided for the application program. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the application program supplies a reference token  of the application developer user as part of the Web service invocation. Before providing the requested Web service to the application program, the Web services Provider Transaction System then contacts  the PHS Transaction System  to obtain appropriate authorization and payment, such as via invocation of a Web services API  of the PHS Transaction System. In the illustrated embodiment, the Web services Provider Transaction System provides the reference token  for the Web services Provider as well as the reference token  from the application program as part of the interaction with the PHS Transaction System, and further provides information about the transaction and associated payment that is to occur.","The PHS Transaction System  determines if the payment transaction is approved in the illustrated embodiment by first interacting with the Account System  to retrieve information about the usage instruction rule sets  corresponding to the reference tokens provided in the call to the Web service API , as well as further retrieving other information from the user accounts  to which those usage instruction rule sets belong. After obtaining the usage instruction rule sets and other information, the PHS Transaction System  then determines whether the rule sets are compatible and otherwise authorize the requested payment to be made, and if so the PHS Transaction System performs the payment (e.g., by charging a payment instrument associated with the application program's reference token  and by depositing at least some of that charge in a payment repository associated with the Transaction System 's reference token ) and provides confirmation to the Transaction System , with the Transaction System  subsequently providing the initially requested Web service to the application program. In some embodiments, the PHS may further obtain payment for some or all of the services it provides, such as a portion of the payment for each transaction performed and\/or a payment associated with account creation and\/or modification.","Although the PHS Transaction System  and Account System  are illustrated in this embodiment as being separate but cooperating systems, in other embodiments the illustrated functionality can be provided in other ways. For example, in some embodiments a single system may provide both the account creation and maintenance capability as well as the transaction authorization and handling capability, while in other embodiments the Transaction System  and Account System  may instead be provided by unrelated systems\/organizations.","In addition, while only payment-type transactions are illustrated here, in other embodiments a variety of other types of transactions could be performed, whether instead of or in addition to a payment transaction. Moreover, while the illustrated embodiment discusses a per-use fee for using the Web service of the Transaction System , in other embodiments a variety of other types of purchase transactions could be performed, such as an ongoing subscription to one or more Web services of the Transaction System  for one or more application programs . Alternatively, a specified number of uses of the Web service or an unlimited number of uses during a specified period of time may instead be purchased and associated with the reference token , such as by the application developer user before distributing the application program  to the end users. In such situations, information about the subscription or other multi-use purchase may be stored by the Account System in various ways so that the Transaction System  will later be able to determine that a payment transaction is authorized. Additional details regarding using usage instruction rule sets to authorize programmatic transactions are included in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/894,350, filed concurrently and entitled \u201cPerforming Automatically Authorized Programmatic Transactions\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["111","113"]},"In this example, the account creation screen also includes an optional section  in which the user ABC can specify one or more payment repositories for payments that the user may receive, such as for providing fee-based Web services to consumers. In this example embodiment, user ABC specifies two payment repositories in which incoming payments may be deposited, including a bank account and a debit card. The user further specifies restrictions for the debit card such that any payments deposited must be a minimum of at least five cents. The section  in this illustrated embodiment also indicates that the user account being created can itself serve as a payment repository for the user.","The account creation screen also includes a section  in which the user ABC can specify one or more payment instruments to be used for payments to be made to others. In this example, user ABC specifies the same bank account as an available payment instrument, although with a restriction that any individual payments from the account be no larger than $50, as well as a credit card payment instrument with restrictions of maximum individual payments of $200 and a maximum cumulative balance of $2,000. Section  similarly indicates that the user account being created can be used as a payment instrument by the user, which for this user and in this example includes a $1,000 maximum balance credit limit. After specifying the various types of information, the user can then select the control to create the account, or the user can instead select the control to cancel the account creation.","In the illustrated embodiment, after initially creating the user account, the user is then presented with the option of creating one or more usage instruction rule sets via the example screen shown in . In particular, the illustrated screen includes a header section  with overview information and a rule specification section  in which various information can be specified for a usage instruction rule set being created. In this example, section  allows the user to specify a name for the usage instruction rule set being created, a usage type for the rule set (which in this example is to receive payments), a payment repository to receive any such payments, and an expiration date which in this example is not specified. The user ABC can also specify one or more specific rules for this rule set. The example illustrates two rules that have been defined, and a drop-down menu for a third rule showing other types of rule attributes that can be selected and customized for this usage instruction rule set in this example.","For example, user ABC has specified that this usage instruction rule set will only receive payments from users that satisfy the first \u201cAllowedPayers\u201d role attribute, which in this example can be satisfied based on a specified organization affiliation of the payer, rating of the payer, or specific payer whose ID is indicated. As is indicated, other rule attributes that can be specified in this example include disallowed or blocked payers from whom user ABC will not accept payment, specifications of allowed or disallowed transaction types with which the usage instruction rule set can be used, allowed or disallowed types of payment instruments and currencies for received payments, terms and conditions for later handling any disputes that occur, etc. In addition, the illustrated embodiment allows a user to specify a user-defined rule, such as by including executable code and\/or a mechanism for invoking an accessible executable function (e.g., a Web service). After specifying the various information for the usage instruction rule set being created, the user ABC can then select one of the controls in section  to create the current usage instruction rule set and continue with creating another rule set for the account, to create the current usage instruction rule set and exit the account modification, or to skip the creation of a current instruction rule set and exit.","The types of rule attributes shown in this example are provided in a simplified manner for the purpose of example, and similar information could instead be specified in other ways in other situations. For example, rather than having different attributes for allowed and disallowed payers, a single attribute for payers could instead be provided, with the type of evaluation criteria instead used to determine whether a user is allowed or disallowed (e.g., to satisfy the rule, it is specified that the payer \u201cIS\u201d or \u201cIS-NOT\u201d a specified value). Additional details regarding example attributes are discussed elsewhere.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B"],"b":"131"},"In particular, this usage instruction rule set is being created by user CDE for use in providing payment for transactions that will be invoked by one or more application programs created by user CDE, such as fee-based Web services (e.g., one or more Web services provided by Web service provider user ABC). In this example, the usage instruction rule set being created will use user CDE's PHS account (designated in this example with the name \u201cMyPHSAccount\u201d), and has a specified expiration date. The second of the two rules defined for the usage instruction rule set further limits the total payments that this usage instruction rule set can authorize to be less than or equal to the amount of $1,000 by using the predefined rule attribute \u201cPaymentsAllowed\u201d with an appropriate evaluation type and rule value.
