{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the preparation of hypermedia documents that retain their hyperlinks in the printed copy and, in particular, to an authoring system for providing a near-optimal assignment of physical links to hyperlinks.","Hypermedia documents are computer-based electronic documents that contain text, graphics, audio and video on pages that are connected by navigational links. The navigational links, often referred to as the hyperlinks, permit non-sequential or non-linear traversal of the document by the readers. A well-known source of hypermedia documents is the so-called World Wide Web (WWW) or simply, \u201cthe Web\u201d.","Hypermedia documents allow multiple simultaneous views and efficient non-linear exploration of information that are not possible with conventional printed documents such as books. On the other hand, unlike books, the absence of an obvious linear structure and a sense of physical orientation in hypermedia documents allows users to become easily lost in the hyperspace of the document.","Although hypermedia documents may be printed, the hyperlinking functionality is typically lost in the printed copy. Most hypermedia documents, especially those on the Web are intended for viewing on the screen and designed to exploit the hyperlinking functionality. As a result, readability also suffers with the loss of the hyperlinks. For instance, removing the hyperlink to the definition of an unfamiliar term may make a description unclear to the readers.","Australian Patent Publication No. AU-A-83194\/98 (Attorney Ref: 432345 CFP0954AU MMedia02), corresponding to United States of America patent application Ser. No. 09\/148,475 discloses a method for forming hypermedia documents that retain their electronic hyperlinks as physical hyperlinks within the printed reproduction of the document. The method associates the hyperlinks with cut-outs or tabs on the edges of the pages and lines or other indicia printed onto the page. To traverse a hyperlink, the reader follows the indicia, places a finger or thumb within the cut-out, locates the first uncut page surface below the cut-out and opens that page.","As the number of hyperlinks increase, it is apparent that the number of cut-outs and thus hyperlinks, is limited by the physical dimensions of the pages. It is therefore desirable to reuse the cut-outs for multiple hyperlinks and optimise their assignment.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a method of creating a document suitable for hard copy reproduction, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is disclosed an authoring system for the creation of a linear document having non-linear referential links, said system including:\n\n","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is disclosed an authoring system for the creation of a linear document having non-linear referential links, said system comprising:\n\n","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a system for the creation of a linear document having non-linear referential links, said system comprising:\n\n","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a computer program product incorporating a computer readable medium incorporating a series of instructions for creating a document suitable for hard copy reproduction, said instructions implementing the steps of:\n\n","A printable document and printed document arising from these aspects are also disclosed.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention is described as a computer application program hosted on the Windows\u2122 operating system developed by Microsoft Corporation. However, those skilled in the art will recognise that the described embodiment may can be implemented on computer systems hosted by other operating systems. For example, the preferred embodiment can be performed on computer systems running UNIX\u2122, or OS\/2\u2122. The application program has a user interface which includes menu items and controls that respond to mouse and keyboard operations. The application program has the ability to transmit data to one or more printers either directly connected to a host computer or accessed over a network. The application program also has the ability to transmit and receive data to a connected digital communications network (for example the \u201cInternet\u201d).","The preferred embodiment of the invention can be practised using a conventional general-purpose (host) computer system, such as the computer system  shown in , wherein the application program discussed above and to be described with reference to the other drawings is implemented as software executed on the computer system . The computer system  comprises a computer module , input devices such as a keyboard  and mouse , and output devices including a printer  and a display device . A Modulator-Demodulator (Modem) transceiver device  is used by the computer module  for communicating to and from a computer network, for example connectable via a telephone line or other functional medium. The modem  can be used to obtain access to the Internet, and other network systems.","The computer module  typically includes at least one processor unit , a memory unit , for example formed from semiconductor random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM), input\/output (I\/O) interfaces including a video interface , and an I\/O interface  for the keyboard  a mouse  and optionally a joystick (not illustrated). A storage device  is provided and typically includes a hard disk drive  and a floppy disk drive . A CD-ROM drive  is typically provided as a non-volatile source of data. The components  to  and  to  of the computer module , typically communicate via an interconnected bus  and in a manner which results in a conventional mode of operation of the computer system  known to those in the relevant art. Examples of computers on which the embodiments can be practised include IBM-PC\/ATs and compatibles, Sun Sparcstations or alike computer systems evolved therefrom. Typically, the application program of the preferred embodiment is resident on a hard disk drive  and read and controlled using the processor . Intermediate storage of the program, generated data such as a print list, and any data fetched from the network may be accomplished using the semiconductor memory , possibly in concert with the hard disk drive . In some instances, the application program may be supplied to the user encoded on a CD-ROM or floppy disk, or alternatively could be read by the user from the network via the modem device . In such instances, the disk or network form a computer program product for provision of the application program to the computer system  for implementation thereby.","Referring to , an electronic multi-page hypermedia document  is shown which illustrates a typical layout of multi-media content spread over separate electronic pages , ,  which also include hyperlinks , , and which is typically displayed to a user of the computer system  via the video display . It will be appreciated that the pages \u2013 may depict only some of the pages and hyperlinks within the document . Navigating through the pages is accomplished by traversing the hyperlinks initiated by a signal such as a clicking of the mouse  or a finger-touch on hyperlink anchors  and , where a touch-sensitive display is used. For instance, selecting the anchor  of hyperlink  will cause page  to be displayed on the display , whilst selecting an anchor  of hyperlink  will cause page  to be displayed. The functionality of the hyperlinks is to be retained in a printed copy reproduction of the document .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","100","300","100","100","120","124","100","320","324","122","100","322","323","500","300","320","322","300","520","323","324","523","524"]},"In this example, the electronic hyperlinks of the document  are associated with cut-outs on the edges of the pages. To traverse a hyperlink, the reader places a finger or thumb within the cut-out, locates the first uncut page surface below the cut-out and opens at that page. In the document , the hyperlinks ,  of the document  become associated with tabs  and  respectively which form cut-outs  and  in the printed copy  of , thereby retaining the hyperlinking functionality of the original document . On page  of the document , selecting the tab  causes the page  to be displayed in a one-page mode and both pages  and  to be displayed in a two-page mode. Moreover, on page , selecting the tab  causes page  to be displayed in one-page display mode and page  and its opposite page to be displayed in a two-page display mode. Note that tab  is not active on page  as indicated, in this particular implementation, through the absence of an appropriate label.","Due to the limited amount of space on the edges of the printed copy, it is possible that some hyperlinks in an electronic hypermedia document cannot be retained in its corresponding printed copy as cut-out tabs. While the number of cut-out tabs that can be made along the edges is limited, under certain conditions and in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to assign multiple hyperlinks to one cut-out tab. Moreover, according to further embodiments, related hyperlinks can be grouped to form a set of nested tabs of progressive size along a single axis, for instance, the tab  in document  and corresponding cut-out  in the printed version . When using a set of nested tabs, the user selects which hyperlink to traverse by simply moving the thumb or finger slightly to grasp the desired size of the cut-out in the printed version.","The preferred embodiment optimises the assignment of the cut-outs and other physical hyperlinks. More specifically, the preferred embodiment provides a mathematical model for describing hyperlinks and cut-out tabs and uses the model to optimise the number of tabs and axes that are required for implementing a given set of hyperlinks. The preferred embodiment will be explained using a particular authoring system that creates hypermedia documents with physical hyperlinks. It will be appreciated that the present invention can be used in other authoring processes as well as in processes that convert existing electronic hypermedia documents to a format that supports physical hyperlinks.","A physical hyperlink from an anchor (or hot-spot) on page S to a target on page T can be represented by a data structure comprising of the 1-dimensional vector {right arrow over (ST)} describing the path traversed by the hyperlink and the location of the target page, that is, the page number of T. Since hyperlinks are typically implemented physically as cut-out tabs and can operate or be used in either a forward or a backward direction, bi-dimensional vectors are involved. The same basic data structure is used to represent the cut-out tabs. Each physical hyperlink in the document is typically associated with one cut-out tab. However, a number of hyperlinks may be able to share one cut-out tab. The preferred embodiment involves a process that starts with a set of cut-out tabs each representing one hyperlink of the hypermedia document. The set of cut-out tabs is then gradually reduced by combining cut-out tabs which can serve multiple hyperlinks.","Other physical attributes such as the size of the tabs and the page, as well as certain system parameters such as the edges to be used for tabs, the maximum number of tabs that can be nested along a single axis and the density of the tabs along an edge are required when optimizing the placement of the cut-out tabs and are typically retained in a tab data structure. Additional attributes such as the location of the tabs on an edge, the shape of the tabs, the colors and labels used by the tabs, etc. are required when producing the tabs. Default values or user's inputs can be used for the value of those attributes that are not set by the optimization process. The user (ie. the document author) is desirably allowed to examine the results of the optimization process and make adjustments as required.","A tab running from S to T has to pass through all the pages in between and is visible, although not necessarily required by those pages. Appropriate presentational style may be used to distinguish an inactive tab from an active tab, for instance by removing or greying out the label of a tab when it has no associated hyperlink. An array is added to the data structure of the cut-out tab to store the status of the tab for the intermediate pages. In case the tab is shared by multiple hyperlinks, a second array is used to store the labels of the tab for the intermediate pages. Hereafter, depending on the context, the notation ST is used to denote a hyperlink or a cut-out tab from page S to page T. In addition,  show graphical notations used in the preferred embodiment to depict the cut-out tabs diagrammatically. The graphical notations can also be used in the graphical user interface (GUI) of an authoring system or editing tool to visualize the assignment and the physical arrangement of the tabs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},"A cut-out tab is denoted by an arrow as shown in . A left pointing arrow represents a forward link and a right pointing arrow represents a backward link. An arrow with arrow head at both ends is used to represent a bi-directional tab that provides both a forward and a backward link. The arrow is labelled. The label indicates the hyperlinks that are associated with the tab. The label has the format ST where S is the identifier of the anchor and T is the indentifier of the target.","In order to denote a cut-out tab that is shared by a set of hyperlinks, as shown in , a cross is placed at the anchor section of each hyperlink except the outermost one along the arrow that represents the tab.","As shown in , a set of arrows enclosed in a rectangular box denotes a set of nested cut-out tabs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","600","800","600","800","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["800","610","800","800","800"],"sub":["i","j ","ij"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":"R DD. . .

In step , each of these hyperlinks is assigned a tab.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0068"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Hyperlinks","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["RD, i = l, . . . , m","from the root page to each cuisine"]},{"entry":[{},"directory"]},{"entry":["DD, r, s = l, . . . , m r \u2260 s","from each cuisine directory to another"]},{"entry":[{},"cuisine directory"]},{"entry":["DS, i = l, . . . , m, j = l, . . . , n","from each cuisine directory to each"]},{"entry":[{},"suburb section"]},{"entry":["SD, i = l, . . . , m, j = l, . . . , n","from each suburb section to each"]},{"entry":[{},"cuisine directory"]},{"entry":["RS, j = l, . . . , n","from the root page to each suburb"]},{"entry":[{},"section"]},{"entry":["SC, i = l, . . . , m, j = l, . . . , n","from each suburb section to each"]},{"entry":[{},"corresponding local cuisine sections"]},{"entry":["CC, r , s = l, m, r \u2260 s,","from each cuisine section of a suburb"]},{"entry":["j = l, . . . , n","to the other cuisine sections of the"]},{"entry":[{},"same suburb"]},{"entry":["CD, r, i = l, . . . , m","from each cuisine section of a"]},{"entry":["j = l, . . . , n","suburb to the cuisine"]},{"entry":[{},"directories"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Note that hyperlink definitions can be either \u201cstatic\u201d or \u201cdynamic\u201d. RDand CCare two examples of a \u201cdynamic\u201d hyperlink definition. In the case of RD, a hyperlink is generated between the \u201cstatic\u201d document element R and every occurrence of the \u201cdynamic\u201d document element D. In the case of CC, a hyperlink is generated between every occurrence of two \u201cdynamic\u201d document elements. In contrast, a \u201cstatic\u201d hyperlink definition defines a fixed hyperlink between two \u201cstatic\u201d document elements.","In step , the number of tabs is reduced by assigning multiple hyperlinks to some of the tabs. A tab can be used for multiple hyperlinks that ended at the same page as the tab. In fact, a tab AB can potentially be used for all hyperlinks starting at section A or at a section between A and B and ended at section B provided that the tab is properly labelled on all the pages it passes through and that such use is not confusing to the reader. For instance, tab  of  running from R to Dis shared by hyperlinks RDand DDwhere p=1, . . . , m\u22121. In addition, a tab leading from a page A to a page B provides an implicit return path from page B to page A. Hence, the number of tabs can be reduced by merging tab pairs that have their two tabs start on the page at which other tab ends.","In step , related tabs are nested to reduce the total number of axes required. Nesting tabs on the same axis allows hyperlinks with different target pages to share the same axis therefore making available edge space for other tabs. However, the overall size of the resulting set of nested tabs is larger than a normal tab. Hence, the saving is not exactly n fold for nesting n tabs. Moreover, indiscriminate nesting of tabs may introduce artificial grouping of otherwise unrelated content and confuse the reader. Hence, a set of nested tabs is preferably used only where a natural, logical or determinable relationship exists among the linked materials. Such relationship may be inferred from the structure of the documents. For instance, the set of nested tabs  of  are used for assessing the m restaurant directories each for a different cuisine. In this case, the nesting of tabs reduces the number of axes required from m to 1.","Steps  and  can be fully-automated. However, an editing tool that allows the user to adjust the resulting hyperlinks\/cut-out tabs assignment interactively is sometimes desirable.","In step , presentational style such as the location, colour, size, shape, etc. of the tabs are defined along with the presentational style of the other elements of the documents such as those of the headers, paragraphs, tables, lists, etc. A number of presentational styles  can be defined to allow the document to be presented in different ways.","The structural definitions  of the hypermedia document created as a result of steps  to  and the style definitions  created as a result of step  can be saved and used as a document template  for creating documents of the same type in the future. In the case of the restaurant's guide example of , XML and XSL are used for defining the structure and the style of the document respectively while the hypermedia document  is generated in HTML format.","In step , content is added either interactively using an editor or from data files using a loader or both. Additional hyperlinks and tabs are generated from the \u201cdynamic\u201d hyperlink definitions. It will be appreciated that all copies of the tabs generated from a \u201cdynamic\u201d hyperlink definition can use the same set of axes. For instance, in , the RD's use a single set of nested tabs  and the CC's use the same two axes for their nested tabs .","After the content is added, new content specific hyperlinks and their associated tabs can be defined if required as indicated in step . The number of new tabs can also be reduced using the same methods used in step  and .","It will be appreciated that the hyperlinks in the resulting hypermedia document  are optimally or near-optimally assigned to the cut-out tabs that serve as physical hyperlinks in the printed copy.","Although the forgoing embodiment describes optimising the hyperlinks spread across a number of page using cut-out tabs, the same optimising principles may be applied to individual pages and links on those pages.  shows a traditional arrangement of a hyperlinked page  which includes four hyperlink anchors (Anchor \u2013Anchor ) and two hyperlink destinations, one being a cut-out tab  formed in the page , and the other being a Linked_Component printed on the page . As seen, printed hyperlinks  and  (printed lines on the page) directly connect the Anchor  and Anchor  respectively to the Linked_Component. Similarly, hyperlinks  and  directly connect Anchor  and Anchor  respectively to the cut-out tab . It is apparent from  that some amount of optimisation may be made in order to maximise the available space on the page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 8B"],"b":["1000","1112","1114","1","3","1116","1118","1120","2","4","1122","1002"]},"Whilst the example of  demonstrates the use of printed lines as hyperlink indicia, other indicia may be used. For example, graphic symbols and the like may substitute for the printed lines to provide to the reader the same referential link that otherwise would have been provided in an electronically linked document.","According to the various principles of the embodiments described above, a further embodiment makes use of a knowledge-based sub-system configured to interpret the main knowledge associated with each hyperlink in order to decide if and how certain hyperlinks can be grouped together thus permitting the grouped hyperlinks to be assigned to a set of nested tabs within a hyperlinked documents. Whilst it is possible for grouping of information within the document to be based upon the inherent structure of the electronic document from which the hyperprint physical document is to be derived, such is limited to the extent of structure incorporated in the electronic document and requires the author of the electronic document to specify every grouping interactively. This can be a tedious process and is not a practical solution where the principles of the present invention are intended to provide for the automated translation of a hyperlinked electronic document to a hyperlinked text document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A"]},"According to the present embodiment and as illustrated in , the various features shown in  may be grouped according to the particular type of feature depicted. As will be understood by those familiar with motor cars, the various features illustrated in  may be grouped into two categories, those relating to safety features of the motor car, and those relating to the comfort of the user of the motor car. According to the specific embodiment illustrated in , the various hyperlinks associated with each of the groupings of safety and comfort are combined for the various features indicated on the printed page. As seen, each of the combined hyperlinks refers to a nested arrangement of tabs that may be used in the manner described above to access information relating to the specific features in each grouping.","The embodiment of  relies upon the main knowledge associated with each of the hyperlinks, such knowledge including information regarding the overall grouping for either safety or comfort. A grouping can be used to select or recommend specific graphic symbols, colours, or abbreviated labels and the like associated with any of the cut-out tabs and\/or indicia printed upon the page.","In a further embodiment, style sheets and\/or style definitions may be used, not only in specifying the presentational style of cut-out tabs used in forming the hyperlinked document, but also in specifying those cut-out tabs that are to be implemented for a particular view of the document.","Existing web technology allows the use of XSL-style sheets (XSL=Extensible Stylesheet Language) to extract various components of XML documents for presentation thereby allowing the presentation of different views of the document. Similarly, and according to the present embodiment, different style sheets may be used in selecting those hyperlinks that are important in generating various views of the hyperprint document. In order to achieve such different views, the hyperlinks are required to be marked up according to their particular role, purpose and level of importance.","For example, such a configuration permits the links and tabs, which form the essence of the hypertext document, to be manipulable (editable) like data in any document. For example, with reference to , a particular style sheet may provide for the printed hyperlinks (eg. a directional arrow), to be provided in a variety of colours or in some other form such as formed using dashed or dotted lines. A modified style sheet may also provide for alternate shaped cut-out portions such as semi-circular, square, triangular and the like. Style sheets may also be used for modifying any printed colours or patterns associated with nested cut-outs and tabs. Further, and with specific reference to the example of , a specific style sheet may be used to either include or exclude particular types of information to which hyperlinks may apply. That is, style sheets can be used to select the set of cut-out tabs that should be included in various versions of the document. For example, where desired, those motor car features of  relating to comfort may be excluded in the generation of the hypertext printed document from the electronically hyperlinked source.","The foregoing describes only a number of embodiments of the present invention, and modifications and alternatives can be practiced within the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A to 4D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 10B","FIG. 10A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
