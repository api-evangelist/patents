title: System and method for reproducibly mounting an optical element
abstract: The present invention provides a two-piece apparatus for holding and aligning the MEMS deformable mirror. The two-piece apparatus comprises a holding plate for fixedly holding an adaptive optics element in an overall optical system and a base spatially fixed with respect to the optical system and adapted for mounting and containing the holding plate. The invention further relates to a means for configuring the holding plate through adjustments to each of a number of off-set pads touching each of three orthogonal plane surfaces on the base, wherein through the adjustments the orientation of the holding plate, and the adaptive optics element attached thereto, can be aligned with respect to the optical system with six degrees of freedom when aligning the plane surface of the optical element. The mounting system thus described also enables an operator to repeatedly remove and restore the adaptive element in the optical system without the need to realign the system once that element has been aligned.

DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention, including a paid-up license and the right, in limited circumstances, to require the owner of any patent issuing in this invention to license others on reasonable terms.","The present invention relates to a two-piece apparatus for fixedly holding an Adaptive Optics (\u201cAO\u201d) element in an overall optical system, wherein said AO element may be aligned with respect to said optical system and wherein said aligned AO element may be repeatedly removed and replaced in said optical system without the need for aligning said AO element.","The present invention also relates to a means for spatially aligning the AO element with six degrees of freedom.","The present invention also relates to Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d) and methods for aligning a deformable MEMS micro-mirror array in an optical system.","Mounting systems for use with deformable mirrors are known. See for instance, U.S. Published patent application Ser. No. 20020097509A1, \u201cMounting Apparatus for a Deformable Mirror\u201d, to Graves, et al. However, descriptions of systems that provide the means for repeated replacement and interchangeability of a deformable mirror (MEMS or otherwise) in an optical system without the need to realign the system with each interchange are not known.","An adaptive phoropter has been designed that uses deformable micro-mirror technology that provides a means to correct wave front errors caused by high order aberrations in the structures of the human eye. A design requirement for the prototype adaptive phoropter must allow repeated removal and replacement of a MEMS deformable micro-mirror within the system without the need for realignment of the system with each interchange. It is also a design requirement that multiple MEMS deformable mirrors as well as a rigid plane mirror (the alignment master) be interchangeable within the overall optical system without the need to realign the system.","In order to provide this capability, a two-piece mount, or mirror holding system , shown in , was constructed for holding and aligning the MEMS deformable mirror. The mirror holding system  comprises a backplate  that mounts to and interacts with a base . Backplate  provides a plurality of off-set members on a first surface  onto which any commercially available MEMS deformable micro-mirror array chip  and circuit board  (also known as the \u201ccard\u201d) may be rigidly mounted. Backplate  further includes three sets of six spherical contact pads - arranged on each of three orthogonal second, third, and fourth surfaces -. The six contact pads are oriented such that two sets of three pads (, , and , and ,  and ) each fall along common perpendicular axes. The contact pads are further arranged such that imaginary axes passing though the lengths of pads ,  and , will intersect at a common point, as will similar imaginary axes passing though the lengths of pads , and . In addition, pad  is located on backplate  such that the imaginary axis passing through pad  also passes through the geometric center of MEMS micro-mirror array .","The mirror holding system  is completed by mounting backplate  into and against base  and holding the two parts in place with a spring-loaded fixture (not shown) although any other equivalent means for holding these parts together including an array of magnets, an array of toggle clamps, or a cam locking assembly. Each of the six contact pads - interface with a corresponding adjacent hard point - located on three orthogonal surfaces - on base  corresponding to the three orthogonal surfaces on backplate .","Mirror holding system  operates as follows. Shown in , base  is rigidly mounted in a -axis translational stage  which is itself mounted to an optical bench or \u201cbaseplate\u201d  (shown in FIG. ). The circuit board or card  carrying the MEMS micro-mirror chip  is installed on backplate  as described below in the alignment procedures, particularly procedure #7. As shown by way of representation in , each of the six contact pads is screwed into the backplate with various numbers of shim stock  to provide for tilting and translating backplate  with respect to the base  and therefore with respect to the optical system. Shims  can be added or removed from under any specific pad in order to provide a known change in the angular or spatial position of the MEMS micro-mirror array chip  and circuit board .","The adaptive phoropter is initially aligned using backplate  mounted with a plane mirror (not shown) installed in place of the MEMS deformable mirror and functions as a \u201csurrogate\u201d MEMS mirror device and serves as a master alignment fixture. Each MEMS deformable mirror backplate assembly  is then aligned by adjusting the shims at each contact pad until it matches the master alignment fixture.","Matching the MEMS deformable mirror backplate assemblies to the pre-aligned master provides for interchangeability. Alignment procedures for using assembly  are detailed below.","A special fixture, hereinafter referred to as a \u201creticle fixture,\u201d has been created to hold a glass reticle with a grid pattern in the same location on an AO system as a MEMS device, such as micro-mirror array chip . This item will represent the MEMS device and will be called the surrogate MEMS.","The surrogate MEMS will be used as the reference to which the positioning of the real MEMS devices are compared when they are mounted to the MEMS backplate . This provides for interchangeability between multiple MEMS devices without the need to make compensation adjustments to other components of the AO system.","The reticle fixture (not shown) and backplate  will be bolted to each other to complete the surrogate MEMS assembly. The reticle is placed in the nominal position and orientation relative to the nominal positions of the contact pads - on backplate . Each of contact pads - is installed on the backplate with an initial thickness of shims  installed under them to place them in their nominal positions.","Throughout the remainder of these procedures multiple interchangeable bases  and backplates  are utilized.
