title: Resource allocation in a virtualized environment
abstract: In a virtualized environment, provisioned virtual machines may be migrated between different servers as needed and, accordingly, may be clustered according to particular configurations and requirements. The system described herein provides techniques for controlling the provisioning of users' virtual machines among clusters based on determined requirements obtained from users' service level agreements (SLAs) and in accordance with an optimized allocation of resources to service the processes corresponding to the virtual machines. The provisioning of virtual machines according to the system described herein may be dynamically controlled and allow for over-provisioning of virtual machines to a cluster beyond that which would normally be supported at the cluster absent the provisioning control techniques provided by the system described herein. The over-provisioning may be controllable according to specific requirements identified in each user's SLA.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application relates to the field of computer networks, and more particularly to the field of allocating resources in a computer environment.","In a virtualized environment, hosts use virtual switches to join tenants in a network fabric local to a server. Uplink ports on the switch may be connected to other virtual fabrics or to a real LAN through the host's physical network card. Co-locating diverse tenants in a virtualization environment requires a significant degree of resource isolation. Tenants on one virtual machine should not be able to access CPU processes, stored data, or the network traffic of another. Virtualization products may address this issue by assuming either a) tenants largely belong to the same organization, and\/or b) the number of unique tenants is a relatively small number. Additionally, techniques such as assigning each organization a unique virtual local area network (VLAN) ID may be used to insure that traffic belonging to each unique tenant is sufficiently isolated. Virtual switches automatically tag traffic from a particular tenant, transparently providing data isolation from other tenants.","Tenancies in a virtualized environment may require dynamic allocation, termination and\/or modification (increasing or decreasing capacity) according to business requirements of the tenants. This can make network management a difficult and costly proposition as known virtual machine provisioning processes for given tasks may be resource intensive and require significant human involvement and configuration. In particular, it may difficult to optimize resource allocation to meet the different requirements of multiple tenants.","Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a system that allows for the improved allocation of resources in a virtualized environment.","According to the system described herein, a method of allocating resources in a computer system includes accessing information identifying service requirements between a service provider and each of a plurality of users. Processing resources are allocated to each of the plurality of users according to the information identifying service requirements between each of the plurality of users and the service provider, in which the total number of processing resources allocated to the users exceeds the total number of processing resources available. The processing resources may include at least one virtual machine for each of the users that corresponds to a process serviceable by the service provider, and in which the at least one virtual machine is assigned to at least one server of the service provider according to the allocation of resources to service the process corresponding to the at least one virtual machine. The process corresponding to the at least one virtual machine may require compute resources to be serviced, the compute resources including at least one of: a central processing unit, a memory, storage capacity, and networking bandwidth. The at least one server may be remotely accessible via the Internet to service the process of the at least one virtual machine for each of the users. The virtual machines of the plurality of users may be grouped into at least one cluster for servicing by the service provider. The information identifying service requirements may be accessed from a service level agreement between each of the plurality of users and the service provider. The service provider may provide computing as a service via a cloud computing environment.","According further to the system described herein, a computer readable storage medium stores computer software that allocates resources in a computer system, the computer software including executable code that accesses information identifying service requirements between a service provider and each of a plurality of users. Executable code is provided that allocates processing resources to each of the plurality of users according to the accessed information identifying service requirements between each of the plurality of users and the service provider, in which the total number of processing resources allocated to the users exceeds the total number of processing resources available. The processing resources may include at least one virtual machine for each of the users that corresponds to a process serviceable by the service provider, and wherein the at least one virtual machine is assigned to at least one server of the service provider according to the allocation of resources to service the process corresponding to the at least one virtual machine. The process corresponding to the at least one virtual machine may require compute resources to be serviced, the compute resources including at least one of: a central processing unit, a memory, storage capacity, and networking bandwidth. The at least one server may be remotely accessible via the Internet to service the process of the at least one virtual machine for each of the users. The virtual machines of the plurality of users may be grouped into at least one cluster for servicing by the service provider. The information identifying service requirements may be accessed from a service level agreement between each of the plurality of users and the service provider. The service provider may provide computing as a service via a cloud computing environment.","According to the system described herein, a method of requesting resources in a computer system includes each of a plurality of users providing information identifying service requirements required of a service provider. Each of the plurality of users may request processing resources according to the information identifying service requirements required of the service provider, in which the total number of processing resources requested by all of the plurality of users exceeds the total number of processing resources available at the same time, and in which the service requirements from the information identifying service requirements required of the service provider are satisfied for each of the plurality of users. The processing resources may include at least one virtual machine for each of the users that corresponds to a process serviceable by the service provider, and wherein the at least one virtual machine is assigned to at least one server of the service provider according to the allocation of resources to service the process of the at least one virtual machine. The process corresponding to the at least one virtual machine may require compute resources to be serviced, the compute resources including at least one of: a central processing unit, a memory, storage capacity, and networking bandwidth. The virtual machines of the plurality of users may be grouped into at least one cluster for servicing by the service provider.","According to the system described herein, a computer readable storage medium storing computer software that requests resources in a computer system, the computer software including executable code that provides, for each of a plurality of users, information identifying service requirements required of a service provider. Executable code is provided that requests, for each of the plurality of users, processing resources according to the information identifying service requirements required of the service provider, in which the total number of processing resources requested by all of the plurality of users exceeds the total number of processing resources available at the same time, and in which the service requirements from the information identifying service requirements required of the service provider are satisfied for each of the plurality of users. The processing resources may include at least one virtual machine for each of the users that corresponds to a process serviceable by the service provider, and wherein the at least one virtual machine is assigned to at least one server of the service provider according to the allocation of resources to service the process of the at least one virtual machine. The process corresponding to the at least one virtual machine may require compute resources to be serviced, the compute resources including at least one of: a central processing unit, a memory, storage capacity, and networking bandwidth.

Note that it is possible to eliminate the router  altogether and have one or more of the other routers - manage communication to and from the server system . In an embodiment herein, the router  also provides appropriate security services, such as firewall protection.","Note also that, although each of the subnets - is shown as having three servers, the number of servers coupled to a subnet may be any number, possibly limited only by the physical address space of the subnet. In addition, there may be any number of subnets and, in some instances, the topology of the server system  may be different than that shown. Generally, a server system should be understood as including any system having a plurality of separately addressable servers that may be externally accessible (e.g., through the Internet).","Using virtualization software, one or more of the servers - may be subdivided into a plurality of virtual machines. A virtual machine (VM) is a software implementation of a machine that executes programs like a physical machine. Virtualization software allows multiple virtual machines with separate operating systems, to run in isolation on the same physical machine. Each virtual machine may have its own set of virtual hardware (e.g., RAM, CPU, NIC, etc.) upon which an operating system and applications are loaded. The operating system sees a consistent, normalized set of hardware regardless of the actual physical hardware components. The term \u201cvirtualization software\u201d is used in a broad sense herein to generally refer to any and all software that supports the operation of one or more virtual machines. A number of virtualization software products exist, including the VMware product family provided by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass. A benefit of providing virtual machines is the ability to host multiple, unrelated, tenants (users) in a single physical server. For example, three unrelated tenants, each hosting their own Web site, may all reside on a single one of the servers - that is running virtualization software to present what looks like a single stand-alone server to each of the tenants as well as other visitors to the Web sites. The virtualization software maintains separation of each of the tenants, which each separately access their own virtual server(s).","Additional separation may be provided using one or more VLANs, where one or more of the single physical networks is logically divided into discrete logical LANs that can operate independently of each other. A first group of servers belonging to a VLAN that is on a particular physical LAN may operate independently of a second group of servers on the same physical LAN but belonging to a different VLAN. Note also that servers on different physical LANs may belong to the same VLAN. Thus, for example, if the server  and the server  were on a first VLAN and the server  were on a second VLAN, then the servers ,  would operate as if on the same subnet while the server  would operate as if on a different subnet even though the servers ,  are on the same physical subnet . The VLAN may be implemented using one or more of the routers -,  and\/or appropriate VLAN software, which may be configured to route data communications according to VLAN topology rather than physical topology. Any conventional VLAN implementation may be used, such as that provided by Cisco Systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["51","72","74","76","74","76","72","72","72","51","72","51","72"]},"The virtual gateway\/switch  may act as a gateway, a firewall, and\/or a switch for the virtual machines -. Thus, communication to and from the virtual machines - is through the virtual gateway\/switch , in a manner similar to a LAN connecting to the Internet through a gateway\/router\/firewall where components of the LAN have private addresses for use only within the LAN and communicating entities outside the LAN communicate only with the gateway\/router\/firewall. Some or all of the other servers - may be configured in a manner similar to that discussed herein for the server . Accordingly, for the discussion herein regarding the server , it may be assumed that the same or similar functionality may be provided on some or all of the remaining servers - of the server system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","104","106","104","106","102","104","106","104","106","104","106","104","106"]},"The services provided by the servers  may include compute services as well as data storage and retrieval and related operations, such as data mirroring, cloning, etc. The servers  may be implemented using a plurality of services (and\/or interconnected servers including SAN components) that are provided by interconnected processing and\/or storage devices. In an embodiment herein, each of the clients - may be coupled to the servers  using the Internet, possibly in conjunction with local TCP\/IP connections. However, it is possible for one or more of the clients - to be coupled to the servers  using any other appropriate communication mechanism and\/or combinations thereof to provide the functionality described herein.

According to the system described herein, online compute services may be provided using a cloud configuration like that shown in  to provide on-demand compute capacity along with online storage and network infrastructure. As further discussed elsewhere herein, online compute services may be used to execute applications in a virtual environment and resources may be allocated to efficiently manage use of the compute resources according to the system described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["104","102","104","102","104","102","104","106","104","106","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["104","102","108","102","104","108","104","104","102","104","102","104","106","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["104","122","124","125","126","128","122","124","122","104","102","124","104","122","125","124","102","126","128","125","122","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["102","202","208","202","208","202","208","104","106"]},"The servers  may also include a user management interface  that facilitates system management. The management interface  exchanges data with one or more of the servers - to affect how the servers  interact with the clients - and corresponding users. The data may be provided through the user management interface  in any one of a number of ways, including conventional interactive computer screen input and data file input (e.g., a text file having user management commands). The data may include information that correlates classes of users and storage parameters such as Quality of Service (QOS), RAID protection level, number and geographic location(s) of mirrors, etc. For example, an administrator may specify through the user management interface  that users of a particular class (users belonging to a particular group) store data file objects on storage devices having a particular RAID level protection. The servers  may also include physical storage  coupled to one or more of the serves -, for example the server  as data storage servers. Although the physical storage  is shown as a single item, there may be any number of separate physical storage units that may be geographically dispersed. In addition, there may be different types of physical storage units having different capabilities. Accordingly, the physical storage  may generically represent one or more instances of physical data storage for the system that is managed by the data storage servers .","Additionally, one or more of the servers - may be used in connection with performing online compute services in virtualized environments according to the system described herein. A compute service according to the system described herein provides on-demand compute capacity, and\/or along with storage infrastructure, which may be used to execute applications in a cloud computing environment. Online compute services may be referred to herein as computing as a service or \u201cCaaS\u201d. Any of the servers -, the user interface module  and\/or software provided on one or more of the clients - may be used in connection with performing one or more of the functions that are discussed herein.","CaaS and\/or other online functionality may be provided by web services that enable the launching and managing of servers in virtual data centers using APIs and\/or available tools and utilities. For example, the Atmos Online Services provided by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass. provide a set of Internet-accessible services that provide self-service compute and storage capacity in the cloud. The EMC Atmos Online Storage service delivers secure storage based on EMC Atmos. The EMC Atmos Online Compute service delivers servers on-demand based on VMware virtualization.","In a virtualization environment, a virtual center may provide a central point of control for managing, monitoring, provisioning and migrating virtual machines. The virtual center provides for managing virtual machines to be deployed at one or more virtual data centers and may perform virtual machine lifecycle management tasks, administer users and roles, and view usage metrics, among other functionality. Virtual centers and virtual data centers may operate to control virtual machines in customer data centers and in connection with cloud computing including both internal and external cloud infrastructures and hybrids thereof. Configuring and deploying virtual machines is known in the field of computer science. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,577,722 to Khandekar, et al., entitled \u201cProvisioning of Computer Systems Using Virtual Machines,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference, discloses techniques for configuring and deploying a virtual machine according to user specifications.","Operations of virtual machine may use virtual machines images. A virtual machine image is a file containing a program that may be loaded and executed by a virtual machine and may include additional information used in connection with executing the program. A virtual machine image may be obtained for an operating virtual machine and transferred to another location where another virtual machine may use the virtual machine image to continue execution of the program from the state defined by the virtual machine image. In this way, the virtual machine image may be a snapshot of an execution state of a program by a virtual machine that may be moved between different locations and processing thereafter continued without interruption.","A user may subscribe to a service (such as EMC Atmos Online Compute Service) that provides CaaS functionality and may contract with the service provider for a service level agreement (SLA) that may define service performance metrics and corresponding service level objectives. Fulfilling CaaS function requirements requires access to compute resources. In virtualized environments, compute resources include central processing units (CPU), memory, storage and networking. The system described herein provides for optimizing compute resource allocation based on a configurable over-provisioning factor and usage of existing resources, as further discussed elsewhere herein.","Virtual machines may be grouped into clusters that share similar configurations. Usage of resources of the different clusters may be tracked. Usage metrics may be measured by the compute service according to the system described herein. The compute service may meter usage of CPU (e.g., in GHz-hours), memory (e.g., in GB-hours) and\/or virtual machine image storage (e.g., in GB-days), among others. Data for current usage and\/or historical usage may be accessed using a management console, for example, using the user management interface . The management console may provide a graphical tool for managing a virtual compute environment allow: browsing the compute service environment to view details of an a virtual center, a virtual data center, the state of deployed virtual machines, networks, and tasks; manage the lifecycle of virtual machines from upload to deployment, and power on\/off, suspend and clone; assign the compute service admin role to users so that the users can access the compute service; view system metrics for resource usage including storage, CPU, and memory; and enable access to other online services, such as a storage service. Other compute service tools that may be provided in connection with operation of the system described herein may include a command line interface that lets a user prepare virtual management image files for upload to a virtual data center Further, an application programming interface (API), such as a representational state transfer (REST)-based API may be provided that lets a user perform management and administration actions on the virtual data center and the virtual machines. Other software tools may be used in connection with the system described herein.","The system described herein provides techniques for the efficient use of compute resources. As further noted elsewhere herein, virtual machines may be grouped into clusters that share similar configurations. For example, virtual machines may be clustered according to particular processing requirements in connection with compute servers. According to the system described herein, more virtual machines may be assigned to a cluster than the cluster would normally be expected to service at the same time based on the use of an over-provisioning factor that is configured according to user SLAs.","An SLA may include various customer requirements and service provider objectives in connection with providing services, such as cloud computing services, as discussed elsewhere herein. For example, the SLA may indicate how many virtual machines a customer estimates would be required over certain time periods, for example, on a hourly, daily, weekly basis, etc. In other embodiments, the SLA may indicate processing performance requirements (for example processing requirements measured in GHz-hours), network performance requirements and\/or storage requirements, among any other suitable requirements set forth in the SLA. The SLA may be stored in a computer-readable format in which requirements of the SLA may be harvested for use in connection with the system described herein. The SLAs may be stored on and\/or accessible by the servers  and\/or the clients -.","The properties of virtual machines allow users' provisioned virtual machines to be migrated between different servers as needed and, accordingly, may be clustered according to particular configurations and requirements as further discussed elsewhere herein. Accordingly, the system described herein provides techniques for controlling the provisioning of users' virtual machines among clusters based on determined requirements obtained from the users' SLAs. Instead of provisioning user's virtual machines only on a fixed basis per cluster, for example according to a pre-specified usage level (e.g., low-usage requirements, medium-usage requirements or high-usage level requirements), the provisioning of virtual machines according to the system described herein may be dynamically controlled and allow for over-provisioning of users' virtual machines to a cluster beyond that which would normally be supported at the cluster absent the provisioning control techniques provided by the system described herein. As further discussed herein, the over-provisioning may be controllable according to specific requirements identified in each user's SLA. Specifically, the system described herein may provide that although the total number of virtual machines allocated to each of the plurality of users exceeds the total number of virtual machines available at the same time, processes corresponding to each of the virtual machines are processed satisfactorily according to each user's SLA. It may be noted that although the system described herein is described principally in connection with the use of virtual machines, and processes corresponding thereto, it may be understood that other types of processing resources may also be used in connection with the system and techniques described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["300","302","1","311","2","312","3","313","1","2","3","311","313","1","2","3","311","313","1","311","2","312","3","313","2","312","1","2","3","311","313"]},"As illustrated, by allocating the resources of the cluster dynamically according to the user's SLA requirements, e.g., based on the illustrated Time Periods, the total number of allocated resources to service process of the virtual machines may exceed the total number of the resources that are available at the same time. The over-provisioning of virtual machines in the manner set forth by the system described herein enables a more efficient allocation of resources to satisfactorily meet the requirements of each user's SLA. It should also be noted that although the allocation of resources of a cluster is illustrated in connection with performance based on time periods, other embodiments according to the system described herein for assigning virtual machines to one or more clusters may use performance requirements other than that based on time periods. The resources allocated in the cluster may correspond to any desirable resource for a particular application, including, for example, compute resources used in connection with cloud computing as further discussed elsewhere herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["300","300","300","4","314","4","314","4","1","2","3","311","313","4","314","4","314","4","4","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["300","300","300","2","312","2","312","2","312","5","315","5","315"]},"In connection with the system described herein, users' SLA requirements may be enforced by the system described herein in order to correctly allocate resources to a cluster. For example, after the removal of the allocation for User #  from Time Period A and B as illustrated in , User #  may not thereafter be able to access resources at Time Period A and B since another allocation of resources would have been made for the new User # . Alternatively, the system described herein may also provide for tracking of actual usage of allocated resources and enable use of resources by a user that were not previously allocated according to actual tracked usage metrics. As further discussed elsewhere herein tracked metrics may include CPU usage (e.g., in GHz-hours), memory (e.g., in GB-hours) and\/or storage capacity (e.g., in GB-days), among others. In an embodiment, the system described herein may provide a priority schema in which a user with allocated resources on a cluster has priority over other users such that in the event that other non-allocated users may have their processing operations suspended if the user requires usage for a time period that was previously allocated to that user according to the users' SLA. Other embodiments may be provided for allocated resources according to actual usage and\/or processing needs in connection with the system described herein, including, for example, the exchange of allocated resources among users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["400","402","402","404","404","406"]},"After the step , processing proceeds to a test step  where it is determined whether the allocation of resources for one or more of the clusters needs to a modified to reflect changed processing requirements. For example, the changes to the processing requirements may include a change to one or more of the SLAs of current users' reflecting changes in the virtual machines required for the current users, may include a change to assign virtual machines from a new user and\/or may reflect the tracking of usage metrics of the users, as further discussed elsewhere herein. Alternatively, the system may automatically periodically review the allocation of resources to determine if changes are necessary for current user SLA requirements. If at the test step , it is determined that resource allocation is to be modified, processing may proceed back to the step . If at the test step , it is determined that the resource allocation is not to be modified, then processing is complete.","In various embodiments, the system described herein may provide multiple CaaS application servers to accommodate a large number of user access from the management console.

This provides a CaaS logic view of the virtual center status rather than expose the virtual center physical view to the end user. For example, during the process or registering a virtual machine in a virtual data center, the virtual data center may show up only after the post configuration is done. Further, the performance of query may be improved and the number of requests to the virtual center may be minimized. Virtual machine or virtual data center information stored in the CaaS DB may be queried more efficiently than the virtual center.

As a result, the content of the CaaS DB may not be exactly the same as the virtual center status. In order to address this problem, a flag in a table corresponding to the virtual data center may be set to identify the inconsistency in an exception handler. Whenever another virtual data center wants to query the information related to the subject virtual data center, the flag may be checked beforehand. If the flag designates an inconsistency, a sync tool with the scope of this virtual data center may be run to resolve the issue. Once the data is recovered and the inconsistency resolved, the flag may be reset.","Various of the embodiments discussed herein may be combined with each other in appropriate combinations in connection with the system described herein.
