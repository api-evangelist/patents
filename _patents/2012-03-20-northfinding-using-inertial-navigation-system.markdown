title: North-finding using inertial navigation system
abstract: A true north heading is determined by using gyroscopes of differing accuracy and orienting a gyroscope of a higher accuracy to a direction that is more sensitive to azimuth change (e.g., an east/west direction). A gyroscope with a lower accuracy is placed perpendicular to the gyroscope with a higher accuracy and can be oriented towards a north or south direction. The gyroscopes may be placed on a rotatable platform to properly orient the gyroscopes. The higher-accuracy gyroscope may be implemented by using multiple gyroscopes oriented in the same direction.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. W15P7T-08-D-P416, awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present disclosure relates to determining the orientation of a targeting platform and\/or the navigation heading of a vehicle. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to inertial north-finding systems.","In a variety of applications, the orientation of a platform or the direction of travel of a vehicle (i.e., the heading) is used to point, orient, or guide the platform or the vehicle. Some conventional systems measure the heading using a floating magnetic compass or strap-down magnetic vector sensor, both of which measure the Earth's magnetic field. Other conventional navigation systems use the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), Galileo, or GLONASS. The accuracy of these conventional navigation systems is, however, influenced by various factors including, for example, signal strength, or local variations in magnetic field.","Gyroscope-based navigation systems may also be used to determine a heading of a vehicle. These systems use the Earth's rotational rate vector as a reference to directly determine the heading of the vehicle. Because measurement of the Earth's rotational rate vector is unaffected by local magnetic fields, satellite signal strength, or other confounding influences, gyroscope-based navigation systems and methods can be a reliable method for determining the heading of a object. However, using gyroscopes having the accuracy needed for navigation, such as ring-laser gyroscopes (RLG) or fiber optic gyroscopes (FOG), can be expensive.","Embodiments relate to determining a true north heading by using gyroscopes of different accuracies and orienting a gyroscope of a higher accuracy to a direction that is more sensitive to azimuth change (e.g., in east\/west direction). A gyroscope with a lower accuracy is placed perpendicular to the gyroscope with a higher accuracy and can be oriented approximately in a north\/south direction. The gyroscopes may be placed and rotated on a platform to properly orient the gyroscopes.","The higher-accuracy gyroscope may be implemented by using multiple gyroscopes oriented in the same direction. The measurement error of the multiple gyroscopes can be identified and\/or calculated, and removed from the gyroscope measurements. In some embodiments, this error correction can be accomplished when the source of the measurement error is uncorrelated between the multiple gyroscopes.","The Figures (FIG.) and the following description relate to preferred embodiments of the present invention by way of illustration only. It should be noted from the following discussion, that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein will be readily recognized as viable alternatives that may be employed without departing from the principles of the claimed invention.","Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments of the present invention(s), examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is noted that wherever practicable, similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only.","Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to determining a true north heading or orientation with respect to true north by using gyroscopes of different accuracies and orienting a gyroscope of a higher accuracy to a direction that is more sensitive to azimuth change (e.g., in the east\/west direction). In one embodiment, a gyroscope with a lower accuracy is placed perpendicular to the gyroscope with a higher accuracy and can be oriented approximately in a north\/south direction. The gyroscopes may be placed and rotated on a platform to properly orient the gyroscopes. The higher-accuracy gyroscope may be implemented by using multiple gyroscopes oriented in the same direction. In another embodiment, the true north heading or orientation with respect to true north can be determined by roughly orienting a gyroscope from approximately 0\u00b0 to approximately 30\u00b0 from true north, and then using the gyroscope to determine a more precise heading or orientation.","A gyroscope as described herein refers to a sensor or a device for measuring angular rotation of a body about a predetermined axis. The gyroscope may include, for example, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope, a ring-laser gyroscope (RLG) or fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) or a conventional mechanical gyroscope. The accuracy of the gyroscope can depend on the type or structure of the gyroscopes used.","A vehicle described herein refers to a body that can travel from one point to another point. Types of vehicles can include land transport vehicles, water-going vessels, and air vehicles. Some vehicles can be self-propelled. Example of vehicles can include, but are not limited to, an automobile, a truck, a tank or mobile artillery unit, a remote or autonomously controlled robot (e.g., the Mars Rover, or a mobile terrestrial robot), other manned or un-manned ground vehicles, an airplane, a helicopter, a missile or other un-manned projectile, an unmanned airplane, a spacecraft, an ocean-going ship, a ship-mounted artillery unit, or a drilling platform.","While a vehicle is used throughout the present disclosure for illustration purposes, embodiments herein are equally applicable for determining the spatial orientation with respect to true north of stationary objects, such as a targeting platform. The targeting platform described herein refers to a platform which provides an azimuth and attitude reference. Types of targeting platforms can include optical targeting systems, weapon targeting devices, orientation references for construction and\/or survey applications, personal handheld targeting modules, and other applications in which heading determination is useful.","Embodiment of an Inertial North-Finding System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["104","108","108","104","104","108","104","108","104","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["108","108","212","232","252","268","272","276"]},"The embodiment of the sensor array  depicted in  includes a z-axis gyroscope , an x-axis gyroscope , a y-axis gyroscope  (in one embodiment formed from two or more gyroscopes A through N that collectively operate as a single higher accuracy gyroscope), accelerometers , and temperatures sensors . In some embodiments, only the y-axis gyroscope  is needed for north finding. The x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis are defined in this example by the body-frame of the vehicle  (illustrated in relationship to the vehicle in  as a \u201cNorth-East-Down\u201d reference frame). In this embodiment, the y-axis gyroscope  has a higher accuracy compared to the x-axis gyroscope . For this purpose, the y-axis gyroscope  may be of a different type of gyroscope than the x-axis gyroscope  or may be multiple gyroscopes operating collectively for a higher accuracy.","In some embodiments, the sensors , , , , and  take measurements at a frequency of about 1000 Hz. Furthermore, the presence of the z-axis gyroscope  is optionally included in the system , and used for determination of vehicle yaw. As with the gyroscopes , , A and B, the accelerometers  can be of any type.","When multiple gyroscopes A through N operate as a single y-axis gyroscope, the gyroscopes A through N are all aligned along the y-axis of the body-frame of the vehicle . As mentioned above, two or more gyroscopes aligned in the same direction can be used collectively to improve the accuracy of the measurements in that direction. The mathematical tools underpinning this improvement will be explained in more detail in the context of . Furthermore, the accuracy of the north-finding function of the system  can be improved when the gyroscope  is aligned with the east\/west direction, as explained in the context of .","The temperature sensors  measure the temperature of the various sensors of the sensor array , and of the components of the data module . These temperature measurements are then provided to a data sampling module , or alternatively, directly to a processor , in order to correct for temperature-related measurement artifacts. For example, if the system  is used in an aircraft at a high altitude, the extremely low temperatures at this altitude may introduce error into measurements through, for example, changes in physical dimensions, physical properties, and\/or electrical properties of the sensors. By using the temperature sensors  to measure the ambient temperatures, whether inside the vehicle, outside the vehicle, or within the sensor array  (or within the components thereof), the measurements provided by the sensors of the sensor array can be corrected.","The rotary stage assembly  is used to align the y-axis gyroscope  (connected to a rotary stage ) with the east\/west direction. As explained in more detail below, aligning the y-axis gyroscope  in this manner improves the north-finding function of the system . The rotary stage assembly  may include, among other components, the rotary stage , a rotary stage motor , a controller , and an encoder . In the example shown in , only the components of the sensor array  are disposed on the rotary stage , although other components from the data module , such a data sampling module , may also reside on the rotary stage .","In this embodiment, the rotary stage  is rotated by the motor . The motor  can include one or more servo-motors, stepper-motors, or other types of motors known in the art for articulating a rotary stage. Furthermore, mechanisms other than those described above can be used to orient the rotary stage . For example, pneumatic actuators or hydraulic cylinders may be used to move the rotary stage . Further, the movement of the rotary stage  need not be one of pure rotation. That is, the movement of the rotary stage  may be a combination of linear motion and rotational motion.","In this embodiment, the motor  is controlled by the controller . The controller  receives a signal from the encoder , which determines the current rotational angle of the rotary stage . Using a signal from the encoder , and optionally a signal from the processor , that identifies the current orientation of the y-axis gyroscope , the controller  can rotate the rotary stage  by sending a signal to the motor  so as to properly orient the gyroscopes , , .","As part of the alignment process, the encoder  generates a signal that identifies the rotational angle of the rotary stage  that is, in turn, communicated to the controller . This signal can then be used to orient the rotary stage , and any sensors thereon, with, for example, the east\/west direction. In one embodiment, a feedback control loop may be implemented using the controller  and the encoder  to more accurately control the rotational angle of the rotary platform . While the encoder  is shown here, other sensors may also be employed to measure rotation and\/or linear motion of the rotary stage .","Continuing with , data from the sensor array  and from the encoder  are provided to the data module . The data module  collects, corrects, and processes the information in preparation for presentation to a user (whether a human or a machine client) of the system . In this embodiment, the data module  includes a data sampling module , and the processor . In some embodiments, the temperature sensors  may be disposed in the data module  instead of within the sensor array . The data sampling module  periodically receives measurements from the sensors of the sensor array . In this embodiment, the data sampling module  can receive data provided by these various data sources, as well as retrieve the data by periodically soliciting the data sources for new data. In some embodiments, the data sampling module  can receive data at a frequency of about 100 Hz. Also, in this embodiment, the data sampling module  is an A\/D converter that converts analog signals provided by the data sources into digital signals in preparation for processing at the processor . In one embodiment, the data sampling module  is capable of 24-bit quantization or higher resolution. In another embodiment, the data sampling module  is connected to the processor  via a serial peripheral interface bus.","In other embodiments, the data sampling module  is unnecessary because data from the gyroscopes, (e.g., the gyroscopes , , , the accelerometers , the encoder , the temperature sensors , and any other data sources), are provided as digital signals directly to the processor . Alternatively, the signals are provided as analog signals but are converted to digital signals within the processor .","Continuing with the embodiment depicted in , the data sampling module  provides the measurement data taken by the sensors of the sensor array  to the processor . The processor  is a hardware component for executing computer instructions. The processor  may be embodied, for example, as a digital signal processor (DSP) or as another type of processor. The processor  performs various operations on the data, the operations including, but not limited to, providing sensor calibrations and corrections, executing navigation algorithms, and communicating navigation state information to a user through a communication interface . In one embodiment, the processor  includes a non-transitory computer-readable memory (not shown) that can store one or more of calibration data, device and system configuration data, sensor data, and executable code. In one embodiment, the processor  is capable of 64-bit floating computation to compute a precise navigation state using complex algorithms.","After performing all, some, or none, of the above-described operations, the processor  provides the processed sensor measurements (including the true-north heading calculated by the processor according to the example method shown in ) to the communications interface . The communications interface  conveys the processed data to a user system , which can be accessed by a human user or a client device. Additionally, the communications interface  can also be configured to receive input from the user system . For example, navigation instructions, data correction, time synchronization messages and location information such as latitude can be communicated to the system  using the user system . The user system  can be, for example, a general purpose computer, a mobile communications device, a specially adapted computer, or any other device used to communicate with a computer system, such as that embodied by the system .","Furthermore, the communications interface  can optionally receive input from a GNSS receiver . Receiving input from the GNSS receiver  provides position and time information to the processor , which can be used to determine the starting location of the vehicle  as an input to the north-finding algorithm. Alternatively, input from the GNSS receiver  can be used throughout execution of the north-finding process and\/or algorithm as part of an error checking and\/or correction method.","In one embodiment, the inertial north-finding system  described above is implemented in a rugged enclosure that includes some or all of the components described above. In one embodiment, the system  has a compact arrangement achieved through the use of small gyroscopes (e.g., MEMS devices). In another embodiment, the system  is implemented on a general purpose computer that is coupled with the rotary stage assembly  and the sensor array .","Enhanced Accuracy of Y-Axis Gyroscope","Embodiments of system  may use multiple lower-accuracy gyroscopes aligned in the same direction, and process signals from these gyroscopes to obtain a signal of higher accuracy. When the source of gyroscope noise is uncorrelated between the y-axis and x-axis gyroscopes, \u03b5and \u03b5(the error measurements of the two gyroscopes respectively) are reduced by using multiple gyroscopes oriented along an axis\u2014in this embodiment, along the y-axis. For example, the noise level attributable to a single gyroscope is described by Equation 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["M","N"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["m","i"]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{}],"sub":["N ","i ","n ","N ","i ","i","N","I"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":"\/\u221an"},"It is the application of Equation 2 to the embodiments of the present disclosure that contributes to the improved north-finding accuracy of arrays of multiple, aligned gyroscopes. That is, the accuracy of the system as a whole can be improved by using multiple gyroscopes, even gyroscopes individually having a lower accuracy.","When using multiple gyroscopes, the signals are received by the data sampling module  and their average value is computed. A weighted average method may also be applied if the gyroscopes have different accuracies. As mentioned above, this improvement can be used alone or in combination with aligning the gyroscopes with the east\/west direction.","East\/West Gyroscope Alignment","As described above, it is advantageous to align the y-axis gyroscope  of the north-finding system  in the east\/west direction to improve the accuracy of the system. As illustrated in , the sensitivity of a gyroscope to changes in the azimuth is significantly improved when the gyroscope is aligned in the east\/west direction because a change in angle in this orientation causes a larger change of the Earth Rotation Vector measurement compared to non-east\/west direction orientations. Because of this, the gyroscope error, which remains approximately constant regardless of gyroscope orientation, makes a proportionately smaller contribution to the gyroscope measurement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["108","404","404","404"]},"North-Finding",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","108","504","220","224","504","228","230"]},"These signals are preprocessed  to remove and\/or reduce the measurement errors.

However, as described below, this repetition is not required.","In some embodiments, particularly when initially orienting the system within approximately 0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 of true north, only a single iteration of the above process need be used. In some examples of this embodiment, this initial orientation can be accomplished by using the sunrise, the sunset, the moonrise or moonset, astral alignment, magnetic compass, or other means of approximately orienting the system with true north. In these embodiments, because of the initial orientation of the system , only a single gyroscope is needed.","While particular embodiments and applications have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are not limited to the precise construction and components disclosed herein. Various modifications, changes and variations, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, may be made in the arrangement, operation and details of the method and apparatus disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope defined in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
