No. 13\/660,010, filed Oct. 25, 2012, which claim the benefit under 35 U.S.C.\u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/552,592 filed Oct. 28, 2011. Each of the aforementioned U.S. Applications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to chemical compounds that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and are expected to have utility in raising HDL-C, lowering LDL-C, and in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and peripheral vascular disease, represent a truly enormous burden to the health care systems of the industrialized world. In the United States alone, approximately 13 million patients have been diagnosed with CHD, and greater than one half million deaths are attributed to CHD each year. Further, this toll is expected to grow over the next quarter century as an epidemic in obesity and diabetes continues to grow.","It has long been recognized that in mammals, variations in circulating lipoprotein profiles correlate with the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD. The clinical success of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, especially the statins, in reducing coronary events is based on the reduction of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), levels of which correlate directly with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. More recently, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and atherosclerosis, leading to the conclusion that low serum HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk for CHD.","Metabolic control of lipoprotein levels is a complex and dynamic process involving many factors. One important metabolic control in man is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein that catalyzes the movement of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the apoB containing lipoproteins, especially VLDL (see Hesler, C. B., et. al. (1987) 262(5), 2275-2282)). Under physiological conditions, the net reaction is a heteroexchange in which CETP carries triglyceride to HDL from the apoB lipoprotein and transports cholesterol ester from HDL to the apoB lipoprotein.","In humans, CETP plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, the process whereby cholesterol is returned to the liver from peripheral tissues. Intriguingly, many animals do not possess CETP, including animals that have high HDL levels and are known to be resistant to coronary heart disease, such as rodents (see Guyard-Dangremont, V., et. al., (1998) 14 120(3), 517-525). Numerous epidemiologic studies correlating the effects of natural variation in CETP activity with respect to coronary heart disease risk have been performed, including studies on a small number of known human null mutations (see Hirano, K.-I., Yamashita, S, and Matsuzawa, Y. (2000) 11(6), 589-596). These studies have clearly demonstrated an inverse correlation between plasma HDL-C concentration and CETP activity (see Inazu, A., et. al. (2000) 11(4), 389-396), leading to the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of CETP lipid transfer activity may be beneficial to humans by increasing levels of HDL-C while lowering LDL-C.","Despite the significant therapeutic advance that statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin represent, statins only achieve a risk reduction of approximately one-third in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events. Currently, few pharmacologic therapies are available that favorably raise circulating levels of HDL-C. Certain statins and some fibrates offer modest HDL-C gains. Niacin provides an effective therapy for raising HDL-C but suffers from patient compliance issues, due in part to side effects such as flushing. Drugs that inhibit CETP (CETP inhibitors) have been under development with the expectation that they will effectively raise HDL cholesterol levels and also reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients. Torcetrapib was the first drug that was tested in a long-term outcomes clinical trial. The clinical trial of torcetrapib was terminated early due to a higher incidence of mortality in patients to whom torcetrapib and atorvastatin were administered concomitantly compared with patients who were treated with atorvastatin alone. The cause of the increased mortality is not completely understood, but it is not believed to be associated with the CETP inhibiting effects of the drug. Dalcetrapib was recently tested in a Phase III outcomes trial, which was terminated early because the interim data did not show a clinical benefit. There were no safety issues detected for dalcetrapib.","Anacetrapib is currently the only CETP inhibitor being tested in a large scale Phase III clinical outcomes trial. Data from the recently completed DEFINE Phase II\/III trial of anacetrapib are promising. Patients who were treated with anacetrapib along with baseline statin therapy showed an increase of HDL-C of 138% and a decrease of LDL-C of 40% compared with patients who were treated with just a statin. See: 2010:363:2406-15. The DEFINE study was not carried out on a large enough scale to serve as a pivotal outcomes trial, but the data in the DEFINE trial were sufficient to indicate that an increase in mortality for patients treated with anacetrapib is unlikely. Additional drug candidates are in development. Evacetrapib currently appears to be the next CETP inhibitor that will proceed to a Phase III outcomes trial. Additional compounds are being sought that may have properties that are advantageous compared with the CETP inhibitors that have so far been studied or are currently being studied. Such properties may include, for example, higher potency, reduced off-target activity, better pharmacodynamics, higher bioavailability, or a reduced food effect compared with many of the highly lipophilic compounds that have so far been studied. \u201cFood effect\u201d refers to the variability in exposure to the active drug that occurs depending on when the patient had last eaten, whether or not the drug is administered with food, and the fat content of the food.","The compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is a potent CETP inhibitor, having the utilities described below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"30.06mm","wi":"58.17mm","file":"US09346825-20160524-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula I, Ris H, \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, \u2014OC-Calkynyl, \u2014OH, halogen, \u2014CN, \u2014NRR, \u2014COR, \u2014C(O)NRR, \u2014SONRR, HET(3), or Ccycloalkyl optionally having 1-2 double bonds, wherein \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, and \u2014OC-Calkynyl are each optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens, and wherein HET(3) and Ccycloalkyl optionally having 1-2 double bonds are optionally substituted with 1-3 substituent groups which are each independently halogen, \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, or \u2014OC-Calkynyl, wherein \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, and \u2014OC-Calkynyl are each optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens;","Rand Rare each independently H or \u2014C-Calkyl;","Ris H or \u2014Calkyl optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens;","HET(3) is a 3-6 membered heterocyclic ring having 1-3 heteroatom groups which are each independently N, NH, O, S, S(O), or S(O)and optionally having 1-3 double bonds;","x is 0 or 1;","The dashed lines in Formula I represent one optional double bond between 2 adjacent carbon atoms;","Dis N or CR;","Dis N or CR;","Dis N or CR;","R, R, and Rare each independently H, \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, \u2014OC-Calkynyl, \u2014OH, halogen, \u2014CN, \u2014NRR, \u2014COR, \u2014C(O)NRR, or \u2014SONRR, wherein \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, and \u2014OC-Calkynyl are optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens;","Each Ris independently \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, \u2014OC-Calkynyl, \u2014OH, halogen, \u2014CN, \u2014NRR, \u2014COR, \u2014C(O)NRR, or \u2014SONRR, wherein \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, and \u2014OC-Calkynyl are optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens;","Ais phenyl, HET(1), or C-Ccycloalkyl optionally having 1-2 double bonds, wherein Ais optionally substituted with one substituent group Z and is optionally substituted with 1-3 groups which are each independently \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, \u2014OC-Calkynyl, halogen, \u2014OH, or \u2014CN, wherein \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, and \u2014OC-Calkynyl are optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens;","Each HET(1) is a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring having 1-4 heteroatom groups which are each independently \u2014N\u2014, \u2014NH\u2014, \u2014S\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, or \u2014S(O)\u2014, optionally having one group \u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014, and optionally having 1-3 double bonds;","Z is A, \u2014C-Calkylene-COR, \u2014C-Calkylene-C(O)NRR, \u2014C-Calkylene-SONRR, \u2014COR, \u2014C(O)NRR, \u2014SONRR, or \u2014C-Calkylene-HET(2), wherein \u2014C-Calkylene in all uses is optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens, and HET(2) is optionally substituted with 1-3 substituents which are independently \u2014Calkyl optionally substituted with 1-5 halogens, \u2014OC-Calkyl optionally substituted with 1-5 halogens, halogen or NRR.","Ais phenyl, C-Ccycloalkyl optionally having 1-2 double bonds, or HET(1), wherein Ais optionally substituted with 1-3 groups which are each independently \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, \u2014OC-Calkynyl, halogen, \u2014OH, or \u2014CN, wherein \u2014C-Calkyl, \u2014OC-Calkyl, \u2014C-Calkenyl, \u2014OC-Calkenyl, \u2014C-Calkynyl, and \u2014OC-Calkynyl are optionally substituted with 1-7 halogens;

There are reports in the scientific literature that suggest that inhibition of CETP may have utility in preventing or slowing the development of Alzheimer's disease. The compounds of Formula I and Ia may therefore have utility in preventing or delaying the progression of Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative diseases.","The compounds disclosed herein are particularly effective in raising HDL-C and\/or increasing the ratio of HDL-C to LDL-C. The compounds may also be effective in reducing LDL-C, and may be effective in treating dyslipidemia. These changes in HDL-C and LDL-C may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, or preventing atherosclerosis. The compounds disclosed herein may thus be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, or preventing atherosclerosis.","Likely indications for atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia using the compounds described herein are written below, where the drug product is titled \u201cCETP inhibitor:\u201d","Atherosclerosis.","In patients at high risk of cardiovascular events because of existing coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease, CETP inhibitor co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated to reduce the risk of coronary mortality, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedures, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death.","Dyslipidemia.","CETP inhibitor co-administered with a statin is indicated to reduce elevated LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), non-HDL-C, and total cholesterol; and increase HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) in patients with mixed or primary dyslipidemia.","Administration and Dose Ranges","Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of the compounds described herein.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the compound of Formula I or Ia or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered. A pharmaceutical composition may also consist essentially of the compound of Formula I or Ia, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, without other therapeutic ingredients.","Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated to be suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.","In practical use, the compound of Formula I or Ia can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.","Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compound can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.","The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.","Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.","The compound of formula I or Ia may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of the compound can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.","The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.","Combination Therapy","The compound of Formula I or Ia, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be used in pharmaceutical combinations with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which the compound of Formula I or Ia is useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with the compound of Formula I or Ia. When the compound of Formula I or Ia is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I or Ia is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I or Ia and one or more other drugs are administered concomitantly, on the same or different schedules.","When oral formulations are used, the drugs may be combined into a single combination tablet or other oral dosage form, or the drugs may be packaged together as separate tablets or other oral dosage forms. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of formula I or Ia and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the compound of formula I or Ia include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to the compound of Formula I or Ia.","The compound of Formula I or Ia will likely be approved initially for coadministration with a statin, which could be administered in the form of a fixed dose combination of the compound of formula I or Ia and a statin.

Then compounds at varying concentrations were incubated with 15 nM CETP (reagent production group, In Vitro Pharmacology, MRL Rahway) and 50 ug\/ml of the biotinylated LDL in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction was started by adding H-cholesterol ester high density lipoprotein (HDL) (American Radiochemicals Corp) at a concentration of \u02dc0.6 nM. The reaction proceeded for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C., after which time it was quenched by the addition of 12% acetic acid. PVT streptavadin-coated scintillation proximity beads, which had been brought to room temperature, were then added at a concentration of 4 mg\/ml. The assay was then mixed and counted after one half hour in a Microbeta plate reader.","In Vitro Radioactive Assays of CETP-Catalyzed CE and TG Transfer (RTA Assay)","Reagents and sources are: [3H] cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK.886), [3H] Triolein (Perkin-Elmer NET-431), Butylated hydroxyl toluene (Aldrich, #D4740-4), DOPC (Sigma, #P6354), Sodium Bromide (Fisher scientific #S255-500), PEG 8000 (Fisher, #BP233-1), and human HDL (Intracel Corp #RP-036).","An in vitro assay for determining IC's to identify compounds that inhibit CETP transfer activity is performed based on a modification of a published method (Morton and Zilversmit, (1981) A plasma inhibitor of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer activities, J. Biol. Chem. 256(23), 11992-11995). The ability of inhibitors to alter CETP activity is performed using two different assays: one using recombinant CETP and one using an endogenous plasma source of CETP. Both assays measure the transfer of [3H] cholesteryl oleate or [3H] triolein from exogenous LDL to HDL.","Radiolabeled donor particles are generated by first combining 100 \u03bcl of 200 \u03bcM butylated hydroxyl toluene in CHCl, 216 \u03bcL of 21.57 mM DOPC in EtOH, and either 500 \u03bcCi [3H]-triolein (Perkin Elmer #NET-431) or 500 \u03bcCi [3H]-cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK886) in a glass tube. Reagents are mixed, dried under nitrogen, and then resuspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris, 27 \u03bcM EDTA at pH 7.4. After a brief vortex, the solution is sonicated until clear and mixed with 20 mL of fresh human serum. The mixture is incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The [3H] labeled LDL substrate is separated at 1.063 g\/ml density by sequential ultracentrifugal flotation in NaBr according to the method of Havel, Eder, et al., 1955, and Chapman, Goldstein, et al., 1981. Once isolated the particles are dialyzed 3\u00d7 in CETP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Human HDL is purchased from Intracel and used as the acceptor particles.","Transfer assays are performed in a 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plate. For the RTA using recombinant CETP (2% RTA), an assay cocktail is prepared with the final concentrations 128 \u03bcg\/mL HDL, 20 nM rCETP, 2% human serum, and 1\u00d7CETP buffer. 1 \u03bcL of each test compound diluted in DMSO is added to 47 \u03bcL of assay cocktail per well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. To initiate the transfer reaction, 2 \u03bcL radiolabeled LDL is added. After an additional 60 min of incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the transfer action is terminated by precipitation of LDL with an equal volume of 20% WN PEG 8000. The plates are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. A 40 \u03bcL aliquot of the HDL-containing supernatant is transferred to a Packard Optiplate\u2122 with 200 \u03bcL of MicroScint\u2122 20. After mixing, plates are counted by liquid scintillation. Counts present in the supernatant for blanks (wells containing only HDL acceptor, CETP buffer and DMSO) are subtracted from those containing test compounds and used to correct for non-specific transfer.","For the transfer assay using endogenous CETP from serum (95% RTA), the same procedure is used except that human serum is added such that a final concentration of serum of 95% of the total assay volume is achieved, yielding a concentration of approximately 15 nM endogenous CETP in the assay. This is then combined with HDL and CETP buffer and the reaction proceeds as above and is terminated as described.","Comparison of the counts of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited (DMSO only) positive control yield a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration, fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation is used to calculate IC50.","The following schemes and examples are provided so that the invention will be more fully appreciated and understood.
