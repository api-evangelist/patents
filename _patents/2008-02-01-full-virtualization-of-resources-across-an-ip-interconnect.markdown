title: Full virtualization of resources across an IP interconnect
abstract: An addressing model is provided where all resources, including memory and devices, are addressed with internet protocol (IP) addresses. A task, such as an application, may be assigned a range of IP addresses rather than an effective address range. Thus, a processing element, such as an I/O adapter or even a printer, for example, may also be addressed using IP addresses without the need for library calls, device drivers, pinning memory, and so forth. This addressing model also provides full virtualization of resources across an IP interconnect, allowing a process to access an I/O device across a network.

It should be appreciated that  is only exemplary and is not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which aspects or embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","With reference now to , a block diagram of an exemplary data processing system is shown in which aspects of the illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system  is an example of a computer. In the depicted example, data processing system  has a plurality of processors ,  connected via a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) bus . Memory controller (MC)  and input\/output channel controller (IOCC)  also connect to SMP bus .","An operating system may run on processing units , . The operating system coordinates and provides control of various components within the data processing system  in . As a client, the operating system may be a commercially available operating system such as Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae XP (Microsoft and Windows are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both). An object-oriented programming system, such as the Java\u2122 programming system, may run in conjunction with the operating system and provides calls to the operating system from Java\u2122 programs or applications executing on data processing system  (Java is a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States, other countries, or both).","As a server, data processing system  may be, for example, an IBM\u00ae eServer\u2122 pSeries\u00ae computer system, running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX\u00ae) operating system or the LINUX\u00ae operating system (eServer, pSeries and AIX are trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both while LINUX is a trademark of Linus Torvalds in the United States, other countries, or both). Data processing system  may be a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) system including a plurality of processors in processing units , . Alternatively, a single processor system may be employed.","Instructions for the operating system, the object-oriented programming system, and applications or programs are located on storage devices, such as a hard disk drive, and may be loaded into main memory through memory controller  for execution by processing units , . The processes for illustrative embodiments of the present invention may be performed by processing units ,  using computer usable program code, which may be located in a memory such as main memory (not shown), or in one or more peripheral devices, for example.","A bus system, such as SMP bus  as shown in , may be comprised of one or more buses. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any type of communication fabric or architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the fabric or architecture. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware in  may vary depending on the implementation. Other internal hardware or peripheral devices, such as flash memory, equivalent non-volatile memory, or optical disk drives and the like, may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted in .","Moreover, the data processing system  may take the form of any of a number of different data processing systems including client computing devices, server computing devices, a tablet computer, laptop computer, telephone or other communication device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or the like. In some illustrative examples, data processing system  may be a portable computing device which is configured with flash memory to provide non-volatile memory for storing operating system files and\/or user-generated data, for example. Essentially, data processing system  may be any known or later developed data processing system without architectural limitation.","In a typical software environment, a plurality of tasks runs under control of an operating system. A task may be a process running on a processor, such as a user level thread, for example. Each task has an assigned address space. Each task has an address space, or address spaces, from which and to which it may read and write. The operating system translates the effective addresses to real addresses, which may exist in memory or may be expanded to persistent storage using a virtual memory manager. A user level thread communicates with another user level thread by making an access request to an effective address.","Each time a task attempts to access an I\/O device, the task must make a call to a library, which accesses the device driver for the target I\/O device. The device driver then performs I\/O reads and writes to set up the device. Then, the device driver requests an amount of memory, such as 8 kB, from the operating system to be \u201cpinned\u201d so the device can read and write into physical memory. This typical process is based on a model that has existed for a very long time. Processes running on processors are at the top of the hierarchy, while I\/O devices are at the bottom of the hierarchy. Manufacturers of I\/O devices accept that I\/O devices are second-class citizens, and that a process must go through the conventional process of setting up an I\/O device through an O\/S library and a device driver to perform I\/O reads and writes. As current trends continue, network I\/O and storage I\/O in particular are becoming more important than the processing elements. Yet, the model for setting up an I\/O device and performing I\/O reads and writes remains the same. The existing model is the pervasive world, and manufacturers are left to accept their lot in life.","In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, a heterogeneous processing element model is provided where I\/O devices look and act like processors. In order to be treated like a processor, an I\/O processing element, or other special purpose processing element, must follow some rules and have some characteristics of a processor, such as address translation, security, interrupt handling, and exception processing, for example. The heterogeneous processing element model puts special purpose processing elements on the same playing field as processors, from a programming perspective, operating system perspective, power perspective, as the processors. The operating system can get work to a security engine, for example, in the same way it does to a processor.","In the illustrative embodiment, IOCC  connects to a plurality of expansion slots, such as peripheral component interconnect express (PCI Express or PCIe) slots . One or more special purpose processors  may connect to PCI Express slots . In the depicted example, special purpose processor  may be, for example, an I\/O device, such as a local area network (LAN) adapter, a storage controller, a security engine, or the like. Thus, a heterogeneous processing element model is provided where I\/O devices and other special purpose processing elements look and act like processors. In order to be treated like a processor, a special purpose processing element must follow some rules and have some characteristics of a processor, such as address translation, security, interrupt handling, and exception processing, for example.","Alternatively, in accordance with the illustrative embodiment, a special purpose processing element may connect to SMP bus  via a processor slot (not shown). Thus, I\/O device  and security engine , for example, may look and act like a processor to the operating system, as long as I\/O device  and security engine  obey the rules of a processor. The heterogeneous processing element model puts special purpose processing elements, such as I\/O device , security engine , and special purpose processor , on the same playing field as processors, from a programming perspective, operating system perspective, power perspective, as the processors. The operating system can get work to a security engine, for example, in the same way it does to a processor.","This heterogeneous processing element model eliminates the need for a device driver for I\/O devices, for instance. Each processing element is assigned an address space from which and to which it may read and write. The operating system may then bind a process to a processing element, whether the processing element is a conventional single core processor, a multiple core processor, an I\/O adapter, a security engine, or some other type of processing element. Some processing elements will be better at certain types of work than others. For example, a security engine will be better at a cryptography task than a conventional processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502"]},"In one exemplary embodiment, address translator  may be an effective-to-real address translation (ERAT) table. Known processor architectures specify a translation-lookaside buffer (TLB) and a segment-lookaside buffer (SLB) to translate from the effective address (EA) used by software and the real address (RA) used by hardware to locate instructions and data in storage. Since these translation mechanisms take several cycles, once translated, the EA, RA pair is stored in a two-way set-associative array, called the effective-to-real address translation (ERAT) table. For example, the POWER4\u2122 architecture from IBM Corporation implements separate ERATs for instruction-cache (IERAT) and data-cache (DERAT) accesses. Both ERATs are indexed using the effective address. A common 1024-entry four-way set-associative TLB is implemented for each processor. Thus, in the exemplary embodiment, address translator  of processing element  may be a similar ERAT table to allow the processing element to easily translate between the effective address used by software and the real address used by hardware.","Processing element  also includes an interrupt handler . An interrupt is a signal that gets the attention of a processor and is usually generated when I\/O is required. For example, hardware interrupts are generated when a key is pressed or when the mouse is moved. Software interrupts are generated by a program requiring disk input or output. As another example, an internal timer may continually interrupt the computer several times per second to keep the time of day current or for timesharing purposes. When an interrupt occurs, processing element  transfers control to the operating system, which determines the action to be taken. Thus, in order to be treated like a processor, a special purpose processing element, such as processing element , must have an interrupt handler  to take appropriate action when hardware or software requires the attention of processing element .","Processing element  also includes exception handler . Exception handling is a programming language construct or computer hardware mechanism designed to handle the occurrence of some condition that changes the normal flow of execution. The condition is called an exception. Exceptions are normally recommended to be used only for signaling error (exceptional) conditions. In general, current state will be saved in a predefined location and execution will switch to a predefined handler. Depending on the situation, the handler may later resume the execution at the original location, using the saved information to restore the original state. For example, an exception that will usually be resumed is a page fault, while a division by zero usually cannot be resolved transparently. From the processing point of view, hardware interrupts are similar to resumable exceptions, although they are usually not related to the current program flow. Thus, processing element  includes exception handler  to manage exception conditions that may change the normal flow of execution.","Thus, processing element  includes the necessary characteristics in order to be treated by a processor with respect to the operating environment of the data processing system. Whether processing element  exists in an expansion slot, such as PCI Express slots  in , or a processor slot, processing element  is treated like a processor by the operating system. In addition, processing element  must obey certain rules that processors must obey, particularly rules about security, for example. The operating system may then assign an address space from which and to which processing element  may read and write. The operating system may bind a process to processing element . Furthermore, other tasks may touch I\/O, for instance, without the need for libraries and device drivers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","32","612","614","616","618","612","614","612","614","612","614"]},"In the depicted example, 32-way bus fabric  may be connected to up to 1800 such 32-way bus fabrics, such as 32-way bus fabric . The 32-way bus fabric  connects up to 32 processing elements - and memory . Operating system  runs on processing elements -, assigns effective address ranges to processing elements -, and may bind processes to processing elements -. Thus, in the multi-tiered interconnect in the illustrative embodiment, there may be as many as 57,600 processing elements. The multi-tiered interconnect depicted in  is meant to illustrate an example and is not meant to imply architectural limitation. More or fewer tiers or processing elements may be permitted depending upon the implementation.","Each one of processing elements - and - may be a conventional processor or a special purpose processing element. For example, processing element  may be a conventional processor while processing element  may be an I\/O device. Thus, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment, an I\/O device, such as processing element , for example, may be abstracted from the physical proximity of processing element , for example. That is, an I\/O device may simply be addressed, even over a distance, rather than having to make a call to a library, call a device driver, pin memory, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["702","720","704","720","720","702","704","720","702","704"]},"In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, the heterogeneous processing element model abstracts an I\/O device such that communication intended for the I\/O device may be packetized and sent over a network. A packet is a formatted block of data carried by a packet mode computer network. Computer communications links that do not support packets, such as traditional point-to-point telecommunications links, simply transmit data as a series of bytes, characters, or bits alone. When data is formatted into a packet, the network can transmit long messages more efficiently and reliably. As an example, transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) is a suite of network transmission protocol that uses packets.","In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, an addressing model is provided where all resources, including memory and devices, are addressed with internet protocol (IP) addresses. A task, such as an application, may be assigned a range of IP addresses rather than an effective address range. Thus, a processing element, such as an I\/O adapter or even a printer, for example, may also be addressed using IP addresses without the need for library calls, device drivers, pinning memory, and so forth.

Thus, each effective address  may be translated to a real address  or to a physical address  of a physical device.","In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, the operating system gives an application a range of Internet protocol (IP) addresses rather than effective addresses. Thus, when an application makes a load or store and gives an address, it is an IP address . IP-to-EA table  translates IP address  to the effective address . All loads and stores from all applications will provide IP addresses for all accesses outside of the local, user level state. The range of IP addresses assigned to an application must be bound to the application.","Turning to , an effective-to-real address translation (ERAT) table  translates effective address (EA)  to real address (RA) . The use of an ERAT table  greatly simplifies address translation. Thus, when an application does a load or store, the operation gives an IP address . IP-to-EA table  translates IP address  to EA . ERAT table  then translates EA  to real address (RA) . For addresses that refer to a physical device outside the physical memory space, real-to-physical address table  translates real address  to physical address (PA) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1030","1010","1020","1030","1016","1010","1012","1016","1034","1010","1012","1010","1016","1014","1030","1036"]},"Application  may also make calls to application programming interfaces (APIs) . Application  may also access a shared portion of memory , which is shared between application  and application , using an IP address that corresponds to a shared effective address. Operating system  may receive the IP address for a load or store and translate the IP address to an effective address of shared memory. Alternatively, operating system  may receive the IP address for a load or store that is translated to a physical address of a physical device outside the physical domain of the data processing system.","Furthermore, application  may perform a load or store to an IP address that corresponds to a processing element, such as an I\/O controller. The addressing model of the illustrative embodiment fully virtualizes resources; thus, abstracting the processing elements.

It will also be understood that each block of the flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based computer systems which perform the specified functions or steps, or by combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","Furthermore, the flowchart is provided to demonstrate the operations performed within the illustrative embodiments. The flowchart is not meant to state or imply limitations with regard to the specific operations or, more particularly, the order of the operations. The operations of the flowchart may be modified to suit a particular implementation without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","With reference now to , operation begins, and the operating system receives a request from an application to access data at a target IP address (block ). A request to access data may be a load or store operation, an API call, or the like. The operating system translates the IP address to an effective address (block ) and translates the effective address to a real address (block ).","Next, the operating system determines whether the IP address is within the private address range for the application (block ). This private range may be an IP address range or effective address range assigned to the application by the operating system. If the IP address corresponds to the private address range of the application, the application performs the access operation to the private address space by real address (block ), and operation ends.","If the IP address does not correspond to the private address range of the application in block , the operating system determines whether the IP address corresponds to a portion of shared memory (block ). If the IP address does correspond to a portion of memory that is shared between two or more applications, then the application performs the access operation to the shared memory by real address (block ), and operation ends.","If the IP address does not correspond to the private address range of the application in block  and does not correspond to a portion of shared memory to which the application may read or write in block , then the IP address may correspond to an address outside the physical memory domain of the data processing system. That is, the data processing system may have to pull some memory from another blade, or the IP address may correspond to a physical device, such as an I\/O device. The IP address may correspond to a processing element, such as an I\/O adapter, that is located remotely. Thus, the operating system translates the real address to a physical address (block ), and performs the access operation to the physical device (block ). Thereafter, operation ends.","Thus, the illustrative embodiments solve the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a heterogeneous processing element model where I\/O devices look and act like processors. In order to be treated like a processor, an I\/O processing element, or other special purpose processing element, must follow some rules and have some characteristics of a processor, such as address translation, security, interrupt handling, and exception processing, for example. The heterogeneous processing element model puts special purpose processing elements on the same playing field as processors, from a programming perspective, operating system perspective, power perspective, as the processors. The operating system can get work to a security engine, for example, in the same way it does to a processor. The heterogeneous processing element model abstracts an I\/O device such that communication intended for the I\/O device may be packetized and sent over a network.
