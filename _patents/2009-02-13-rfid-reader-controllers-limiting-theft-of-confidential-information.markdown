{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/039,040 filed on Mar. 24, 2008. The disclosure of the provisional patent application is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems typically include RFID tags and RFID readers. RFID readers are also known as RFID reader\/writers or RFID interrogators. RFID systems can be used in many ways for locating and identifying objects to which the tags are attached. RFID systems are particularly useful in product-related and service-related industries for tracking objects being processed, inventoried, or handled. In such cases, an RFID tag is usually attached to an individual item, or to its package.","In principle, RFID techniques entail using an RFID reader to interrogate one or more RFID tags. The reader transmitting a Radio Frequency (RF) wave performs the interrogation. The RF wave is typically electromagnetic, at least in the far field. The RF wave can also be predominantly electric or magnetic in the near field.","A tag that senses the interrogating RF wave responds by transmitting back another RF wave. The tag generates the transmitted back RF wave either originally, or by reflecting back a portion of the interrogating RF wave in a process known as backscatter. Backscatter may take place in a number of ways.","The reflected-back RF wave may further encode data stored internally in the tag, such as a number. The response is demodulated and decoded by the reader, which thereby identifies, counts, or otherwise interacts with the associated item. The decoded data can denote a serial number, a price, a date, a destination, other attribute(s), any combination of attributes, and so on.","An RFID tag typically includes an antenna system, a radio section, a power management section, and frequently a logical section, a memory, or both. In earlier RFID tags, the power management section included an energy storage device, such as a battery. RFID tags with an energy storage device are known as active or semi-active tags. Advances in semiconductor technology have miniaturized the electronics so much that an RFID tag can be powered solely by the RF signal it receives. Such RFID tags do not include an energy storage device, and are called passive tags.","RFID readers may issue confidential information such as encryption keys, passwords, specific commands, and so on, to tags. This confidential information may be used to encrypt or decrypt messages, to lock or unlock tag memory, or to perform a specific operation on the tag, and may be intrinsically confidential such as financial information, and so on. The confidential information may be sent one time, or updated occasionally or regularly. Readers which legitimately have access to this confidential information may be stolen, or an illegitimate reader (also known as a rogue reader) may be inserted into a multi-reader system to gain nefarious access to this confidential information.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Embodiments are directed to a controller communicating with an RFID reader and methods of controlling an RFID reader to limit or prevent the issuing of confidential information such as encryption keys, passwords, shared secrets, and the like, to tags if a reader is not authorized. According to some embodiments, the controller may determine the reader's authorization status and limit its communication with the reader or instruct the reader to limit an operational aspect of the reader.","These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of aspects as claimed.","In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustrations specific embodiments or examples. These aspects may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","112","120","110","112","126","110","126"]},"Reader  and tag  exchange data via wave  and wave . In a session of such an exchange each encodes, modulates, and transmits data to the other, and each receives, demodulates, and decodes data from the other. The data can be modulated onto, and demodulated from, RF waveforms. The RF waveforms are in a suitable range of frequencies. Such ranges include those near 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and so on.","Encoding the data in waveforms can be performed in a number of different ways. For example, protocols are devised to communicate in terms of symbols, also called RFID symbols. A symbol for communicating can be a delimiter, a calibration symbol, and so on. Further symbols can be implemented for ultimately exchanging binary data, such as \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d, if that is desired. In turn, when the waveforms are processed internally by reader  and tag , they can be equivalently considered and treated as numbers having corresponding values, and so on.","Tag  can be a passive tag or an active or semi-active tag, i.e., having its own power source. Where tag  is a passive tag, it is powered from wave .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["220","120","220"]},"Tag  is formed on a substantially planar inlay , which can be made in many ways known in the art. Tag  includes an electrical circuit, which is preferably implemented in an integrated circuit (IC) . IC  is arranged on inlay .","Tag  also includes an antenna for exchanging wireless signals with its environment. The antenna is usually flat and attached to inlay . IC  is electrically coupled to the antenna via suitable antenna ports (not shown in ).","The antenna may be made in a number of ways, as is well known in the art. In the example of , the antenna is made from two distinct antenna segments , which are shown here forming a dipole. Many other embodiments are possible, using any number of antenna segments.","In some embodiments, an antenna can be made with even a single segment. Different points of the segment can be coupled to one or more of the antenna ports of IC . For example, the antenna can form a single loop, with its ends coupled to the ports. It should be remembered that, when the single segment has more complex shapes, even a single segment could behave like multiple segments, at the frequencies of RFID wireless communication.","In operation, a signal is received by the antenna, and communicated to IC . IC  both harvests power, and responds if appropriate, based on the incoming signal and its internal state. In order to respond by replying, IC  modulates the reflectance of the antenna, which generates the backscatter from a wave transmitted by the reader. Coupling together and uncoupling the antenna ports of IC  can modulate the reflectance, as can a variety of other means.","In the embodiment of , antenna segments  are separate from IC . In other embodiments, antenna segments may alternately be formed on IC , and so on.","The components of the RFID system of  may communicate with each other in any number of modes. One such mode is called full duplex. Another such mode is called half-duplex, and is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","120","220"]},"RFID reader  and RFID tag  talk and listen to each other by taking turns. As seen on axis TIME, when reader  talks to tag  the communication session is designated as \u201cR\u2192T\u201d, and when tag  talks to reader  the communication session is designated as \u201cT\u2192R\u201d. Along the TIME axis, a sample R\u2192T communication session occurs during a time interval , and a following sample T\u2192R communication session occurs during a time interval . Of course interval  is typically of a different duration than interval \u2014here the durations are shown approximately equal only for purposes of illustration.","According to blocks  and , RFID reader  talks during interval , and listens during interval . According to blocks  and , RFID tag  listens while reader  talks (during interval ), and talks while reader  listens (during interval ).","In terms of actual technical behavior, during interval , reader  talks to tag  as follows. According to block , reader  transmits wave , which was first described in . At the same time, according to block , tag  receives wave  and processes it, to extract data and so on. Meanwhile, according to block , tag  does not backscatter with its antenna, and according to block , reader  has no wave to receive from tag .","During interval , tag  talks to reader  as follows. According to block , reader  transmits a Continuous Wave (CW), which can be thought of as a carrier signal that ideally encodes no information. As discussed before, this carrier signal serves both to be harvested by tag  for its own internal power needs, and also as a wave that tag  can backscatter. Indeed, during interval , according to block , tag  does not receive a signal for processing. Instead, according to block , tag  modulates the CW emitted according to block , so as to generate backscatter wave . Concurrently, according to block , reader  receives backscatter wave  and processes it.","In the above, an RFID reader\/interrogator may communicate with one or more RFID tags in any number of ways. Some such ways are described in protocols. A protocol is a specification that calls for specific manners of signaling between the reader and the tags.","One such protocol is called the Specification for RFID Air Interface\u2014EPC\u2122 Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz-960 MHz, which is also colloquially known as \u201cthe Gen2 Spec\u201d. The Gen2 Spec has been ratified by EPCglobal, which is an organization that maintains a website at: <http:\/\/www.epcglobalinc.org\/> at the time this document is initially filed with the USPTO.","In addition, a protocol can be a variant of a stated specification such as the Gen2 Spec, for example including fewer or additional commands than the stated specification calls for, and so on. In such instances, additional commands are sometimes called custom commands.","It was described above how reader  and tag  communicate in terms of time. In addition, communications between reader  and tag  may be restricted according to frequency. One such restriction is that the available frequency spectrum may be partitioned into divisions that are called channels. Different partitioning manners may be specified by different regulatory jurisdictions and authorities (e.g. FCC in North America, CEPT in Europe, etc.).","Reader  typically transmits with a transmission spectrum that lies within one channel. In some regulatory jurisdictions the authorities permit aggregating multiple channels into one or more larger channels, but for all practical purposes an aggregate channel can again be considered a single, albeit larger, individual channel.","Tag  can respond with a backscatter that is modulated directly onto the frequency of the reader's emitted CW, also called baseband backscatter. Alternatively, tag  can respond with a backscatter that is modulated onto a frequency, developed by tag , that is different from the reader's emitted CW, and this modulated tag frequency is then impressed upon the reader's emitted CW. This second type of backscatter is called subcarrier backscatter. The subcarrier frequency can be within the reader's channel, can straddle the boundaries with the adjacent channel, or can be wholly outside the reader's channel.","Embodiments of the present disclosure can be useful in different RFID environments, for example, in the deployment of RFID readers in retail environments, in point-of-sale environments, in the environments of financial institutions, in environments of data-management institutions, in library environments, in environments related to returnable objects or assets, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["410","110","420","420","430","430","430","435","430","435","440"]},"A driver  can send to its respective antenna  a driving signal that is in the RF range, which is why connector  is typically but not necessarily a coaxial cable. The driving signal causes the antenna  to transmit an RF wave , which is analogous to RF wave  of . In addition, RF wave  can be backscattered from the RFID tags, analogous to RF wave  of . Backscattered RF wave  is received by an antenna  and ultimately becomes a signal sensed by unit .","Unit  also has other components , such as hardware and\/or software and\/or firmware, which may be described in more detail later in this document. Components  control drivers , and as such cause RF wave  to be transmitted, and the sensed backscattered RF wave  to be interpreted. Optionally and preferably there is a communication link  to other equipment, such as computers and the like, for remote operation of system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","510","570","510","570","110","510","570","110","500","510"]},"Local block  is responsible for communicating with the tags. Local block  includes a block  of an antenna and a driver of the antenna for communicating with the tags. Some readers, like that shown in local block , contain a single antenna and driver. Some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers and a method to switch signals among them, including sometimes using different antennas for transmitting and for receiving. And some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers that can operate simultaneously. A demodulator\/decoder block  demodulates and decodes backscattered waves received from the tags via antenna block . Modulator\/encoder block  encodes and modulates an RF wave that is to be transmitted to the tags via antenna block .","Local block  additionally includes an optional local processor . Processor  may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include, by way of examples and not of limitation, digital and\/or analog processors such as microprocessors and digital-signal processors (DSPs); controllers such as microcontrollers; software running in a machine such as a general purpose computer; programmable circuits such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Field-Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), any combination of one or more of these; and so on. In some cases, some or all of the decoding function in block , the encoding function in block , or both, may be performed instead by processor . In some cases processor  may implement an encryption or authorization function; in some cases one or more of these functions can be distributed among other blocks such as encoding block , or may be entirely incorporated in another block.","Local block  additionally includes an optional local memory . Memory  may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include, by way of examples and not of limitation, nonvolatile memories (NVM), read-only memories (ROM), random access memories (RAM), any combination of one or more of these, and so on. These can be implemented separately from processor , or in a single chip, with or without other components. Memory , if provided, can store programs for processor  to run, if needed.","In some embodiments, memory  stores data read from tags, or data to be written to tags, such as Electronic Product Codes (EPCs), Tag Identifiers (TIDs) and other data. Memory  can also include reference data that is to be compared to the EPC codes, instructions and\/or rules for how to encode commands for the tags, modes for controlling antenna , and so on. In some of these embodiments, local memory  is provided as a database. In some cases memory  may contain confidential information, authorization information, encryption information such as encryption keys or secrets, and the like.","Some components of local block  typically treat the data as analog, such as the antenna\/driver block . Other components such as memory  typically treat the data as digital. At some point there is a conversion between analog and digital. Based on where this conversion occurs, a whole reader may be characterized as \u201canalog\u201d or \u201cdigital\u201d, but most readers contain a mix of analog and digital functionality.","If remote components  are indeed provided, they are coupled to local block  via an electronic communications network . Network  can be a Local Area Network (LAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a network of networks such as the internet, or a mere local communication link, such as a USB, PCI, and so on. In turn, local block  then includes a local network connection  for communicating with network . Communications on the network can be secure, such as if they are encrypted or physically protected, or insecure, such as if they are not encrypted or otherwise protected.","There can be one or more remote component(s) . If more than one, they can be located at the same location, or in different locations. They can access each other and local block  via network , or via other similar networks, and so on. Accordingly, remote component(s)  can use respective remote network connections. Only one such remote network connection  is shown, which is similar to local network connection , etc.","Remote component(s)  can also include a remote processor . Processor  can be made in any way known in the art, such as was described with reference to local processor . Remote processor  may also implement an encryption or authorization function, similar to local processor .","Remote component(s)  can also include a remote memory . Memory  can be made in any way known in the art, such as was described with reference to local memory . Memory  may include a local database, and a different database of a Standards Organization, such as one that can reference EPCs. Remote memory  may also contain confidential information, authorization information, encryption information, or the like, similar to local memory .","Of the above-described elements, it is advantageous to consider a combination of these components, designated as operational processing block . Block  includes those components that are provided of the following: local processor , remote processor , local network connection , remote network connection , and by extension an applicable portion of network  that links connection  with connection . The portion can be dynamically changeable, etc. In addition, block  can receive and decode RF waves received via antenna , and cause antenna  to transmit RF waves according to what it has processed.","Block  includes either local processor , or remote processor , or both. If both are provided, remote processor  can be made such that it operates in a way complementary with that of local processor . In fact, the two can cooperate. It will be appreciated that block , as defined this way, is in communication with both local memory  and remote memory , if both are present.","Accordingly, block  is location agnostic, in that its functions can be implemented either by local processor , or by remote processor , or by a combination of both. Some of these functions are preferably implemented by local processor , and some by remote processor . Block  accesses local memory , or remote memory , or both for storing and\/or retrieving data, confidential information, passwords, authorizing information, and the like.","Reader system  operates by block  generating communications for RFID tags. These communications are ultimately transmitted by antenna block , with modulator\/encoder block  encoding and modulating the information on an RF wave. Then data is received from the tags via antenna block , demodulated and decoded by demodulator\/decoder block , and processed by processing block .","Embodiments additionally include programs, and methods of operation of the programs. A program is generally defined as a group of steps or operations leading to a desired result, due to the nature of the elements in the steps and their sequence. A program is usually advantageously implemented as a sequence of steps or operations for a processor, such as the structures described above.","Performing the steps, instructions, or operations of a program requires manipulation of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities may be transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated or processed according to the steps or instructions, and they may also be stored in a computer-readable medium. These quantities include, for example, electrical, magnetic, and electromagnetic charges or particles, states of matter, and in the more general case can include the states of any physical devices or elements. It is convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to information represented by the states of these quantities as bits, data bits, samples, values, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are associated with the appropriate physical quantities, and that these terms are merely convenient labels applied to these physical quantities, individually or in groups.","Embodiments furthermore include storage media. Such media, individually or in combination with others, have stored thereon instructions of a program made according to the embodiments. A storage medium according to the embodiments is a computer-readable medium, such as a memory, and is read by a processor of the type mentioned above. If a memory, it can be implemented in a number of ways, such as Read Only Memory (ROM), Random Access Memory (RAM), etc., some of which are volatile and some non-volatile.","Even though it is said that the program may be stored in a computer-readable medium, it should be clear to a person skilled in the art that it need not be a single memory, or even a single machine. Various portions, modules or features of it may reside in separate memories, or even separate machines. The separate machines may be connected directly, or through a network such as a local access network (LAN) or a global network such as the Internet.","Often, for the sake of convenience only, it is desirable to implement and describe a program as software. The software can be unitary, or thought in terms of various interconnected distinct software modules.","This detailed description is presented largely in terms of flowcharts, algorithms, and symbolic representations of operations on data bits on and\/or within at least one medium that allows computational operations, such as a computer with memory. Indeed, such descriptions and representations are the type of convenient labels used by those skilled in programming and\/or the data-processing arts to effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A person skilled in the art of programming may use these descriptions to readily generate specific instructions for implementing a program according to the present disclosure.","Embodiments of an RFID reader system can be implemented as hardware, software, firmware, or any combination. It is advantageous to consider such a system as subdivided into components or modules. A person skilled in the art will recognize that some of these components or modules can be implemented as hardware, some as software, some as firmware, and some as a combination. An example of such a subdivision is now described, together with the RFID tag as an additional module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600"]},"An RFID tag  is considered here as a module by itself. Tag  conducts a wireless communication  with the remainder, via the air interface . It is noteworthy that air interface  is really only a boundary, in that signals or data that pass through it are not intended to be transformed from one thing to another. Specifications as to how readers and tags are to communicate with each other, for example the Gen2 Specification, also properly characterize that boundary an interface.","RFID system  includes one or more antennas , and an RF Front End , for interfacing with antenna(s) . These can be made as described above. In addition, Front End  typically includes analog components.","System  also includes a Signal Processing module . In this embodiment, module  exchanges waveforms with Front End , such as I and Q waveform pairs. In some embodiments, signal processing module  is implemented by itself in an FPGA.","System  also includes a Physical Driver module , which is also known as Data Link. In this embodiment, module  exchanges bits with module . Data Link  can be the stage associated with framing of data. In one embodiment, module  is implemented by a Digital Signal Processor.","System  additionally includes a Media Access Control module , which is also known as MAC layer. In this embodiment, module  exchanges packets of bits with module . MAC layer  can be the stage for making decisions for sharing the medium of wireless communication, which in this case is the air interface. Sharing can be between reader system  and tags, or between system  with another reader, or between tags, or a combination. In one embodiment, module  is implemented by a Digital Signal Processor. In some embodiments, many of the components of modules , ,  and  can be implemented in one or two Integrated Circuit (IC) chips.","System  moreover includes an Application Programming Library module . This can include Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), other objects, etc.","All of these functionalities can be supported by one or more processors. One of these processors can be considered a host processor. Such a host processor might include a Host Operating System (OS) and\/or Central Processing Unit (CPU) . In some embodiments, the processor is not considered as a separate module, but one that includes some of the above-mentioned modules of system . In some embodiments, the one or more processors may manipulate confidential information, implement an authorization function, perform an encryption operation, or otherwise operate on or communicate confidential information.","A user interface  may be coupled to library , for accessing the APIs. User interface  can be manual, automatic, or both. It can be supported by the host processor mentioned above, or a separate processor, etc.","It will be observed that the modules of system  form something of a chain. Adjacent modules in the chain can be coupled by the appropriate instrumentalities for exchanging signals. These instrumentalities include conductors, buses, interfaces, and so on. These instrumentalities can be local, e.g. to connect modules that are physically close to each other, or over a network, for remote communication.","The chain is used in opposite directions for receiving and transmitting. In a receiving mode, wireless waves are received by antenna(s)  as signals, which are in turn processed successively by the various modules in the chain. Processing can terminate in any one of the modules. In a transmitting mode, initiation can be in any one of these modules. Ultimately, signals are routed internally, for antenna(s)  to transmit as wireless waves.","The architecture of system  is presented for purposes of explanation, and not of limitation. Its particular subdivision into modules need not be followed for creating embodiments.

The controller may also receive a communication from the reader indicating that the reader itself has determined its status to be unauthorized.","If the reader's status is determined to be unauthorized, an operational aspect of the reader or forwarding of the confidential information is limited at step . The operational aspect of the reader may be limited by a command from the controller or by terminating an authorization from the controller. Forwarding of confidential information may also include complete termination of communication with the reader, reduction of communication such that a limited number of passwords may be issued, or similar actions.","The operations included in processes  and  are for illustration purposes. Limiting theft of confidential information in an RFID system may be implemented by similar processes with fewer or additional steps, as well as in different order of operations using the principles described herein.","The above described features can be implemented by a so-called utility of an RFID reader. For example, a utility can include one or more of the above described components, operational processing blocks, an article of manufacture, etc. The invention further provides interfacing, to expose a functionality of this utility to an agent, as is described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","1240"]},"More particularly, utility  may determine the reader's authorization status and limit an operational aspect of the reader, as discussed previously, upon determining the reader to be unauthorized.","Architecture  additionally includes an interface converter , and an agent . Agent , interface converter , and utility  can be implemented in any way known in the art. For example, each can be implemented in hardware, middleware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, agent  is a human.","Embodiments also include interface converter , and methods of operation of an interface converter such as interface converter . Interface converter  thus enables agent  to control utility . Interface converter  is so named because it performs a conversion, a change, as will be described in more detail below.","Between interface converter  and agent  and utility  there are respective boundaries , . Boundaries ,  are properly called interfaces, in that they are pure boundaries, as is the above described air interface.","In addition, it is a sometimes informal usage to call the space between boundaries  and , which includes interface converter , an \u201cinterface\u201d . Further, it is common to designate this space with a double arrow as shown, with an understanding that operations take place within the arrow. So, while \u201cinterface\u201d  is located at a boundary between agent  and utility , it is not itself a pure boundary. Regardless, the usage of \u201cinterface\u201d  is so common for interface converter  that this document sometimes also refers to it as an interface. It is clear that embodiments of such an \u201cinterface\u201d  can be included in this invention, if they include an interface converter that converts or alters one type of transmission or data to another, as will be seen below.","Agent  can be one or more layers in an architecture. For example, agent  can be something that a programmer programs to. In alternative embodiments, where agent  is a human, interface converter  can include a screen, a keyboard, etc. An example is now described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"],"b":["1350","1350","1350","1240","1240","1350","1240","1260","1240"]},"Returning to , interface converter  can be implemented in any number of ways. One such way is as a software Application Programming Interface (API). This API can control or provide inputs to an underlying software library, and so on.","Transmissions can be made between agent , interface converter , and utility . Such transmissions can be as input or can be converted, using appropriate protocols, etc. What is transmitted can encode commands, data, etc. Such transmissions can include any one or a combination of the following: a high down transmission HDNT from agent  to interface converter ; a low down transmission LDNT from interface converter  to utility ; a low up transmission LUPT from utility  to interface converter ; and a high up transmission HUPT from interface converter  to agent . These transmissions can be spontaneous, or in response to another transmission, or in response to an input or an interrupt, etc.","Commands are more usually included in transmissions HDNT and LDNT, for ultimately controlling utility . Controlling can be in a number of manners. One such manner can be to install utility , or just a feature of it. Such installing can be by spawning, downloading, etc. Other such manners can be to configure, enable, disable, or operate utility , or just a feature of it. These commands can be standalone, or carry parameters, such as data, confidential information, etc. In some embodiments interface converter  can convert these commands to a format suitable for utility .","Data is more usually included in transmissions HUPT and LUPT. The data can inform as to success or failure of executing an operation. The data can also include tag data, which can be both codes read from tags, including confidential information, and data about reading tags, such as time stamps, date stamps, etc. In some embodiments interface converter  can convert the data to a format suitable for agent , including in some cases aggregating, filtering, merging, or otherwise altering the format or utility of the data.","It should be noted that, what passes across a single pure boundary can be unchanged, by the mere definition of what is a pure boundary. But what passes through interface converter  can be changed or not. More particularly, high down transmission HDNT can be being encoded similarly to, or differently from, low down transmission LDNT. In addition, low up transmission LUPT can be encoded similarly to, or differently from, high up transmission HUPT. When different, it can be attributed to interface converter , which performs a suitable change, or conversion, of one transmission to another. The change, or conversion, performed by interface converter  is for exposing the functionality of utility  to agent , and vice versa. In some embodiments, a command is converted, but a parameter is passed along without being converted. Plus, what is not converted at one module may be converted at another. Such modules taken together can also form an interface converter according to embodiments.","Agent , interface converter , and utility  can be implemented as part of a reader, or as a different device. For being implemented as part of a reader,  suggests a scheme  where agent , interface converter , and utility  can be implemented in connection with respective reader modules that are suitable, depending on the requirements.","The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the embodiments.
