Field of the Invention","The present invention relates in general to the field of information handling systems, and more particularly relates to a method and system for selecting a presentation mode of an information handling system, such as selecting presentation of information from a portable computer through a projector.","2. Description of the Related Art","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally process, compiles, stores and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.","The use of a variety of hardware and software components with information handling systems sometimes leads to difficulty in configuring the systems to operate properly. For instance, one common difficulty is the configuring of computer systems to display information from different types of display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) and liquid crystal displays (LCD). To aid in the configuration of display devices, the WINDOWS operating system offers functionality in which the computer system BIOS detects devices during boot and cooperates with the operating system to configure the computer interfacing with the detected display devices. Although this functionality simplifies the process of interfacing a display device with a computer system, it is generally limited to use in system boot and is generally not able to dynamically detect added video devices and switch to them on the fly. Thus, a computer running WINDOWS in an operational state is generally not able to select a display device added after boot and is thus not able to configure display settings for the added device, such as resolution settings.","One difficult situation often faced by computer users is the interfacing of a projector with a portable computer, such as a laptop, to make a presentation. For instance, a portable computer stores presentation information, such as a presentation in POWERPOINT, and is interfaced with a projector for showing the presentation information on a screen. In order to select the projector to receive the presentation information, the portable computer typically must initiate a signal to a port interfaced with the projector and then must configure the presentation information for the projector, such as by setting the portable computer for a desired resolution associated with the projector. One manner for switching the display of presentation information to select the projector is to toggle through display modes by a keyboard interface with the BIOS of the portable computer. For instance, hitting the function and F8 keys simultaneously commands the BIOS to sequence the portable computer through three presentation modes: an LCD only presentation mode in which presentation of information is only through the LCD of the portable computer; a CRT only presentation mode in which display of information is only through a video port of the portable computer; and a simulscan presentation mode in which presentation of information is through both the LCD and the video port of the portable computer.","Although toggling through presentation modes with the keyboard function allows a portable computer user to select a presentation mode for presentation of information through a projector, this toggling function is inconvenient and difficult to use and often does not result in an optimal display of the presentation information over the projector. For instance, when a user sets up for a presentation the user is often under time pressure and in front of an audience. In some cases, the user lacks the time or opportunity to test the projector being used and sometimes must even connect the portable computer to the projector for the first time in front of the audience. Assuming the projector gets a signal from the portable computer and presents information, the user still must set the resolution of the projector to obtain an optimal presentation. For a user under pressure and in front of an audience, the first impression often sets the tone of the presentation, and fumbling with a projector and portable computer is hardly the first impression that the user desires for any audience.","Therefore a need has arisen for a system and method which simplifies the selection of the presentation mode of an information handling system.","A further need has arisen for a system and method which provides a user interface for selecting a projector presentation mode.","A further need has arisen for a system and method which selects presentation of information through an unconfigured display mode having an unconfigured resolution.","In accordance with the present invention, a system and method are provided that substantially reduce or eliminate disadvantages and problems associated with previous systems and methods for selecting a presentation mode for an information handling system. An unconfigured display device is selected with a graphical user interface presented by a configured display of the information handling system. The selection is communicated to the BIOS of the information handling system by a presentation tool running on the information handling system so that a presentation module of the BIOS commands a switch to the unconfigured display device.","More specifically, in one embodiment, the graphical user interface presents a presentation button that switches between the LCD only presentation mode of a portable computer and the simulscan presentation mode with a single click of a mouse I\/O device. A presentation tool operable on the portable computer's CPU, such as a presentation dynamic link library (DLL), is called upon selection of the presentation button to coordinate selection of the desired presentation mode. The presentation DLL communicates the requested presentation mode switch with a presentation module of the portable computer's BIOS. The presentation module applies BIOS and\/or video BIOS functionality to determine the current and selected presentation modes and to command a switch to the requested presentation mode if appropriate. For instance, if an unconfigured presentation device interfaces with the portable computer and the portable computer is in an LCD only presentation mode, then the presentation module commands a switch to the simulscan presentation mode to enable presentation from the unconfigured presentation device. If the portable computer is already in the simulscan presentation mode, then the presentation module commands selection of LCD only or another predetermined mode, such as the presentation mode in use at the time of the selection of the simulscan presentation mode.","One specific example of the present invention is the interfacing of a projector with a portable computer video port to present information over a screen, such as before an audience. A user having presentation information on the portable computer views the presentation information over a configured device, such as an LCD recognized by the portable computer during boot. The configured device, for instance, has resolution settings configured by the operating system and video driver of the portable computer to ensure an accurate display of the presentation information. The user then interfaces the projector with the portable computer to project the presentation information for the audience. The portable computer initially lacks resolution settings for the projector and does not recognize the projector, for instance, because the projector is interfaced after boot. The user selects a presentation button from a graphical user interface presented by the configured display, such as the portable computer's LCD, to call a presentation dynamic link library. The presentation dynamic link library initiates the presentation module of the portable computer's BIOS to determine the current display mode and to determine that the projector is interfaced with the portable computer. The presentation module commands a switch to the simulscan presentation mode, enabling display of the presentation information over both the projector and the LCD and also detects the resolution of the projector. A resolution module, such as an application programming interface (API) associated with the operating system of the portable computer system, receives the detected resolution of the projector and configures the projector on the portable computer system with an appropriate resolution. Upon completion of the presentation, selection of the presentation button commands the presentation module through the presentation dynamic link library to return to the saved display mode and the resolution.","The present invention provides a number of important technical advantages. One example of an important technical advantage is the simplification of the selection of presentation modes for an information handling system. For instance, a display device added on the fly is automatically recognized and configured by selection of a single graphical user interface button. Similarly, the same button returns the information handling system to the originally configured presentation mode. The use of a single graphical user interface button greatly simplifies presentation mode selection so that a user under time constraints or other pressures may reliably and quickly set the information handling system to a desired presentation mode without undue thought or stress.","Another example of an important technical advantage is that a user interface selects a projector presentation mode to automatically recognize, select and configure the resolution of a projector interfaced with a portable computer both quickly and reliably. The presentation module of the BIOS enables operating system interaction with BIOS functionality for establishing and configuring the physical projector device, including interaction with resolution tools that set an optimal resolution for the device determined by the BIOS functionality. The graphical user interface advantageously provides a familiar and user-friendly environment for quick selection of the projector presentation mode under difficult or stressful situations.","Another example of an important technical advantage of the present invention is that selection of presentation of information through an unconfigured display mode is provided through a configured display mode. For instance, a LCD of a portable computer displays a graphical user interface that initiates recognition of an unconfigured display device, such as a projector interfaced after boot, by the operating system. Once recognized by the operating system, resolution tools associated with the operating system, such as resolution application programming interfaces, set the resolution of the unconfigured device to obtain a desired presentation resolution.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the figures, like numerals being used referred to like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.","The present invention provides greater convenience and ease of use for information handling systems by improving flexibility for adding display devices to information handling systems on the fly. A module added to the BIOS of the information handling system allows intermediate level drivers operating on the CPU of the information handling system, such as a dynamic link library, to set the display type and configuration. For instance, an unconfigured display device added after boot of the information handling system is recognized upon a user command to allow configuration of the display device, such as determination and setting of resolution, for use with the information handling system.","Referring now to , a block diagram depicts a portable computer  having a CPU , BIOS  and video BIOS . BIOS  coordinates communication between physical and peripheral devices of portable computer  and CPU  to allow an operating system  running on CPU  to operate the physical devices. Video BIOS  coordinates communication with display devices in cooperation with BIOS  and may have its functionality included within BIOS . Although  depicts a portable computer , for purposes of this disclosure, any information handling system may apply. An information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control or other purposes. For example, an information handling system may be a personal computer, a network storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality and price. The information handling system may include random access memory (RAM), one or more processing resources such as a CPU, or hardware or software control logic, ROM and\/or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives, one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output (I\/O) devices, such as a keyboard , a mouse  and a video display such as LCD . The information handling system may include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.","LCD  displays a presentation graphical user interface  which is, for instance, called from a tool bar . Presentation graphical user interface  includes a presentation button , such as a navigation bar with the label \u201cpresentation,\u201d that is activated by a pointer  controlled by mouse  or otherwise activated through keyboard  or other I\/O devices capable of interacting with presentation graphical user interface . Thus, for instance, a user desiring to present information from the portable computer  through a projector  simply points and clicks presentation button  of presentation graphical user interface . Similarly, a user displaying information over a projector  and desiring to return to the presentation mode in use before selection of the projector simply points and clicks presentation button  of presentation graphical user interface .","Upon selection of presentation button , a presentation tool , such as a presentation dynamic link library, is run on CPU  to access functionality of BIOS . For instance, a presentation dynamic link library  calls a presentation module , such as a module operating within BIOS  as a firmware or software module. Presentation module  determines the current display mode of portable computer  and, if the current display mode does not display information over the projector , presentation module  gets the current presentation mode resolution settings and then presentation DLL saves the settings. If presentation module  detects projector  and determines that the current display mode is LCD only, then presentation module  commands selection of the simulscan presentation mode to enable presentation of information through projector . If presentation module  determines that projector  is in use, for instance because portable computer  is in the simulscan presentation mode, then presentation module  commands selection of the previous presentation mode from memory. Presentation module  commands the selection of presentation modes by accessing and using functionality of BIOS  and video BIOS  as appropriate.","Presentation module  communicates the change in presentation mode to presentation dynamic link library . If projector  is unconfigured for portable computer , presentation dynamic link library  calls operating system tools to configure projector  and thus obtain an optimal presentation of information on screen . For instance, resolution application programming interfaces are called to set the resolution of projector  in cooperation with BIOS  and video BIOS  based on a determination of the resolution by presentation module . As a specific example available with WINDOWS operating systems , presentation dynamic link library  may call the \u201cenumdisplaytype\u201d and \u201cchangedisplaytype\u201d APIs to set the resolution of projector . In this manner, the user of portable computer  is able to switch to a presentation mode for displaying information over projector  as a configured device by selecting a single navigation bar of presentation graphical user interface  available in a user-friendly and familiar environment on the configured LCD display.","Referring now to , a flow diagram depicts the logical steps for switching between presentation modes of a portable computer . The process starts as step  with the selection of presentation button  by a user through presentation graphical user interface  displayed on LCD . At step , presentation dynamic link library  is called to access BIOS and video BIOS functions through presentation module  for interacting with the current configured display devices to command a determination of the current display mode. At step , a determination is made of whether the current display mode is LCD only. If yes, then at step  LCD display resolution is saved as a LCD resolution variable and the process proceeds to step . The saved resolution variable helps ensure a seamless return to LCD only mode if presentation button  is re-selected by the user. If at step  the determination is no, then the process proceeds directly to step  at which the presentation dynamic link library  is again called.","At step , presentation dynamic link library  communicates with presentation module  to command a switch of display modes if appropriate. At step , presentation module  accesses functionality of BIOS  or video BIOS  to determine if a projector is attached to portable computer 's projector port. If no, the process ends at step  since a change in presentation modes is not possible and an appropriate message is provided to the user to check the projector connection. If yes, the process proceeds to step  to determine if the portable computer lid is open. If no, the process ends at step  since a closed lid indicates that the video port is in use, such as with a CRT display device. In alternative embodiments with multiple video ports, the check of lid position may be skipped or otherwise modified. If the lid is open, the process proceeds to step . In alternative embodiments, the detection of and switching to an unconfigured CRT display may be desirable and the process may be adjusted to select presentation through the CRT either in the CRT only or simulscan display modes as desired.","At step , a determination is made of the current display mode in order to find whether a selection was made to use a projector or discontinue use of a projector. If the presentation mode is not LCD only or CRT only, the process proceeds to step  for commands to discontinue the use of the projector. At step , presentation module  commands a switch to LCD only mode and signals presentation dynamic link library . At step , presentation dynamic link library  determines whether the previous LCD resolution settings were saved, such as at step . If no, then at step , presentation module  detects the highest LCD resolution available in cooperation with BIOS , saves that resolution as the resolution variable, and proceeds to step . At step , resolution application programming interface  sets the LCD resolution to the saved LCD resolution variable, which is either the variable saved at step  or the variable detected at step  depending on the result of the determination made at step .","If the determination at step  is yes that the display mode is either LCD only or CRT only, the presentation module  commands selection of presentation through projector . At step , presentation module  commands a switch by BIOS  from the current presentation mode to the simulscan presentation mode to enable presentation of information over both LCD  and projector . Presentation module  signals the change to the simulscan presentation mode to presentation dynamic link library . At step , presentation module  detects the resolution of projector  and provides the resolution to dynamic link library . At step , resolution application programming interface  configures portable computer  for projector  by setting the projector resolution to the highest resolution supported. In this manner, the user is provided with the clearest possible presentation of information over a previously unconfigured display device in an automated fashion based on a single selection from a presentation graphical user interface presented over a configured LCD. In alternative embodiments, the detection and setting of resolution may be provided through alternative configurations of BIOS and operating system functionality.","In other embodiments of the present invention, variations of the above steps provide even greater ease of use. For instance, the detection of a projector interface may be accomplished with active detect that periodically scans the projector port. As an example, when a presentation program enters a view designed for display of information over a projector, the presentation program may call presentation dynamic link library  into an active mode that commands presentation module  to scan the projector port for a projector interface. Upon detection of a projector interface, presentation module  signals presentation dynamic link  which may automatically proceed with selection of the simulscan presentation mode and resolution settings or which may pop up a graphical user interface informing the user that automated selection of the projector is available by, for instance, responding positively to the pop up window or selecting a key or key combination from key board . In addition, presentation dynamic link library  and presentation module  may configure other types of display devices added on the fly to information handling systems.","Although the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention may be better understood, and its numerous objects, features and advantages made apparent to those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.
