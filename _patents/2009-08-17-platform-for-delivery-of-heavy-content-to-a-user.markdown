title: Platform for delivery of heavy content to a user
abstract: Heavy content is selectively provided over a network to a client device using a background mode based on a user's tracked behavior and other profile information, such that the heavy content may be served up within a web page, messenger application, and/or other application when the user of the client device performs a particular action, such as requesting a web page configured to display the heavy content. Based on the user's profile, heavy content is downloaded onto the user's client device automatically without the user performing additional actions and before the user accesses a web page that may enable access to the heavy content. When the user requests a web page, the web page is parsed to determine whether it is configured for use with heavy content. If so, then the downloaded heavy content is served to the user based on the requested web page and user identifier.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments relate generally to delivery of content to a client device and, more particularly, but not exclusively to, based on a user's tracked behavior, downloading in a client device's background mode heavy content to the client device absent a link to or request for the content being detected such that the heavy content is available for display within a client application when requested. Moreover, such downloaded content is available to more than one client application.","Tremendous changes have been occurring in the Internet that influence our everyday lives. For example, in today's society, one of the first activities that a user might perform during their day is to turn on their computers is to communicate with friends, co-workers, family, as well as to read news and\/or a variety of other online content. In fact, today, many of a person's social activities are now being conducted over the Internet.","Thus, many people are looking to the Internet to provide them with richer, fuller content that might include live tutorials, movies, music, and yes, even richer advertisements. Many people today have identified advertisements to not only be entertaining, but educational and informative. However, delivering rich content that may include documents, movies, music files, applications, or the like, that might be large in size has been a slow and sometimes frustrating experience for an Internet user. Large content files, sometimes, called heavy content may include files that are anywhere between about one Megabyte in size to hundreds or even thousands of Megabytes in size. A traditional mechanism for delivering heavy content, such as movies, over the Internet has been to employ a content streaming communications protocol. However, as many people may have experienced, streamlining movies may result in skips, stalls, or other detectable delays in receipt of the content by the user. When a user wishes to fast forward, or even rewind, additional detectable delays may become apparent to the user, further providing increased frustration for the user. Thus, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the present invention has been made.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Among other things, the present invention may be embodied as methods or devices. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.","Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, though it may. As used herein, the term \u201cor\u201d is an inclusive \u201cor\u201d operator, and is equivalent to the term \u201cand\/or,\u201d unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term \u201cbased on\u201d is not exclusive and allows for being based on additional factors not described, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition, throughout the specification, the meaning of \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references. The meaning of \u201cin\u201d includes \u201cin\u201d and \u201con.\u201d","As used herein, the term \u201ccontent\u201d refers to any digital data that may be provided over a network for use by a receiving user. Examples of content include but are not limited to motion pictures, movies, videos, music, interactive media, audios, still images, text, graphics, scripts, applications, and other forms of digital data useable by a computing device. However, content is not limited to these examples, and virtually any digital data may be included, without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Content is further categorized into \u201cheavy content,\u201d or non-heavy content. As used herein, the term \u201cheavy content\u201d refers to any digital data that exceeds about one Megabyte in size. Thus, heavy content may include digital photographs, movies, computer games, applications, and advertisements.","As used here, the term \u201cbackground mode\u201d refers to actions that are performed within or by a computing device, such as a client device, that are performed using one or more of the computer's resources while another application is executing in a \u201cforeground mode\u201d such that the foreground mode application has priority for the resources over the background mode actions. Thus, an application or other action that is to execute in background mode waits until resources become available to execute. For example, if a foreground application is using memory of the computing device, the foreground mode may use memory that is available after the foreground application has been allocated memory. However, if the foreground application uses the resources such that there are insufficient resources for the background mode application to execute, then the background application waits, until resources are available.","The following briefly describes the embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This brief description is not intended as an extensive overview. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements, or to delineate or otherwise narrow the scope. Its purpose is merely to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Briefly stated, embodiments are directed towards providing heavy content over a network to a client device using the client's background mode, such that the heavy content may be served up within a web page, messenger application, and\/or other application when a user of the client device performs a particular action, such as request a web page configured to display of the heavy content. A user profile is determined based on a variety of network activities by the user, including browsing actions, purchase actions, messaging activities, blogging, or other social networking activities by the user over the network. The invention is not limited to these sources of user information and others are envisaged. In one embodiment, the user may be identified based on a messenger login identifier, an Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's client device, and\/or a variety of other accessible identifiers. Based on the user's profile, heavy content may be downloaded onto the user's client device using an offline download mechanism. Such downloads are typically performed automatically without the user performing an action, such as requesting the content, browsing a web page that includes a link or the like to the heavy content, or other actions. The downloaded content may then be stored on the client device. When the user subsequently performs some action, such as requesting a web page, the web page is examined or parsed to determine whether it is configured for use with heavy content. If so, then downloaded heavy content is selected based on the requested web page and user identifier. The heavy content is then inserted or otherwise provided through the user's browser. In one embodiment, the web page might include a default advertisement, which may be replaced by the heavy content. In another embodiment, different downloaded heavy content might be served to the user through the browser over time, when the user transitions from and then back to the web page, or performs some other browser related action. Where the user employs a messenger or other application, other indicators might be detected for use in serving heavy content to the user, including when a messenger application is displayed, or the like. In one embodiment, where multiple users might employ a same client device, heavy content may be downloaded offline for each user based on their unique user profile data. Thus, different heavy content might be displayed to different users for a same web page, messenger application, or the like. However, in another embodiment, where the users' profiles might include similarities, a same or similar heavy content might be provided to each of the users. In one embodiment, the delivery of heavy content is specific to delivery of heavy advertisements, which are defined as a form of communication used to help sell a product or service, and the advertisement is digitally greater than one Megabyte in size.","As herein described, embodiments of the invention employ mechanisms that are unlike traditional approaches that might receive a web page, analyze the web page for links to other content, and then prior to receiving a request to the other linked content, download the other linked content based on some expectation algorithm, or the like. Thus, traditional approaches must first receive the web page that provides the link to the other content. However, unlike such traditional mechanisms, the present invention does not require such first web page to analyze. Instead, content is provided to the client device independent of any such web page with links to other content. Thus, there is no web page to analyze in the present invention. Moreover, the other traditional approaches, the other linked content remains constrained to being accessed within a web browser. However, unlike the traditional approaches, the downloaded content in the present embodiments may be available to a variety of different applications, including, but not limited to messenger applications, such as an Instant Messenger (IM) application, email application, Short Messaging Service (SMS) application, or the like, as well as toolbars, game applications, video execution applications, photo management applications, or the like. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide numerous advantages over traditional approaches.","Illustrative Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","110","101","104","106","108","107"]},"One embodiment of a client device usable as one of client devices - is described in more detail below in conjunction with . Generally, however, client devices - may include virtually any mobile computing device capable of receiving and sending a message over a network, such as wireless network , or the like. Such devices include portable devices such as, cellular telephones, smart phones, display pagers, radio frequency (RF) devices, infrared (IR) devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), handheld computers, laptop computers, wearable computers, tablet computers, integrated devices combining one or more of the preceding devices, or the like. Client device  may include virtually any computing device that typically connects using a wired communications medium such as personal computers, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, or the like. In one embodiment, one or more of client devices - may also be configured to operate over a wired and\/or a wireless network.","Client devices - typically range widely in terms of capabilities and features. For example, a cell phone may have a numeric keypad and a few lines of monochrome LCD display on which only text may be displayed. In another example, a web-enabled client device may have a touch sensitive screen, a stylus, and several lines of color LCD display in which both text and graphics may be displayed.","A web-enabled client device may include a browser application that is configured to receive and to send web pages, web-based messages, or the like. The browser application may be configured to receive and display graphics, text, multimedia, or the like, employing virtually any web-based language, including a wireless application protocol messages (WAP), or the like. In one embodiment, the browser application is enabled to employ Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML), Wireless Markup Language (WML), WMLScript, JavaScript, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SMGL), HyperText Markup Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), or the like, to display and send information.","Client devices - also may include at least one other client application that is configured to, receive content from another computing device. The client application may include a capability to provide and receive textual content, multimedia information, or the like. The client application may further provide information that identifies itself, including a type, capability, name, or the like. In one embodiment, client devices - may uniquely identify themselves through any of a variety of mechanisms, including a phone number, Mobile Identification Number (MIN), an electronic serial number (ESN), mobile device identifier, network address, or other identifier. The identifier may be provided in a message, or the like, sent to another computing device.","Client devices - may also be configured to communicate a message, such as through email, SMS, MMS, IM, IRC, mIRC, Jabber, or the like, between another computing device. However, the present invention is not limited to these message protocols, and virtually any other message protocol may be employed.","Client devices - may further be configured to include a client application that enables the user to log into a user account that may be managed by another computing device, such as SDCS , or the like. Such user account, for example, may be configured to enable the user to receive emails, send\/receive IM messages, SMS messages, access selected web pages, or participates in any of a variety of other social networking activity. However, managing of messages or otherwise participating in other social activities may also be performed without logging into the user account. In one embodiment, a login identifier might be employed with the client application. Such login identifier may also be used to identifier the user for a variety of other activities, including tracking various network activities performed over a network by the user. While the login identifier may be used to track network activities, the other identifiers mentioned above, may also be used. Thus, one or more identifiers associated with the client device and\/or the user of the client device may be used to track network activities of the user. In one embodiment, BT  described below employs the one or more identifiers to associated monitored network activities with a user.","In one embodiment, the user of client devices - may also be enabled to access a web page, or other user interface that enables the user to enter, select, and\/or otherwise generate one or more content items, and\/or to read content items. In one embodiment, the user might again, employ a login identifier, or other type of identifier to access a web page, and\/or to provide content to a web page, or the like.","Wireless network  is configured to couple client devices - with network . Wireless network  may include any of a variety of wireless sub-networks that may further overlay stand-alone ad-hoc networks, or the like, to provide an infrastructure-oriented connection for client devices -. Such sub-networks may include mesh networks, Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, cellular networks, or the like.","Wireless network  may further include an autonomous system of terminals, gateways, routers, or the like connected by wireless radio links, or the like. These connectors may be configured to move freely and randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily, such that the topology of wireless network  may change rapidly.","Wireless network  may further employ a plurality of access technologies including 2nd (2G), 3rd (3G), 4th (4G) generation radio access for cellular systems, WLAN, Wireless Router (WR) mesh, or the like. Access technologies such as 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, and future access networks may enable wide area coverage for client devices, such as client devices - with various degrees of mobility. For example, wireless network  may enable a radio connection through a radio network access such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Bluetooth, or the like. In essence, wireless network  may include virtually any wireless communication mechanism by which information may travel between client devices - and another computing device, network, or the like.","Network  is configured to couple HCS , CIS , BT , and client device  with other computing devices, including through wireless network  to client devices -. Network  is enabled to employ any form of computer readable media for communicating information from one electronic device to another. Also, network  can include the Internet in addition to local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), direct connections, such as through a universal serial bus (USB) port, other forms of computer-readable media, or any combination thereof. On an interconnected set of LANs, including those based on differing architectures and protocols, a router acts as a link between LANs, enabling messages to be sent from one to another. In addition, communication links within LANs typically include twisted wire pair or coaxial cable, while communication links between networks may utilize analog telephone lines, full or fractional dedicated digital lines including T1, T2, T3, and T4, Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDNs), Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs), wireless links including satellite links, or other communications links known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, remote computers and other related electronic devices could be remotely connected to either LANs or WANs via a modem and temporary telephone link. In essence, network  includes any communication method by which information may travel between computing devices.","BT  includes virtually any one or more network devices that are configured to monitor activities over a network of one or more users to generate one or more user behavior profiles. In one embodiment, BT  might receive and\/or otherwise intercept messages between client devices -. BT  may then perform an analysis on the messages to collect various behavior information about the message sender\/receiver, including, but not limited to what a subject of the message is about, how often does the sender\/receiver send messages on such subject, or the like. BT  may analyze the messages to determine, for example, a hot word\/phrase\/subject list. For example, BT  might determine how often a particular word, phrase, or subject has occurred within messages from a particular sender (and\/or to a particular recipient). BT  is not limited to tracking merely messages however. BT  may track which websites a user frequents, types of activities performed while at the websites, whether the user provides content to the websites, makes purchases, a type of purchase made, and the like. In fact, virtually any activity performed by a user over a network might be tracked and recorded. BT  may further analysis the various tracked activities to determine whether their might be a pattern of activities by the user.","In one embodiment, BT  obtains an identifier for the user, such as a login identifier, and\/or a client device identifier, or the like. BT  may then store various information, analysis results, patterns, hot word\/phrase\/subject lists, and the like, for a particular user based on the obtained identifier. In one embodiment, BT  might store such information for the user within a user behavior profile.","It should be noted, however, that the invention is not limited to merely BT  performing such tracking, and other network devices, websites, messenger services, Internet Service Providers (ISP), or the like, may also track various networking activities for a user and provide at least some of their tracked data to BT . For example, in one embodiment, a website, blog, network service, or the like, might be configured, collect information about a reputation of the user for at least their online activities. A reputation might be based on a variety of user activities, as well as based on feedback about the user's activities from other users. Such reputation information might therefore be collected, analyzed, and provided to BT  for storage, at least in part, within a user's behavior profile. Thus, a user's behavior profile includes information about the user for which the user typically does not directly provide to BT . However, the invention is not so limited, and other information may also be included. For example, in one embodiment, survey results and other direct entries by the user might also be used. For example, the user might provide selected information about the user's age, occupation, likes\/dislikes, or the like.","CIS  includes one or more network devices configured to receive and to store heavy content, including heavy advertisements, heavy movies, photographs, tutorials, and the like. CIS  may receive the heavy content from any of a variety of sources (not shown) including, but not limited to content producers, such as film producers, content aggregators, content distributors, or the like. CIS  may also receive advertisements, and the like, from advertisers, product providers, service providers, or the like. CIS  may even receive heavy content from other users, from BT , ISPs, and\/or other product\/service providers. In one embodiment, CIS  may employ a plurality of database structures to manage the heavy content. However, the invention is not so limited and other storage schemes may also be used, including, for example, folders, links to other sources, scripts, applications, or the like.","HCS  includes one or more network devices that are configured to provide heavy content to client devices - in a client's background mode, such that the heavy content is available for display (and\/or for audio play), when an application on the client device that is so configured, indicates that heavy content is to be displayed, as described further below. HCS  may receive an identifier from a client device, and use the identifier to locate a user behavior profile from BT  that includes tracked behaviors of a user of the client device. HCS  may then use the user behavior profile to select one or more heavy content items stored on CIS . HCS  may then, automatically download the selected (determined) heavy content items to a client device associated with the identifier using a background mode of the client device, without receiving a request from the client device for the heavy content items.","HCS  may also download one or more heavy content modules to a client device such that the heavy content modules may be installed onto the client device for use in performing some or more of the above actions of HCS , including, for example, requesting a user behavior profile from BT , selecting heavy content items from CIS , and\/or automatically downloading in a client background mode the selected one or more heavy content items. The downloaded heavy client modules may further detect various conditions, events, or the like, for which heavy content is to be displayed or otherwise presented to a user at the client device, as described further below. Thus, in one embodiment, HCS  may perform various actions, on behalf of a client device, and\/or provide heavy content modules to the client device to enable the client device to perform one or more actions associated with managing heavy content. In still another embodiment, a combination of HCS  and the downloaded client modules may perform such heavy content management activities. Hence, HCS  and\/or the downloaded heavy content modules may employ processes such as described below in conjunction with  to perform at least some of their actions.","Devices that may operate as HCS , CIS , and\/or BT  include, but are not limited to personal computers, desktop computers, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, servers, network appliances, and the like.","Although HCS  is illustrated as a distinct network device, the invention is not so limited. For example, a plurality of network devices may be configured to perform the operational aspects of HCS . For example, in one embodiment, the managing downloading heavy content might be performed by one network device, and managing access to BT  and\/or CIS  might be performed by another network device. However, in another embodiment, functionality of HCS , CIS , and\/or BT  might be performed using a single network device. For example, as described below in conjunction with , functions of HCS , CIS , and\/or BT  are described within a single network device. However, as noted above, other configurations are also envisaged. Thus, system  (and network device ) should not be construed as limiting the invention, and other system structures may be used.","Illustrative Client Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","200","101","104"]},"As shown in the figure, client device  includes a processing unit (CPU)  in communication with a mass memory  via a bus .

In one embodiment, the background downloading is configurable using an Application Programming Interface (API), or other user interface, that may be exposed by operating system  and\/or client content manager . In one embodiment, the downloaded heavy content items may be indexed within heavy content store  based on a user identifier, or the like. In this manner, heavy content store  may manage heavy content items for different users (identifiers).","Heavy pusher  and heavy content agent  may operate together, in one embodiment, to deliver heavy content items to one or more different applications , including browser  and\/or messenger . In one embodiment, heavy pusher  represents a component that is configured to retrieve one or more heavy content items from heavy content store  and deposit it into a heavy content enabled location for an application, such as messenger , or the like. In one embodiment, heavy pusher  may employ a local zone within client device  for which content may be provided to a variety of applications . Such local zones are arranged based on various security levels of client device  to enable other applications to communicate relatively unencumbered by such security measures as sandboxes, or the like. In any event, one or more applications  may then access and display or otherwise enable a user to access the deposited heavy content item. For example, in one embodiment, messenger  might locate the deposited heavy content item and display the content item within a toolbar or banner location, or within a skin location of messenger . In one embodiment, messenger  might replace a non-heavy content item with the deposited heavy content item. In another embodiment, messenger  might display or otherwise provide access to the deposited heavy content item within a message displayed to a user within messenger .","Heavy content agent  represents one or more components that may be web browser enabled, such as a browser plug-in, or the like, that enables delivery of heavy content items into a web page. In one embodiment, therefore, heavy content agent  may be an ActiveX component, a browser extension, an application, script, applet, or the like. For example, in one embodiment, heavy content agent  might be a Firefox extension for Firefox and\/or Google Chrome browsers.","Thus, in one embodiment, a web page might be arranged to include traditional content slots. Such slots might be identified via links, tags, scripts, or the like. In one embodiment, then, heavy content items might be delivered to a web page having such slots by providing a default content item plus an additional HTML tag, or the like for heavy content. The web page may then be parsed or otherwise analyzed for the tag, link, script, or the like. In one embodiment, the heavy content item tags in a web page might appear as the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<! - yh_mgr.slots.Middle1 = {content_size_list: [\u201c400\u00d7350\u201d],"]},{"entry":[{},"content_delivery_mode: \u201cheavy\u201d, content_format_list: [ ] } -->"]},{"entry":[{},"<! - yh_mgr.slots.Frame1 = {content_size_list: [\u201c234\u00d7234\u201d],"]},{"entry":[{},"content_delivery_mode: \u201cheavy\u201d, content_format_list: [ ] } --> ;"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"It should be noted, however, that the above tag format is to be viewed as one embodiment, of a non-exhaustive, non-limiting example. As such, other tag structures, options, parameters, and the like, may also be used, without departing from the scope of the invention.","In any event, in one embodiment, heavy content agent  may intercept the web page, parse the web page to detect the tag, such as illustrated above, and determine that the web page is configured to serve heavy content (e.g., content_delivery_mode: \u201cheavy\u201d). Heavy content agent  may then call heavy pusher , which may in turn call client content manage  to check a target user behavior profile of a web user. Based on the target user behavior profile, heavy pusher  may retrieve the heavy content item(s) from heavy content store . Heavy content agent  may then take the heavy content item(s) and place it into the web page. In one embodiment, heavy content agent  may replace a default content item with the heavy content item(s).","Client content manager , heavy pusher , and\/or heavy content agent  may employ some or all of processes  and  described below in conjunction with  to perform at least some of their actions.","Illustrative Network Device Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","106","108","107"]},"Network device  includes processing unit , video display adapter , and a mass memory, all in communication with each other via bus . The mass memory generally includes RAM , ROM , and one or more permanent mass storage devices, such as hard disk drive , tape drive, optical drive, and\/or floppy disk drive. The mass memory stores operating system  for controlling the operation of network device . Any general-purpose operating system may be employed. Basic input\/output system (\u201cBIOS\u201d)  is also provided for controlling the low-level operation of network device . As illustrated in , network device  also can communicate with the Internet, or some other communications network, via network interface unit , which is constructed for use with various communication protocols including the TCP\/IP protocol. Network interface unit  is sometimes known as a transceiver, transceiving device, or network interface card (NIC).","The mass memory as described above illustrates another type of computer-readable media, namely computer storage media. Computer-readable storage media may include volatile, nonvolatile, removable, and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Examples of computer readable storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other physical medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a computing device.","The mass memory also stores program code and data. For example, mass memory might include data stores . Data stores  may be include virtually any mechanism usable for store and managing data, including but not limited to a file, a folder, a document, or an application, such as a database, spreadsheet, or the like. Data stores  may manage information that might include, but is not limited to web pages, account information, or the like, as well as scripts, applications, applets, and the like. Data stores  may also include various heavy content modules that may be downloaded and installed on one or more client devices, such as client devices - of . Further, data stores  may include heavy content inventory . Heavy content inventory  may mange heavy content items for use by one or more client devices and\/or one or more user identifiers. In one embodiment, heavy content inventory  may be indexed based on a subject, or the like. At some of the data and other information stored within data stores  may be stored in part or in whole on other computer readable storage media including, hard disk drive , cd-rom\/dvd-rom drive , or even on another remote network device.","One or more applications  may be loaded into mass memory for execution by central processing unit  to perform various actions. Such applications  may include, but are not limited to HTTP programs, customizable user interface programs, IPSec applications, encryption programs, security programs, VPN programs, web servers, account management, and so forth. Applications  may include web services , Message Server (MS) , Remote Heavy Content Manager (RHCM) , and behavior tracker .","Web services  represent any of a variety of services that are configured to provide content, including messages, over a network to another computing device. Thus, web services  include for example, a web server, messaging server, a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, a database server, a content server, or the like. Web services  may provide the content including messages over the network using any of a variety of formats, including, but not limited to WAP, HDML, WML, SMGL, HTML, XML, cHTML, xHTML, or the like. In at least one web page provided through web services , might be a tag, link, or other mechanism, useable to identify that the web page is configured to server heavy content. In one embodiment, the web page might include a default content item that may be subsequently replaced by a heavy content item at the client device. In another embodiment, the web page might merely include a tag, link, or other mechanism where a heavy content item may be inserted, in absence of a default content item.","Message server  may include virtually any computing component or components configured and arranged to forward messages from message user agents, and\/or other message servers, or to deliver messages to a local message store, such as data stores , or the like. Thus, message server  may include a message transfer manager to communicate a message employing any of a variety of email protocols, including, but not limited, to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), NNTP, or the like.","However, message server  is not constrained to email messages, and other messaging protocols may be managed by one or more components of message server . Thus, message server  may also be configured to manage SMS messages, IM, MMS, IRC, mIRC, or any of a variety of other message types.","Behavior tracker  represents a component within network device  that is configured to monitor activities over a network of one or more users to generate one or more user behavior profiles. As such, behavior tracker  might perform substantially similar actions as BT  of , including storing one or more user behavior profiles within data stores .

RHCM  may further manage various aspects of delivery of heavy content items to a client device based a user behavior profile. As such, in one embodiment, RHCM  might interact with behavior tracker  to receive an identifier from a client device, such as a client device identifier, login identifier, or the like. RHCM  might then provide the identifier to behavior tracker  such that behavior tracker  may store tracked user network activities and detected patterns in data stores  based on the identifier. RHCM  might further perform various analyses of the stored user behavior profiles to select one or more content items from within heavy content inventory . RHCM  may then operate in conjunction with various client heavy content modules to automatically provide the selected heavy content items to the client device using a background mode of operation of the client device, without receiving a request from the client device for the heavy content items through a web page, messenger application, or the like. In one embodiment, however, a client heavy content module may be configured to, instead of using RHCM , select and request downloading the content items using the client device's background mode of operation. Thus, it should be understood that RHCM  may select and provide the heavy content items, and\/or a downloaded heavy content module may select and\/or request downloading of the heavy content items. In either instance, the heavy content items are downloaded absent an analysis being performed of a message, and\/or web page to detect a link to, or similar mechanism that requests the heavy content item. As noted above, then, such heavy content items are downloaded independent of any requests identified within a web page, a message, or similar application for the heavy content item.","Generalized Operation","The operation of certain aspects of the invention will now be described with respect to .  illustrates a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of a process for managing a user's behavior profile based in part of tracked network activities.

In one embodiment, the user identifier is received from a client device, as a login identifier to a messenger, application, web page, or the like. In another embodiment, the received user identifier is a client device identifier, such as those described above.","Processing then flows to block , where various user actions, activities, and the like, are tracked and recorded. In one embodiment, at least some of the activities may be time stamped, such that patterns may be detected. Similarly, at least some of the activities may be summarized to minimize an amount of information tracked for the user. As noted, virtually any network activity performed by a user over a network may be tracked, including, but not limited to where a user \u2018goes\u2019 on the network (which URLs, network devices, or the like, that the user accesses); when the user performs an activity, a type of activity (browsing, sending\/receiving messages), blogging, reading, purchasing, downloading items, or the like.","Processing continues to block , where at least some information about the user's activities may be received from other sources. For example, where the user posts articles and\/or comments to articles on a network device, information about the user's activities might be generated. For example, other users might provide comments to the user's activities that may then be used to generate a reputation for the user. Such reputation information may then be provided, as but one example, of information from other sources. Credit ratings, purchase histories, educational histories, and the like, are but other non-limiting, non-exhaustive examples of information that may be obtained from other sources about the user's networking activities.","Continuing next to block  the tracked behavior activities, including the information received from other sources, may be analyzed to detect patterns of the user's networking activities. For example, it might be detected that the user seeks educational information about new vehicles, during a particular time of day, from particular network sources, or the like. Similarly, the user might seek restaurant and\/or recipe information at particular times of day, from particular network sources, or the like. In any event, such patterns may also be collected.","Process  then flows to block , where such activities and patterns may be stored in a user's behavior profile that is indexed based on the user identifier of block .

In one embodiment, the multiple client applications might display a same heavy content item. However, in another embodiment, different heavy content items might be displayed within different client applications, based further on a subject of the client application. For example, a web page might be currently displayed, or being accessed by the user's browser that is associated with movies, while the user's messenger might be include message communications with another user about food, restaurants, or the like. Thus, different heavy content items may also be selected based on a currently user behavior and\/or context associated with the client application. Therefore, at block , a same or different heavy content item might be selected and retrieved for the messenger application, based on a context associated with the messenger application, as well as the user's behavior profile and user identifier.
