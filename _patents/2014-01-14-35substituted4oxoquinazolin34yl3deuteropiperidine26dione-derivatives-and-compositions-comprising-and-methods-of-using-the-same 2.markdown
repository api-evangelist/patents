The hydrogen at the 3-position is acidic due to the presence of the adjacent carbonyl moiety, thereby making it difficult to prevent racemization of the two stereoisomers and difficult to determine if one of the stereoisomers is superior to the other.","The present invention provides new compounds that are resistant to racemization at their stereogenic center, and are useful in the treatment of various medical disorders.","Accordingly, described herein are 3-deuterium-enriched 3-(5-substituted-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-piperidine-2,6-diones (e.g., 3-(5-substituted-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-3-deutero-piperidine-2,6-diones) and stereoisomers, solvates, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.","Another aspect provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the deuterium-enriched compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Another aspect is a method for treating, preventing, and\/or managing angiogenesis and\/or a cytokine related disorder, comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the deutero-compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Another aspect is a method for treating, preventing, and\/or managing a cancer, comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the deutero-compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Another aspect is a method for treating, preventing, and\/or managing a disease associated with lymphocytic activity, including activity of B cells and\/or T cells, e.g., immune-related diseases or inflammatory diseases, comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the deutero-compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Also provided are novel 3-deuterium-enriched 3-(5-substituted-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-piperidine-2,6-diones or a stereoisomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in therapy.","Another aspect is the use of novel 3-deuterium-enriched 3-(5-substituted-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-piperidine-2,6-diones or a stereoisomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament (e.g., for the treatment of angiogenesis and\/or a cytokine related disorder). In certain instances, the treatment is for cancer, an immune-related disease, or an inflammatory disease.","These and other aspects, which will become apparent during the following detailed description, have been achieved by the inventor's discovery of 3-deuterium-enriched 3-(5-substituted-4-oxoquinazolin-3 (4H)-yl)-piperidine-2,6-diones.","Deuterium (D or H) is a stable, non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen and has an atomic weight of 2.014. Hydrogen naturally occurs as a mixture of the isotopes H (hydrogen or protium), D (H or deuterium), and T (H or tritium). The natural abundance of deuterium is 0.015%. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that in all chemical compounds with a H atom, the H atom actually represents a mixture of H and D, with about 0.015% being D. Thus, compounds with a level of deuterium that has been enriched to be greater than its natural abundance of 0.015%, should be considered unnatural and, as a result, novel over their non-enriched counterparts. Thus, the present invention relates to a deuterium-enriched compound or compounds whose enrichment is greater than naturally occurring deuterated molecules.","All percentages given for the amount of deuterium present are mole percentages. Further, when a variable is not accompanied by a definition, the previous definition of the variable controls.","Unless indicated otherwise, when a D is specifically recited at a position or is shown in a formula, this D represents a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium where the amount of deuterium is about 100% (i.e., the abundance of deuterium is from 90% to 100%). In certain aspects, the abundance of deuterium is from 97% to 100%).","The 3-deuterium group (i.e., the Z group) in the present compounds means that the compounds have been isotopically enriched at the 3-position and are different and distinct from the corresponding non-enriched compound.","Compound refers to a quantity of molecules that is sufficient to be weighed, tested for its structural identity, and to have a demonstrable use (e.g., a quantity that can be shown to be active in an assay, an in vitro test, or in vivo test, or a quantity that can be administered to a patient and provide a therapeutic benefit).","One aspect of the invention provides a deuterium-enriched compound of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"29.13mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09540340-20170110-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and stereoisomers thereof, wherein:","Z is H or D, provided that the abundance of deuterium in Z is at least 30%;","R, R, R, R, R, R, R, and Rare independently selected from H and D;","Ris selected from: H; D; \u2014(CH)OH; phenyl; \u2014O(C-C)alkyl; and (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo;","Ris selected from: H; D; halo; \u2014(CH)OH; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo; and \u2014(CH)NHR;","Ris selected from: H; D; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; \u2014(CH)-(6 to 10 membered aryl); \u2014C(O)(CH)-(6 to 10 membered aryl); \u2014C(O)(CH)-(6 to 10 membered heteroaryl); \u2014C(O)(C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; \u2014C(O)(CH)\u2014(C-C-cycloalkyl); \u2014C(O)(CH)\u2014NRR, \u2014C(O)(CH)\u2014O\u2014(C-C)alkyl; and, \u2014C(O)(CH)\u2014O\u2014(CH)-(6 to 10 membered aryl); wherein the aryl and heteroaryl are optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from: halo; \u2014SCF; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; and (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo;","Rand Rare each independently selected from: H; D; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo; and 6 to 10 membered aryl; the aryl being optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from: halo; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; and (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo;","alternatively, Ris selected from R, R, R;","Ris selected from: H; D; halo; \u2014(CH)OH; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; and (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo;","R=\u2014(CH)\u2014NHR;","R=\u2014(CH)\u2014NHR;","Ris selected from: H; D; \u2014(C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; \u2014C(O)(C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; \u2014C(O)(CH)(C-C-cycloalkyl); \u2014C(O)(CH)NRR; and, \u2014C(O)(CH)O(C-C)alkyl.","Rand Rare each independently selected from: hydrogen; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; and (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo;","Ris selected from: \u2014C(O)(CH)\u2014NHR; \u2014(CH)-(6 to 10 membered aryl); \u2014C(O)(CH)-(6 to 10 membered aryl); \u2014C(O)(CH)-(6 to 10 membered heteroaryl); and, \u2014C(O)(CH)O(CH)-(6 to 10 membered aryl), wherein the aryl and heteroaryl are optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from: halo; \u2014SCF; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; and, (C-C)alkoxy substituted with one or more halo;","Ris selected from: 6 to 10 membered aryl optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from: halo; (C-C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halo; and, (C-C)alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more halo;","n is independently selected from selected from 0, 1, and 2; and","a hydrogen atom present in any substituent is optionally replaced by D.","In another aspect, n is 0.

Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and\/or improve the efficacy of the treatment.","Consequently, in another aspect, a compound provided herein is administered daily in a single or divided doses in a four to six week cycle with a rest period of about a week or two weeks. Cycling therapy further allows the frequency, number, and length of dosing cycles to be increased. Thus, another aspect encompasses the administration of a compound provided herein for more cycles than are typical when it is administered alone. In yet another aspect, a compound provided herein is administered for a greater number of cycles than would typically cause dose-limiting toxicity in a patient to whom a second active ingredient is not also being administered.","In another aspect, a compound provided herein is administered daily and continuously for three or four weeks at a dose of from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day, followed by a rest of one or two weeks.

Exemplary General Procedures for Synthesis of Deuterium-Enriched Compounds","The hydrogens present on the 3-(5-substituted-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-3-deutero-piperidine-2,6-diones have different capacities for exchange with deuterium.

Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; powders; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations suitable for topical administration; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.","The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms will typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms are used will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","In another aspect of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art including, but are not limited to, the way in which the dosage form will be administered to a patient. For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example, the decomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose, or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently, provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little, if any, lactose other mono- or di-saccharides. As used herein, the term \u201clactose-free\u201d means that the amount of lactose present, if any, is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient.","Lactose-free compositions can comprise excipients that are well known in the art and are listed, for example, in the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) 25-NF20 (2002). In general, lactose-free compositions comprise active ingredients, a binder\/filler, and a lubricant in pharmaceutically compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. In another aspect, lactose-free dosage forms comprise active ingredients, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate.","Also provided are anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising active ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles & Practice, 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, N.Y., 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and\/or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment, and use of formulations.","Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected.","An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are, in another aspect, packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, dose containers (e.g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.","Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as \u201cstabilizers,\u201d include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers.","Like the amounts and types of excipients, the amounts and specific types of active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as, but are not limited to, the route by which it is to be administered to patients. In another aspect, dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein in an amount of from about 0.10 to about 500 mg. Examples of dosages include, but are not limited to, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 mg.","In another aspect, dosage forms comprise the second active ingredient in an amount of 1 to about 1000 mg, from about 5 to about 500 mg, from about 10 to about 350 mg, or from about 50 to about 200 mg. Of course, the specific amount of the second active agent will depend on the specific agent used, the diseases or disorders being treated or managed, and the amount(s) of a compound provided herein, and any optional additional active agents concurrently administered to the patient.","Pharmaceutical compositions that are suitable for oral administration can be provided as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","Oral dosage forms provided herein are prepared by combining the active ingredients in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.","In another aspect, the present invention provides oral dosage forms that are tablets or capsules, in which case solid excipients are employed. In another aspect, the tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary.","For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, disintegrants, and lubricants. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited to, the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581, AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division, Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, Pa.), and mixtures thereof. An specific binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL-PH-103\u2122 and Starch 1500 LM.","Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions is, in another aspect, present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form.","Disintegrants may be used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredients may be used to form solid oral dosage forms. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. In another aspect, pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.","Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof","Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a Syloid\u00ae silica gel (AEROSIL200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Piano, Tex.), CAB-O-SIL (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, Mass.), and mixtures thereof. If used at all, lubricants may be used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are incorporated.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a solid oral dosage form comprising a compound provided herein, anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, stearic acid, colloidal anhydrous silica, and gelatin.","Active ingredients provided herein can also be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595, 5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active agents provided herein. In another aspect, the present invention procies single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but are not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.","Controlled-release pharmaceutical products improve drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a controlled-release preparation in medical treatment characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.","In another aspect, the controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In another aspect, in order to maintain a constant level of drug in the body, the drug can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlle release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but are not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.","Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including, but are not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Administration of a parenteral dosage form bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, and thus, in these aspects, parenteral dosage forms are sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.","Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but are not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but are not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and nonaqueous vehicles such as, but are not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","Compounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms. For example, cyclodextrin and its derivatives can be used to increase the solubility of a compound provided herein. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,134,127, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.","Topical and mucosal dosage forms provided herein include, but are v+ limited to, sprays, aerosols, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980 & 1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 4th ed., Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels.","Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide topical and mucosal dosage forms encompassed herein are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. In another aspect, excipients include, but are not limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof to form solutions, emulsions or gels, which are nontoxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms. Examples of additional ingredients are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980 & 1990).","The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Also, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In other aspects, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, or as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. In other aspects, salts, solvates, prodrugs, or stereoisomers of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition.","In another aspect, the active ingredients provided herein are not administered to a patient at the same time or by the same route of administration. In another aspect, provided are kits which can simplify the administration of appropriate amounts of active ingredients.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a kit comprising a dosage form of a compound provided herein. Kits can further comprise additional active ingredients such as oblimersen (Genasense\u00ae), melphalan, G-CSF, GM-CSF, EPO, topotecan, dacarbazine, irinotecan, taxotere, IFN, COX-2 inhibitor, pentoxifylline, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, IL-2, IL-8, IL-18, Ara-C, vinorelbine, isotretinoin, 13 cis-retinoic acid, or a pharmacologically active mutant or derivative thereof, or a combination thereof. Examples of the additional active ingredients include, but are not limited to, those disclosed herein.","In other aspects, the kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active ingredients. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, syringes, drip bags, patches, and inhalers.","Kits can further comprise cells or blood for transplantation as well as pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active ingredients. For example, if an active ingredient is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration, the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active ingredient can be dissolved to form a particulate-free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but are not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but are not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but are not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","The invention now being generally described, will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0405","num":"0445"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00053","num":"00053"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00053","he":"19.30mm","wi":"70.78mm","file":"US09540340-20170110-C00053.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"2-Amino-6-nitrobenzoic acid (25.0 g, 137 mmol) was mixed with acetic anhydride (50 mL, 529 mmol) and the resulting mixture was heated to 120\u00b0 C. by placing the reaction vessel containing this mixture in an oil bath for 2 hours, while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC.

Exposure to the enantiomers of the protonated molecule is stereoselective with h\u2212 representing 39% of the total exposure. Exposure to the deuterated enantiomers shows the same stereoselectivity. Exposure to the protonated enantiomers h\u2212 and h+ upon administration of the deuterated enantiomers represents about 10-14% of the total exposure, corresponding to the amount of protonated compound in the dosed material. Little to no D\/H exchange is evidenced in the pharmacokinetic parameters, and exposure to the dosed enantiomer (protonated and deuterated) represents 96-98% of the total exposure.","Female CB.17 SCID mice (8-12 weeks of age, N=60) were administered 1\u00d710H929 tumor cells in 50% Matrigel subcutaneously in their flank (0.2 mL\/mouse). Animals were returned to their cages and tumor growth was monitored. Tumor size was reported as tumor volume (Vol) calculated as Vol=\u00bd (L*W), where L and W are the length and width of the tumor as measured by caliper (L>W). A pair match was performed when tumors reached an average size of 100-150 mmand the animals were divided into 6 treatment groups of N=10 animals each.","Animals were treated daily by oral gavage (10 mL\/kg) with vehicle, d\u2212 (1.5 or 15 mg\/kg), d+(1.5 or 15 mg\/kg), or h-rac (racemic mixture of protonated enantiomers h\u2212 and h+; 3 mg\/kg). The compound h-rac was administered at twice the dose of the deuterated enantiomers since it contains 50% (i.e., 1.5 mg\/kg) of each enantiomer. Body weight measurements were taken daily for the first week then biweekly. Tumor sizes were measured by caliper biweekly. The study was terminated after 23 days of dosing, then all animals were euthanized.","Tumor volume as a function of time is shown in . As the results in  show, deuterated enantiomer d\u2212 was more potent at limiting tumor growth at both doses than h\u2212 rac (i.e., the racemic mixture of compound not enriched in deuterium). The other deuterated enantiomer (i.e., d+) was less efficacious than d\u2212, and efficacy for d+ was observed only at the highest dose of d+.","All references listed herein are individually incorporated in their entirety by reference.","Numerous modifications and variations of the invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
