{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The Government of the United States of America may have rights in the present invention as a result of Contract No. N00019-02-C-3003 awarded by the Department of the Navy.","(a) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a turbine engine component having a fanned trailing edge teardrop array for improving aerodynamic and thermal performance.","(b) Prior Art","A large number of turbine blades have internal cooling passages. Often, fluid in the rearmost cooling passage is ejected externally of the blade. One such coolant ejection system is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,503,529 to Anselmi et al. Another such blade is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,913 to Reddy.","The Anselmi et al. patent shows a turbine blade having angled ejection slots. The ejection slots are formed in one of the airfoil sidewalls. Adjacent the slots are a plurality of tapering ribs for directing the fluid aftward. In order for the flow in a coolant passageway to enter one of the slots, the flow must turn more than 90 degrees. As a result, the Anselmi et al. blade has poor thermal performance.","The Reddy blade is similar in design to the Anselmi et al. blade. In Reddy, the ejection slots empty the coolant fluid being discharged into a trough arranged in a column immediately adjacent the trailing edge. The column of troughs is disposed in the pressure sidewall of the blade. Each trough has sidewalls which decrease in depth for blending the troughs downstream to the trailing edge. Further, the sidewalls of each trough diverge radially for distributing the coolant ejected from the slots. This blade is also suffers from poor thermal performance.","In turbine applications, coolant air flowing through film holes and trailing edge exits in the airfoil portion of a turbine blade contributes efficiency loss due to coolant injection mixing with the gas path and accelerating the coolant into the free stream velocity. The greater the angles between the free stream gas path and the coolant injection, the greater the loss of efficiency. While teardrop designs are known in the art, they have conventionally been designed axially regardless of the gas path streamline angles.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a turbine engine component having a reduced aero mixing loss by aligning coolant injection slots features with non axial airfoil surface streamlines which improves overall turbine mixing efficiency and minimizes additional mixing loss.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a turbine engine components that has improved thermal performance as a result of a reduction in the relative diffusion angle between the injected coolant flow and the streamline direction of the mainstream gas.","It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide an improved trailing edge slot film effectiveness and improved internal performance.","The foregoing objects are attained by the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a component for use in a gas turbine engine is provided. The component broadly comprises an airfoil portion having a trailing edge, and means for maximizing thermal performance of the component by reducing a relative diffusion angle between an injected coolant flow and a streamline direction of a fluid passing over the airfoil portion. The component may be a variety of turbine engine components including, but not limited to, a blade and a vane.","Other details of the fanned trailing edge teardrop array, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.","Referring now to , a component  to be used in a gas turbine engine is shown. The component  may be a turbine blade or a vane. The component  has an airfoil portion  with a leading edge  and a non-linear, preferably arcuately, shaped trailing edge . Internal of the component  are cooling passageways , , , and . Also internal of the component  is a trailing edge cooling passage  which has an inlet  for receiving a cooling fluid.","A plurality of cooling fluid injection slots  are located in the trailing edge region of the component . The injection slots  are formed by a non-linear, preferably arcuate, array of spaced apart teardrop shaped assemblies . Each teardrop shaped assembly  preferably has an arcuate shaped leading edge , flat portions  and  extending outwardly from the leading edge , and tapering angled portions  and  extending from the flat portions  and  to a trailing edge . The extent of the flat portions  and  depends upon the flow passing through the slots . If desired, the flat portions  and  may be omitted. Each teardrop shaped assembly  has a central longitudinal axis . The injection slots  are designed to create a fan shaped coolant flow which mimics the gas path free stream (see ).","The cooling passage  has a plurality of outlets  through which cooling fluid leaves the passage . The outlets  are also arranged in a non-linear, preferably arcuate, array. Each of the individual outlets  is formed by a pair of spaced apart ribs  and  positioned in one of the arcuately shaped walls  and . Each cooling fluid outlet  has a central axis  which is preferably aligned with the longitudinal axis  of one of the teardrop shaped assemblies .","Intermediate the outlets  and the teardrop shaped assemblies are a plurality of pedestals  which form a plurality of flow passages . As can be seen from , the pedestals  vary in density in a spanwise direction. The pedestals  are configured so that the flow exiting one of the outlets  impinges directly onto one of the pedestals . The flow passages  formed by the pedestals  are preferably axially aligned with the injection slots . Further as can be seen in , a plurality of the pedestals  may be aligned along an axis which coincides with the central longitudinal axis  of the teardrop shaped assemblies .","By providing the above described structure, it is possible to reduce aero mixing loss by aligning the coolant injection slots  with non axial airfoil surface streamlines. This improves the overall turbine mixing efficiency and minimizes the additional mixing loss that occurs with axially aligned teardrops.","Further, the above described structure maximizes thermal performance by reducing the relative diffusion angle between the injected coolant flow and the streamline direction of the mainstream fluid. The reduction of the relative angle between the coolant and the mainstream fluid flow minimizes the potential for separated flow off the teardrop diffuser. Separated flow off a trailing edge teardrop feature can lead to premature oxidation of the trailing edge region, resulting in accelerated reduction in turbine efficiency, performance, and airfoil life.","The design of the present invention also optimizes trailing edge slot film effectiveness resulting from non separated flow off non-axial trailing edge teardrop features which increases trailing edge adiabatic film effectiveness and reduces suction side lip metal temperatures resulting in improved thermal performance.","The design of the present invention by aligning trailing edge teardrop features with upstream coolant flow field direction minimizes the potential for internal flow separation and additional pressure loss off the trailing edge teardrop features resulting in a reduction of the overall flow capacity of the trailing edge circuit for a given trailing edge slot geometry and flow area. The reduction in flow capacity may adversely impact the overall thermal performance of trailing edge design reducing its cooling potential for a fixed operating pressure ratio from Pto Pdump.","The non-axial teardrop features of the present invention improve the ceramic core producibility by minimizing the required throat meter length between adjacent teardrop features. Since it is important that an effective metering length be established to accurately control the trailing edge slot flow, a minimum slot length based on the slot hydraulic diameter is required. Given the axial bow and curvature of the local trailing edge, it is advantageous to orient the teardrop features as shown above to minimize the required meter length necessary to establish fully developed flow. In doing so, the overall teardrop length can be reduced which significantly improves the moment of inertia characteristics of the trailing edge teardrop feature and improves the overall stiffness of the trailing edge core and producibility.","By fanning the teardrop shaped assemblies of the present invention as shown in  to match the free stream shown in , the efficiency loss can be significantly reduced.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a fanned trailing edge teardrop array which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
