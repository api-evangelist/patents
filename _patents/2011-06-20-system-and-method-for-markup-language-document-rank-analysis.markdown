{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This Application claims priority from US Provisional Application No. 61\/356,607, filed on Jun. 20, 2010, and from US Provisional Application No. 61\/394,350, filed on Oct. 19, 2010, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention is of a system and method for mark-up language document rank analysis, and in particular but not exclusively, to such a system and method that is useful for determining one or more differences between mark-up language documents with regard to their relative rank.","Search engines play important roles for supporting user interactions with the Internet. Search engines often act as a \u201cgateway\u201d to the Internet for many users, who use them to locate information of interest as a first resource. They are practically indispensable for negotiating the many thousands of web pages that form the World Wide Web.","Many users typically review only the first page or first few pages of search results that are provided by a search engine. For this reason, owners of web sites alter their web pages to increase their rank, whether by making the pages more \u201cfriendly\u201d to spiders or by altering content, layout, tags and so forth. This process of changing a web page to increase its rank is known as SEO or \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d.","Currently search engine optimization is typically performed manually. Search engines carefully guard their rules and algorithms for determining rank, both against competitors and also to avoid \u201cspam\u201d web pages which do not provide useful content but which seek only to have a high ranking, for example to attract advertisers. However, manual analysis and adjustments are highly limited and may miss many important improvements to web pages that could raise their rank in search engine results.","The background art does not teach or suggest a system and method for mark-up language document rank analysis that may be performed automatically and that may also determine one or more differences between mark-up language documents with regard to their relative rank.","The present invention overcomes these drawbacks of the background art by providing, in at least some embodiments, a system and method for mark-up language document rank analysis that may be performed automatically and that may also determine one or more differences between mark-up language documents with regard to their relative rank.","Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. The materials, methods, and examples provided herein are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.","Implementation of the method and system of the present invention involves performing or completing certain selected tasks or steps manually, automatically, or a combination thereof. Moreover, according to actual instrumentation and equipment of preferred embodiments of the method and system of the present invention, several selected steps could be implemented by hardware or by software on any operating system of any firmware or a combination thereof. For example, as hardware, selected steps of the invention could be implemented as a chip or a circuit. As software, selected steps of the invention could be implemented as a plurality of software instructions being executed by a computer using any suitable operating system. In any case, selected steps of the method and system of the invention could be described as being performed by a data processor, such as a computing platform for executing a plurality of instructions.","Although the present invention is described with regard to a \u201ccomputer\u201d on a \u201ccomputer network\u201d, it should be noted that optionally any device featuring a data processor and the ability to execute one or more instructions may be described as a computer, including but not limited to any type of personal computer (PC), a server, a cellular telephone, an IP telephone, a smart phone, a PDA (personal digital assistant), or a pager. Any two or more of such devices in communication with each other may optionally comprise a \u201ccomputer network\u201d.","The present invention is, in at least some embodiments, of a system and method for mark-up language document rank analysis that may be performed automatically and that may also determine one or more differences between mark-up language documents with regard to their relative rank.","Referring now to the drawings,  shows an exemplary, illustrative non-limiting system according to some embodiments of the present invention. As shown, a system  features a plurality of search engines  as non-limiting examples of computer network based indexing programs for indexing mark-up language documents, which are preferably internet based indexing computer programs for indexing such mark-up language documents. Such programs assist users to locate content based upon one or more parameters such as keyword searches for example, typically by using indexes of mark-up language documents such as web pages for example. Typically search engines  return a plurality of mark-up language document results by returning a plurality of links to such documents to a computer of the requestor of the search, such as for example a plurality of URLs. Search engines  are shown in  as returning a plurality of search results  to an analysis subsystem  through a computer network , which may optionally be the internet for example. Analysis subsystem  is typically operated by one computer or a plurality of computers, and\/or through distributed computing, as non-limiting examples.","Analysis subsystem  optionally and preferably receives such search results  in response to a query, which is preferably formatted as for any search engine query (for example, containing one or more keywords). The query is preferably generated and transmitted by a data collector , which also receives search results .","Data collector  also preferably obtains the mark-up language documents associated with search results , for example by downloading such documents from a server. As non-limiting examples, data collector  is shown as being in communication with a plurality of mark-up language document servers  through a computer network , which may optionally also be the Internet and\/or otherwise the same computer network as computer network . Data collector  preferably receives one or more mark-up language documents  according to the search results , for example according to a URL or other address for a particular mark-up language document server , which is supplied with search results . Data collector  may optionally retrieve or \u201cpull\u201d a mark-up language document  or alternatively may have such a mark-up language document  \u201cpushed\u201d or sent to data collector .","Each mark-up language document server  is shown as providing a different type of mark-up language document  (although of course each server  may or may not be limited to a particular type of mark-up language document ), with non-limiting examples including a static mark-up language document A , a dynamic mark-up language document B  or a mark-up language document C . Each mark-up language document server  optionally retrieves each such mark-up language document  from a database  as shown.","Data collector  then preferably passes these results and one or more of the above described mark-up language documents  to a prediction engine , which as shown is also part of analysis subsystem . As described in greater detail below, prediction engine  then analyzes the received search results  and also the corresponding mark-up language documents  with regard to the relative ranking of a plurality of mark-up language documents , and also by comparing one or more features within the plurality of mark-up language documents  according to their relative rank.","Additionally or alternatively, prediction engine  may also optionally compare one or more features of a target mark-up language document  to such one or more features in mark-up language documents , with regard to a relative rank of target mark-up language document  in comparison to mark-up language documents , as determined in search results .","Target mark-up language document  is preferably provided by a target mark-up language document source , which preferably comprises a target mark-up language document server . Target mark-up language document server  is preferably in communication with data collector , preferably through an API (application programming interface) , and also optionally through any computer network  as previously described (alternatively, target mark-up language document server  may optionally be in direct communication with data collector , for example through an internal network and\/or as part of a particular computational hardware installation). Data collector  may optionally \u201cpull\u201d target mark-up language document  from target mark-up language document server  or alternatively may have target mark-up language document  \u201cpushed\u201d by target mark-up language document server .","The comparative analysis of target mark-up language document  with regard to mark-up language documents  is described in greater detail below, but preferably includes determining at least one difference between target mark-up language document  and mark-up language documents  with regard to relative rank. Optionally such a difference could for example explain a relatively lower rank of target mark-up language document  with regard to one or more mark-up language documents .","The results of the analysis may optionally be adjusted according to feedback from a user, which provided through a UI feedback and guidance module .","Analysis subsystem  is optionally in communication with one or more additional external computers or systems, which is preferably performed through one or more APIs (application programming interfaces) . In this exemplary system , API  supports communication between UI feedback and guidance module  and an application layer , which for example may optionally support a user interface (UI, not shown) for communication with UI feedback and guidance module .","Target mark-up language document source  also preferably features a mark-up language document editor , which may either optionally perform one or changes on target mark-up language document  automatically or alternatively (or additionally) according to one or more user inputs, for example through application layer . For example, UI feedback and guidance module  may also optionally provide inputs as to one or more proposed changes to target mark-up language document  to increase the relative rank of target mark-up language document  with regard to the plurality of mark-up language documents  obtained in the search results. Such inputs are preferably provided to application layer , whether for user approval or for automatic implementation by mark-up language document editor .","Alternatively or additionally, the user may perform one or more changes to target mark-up language document , whether through application layer  or directly through mark-up language document editor , after which the changed document is reanalyzed by prediction engine , to see whether the expected relative rank would be higher or lower, as described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},"Stages 3-7 are then performed by the prediction engine. In stage 3, the prediction engine extracts one or more features from the web pages as described in greater detail below. In stage 4, the prediction engine preferably performs supervised training of an analysis algorithm with regard to such features.","Supervised training is a machine learning methodology whereby examples from a known set of classes are fed into a system with the class identifiers. Often the input samples are in the form of an N-dimensional feature vectors. The system is trained with these samples and class identifiers and the resultant model is called a classifier.","Ideally, the classifier should be able to classify the entire training set (now without the given class identifiers) correctly. The entire process of learning from a set of sample feature vectors is called \u201ctraining the classifier\u201d.","Once training is complete, the classifier is then used to classify unlabeled data into classes. This can be done through a variety of methods that typically rely on determining relative similarities between classes (as determined during training) and the new input vectors.","A simple example of supervised training is the ability to distinguish between males and females based on just two features. The first feature is height and the second feature is hair color. Clearly from a priori knowledge, it is known that height is more likely to be a usefully distinguishing feature than is hair color. The process starts by obtaining training samples from a selected and known training set of male and female participants. A feature vector (2-dimensional) is extracted from each of the training samples and plotted in a two-dimensional feature space, with one dimension for each feature. As seen from the example (), the male population tends to be taller (that is, the male and female populations may be more accurately separated by height) and a decision boundary is calculated for the feature of \u201cheight\u201d. While the separation between the two classes is not 100% accurate, it is possible to classify new samples with reasonable accuracy. For greater accuracy, it would be necessary to enhance the classifier by adding new features. In any case, the classifier can be used now to classify unknown samples based on the calculated decision boundary.","The main advantage of supervised training is the construction of the classifier is often more accurate and reliable than for unsupervised training, because the training set had a known set of class identifiers. For the presently described method, it is possible to leverage supervised training methods because the search engines provide the rankings in the Search Engine Result Pages. The supervised training is not limited to training by search engine rankings but may instead optionally include other classification information for training purposes.","In stage 5, the prediction engine optionally performs feature space reduction, to locate one or more features considered to be of particular importance in determining the relative rank of the target after the supervised training. Therefore, subsequent stages may optionally be performed with fewer features. Non-limiting examples of algorithms for feature space reduction include PCA (principle component analysis).","In stage 6, the prediction engine classifies the target web page according to the N dimensional feature space and according to the respective decision boundary for each feature. Optionally one or more features are weighted with regard to its respective decision boundary such that in cases where the classification of the target web page with regard to that feature is not clear, the decision may optionally be weighted toward a particular side of the boundary. In stage 7 the prediction engine then performs feature space expansion in which the engine determines which features have the most effect on altering the rank of the target web page with regard to the other ranked web pages.","Optionally stages 5 and 6 are not performed, for example if the method is not to be performed in real time, in which case the method optionally proceeds from stage 4 directly to stage 6A as described below.","From stage 6 the process may also optionally be performed by the UI feedback and guidance module in stage 6A, which may optionally perform real time reclassification of the target web page according to input through the web page editor. Also from stage 7, the process may also optionally be performed by the UI feedback and guidance module in stage 7A, which may optionally provide guidance to the user (or to an automated web page editor) with regard to whether one or more changes are likely to improve or reduce the rank of the web page with regard to the other analyzed web pages.","In stage 8, optionally such information is provided to the user and\/or through the web; for example, optionally the altered webpage is published to the Internet by being uploaded to a web server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","200","200","202"]},"Both feature extraction module  and supervised training module  preferably communicate with a feature space reduction and classification module . Feature space reduction and classification module  is optionally provided to increase the rapidity of calculations, by reducing the number of features initially considered for classifying the target web page with regard to its relative rank in the search results. Feature space reduction and classification module  also classifies the target web page with regard to the results determined through supervised training from supervised training module  and also according to the features extracted by feature extraction module .","The classification of the target web page according to the reduced features is then passed from prediction engine  to UI feedback and guidance module  through API  as previously described. Within UI feedback and guidance module , a feature space expansion and distance measure module  preferably first expands the feature space again to the full set of features that provide the best discrimination in terms of classification, and the calculates a distance between the target web page and the received web pages from the search engine results.","In addition, feature space expansion and distance measure module  may perform feature space expansion to determine which features have the most effect on altering the rank of the target web page with regard to the other ranked web pages. A heuristics module  may also optionally be used to provide guidance to the above process through one or more heuristically determined rules.","Also, feature space expansion and distance measure module  may determine the distance measure for a target web page that has been altered, to determine the potential effect of such alteration on the relative rank of the target web page within a set of received, ranked web pages (i.e. the search engine results).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","402"]},"The internet spider also obtains mark-up language documents according to the search results as specified by the SERPs (A). Both the search results and the actual mark-up language documents are stored in a storage cache (); the search engine results are then stored in a search engine results module () within a database (), which may optionally correspond to the database of analysis subsystem (); while the mark-up language documents are then stored in a webpage storage () also within database (). Webpage storage () may also optionally include any type of data fetched with the mark-up language document, including but not limited to HTML, CSS, graphics, video and other content\/information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"As shown, a target web page is edited, such that at least one change is made (stage 1). Such editing may optionally be performed manually by a user, automatically by an editing software, or a combination thereof. To assist in performing the editing process, preferably textual guidance for improvements is received (stage 2) and\/or graphical guidance for improvements (stage 3). More preferably, stages 2 and 3 are performed in a feedback cycle with stage 1 at least once, and most preferably a plurality of times, such that textual and\/or graphical guidance from stages 2 and 3 is then input to the editing process of stage 1, for manual and\/or automatic performance.","In stage 4, the suggested changes to the target web page are approved to improve the relative ranking of the target web page. Such approval may optionally be performed for each cycle of stages 1-3 or may optionally be performed once after all cycle or cycles of stages 1-3 have been performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","702","702"]},"Locality related server  preferably features a lexicon generator service  and a crawler service . Lexicon generator service  provides a lexicon for the specific locality, which as described above is a combination of language and cultural factors. Lexicon generator service  preferably constructs the lexicon. For the purpose of discussion only and without any intention of being limiting, it is assumed that lexicon generator service  generates the lexicon at least partially based upon search engine ranking results. By \u201ctopic modeling\u201d it is meant any type of statistically based analysis of language related to a particular subject area or topic. The subject area may optionally be defined narrowly or broadly, but to the extent that the subject area or topic is defined more specifically, it is expected that the resultant model would capture more features of the language and\/or capture them more precisely.","Without wishing to be limited in any way, optionally lexicon generator service  generates the lexicon by first obtaining a word count of each word in a collection of related documents; in this non-limiting example, the search engine ranking results serve to determine the extent to which the documents are related (and also which documents are related), such that the training process is supervised training. Optionally and preferably, every word appearing at least once in any document has a database entry and the number of times the word appears is also recorded.","Once the collection of words has been established, preferably any stop words are eliminated. Stop words are those words appearing frequently in all documents, regardless of topic (\u201cand\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cis\u201d, and so forth). The determination of which words are \u201cstop words\u201d is typically language dependent; for example, the stop words may optionally be taken from a list of known stop words in a particular language. Alternatively or additionally, a list of stop words may optionally be determined from the collection of documents itself, for example by determining which words appear with a statistical frequency that is greater than a threshold. Optionally phrases comprising such stop words (\u201cfor sale\u201d) are not eliminated if the phrase itself is determined to be important.","After stop words are removed, the most frequently appearing terms for this specific topic, preferably which do not appear frequently for other topics, form the lexicon for the topic. For example, optionally a scoring system may be used to determine which words appear in the lexicon, and optionally and preferably also determines the ordering of the words in the lexicon.","Such a scoring system may optionally comprise determining the number of documents in which the lexicon term appears for the topic under consideration (\u201cNumDocs\u201d) and multiplying by the average number of occurrences of this term per document (again, within the context of this topic; \u201cAvgOccur\u201d). However, such a simple calculation could enable a frequently occurring (but otherwise irrelevant) word to be selected. To help prevent such an artifact, preferably the highest ranking document in which the term occurs is determined (HighRank) and the score is adjusted accordingly: Score=(NumDocs*AvgOcur)\/HighRank.","The division by the HighRank ensures that the rank or relevancy of the document is also considered, thereby preventing a non-relevant word that appears more frequently in low ranking documents from being selected.","Lexicon generator service  preferably receives web pages and also search engine ranking results from crawler service  in order to analyze the search engine results as described above. Crawler service  optionally operates similarly to data collector , in that crawler service  at least requests and receives search engine ranking results; crawler service  may also optionally retrieve one or more mark-up language documents according to the search engine ranking results.","Lexicon generator service  then generates the lexicon according to these search engine results and also according to a topic model generated by a training engine . Training engine  optionally and preferably models a topic or subject area based upon an analysis of the language used, particularly with regard to the words selected, word frequency and also optionally with regard to word constructs (for example, having a plurality of words featured in the same sentence, same paragraph etc). Other types of language may also optionally be performed as previously described. The language analysis also preferably relates to the effect of such language on search engine ranking results as previously described. Training engine  may therefore optionally have a crawler service (not shown) or alternatively may optionally use crawler service .","Once the lexicon has been generated by lexicon generator service , a suggestion server  uses the lexicon to provide one or more language adjustment suggestions to a document as previously described, for example through a client (not shown). The lexicon may optionally be saved locally at a lexicon database ; alternatively, suggestion server  may communicate with lexicon generator service  for each suggestion. Suggestion server  optionally and preferably communicates with lexicon generator service  to determine the efficacy of suggestions provided, such that lexicon generator service  optionally determines the actual search engine ranking of a mark-up language document that has been adjusted according to one or more suggestions from suggestion server . Training engine  preferably operates at least once to provide the topic model for lexicon generator service , but may also optionally be invoked again, one or more times, to adjust the topic model, by a watchdog  according to at least some embodiments of the present invention. Watchdog  preferably samples at least a portion of search engine results, such that for example, such an adjustment may be invoked according to a comparison of the actual and predicted search engine rankings; if the predicted rankings are too distant from the actual rankings, then watchdog  may optionally activate training engine . The actual and predicted search engine rankings are optionally compared by watchdog . If the predicted values are too far off from some specified tolerance, then the topic model is preferably reviewed and if necessary adjusted, more preferably through invoking the training engine  as noted previously.","By \u201cdistant\u201d it is meant that the numerical difference between the predicted and actual search engine rankings is greater than a threshold level.","Once watchdog  has activated training engine , the above process for generating the topic model is preferably repeated, after which lexicon generator service  receives the new model and generates a new lexicon based upon this model.","As shown with regard to a system  of , suggestion server  preferably makes suggestions for changing one or more words of a document according to the generated lexicon through a session manager . Session manager  in turn is in communication with one or more document generation and\/or editing software, directly or indirectly. Session manager  preferably provides suggestions to such software and also receives feedback in terms of the changes made to suggestion server . Data may optionally be buffered through a database .","As non-limiting examples, two types of such software are shown: an agent  (of which three are shown for the purpose of illustration and without any intention of being limiting) and an authoring system  (of which two are shown for the purpose of illustration and without any intention of being limiting). Agent  optionally operates with any type of document generation and\/or editing software as an \u201cadd on\u201d to such software as previously described. Session manager  may also optionally communicate directly with authoring system , such that the suggestions are provided through authoring system  in an integrated manner that is optionally and preferably transparent to the end user.","If a keyword is not known to suggestion server , then optionally a request is sent from suggestion server  to a request dispatcher . Request dispatcher  then preferably communicates with locality related server  to analyze the unknown keyword. If the keyword is not part of the lexicon generated by lexicon generator , then optionally and preferably crawler  is invoked to determine a ranking based upon this keyword, after which search engine rankings and optionally any synonyms are to suggestion server . Optionally another request dispatcher  handles requests made by training engine  as previously described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["712","800","800","712","712","806","804","802","804","900","902","904","900","804"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["708","708","706","708","1100","1002","1002","1004","1006","712","712"]},"Also as shown, training engine  optionally features watchdog , which may also be implemented separately (not shown).
