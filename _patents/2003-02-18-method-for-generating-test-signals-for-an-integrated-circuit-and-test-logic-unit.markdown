{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","Field of the Invention","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates to a method for generating test signals for an integrated circuit, and to a test logic unit for such an integrated circuit in order to check specific parameters and functions of the integrated circuit.","It is known for a test logic unit for complex integrated circuits (ICs) such as memory circuits, for example, Dynamic Random Access Memories to be integrated directly on the semiconductor wafer with the integrated circuit, in particular, in the sawing frame region (kerf) between two semiconductor chips. The test logic unit is used to generate test patterns in the form of addresses and\/or data to carry out the test cycles in the integrated circuit for the parameter and function test.","In the case of such built-in self tests, use is frequently made of an algorithmic function generator, a so-called algorithmic pattern generator (ALPG), which generally has a system of programmed counters that can use a prescribed algorithm to generate test signals for addresses and\/or data.","In the case of the prior art test logic units for integrated circuits there is, in particular, the problem that specific test signals must be generated with a rate that corresponds at least to the maximum data transmission rate of the integrated circuit to be tested, in order to be able to carry out a realistic parameter or function test. In the case of complex test logic units with a multiplicity of programmed counters, however, because of the signal propagation times in the test logic unit, the test signal rate required for testing the integrated circuit can often be achieved only with difficulty or not at all. To reach higher test signal rates, the design of the test logic unit is, therefore, increasingly being optimized to the effect of shortening the signal propagation times in the test logic unit. However, this sets physical limits to the optimization.","It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a method for generating test signals for an integrated circuit, and a test logic unit that overcome the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that is disposed on the semiconductor wafer with the integrated circuit, both of which aiding in the production of high test signal rates in a simple way.","With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for generating test signals with a test logic unit on a semiconductor chip to check at least one of specific functions and parameters of an integrated circuit on the semiconductor chip with the test signals, including the steps of providing at least two test signals substantially simultaneously with the test logic unit and subsequently serializing the at least two test signals to generate a multiplexed test signal sequence with a data rate required for testing.","With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a method for checking at least one of specific functions and parameters of an integrated circuit on a semiconductor chip with test signals, including the steps of generating at least two test signals with a test logic unit on the semiconductor chip, providing the at least two test signals substantially simultaneously with the test logic unit and subsequently serializing the at least two test signals to generate a multiplexed test signal sequence with a data rate required for testing, and checking the at least one of specific functions and parameters of the integrated circuit with the at least two test signals.","With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a method for generating test signals with a test logic unit on a semiconductor chip to check at least one of specific functions and parameters of an integrated circuit with the test signals, including the steps of providing an integrated circuit on the semiconductor chip, providing at least two test signals substantially simultaneously with the test logic unit, and subsequently serializing the at least two test signals to generate a multiplexed test signal sequence with a data rate required for testing.","In accordance with the invention, test signals are generated by a test logic unit on the semiconductor wafer to use the test signals to test specific functions and\/or parameters of an integrated circuit on the semiconductor wafer, at least two test signals being provided substantially simultaneously by the test logic unit and subsequently serialized by a multiplexer to generate a multiplexed data sequence with a data rate required for testing the integrated circuit. The parallel provision of the two test signals is performed in such a case through two parallel-connected algorithmic function generators that in each case apply their generated test signals to an input of a multiplexer.","It is possible by the invention to increase the test signal generation rate in a simple way because, due to the multiplexing operation, it is possible for test signal sequences with a low data rate to be combined to form a test signal sequence with a substantially higher data rate. It is also particularly advantageous in this case that, to generate the parallel input test signals, it is possible to use algorithmic function generators that are identical in substantial parts and, therefore, all have substantially the same layout, a characteristic that substantially simplifies the outlay on production.","The test signals are, preferably, combined with the aid of a fast multiplexer that substantially has a row of switching transistors, with which individual input signals can be connected or disconnected in a simple manner. It is possible by sequentially switching over the multiplexer to convert the input test signals generated in parallel into serial test signals that can have very high data rates in accordance with the switchover rate of the multiplexer.","It is considered as a particularly advantageous solution that, in the case of a built-in self test, a plurality of test signal sequences with a relatively low data rate, which are generated substantially simultaneously, are combined to form a few test signals with a correspondingly high data rate. The data rate can be raised very easily with the aid of such a method.","In accordance with another mode of the invention, two test signal sequences generated substantially simultaneously are multiplexed with one data rate to form a test signal sequence with a doubled data rate.","In accordance with a further mode of the invention, two test signal sequences are substantially simultaneously generated and the two test signal sequences are multiplexed with one data rate to form a test signal sequence with a doubled data rate.","In accordance with an added mode of the invention, the two test signal sequences are substantially simultaneously generated from the at least two test signals and the two test signal sequences are multiplexed with one data rate to form a test signal sequence with a doubled data rate.","In accordance with an additional mode of the invention, there is provided the step of serializing the two test signal sequences generated by the test logic unit taking account of a data rate of the two test signal sequences.","In accordance with yet another mode of the invention, there is provided the step of multiplexing only test signal sequences with a relatively higher data rate.","In accordance with yet a further mode of the invention, there are provided the steps of serializing the two test signal sequences generated by the test logic unit dependent upon a data rate of the two test signal sequences and only multiplexing a test signal sequence of the two test signal sequences having a relatively higher data rate than another test signal sequence.","With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a test logic unit for generating test signals on a semiconductor chip used to check at least one of specific functions and parameters of an integrated circuit on the semiconductor chip, including a multiplexer, at least two algorithmic function generators connected in parallel and connected to the multiplexer, the at least two algorithmic function generators generating test signals including at least two substantially simultaneously generated test signals, and the multiplexer serializing the at least two test signals and outputting a multiplexed test signal sequence with a given testing data rate.","With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a test logic unit for generating test signals on a semiconductor chip used to check at least one of specific functions and parameters of an integrated circuit on the semiconductor chip, including a multiplexer, at least two algorithmic function generators connected in parallel, each of the at least two algorithmic function generators being connected to the multiplexer and generating test signals including at least two substantially simultaneously generated test signals, and the multiplexer serializing the at least two test signals and outputting a multiplexed test signal sequence with a given testing data rate.","If, for example, two algorithmic function generators are integrated in the test logic unit and connected to a dual multiplexer, it is, then, already possible to double the data rate given an appropriately configured interconnection. Such a procedure constitutes a very simple solution that can already be sufficient in many instances.","However, if further increases in the rate of generation of test signals are required, this can advantageously be achieved by configuring the multiplexer with an algorithmic operation. For example, two inverters can be connected upstream of the multiplexer such that the two test signals generated by the algorithmic function generators can be mirrored, and, then, four test signals reach the multiplexer. The data rate is doubled again thereby such that it is raised overall virtually by a factor of four.","A favorable solution is also to be seen in that the algorithmic function generators use counters to generate the individual bits. Arbitrary data and addresses can be generated easily with the aid of counters because they are easy to control.","In accordance with yet an added feature of the invention, the at least two test signals travel to the multiplexer in a signal flow direction and two inverters are connected upstream of the multiplexer with respect to the signal flow direction, the two inverters carrying out an algorithmic operation of the test signals generated by the at least two algorithmic function generators.","In accordance with yet an additional feature of the invention, there are provided two inverters are between the at least two algorithmic function generators and the multiplexer, the two inverters carrying out an algorithmic operation of the test signals generated by the at least two algorithmic function generators.","In accordance with again another feature of the invention, each of the at least two algorithmic function generators have a plurality of counters for generating individual bit signal sequences and a number of the counters in a respective one of the at least two algorithmic function generators and the parallel connection of the at least two algorithmic function generators through the multiplexer being executed in accordance with test stimuli to be generated.","In accordance with a concomitant feature of the invention, each of the at least two algorithmic function generators have a plurality of counters for generating individual bit signal sequences and a number of the counters in a respective one of the at least two algorithmic function generators and the parallel connection of the at least two algorithmic function generators through the multiplexer being dependent upon a given test stimuli to be generated.","A particular advantage is also to be seen in that the test signals are fed to the multiplexer taking account of their data rate. Thus, in particular, signals with a higher data rate can be multiplexed, while those with a lower data rate need not be fed to the multiplexer. In particular, it is possible in such a case by an appropriately intelligent concept to save on counters or else on algorithmic function generators because not all counters require an equally high generation rate.","It is also regarded as particularly advantageous that the number of the counters is adapted to the test stimuli to be generated. There is, therefore, no need for an algorithmic function generator to be completely duplicated. Rather, it suffices to multiply only as many counters as are required from the point of view of the data rate because the generation of higher bits can proceed much more slowly. The outlay is, thereby, reduced very substantially.","Other features that are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.","Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a method for generating test signals for an integrated circuit, and a test logic unit, it is, nevertheless, not intended to be limited to the details shown because various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.","The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","In order to understand the invention better, the first step is to explain somewhat more generally how the test signals are generated for the test stimuli. The test logic unit is known per se. It is disposed at suitable locations on the semiconductor wafer with the integrated circuit, for example, a dynamic memory such as a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). It can also be provided in an alternative design, for example, to disposed the test logic unit on the wafer in the sawing frame region (kerf) between two semiconductor chips.","When a memory chip is being tested, it is necessary to generate test signals, for example, addresses or data, with the aid of which the individual memory cells are tested at least with the data rate or clock frequency permissible for the memory chip. Such a method is also referred to as a built-in self test (BIST). For example, the addresses must be enumerated in the case of such a test 0, 1, 2, 3. The first address is, then, generated in the first cycle (clock pulse), the second address in the second cycle, the third address in the third cycle etc.","To generate the test signals, according to the invention the test logic unit has at least two algorithmic function generators, as will be explained in more detail later. The algorithmic function generators generally include, inter alia, counters that are, however, relatively slow and cannot reach the data rate at which a memory chip operates. The counters have, for example, different logic circuits for incrementing or decrementing. As a result, their signal propagation times are relatively long and the low generation rate, therefore, results.","To solve such a problem, reference is now made to the figures of the drawings in detail and first, particularly to  thereof, which shows a first embodiment of the invention with the aid of which a high test signal rate can be generated.","Illustrated in  is a test logic unit  in a simplified schematic embodiment with two algorithmic function generators (ALPG, , Algorithmic Pattern Generator) , , whose outputs are led to two corresponding inputs of a, preferably, fast multiplexer .","The algorithmic function generators ,  substantially have a system of counters with the aid of which the test signals can be generated. Algorithmic function generators ,  are used, for example, in special, commercially available test systems and are, therefore, known per se. Not yet known, however, is the integration of a plurality of, preferably, substantially identical algorithmic function generators ,  in a test logic unit on a semiconductor wafer in order to increase the rate of generation of test signals.","It is proposed according to the invention to multiply the algorithmic function generators ,  by simply copying the layout. As is further shown later with the aid of , it also suffices to multiply only individual parts of the algorithmic function generator , for example, one or more counters  (FIG. ), in order to multiply only those test signals that are used with a high data transmission rate during the test operation.","As may further be gathered from , the output of the multiplexer  is connected to a memory unit , to be tested, of the semiconductor chip, which is illustrated symbolically in the right hand part of FIG. . The memory unit  to be tested is, usually, also denoted as core under test.","The mode of operation of the configuration is explained in more detail below. The two algorithmic function generators ,  generate the test signals substantially simultaneously with a relatively low data rate and pass their test signals to the inputs of the multiplexer . The multiplexer  has a fast switch and, therefore, switches the test signals alternately to its output. Consequently, twice as high a data rate (2*f) arises at the output of the multiplexer  as at the output of the two algorithmic function generators ,  that operate with a single data rate f. For reasons of clarity, only one core test signal is considered in , but in practice, of course, an appropriate number of core test signals are to be taken into account.","An alternative solution to the generation of a higher test signal rate is illustrated in , which is regarded as particularly interesting. In a way similar to , two algorithmic function generators ,  are, likewise, connected here in the test logic unit  to a multiplexer . However, in this case, the multiplexer  is equipped with an algorithmic operation. The algorithmic function is simulated here by two inverters  that are connected upstream in each case of an input of the multiplexer . Consequently, in addition to two further inputs of the multiplexer , which receive the test signals of the two algorithmic function generators , , the test signals, that is to say, the generated addresses or data, are mirrored and, so, a total of four input signals are present in parallel at the multiplexer . These four parallel input signals are switched over sequentially by non-illustrated switches of the multiplexer  so that, now, the test signals are present serially at the output of the multiplexer  and can be switched to the memory unit  to be tested. This simple method, therefore, yields a four-fold data rate (4*f). Such a multiplexer is illustrated in  as an \u201cintelligent\u201d multiplexer . With such a configuration, success is achieved in raising the frequency fby four times the value to 4*for to four times the data rate. The intelligent multiplexer , thus, runs with the desired final frequency for the test operation.","The generation of the test signals (test stimuli) is explained in more detail with the aid of  to  using the example of the generation of addresses with the aid of algorithmic function generators (,). The illustrations are reduced in a very simplified way to preserve clarity. In particular, it is shown that it is often not necessary for all the bits to be switched on the signal bus with the highest possible data rate in order to change the test signals, that is to say, addresses or data. In the example, it is assumed that the last three Least Significant Bits (LSBs) are to be generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00050","num":"00050"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 5"],"b":["20","1","2","1","2","0","1","2","0","4","000","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","2","1","1","0","3","0","0","1","4","0","1","2","20"]},"The second table in  shows the counters  with which the individual bits are generated. In cycle , the counters  of the algorithmic function generator  (again from right to left) , , and  firstly generate the three bits ,, of table 1. In cycle , the counters \u2032, \u2032 and  of the two algorithmic function generators ,  correspondingly participate. In cycle , the counters , , and  participate, in cycle  the counters \u2032, \u2032, and , and in cycle  the counters , , and .","As may further be gathered from the two tables of , only the counter  generates the A bit, and a change also takes place only in cycle . This counter can, therefore, run with the lowest clock rate. The highest clock rate is required, by contrast, in the case of the A bit.","It is, therefore, proposed according to the invention, preferably, to multiplex only the fastest signals and to generate the slow signals normally with the aid of the counters. In the example, only the bit A would need to be multiplexed. The result, inter alia, is to achieve a simple adaptation of the rate of generation to the speed of the integrated circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00054","num":"00054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["1","2","1","0","1","2","2","2","0","1","1","2","20"]}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
