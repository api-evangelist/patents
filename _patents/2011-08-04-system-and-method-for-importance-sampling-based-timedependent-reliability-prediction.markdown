The decorrelation length generally determined such that large enough so that the correlation between X=X(t) and X=X(t) is relatively small. However, the variance of the likelihood ratio (discussed below in connection with step or block ) generally increases with increasing decorrelation length, resulting in an undesirable increase in the variance of the estimated failure rate. Thus, a value of d is generally determined based on the tradeoff between accuracy of the importance sampling method and computational efficiency.","For a stationary process, the autocorrelation function generally decays rapidly, either exponentially or by overshooting into the negative region before settling down. When the autocorrelation function decay is exponential, all of the feedback parameters are generally positive, the number of feedback parameters may be sufficient to estimate the shape of the autocorrelation function. Therefore, a decorrelation length d=p which is equal to the order of the AR(p) model may be implemented because the partial autocorrelation function generally becomes insignificant after p lags.","When the autocorrelation function overshoots the zero axis, the oscillations with increasing lag generally indicate that there is at least one negative feedback parameter. Depending upon which feedback parameter is negative, the shape of the autocorrelation function can vary (change). As such, the shape of autocorrelation function is generally not determined based only on the order of the AR(p) model.","In the case illustrated on , a decorrelation length, d, which is at least equal to the number of lags from zero to the point the autocorrelation function (ACF) reaches the minimum value.
