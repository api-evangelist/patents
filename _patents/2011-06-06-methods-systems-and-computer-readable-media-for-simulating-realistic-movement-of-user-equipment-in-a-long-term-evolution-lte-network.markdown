No. 61\/351,849, filed Jun. 4, 2010; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The subject matter described herein relates to user equipment simulation in an LTE network. More specifically, the subject matter relates to methods, systems, and computer readable media for simulating realistic movement of user equipment in an LTE network.","As the number of users connected to mobile networks increases, so too does the need to ensure reliable and efficient operation of mobile network equipment. Therefore, mobile network operators typically simulate various network conditions before equipment is deployed in a live network. Simulated network conditions may include, for example, generating traffic mix simulation for real-live scenarios such as: registering\/de-registering and handover for a mix of voice, video, data traffic. Currently supported test types include: stress testing, function testing, protocol stack testing, negative testing, and handover testing. Stress testing may include pushing eNode B and other LTE elements to capacity and overload conditions. Function testing may include verifying LTE elements deliver desired features and functionality. Full protocol stack testing in LTE networks may include analyzing all LTE protocol layers, not just upper levels. Negative testing may include verifying system response when the system is experiencing error conditions. Handover testing may include verifying that a system properly handles inter\/intra eNode B and inter-radio access technology (IRAT) handovers. Specifically, conventional LTE mobile equipment simulation and testing may include verifying: eNode B network element and interfaces (S, X, Uu), user and control plane latency, mobility (e.g., handovers, security), radio resource management, negative testing, interoperability with global system for mobile communications (GSM), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), code division Multiple Access (CDMA)  (CDMA), worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), and\/or Internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS), handover scenarios, service and support, real time physical layer (PHY), media access control layer (MAC), and\/or radio link control layer (RLC) alarms and error notification, logging and post-analysis per UE.","However, current LTE mobile equipment simulation and testing methods are not capable of realistically simulating the movement of UEs through the network, both physically and logically. For example, in a real-world scenario, a UE may travel a physical path through a network. The physical path may correspond to a logical path through the network topology, such as movement from one sector to another sector within a cell, or a series of handovers from one cell to another cell. Yet the path traveled by the UE may include various problem areas, such as tunnels, buildings, trees, or cell boundaries, where poor signal quality may be expected. If the realistic movement of UEs, including potential movement through problem areas, is not accurately simulated, then mobile network operators may deploy network elements suboptimally. The result may include adjusting logical network topology (e.g., adding more eNBs) or adjusting the physical location of network nodes (e.g., moving two eNBs closer together) after network elements have been deployed and are in use by network customers. This may be costly for network operators and result in dissatisfied customers.","Accordingly, in light of these difficulties, a need exists for improved methods, systems, and computer readable media for simulating realistic movement of user equipment in an LTE network.","Methods, systems, and computer readable media for simulating realistic movement of user equipment in an LTE network are disclosed. According to one method, a logical topology of a long term evolution (LTE) access network is defined that includes defining connections between one or more eNodeBs (eNBs). A physical topology of the LTE access network is defined. The defining of the physical topology includes defining locations of the eNBs and sectors, where the physical network topology is mapped to the logical network topology. One or more problem areas are defined within the physical network topology, where the one or more problem areas include locations where signal quality is degraded. One or more paths are defined through the physical network topology. A traffic profile for a user equipment (UE) device is defined. A plurality of messages is generated for simulating the movement of a UE device along a path through the physical network topology.","A system for simulating realistic movement of user equipment in an LTE network is also disclosed. The system includes an input module for receiving a logical topology of a long term evolution (LTE) access network that includes defining connections between one or more eNodeBs (eNBs). The input module also receives a physical topology of the LTE access network that includes defining locations of the eNBs and sectors, wherein the physical network topology is mapped to the logical network topology. The input module also receives one or more problem areas within the physical network topology, wherein the one or more problem areas include locations where signal quality is degraded. The input module also receives one or more paths through the physical network topology and a traffic profile for a user equipment (UE) device. A realistic UE simulator generates a plurality of messages for simulating the movement of a UE device along a path through the physical network topology.","The subject matter described herein for simulating realistic movement of user equipment in an LTE network may be implemented using a non-transitory computer readable medium to having stored thereon executable instructions that when executed by the processor of a computer control the computer to perform steps. Exemplary computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein include non-transitory computer readable media, such as chip memory devices or disk memory devices accessible by a processor, programmable logic devices, and application specific integrated circuits. In addition, a computer readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be located on a single computing platform or may be distributed across plural computing platforms.","As used herein, the term \u201cmobile communications network\u201d refers to a system of nodes (i.e., computing platforms) that support wireless (with network interfaces) communications between user terminals. Exemplary types of mobile communications networks may include 2G networks (e.g., GSM), 3G networks (e.g., UMTS), and 4G+ networks (e.g., LTE networks). Examples of nodes in such networks include radio network controllers (RNCs) and Enhanced Node Bs (eNodeBs).","As used herein, the term \u201cuser equipment\u201d (UE) refers to a mobile communications terminal operated by a user in a mobile communications network. For example, in LTE networks, the UE communicates directly with the eNodeB over an air (i.e., Uu) interface. Exemplary types of UEs include mobile phones and computers with wireless communications capabilities.","As used herein, the term \u201cradio equipment\u201d (RE) refers to a device that serves as the air interface to user equipment and implements analog radio frequency functions. RE may include one or more antennas for communicating with one or more UEs, and may include support for a variety of antenna types and configurations including, but not limited to, single omni-directional antennas and MIMO arrays of directional antennas. Exemplary functions that may be performed by an RE include digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion, carrier multiplexing, power amplification, and RF filtering.","As used herein, the term \u201cradio equipment controller\u201d (REC) refers to a device in wireless communications network for implementing radio functions of the digital baseband domain. These functions may include, but are not limited to, radio base station control and management, and channel coding and de-coding.","As used herein, the term \u201ccell\u201d refers to a geographical service area served by a mobile network device (e.g., BS\/NodeB\/eNodeB) in a mobile communications network. A cell may be divided into one or more sectors.","As used herein, the term \u201csector\u201d refers to a geographical service area (e.g. wedge-shaped) expanding from the mobile network device (e.g., BS\/NodeB\/eNB) antenna, where sectors are defined by the service areas of directional antennas (e.g., MIMO, beam forming). A mobile network device supporting multiple sectors may support a full channel bandwidth for each sector. Typical configurations include 1, 3, and 6 sectors per cell.","As used herein, the term \u201cmultiple input multiple output\u201d (MIMO) refers to the use of multiple antennas for transmission and reception of a single data stream in order to improve data throughput. Using multiple, spatially separated antennas at the mobile network equipment and at the UE, each transmitting\/receiving antenna pair provides a path between the UE and the mobile network equipment. Signal analysis can separate each path from the paths formed by other pairs by exploiting imperfections in the channel such as multi-path, delay and phase differences, etc., even though different pairs may use the same frequency. Typical MIMO configurations include 2\u00d72 and 4\u00d74 MIMO corresponding to 2 transmitting\/2 receiving antennas and 4 transmitting\/4 receiving antennas, respectively.","As used herein, the terms \u201cbase transceiver station\u201d (BTS) and \u201cbase station\u201d (BS) refer to an entity in a 2G network for communicating with one or more UEs located within its coverage area (e.g., sector, cell) via an air interface. A BS may be associated with one or more antennas for subdividing a cell into one or more sectors, depending on configuration. In cells containing multiple sectors, each sector may be served by an antenna that concentrates the flow of power to that sector. Typical configurations include 3-sector cells, wherein each sector is served by a separate directional antenna. In cells that are not divided into sectors, each cell may be served by a unidirectional antenna that radiates a signal in all directions equally.","As used herein, the term \u201cbase station controller\u201d (BSC) refers to a device in a 2G network which controls one or more BTSs. Exemplary functions performed by a BSC may include, but are not limited to, radio channel allocation and controlling inter-BTS handovers. Thus, a BSC may serve to concentrate several low capacity\/low utilization connections from a plurality of BTSs into fewer connections of higher utilization to other network devices such as mobile switching centers (MSCs).","As used herein, the term \u201cNodeB\u201d refers to a device in a 3G network that performs functions similar to a BTS. A NodeB contains radio frequency transmitter(s) and the receiver(s) for communicating directly with UEs. The area covered by a NodeB (i.e., a cell) may be divided into one or more sectors, depending on the configuration and type of antenna. Common configurations include a single omni-directional antenna-based cell) (360\u00b0, a 3 sector cell) (3\u00d7120\u00b0, and a 6 sector cell (3 sectors 120\u00b0 wide overlapping with 3 sectors of different frequency).","As used herein, the term \u201cradio network controller\u201d (RNC) refers to a device in a 3G network controlling one or more NodeBs. Exemplary functions performed by an RNC may include, but are not limited to, radio resource management, mobility management, and encryption.","As used herein, the term \u201clong term evolution\u201d (LTE) refers to a mobile communications network architecture developed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) to improve UMTS mobile phone standards. An LTE network may include an evolved packet system (EPS), an evolved UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN)(E-UTRAN), and an evolved packet core (EPC). LTE architecture may be streamlined to optimize network performance, maximize data throughput, and minimize latency as compared to 2G and 3G networks. Rather than four nodes (Node B, RNC, serving general packet radio service (GPRS) support node (SGSN), gateway GPRS support node (GGSN), LTE networks have a simpler configuration including just the eNodeB and the Access Gateway (aGW), where the aGW includes one logical user plane entity (i.e., SAE GW) and one control plane entity (i.e., MME).","As used herein, the term \u201ccommon public radio interface\u201d (CPRI) refers to a standard for describing a wired communications interface between the REC and the RE components of a networking component, such as a wireless base station. CPRI may be used to divide networking components that utilize a variety of access technologies including LTE, GSM, GPRS, enhanced data for GSM evolution (EDGE), UMTS (including releases R, R, R, high speed packet access (HSPA), and HSPA+evolutionary steps), CDMA, CDMA2000, and WiMAX. CPRI is an industry cooperation aimed at defining the internal interface between two basic building blocks, the so-called radio equipment control (REC) and the radio equipment (RE) itself. CPRI enables flexible and efficient product differentiation for radio base stations and independent technology evolution by dividing networking components (i.e., wireless base stations) into two parts (i.e., the RE and the REC) with a digital connection between the two elements. Data transmitted over a CPRI link consists of digitized samples of the analog baseband signal, plus a low bandwidth control channel. Data carried over the CPRI link is a continuous stream of numbers, representing the digitized samples of the baseband waveform. A CPRI connection can support several \u201cantennas,\u201d each \u201cantenna\u201d representing a sector or a MIMO antenna. CPRI does not limit the data rate of connections, but may limit the number of antennas that may be carried on a single CPRI connection.","As used herein, the terms \u201cevolved Node B,\u201d \u201cenhanced Node B,\u201d \u201ceNodeB,\u201d and \u201ceNB\u201d refer to an LTE mobile, network entity having functionality similar to that of a radio network controller (RNC) and a base station (BS) in 2G networks or an RNC and a Node B in 3G mobile networks. The eNB communicates directly with LTE UEs and is responsible for header compression, ciphering, reliable delivery of packets, admission control, and radio resource management. By eliminating the RNC from the data path and incorporating its functions into the eNB, packet delay may be decreased and network performance may be increased. As described above, CPRI provides for dividing the eNB into two parts, a radio equipment controller (REC) component and one or more radio equipment (RE) components, where multiple REs may be associated with a single REC being connected together using a wired CPRI link. As used herein, the terms RE and REC will primarily refer to components of an eNB, however it is appreciated that they may also refer to components of other (i.e., non-LTE) networking components. One or more REs and a corresponding REC may either be physically separated or co-located. For example, an RE may be located close to an antenna, while the REC may be located in a more convenient and\/or accessible site.","As used herein, the term \u201cUu\u201d or \u201cair\u201d interface refers to an interface between the UE and mobile network equipment (e.g., the eNB\/NodeB\/BS) wherein air is the physical transmission medium. For mobile network devices utilizing CPRI, the air interface may more precisely refer to the interface between a UE and an RE.","As used herein, the term \u201cmobile management entity\u201d (MME) refers to a mobile network node that manages non access stratum (NAS)\/control plane signaling functions such as network attach, UE authentication, bearer channel setup, and mobility management. For example, an MME may generate temporary identities, allocate the identities to UEs, and authenticate the UE.","As used herein, the term \u201csystem architecture evolution\u201d (SAE) gateway (GW) refers to a core network data plane node that manages the data plane, routes, and forwards data packets, and stores and manages user context. Packet routing functions performed by the SAE gateway may include packet screening, IP header compression, ciphering, integrity protection, policy enforcement, and lawful intercept.","The subject matter described herein discloses methods, systems, and computer readable media for providing user equipment device traffic simulation including realistic movement of user equipment devices in an LTE network. By allowing network operators to model numerous UEs moving realistically through a network coverage area, realistic traffic profiles may be generated. Using these realistic traffic profiles, more accurate testing of LTE network equipment may be performed and LTE network topologies may be optimized by adjusting the physical and\/or logical locations of network devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A"],"b":"100"},"In step , a physical topology of the LTE access network may be defined, where defining the physical topology includes defining locations of the eNBs and sectors, wherein the physical network topology is mapped to the logical network topology. In contrast to the logical topology defined above in step , the physical topology defines the physical structure of the network (e.g., how devices are connected to the network through the actual cables that transmit data). Moreover, the physical topology may be different from the logical topology. For example, the logical star topology provided in step  may include a central hub node located in Los Angeles, Calif., while a second node corresponding to a point on the star may be located in San Francisco, Calif., and the remaining nodes may be located in New York, N.Y. In this case, the physical topology (e.g., as viewed from space) would not resemble its logical topology (i.e., a star). However, the physical and logical topologies may be mapped to one another in a one-to-one correlation by mapping each logical node and each physical node.","In step , one or more problem areas within the physical network topology may be defined, where the one or more problem areas include locations where signal quality is degraded. For example, tunnels, underground parking, buildings, trees, cell boundaries, or any area where poor signal quality may be expected may be geographically defined by a user. This may include drawing an area on a map corresponding to the problem area or could be generated automatically based on coordinate, signal strength, and other data.","In step , one or more paths through the physical network topology may be defined. For example, a first and second user may each routinely connect to the same two cell towers on weekdays (e.g., towers A and B), yet the paths they traverse may be unique. The first user may live near tower A and work near tower B and may travel along a major road connecting the two locations. The second user, on the other hand, may walk to work using several secondary roads between the two locations which include a variety of problem areas. As a result, even though both users may logically be viewed as moving back-and-forth between cell tower A and cell tower B, they may travel very different paths though the physical network topology and this may impact each user's network experience differently.","In step , a traffic profile for a user equipment (UE) device may be defined. The traffic profile may define a number of UEs to be simulated, designate which UEs travel a particular path, define the speed of travel on each path, or define a traffic pattern such as a mixture of data and voice calls. In addition, the traffic profile can define any of the variables mentioned above as changing over time. In another embodiment, the traffic profile may define a minimum, maximum, or average value for any of the variable mentioned above.","When the defined traffic profile is executed, an algorithm may alter the reported channel quality indicator (CQI) values for each UE based on distance from eNBs and proximity to any problem areas. The output of the simulation based on the traffic profile may include a variety of statistics to aid in determining how close to achieving any performance objectives the simulated network topology performed. Statistics may be visually displayed using a graphical user interface (GUI). For example, when the user mouses over a particular cell, a pop up box may display the cell ID or other relevant information. Additionally, the pop up box may allow the user to input the cell ID or other information. The user may also double-click on a particular path and view a list of all UEs associated with that path and details of their traffic profiles such as average, minimum, or maximum travel speed. Other metrics indicating how well a UE is being serviced may be provided as output may include the achieved download and upload traffic rates, error statistics such as the number of dropped frames, dropped calls, handover failures, and the like.","In one embodiment, the values in the rrcMeasurementReports which are sent between eNBs may be altered in order to invoke handovers between sectors and\/or between eNBs.","In step , a plurality of messages may be generated for simulating the movement of a UE device along a path through the physical network topology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","202","204","206","208","210","212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["214","216","218","220","214","220"]},"eNBs - may each support a coverage area, where UEs located within a particular coverage area may communicate with the eNB - associated with that coverage area. Further, coverage areas may be divided into a number of sectors. For example, the hexagonal coverage areas shown in  may be divided into six equal triangular-shaped sectors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","302","304","306","308","310"]},"In the embodiment shown in , mobile network equipment simulation and testing platform  includes UE simulator  for simulating multiple UEs and LTE network node simulator  for simulating other non-UE types of LTE nodes which may be connected to an eNB. UE simulator  may connect to eNB  via CPRI link . Mobile network equipment simulation and testing platform  may include a load test application (LTA) module  for managing simulation of adjacent eNBs, SAE gateways, and MMEs, and for executing user scripts. User scripts  may include various predetermined sequences of messages representing simulated actions performed by simulated UEs.","LTA module  may help perform realistic UE simulation (in conjunction with UE simulator ), UE call dispatching (including both real and simulated UEs), UE traffic profile configuration, call automation, quality of service (QoS) testing, selective reporting and statistics, and call tracing.","User scripts  may include one or more pre-defined scripts for simulating different LTE traffic\/load scenarios in which multiple UEs are connected to an eNB. As used herein, a script includes a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program (e.g., LTA control module ) rather than directly by a computer processor itself (as in the case of a compiled program).","In this case, user scripts  may be carried out by LTA control module . At any given time, the load on an eNB may include UEs continuously connecting and disconnecting to the network, making and receiving calls, sending data, roaming to another eNB within the network, etc. Moreover, the particular mix of UEs and how they behave may be highly dependent upon the network carrier and\/or the DUT's location within the network. Therefore, user scripts  may include a wide variety of primitive\/basic operations that are typically performed by individual UEs so that a network operator can customize their simulated traffic mix to be similar to real world scenarios of interest.","For example, user scripts  may include originating scripts associated with a simulated UE that originates a call\/session. Originating scripts may include, but are not limited to, attach, detach, session establishment and release, handover, session initiation protocol (SIP) calls, file transfer protocol (FTP) calls, and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) calls. Conversely, user scripts  may also include terminating scripts associated with a simulated UE that terminates a call\/session such as MME-initiated detach, home subscriber server (HSS),-initiated detach, handover, and SIP\/FTP\/HTTP calls.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["302","312","314","400","312","314","312","402","406","408","410","412","414"]},"LTE network node simulator  may include a plurality of processor and interface cards located within a chassis.

Interface cards may include a mesh physical interface (mPI) card, and a plurality of multi-port communications cards for supporting ATM, STM, gigabit rear transmission module (RTM), optical RTM, and the like. These cards may be located within a multi-slot chassis which also includes various other supporting hardware and software. For example, the chassis may include one or more universal serial bus (USB), serial, and Ethernet ports, a hard disk drive, random access memory (RAM). In an exemplary configuration, LTE network node simulator  may execute an operating system such as SuSE Linux Enterprise Edition (SLED) and provide connections for a monitor, keyboard, and mouse or any other suitable human-computer interface. Additionally, supported internal bus architectures that may be supported may include, but are not limited to, peripheral component interconnect (PCI) and 1Gbps Ethernet in either mesh or star configurations. External interfaces may include optical carrier  (OC-), optical carrier  (OC-), and optical carrier  (OC-), J carrier  (J), E-carrier  (E), T-carrier  (T), Ethernet, serial, common instrument interface (CII), and structure synchronous transport module level- (STM-)\/C-.","Multi-UE simulator may be similarly configured\/implemented using cards located within a chassis having a processor, memory, operating system (OS), internal communications bus, and external communications interfaces.
