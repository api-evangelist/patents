title: Surface modified adsorbents and use thereof
abstract: A surface-modified adsorbent comprises a reagent on a porous carrier. Preferred porous carriers are adsorbent carbons such as activated carbon, silica gels, aluminas, polyester resins, zeolites or zeolite-like materials, and mixtures thereof. Preferred reagents are 2-hydroxymethylpiperidine (2-HMP) or a 2-HMP analogue. Surface modified adsorbents can be incorporated into cigarettes, preferably in an amount effective to reduce the concentration of one or more constituents of cigarette smoke.

However, their lack of selectivity between smoke constituents may cause reduced shelf life and poor smoke subjectives. To improve filtration performance in cigarette filters, activated carbon, silica gel, and other porous substrates can be modified with chemical reagents that can target specific smoke constituents.","According to a preferred embodiment, a surface-modified adsorbent comprises a reagent incorporated in a porous carrier, the reagent comprising 2-HMP or an analogue thereof. The porous carrier is preferably an adsorbent carbon, activated carbon, silica gel, alumina, polyester resin, zeolite or zeolite-like material, or mixture thereof, and more preferably activated carbon comprising at least about 80% micropores and having an average particle size from about 6 mesh to about 300 mesh or an average particle size from about 0.2 mm to about 1 mm. In a preferred embodiment, the reagent can comprise 1 to 80% or 3 to 10% by weight of the adsorbent.","The reagent preferably comprises 2-hydroxymethylpiperidine (2-HMP) or a 2-HMP analogue such as 2-(2-piperidine)ethanol (2-PE), N-piperidineethanol (N-PE), 2-(4-piperidine)ethanol (4-PE), 3-hydroxypiperidine hydrochloride (3-HPH), 4-hydroxypiperidine (4-HP), 3-N-piperidinyl-1,2-propanediol (3-PDP), 2-amino-1-phenylethanol (2-APE), 2-(N-anilino)ethanol (2-AE) or S-(\u2212)2-phenylglycinol (2-PG).","The surface-modified adsorbent (e.g., adsorbent beads) can be incorporated into a cigarette (e.g., a cigarette filter) in an amount effective to reduce the concentration of mainstream tobacco smoke constituents such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, ethane, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, cyclohexadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, methyl cyclopentadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, diacetyl, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclopentanone, benzene, toluene, acrylonitrile, methyl furan, 2,5 dimethyl furan, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mecaptan, propene, propadiene, carbonyl sulfide, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, methanol, and 1-methylpyrrole. For example, the reagent can be incorporated in a cigarette in an amount effective to reduce the concentration in mainstream smoke of hydrogen cyanide, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, diacetyl, acrylonitrile, and hydrogen sulfide by at least 90%. A preferred filter comprises a plug-space-plug configuration having the surface-modified adsorbent incorporated in the space between the plugs.","Porous sorbent materials such as adsorbent carbon, activated carbon, silica gel, alumina, polyester resins, zeolites or zeolite-like materials, and mixtures thereof can be used to adsorb a wide spectrum of gas phase constituents from mainstream cigarette smoke when incorporated in cigarette filters. However, the lack of selectivity of these materials for specific smoke constituents may cause reduced shelf life and poor smoke subjectives. To improve filtration performance in cigarette filters, activated carbon can be modified with chemical reagents that can specifically react with targeted smoke constituents.","In an embodiment, a porous substrate such as carbon (e.g., activated carbon) or silica gel is treated with a reagent such as 2-HMP or one or more analogues thereof to form a surface modified adsorbent. Analogues of 2-HMP such as 3-N-piperidinyl-1,2-propanediol (3-PDP) and S-(\u2212)-2-phenylglycinol (2-PG) comprise the functional groups \u2014NH\u2014 and \u2014O, which can react with carbonyl (\u2550C\u2550O) or nitrile (\u2014CN) groups of targeted tobacco smoke constituents. Additional 2-HMP analogues include 2-(2-piperidine)ethanol (2-PE), N-piperidineethanol (N-PE), 2-(4-piperidine)ethanol (4-PE), 3-hydroxypiperidine hydrochloride (3-HPH), 4-hydroxypiperidine (4-HP), 2-amino-1-phenylethanol (2-APE), and 2-(N-anilino)ethanol (2-AE).","The filtration efficiency of chemically modified porous substrates can depend on the loading level of the reagent. For a porous carbon substrate, it has been found that for higher levels of reagent loading, e.g., 25% or more of 2-HMP by weight, adsorbent selectivity for targeted tobacco smoke constituents (i.e., chemisorption) can be achieved. At higher levels of loading, the pores on the surface of the porous substrate can be flooded by an excess of reagent, and the physical adsorption (physisorption) of non-reactive constituents such as 1,3-butadiene can be mostly blocked. Reactive smoke constituents include hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, acrolein and diacetyl.","For lower levels of loading, e.g., 5-10% of 2-HMP by weight, modified carbons with improved activity for removing a broad range of constituents can be obtained. Surface modified carbon comprising lower levels of chemical loading can adsorb both chemically reactive and non-chemically reactive constituents. A hypothesis for this observation is the formation of an intermediate impregnation stage where the physical adsorption surface area of carbon can be increased after the impregnation. Similar effects in filtration performance were also observed in carbons treated with 2-HMP analogues such as 3-N-piperidinyl-1,2-propanediol (3-PDP) and S-(\u2212)-2-phenylglycinol (2-PG), the formulas of which are:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"55.46mm","wi":"49.95mm","file":"US07832412-20101116-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Surface modified adsorbents having different loading levels of reagent can be prepared and incorporated into a test cigarette.  shows a modified 1R4F reference cigarette  used for evaluating surface modified adsorbents.

For example, granules of the carrier material can be mixed with a liquid containing the reagent, and the infiltrated granules can be dried under a flowing gas such as air or nitrogen to obtain an impregnated carrier having a desired loading of reagent.","Commercially-available PICA-G277 carbon granules or commercially-available Grace Davison silica gel particles were used as the porous carrier (i.e., substrate) to form surface modified adsorbent particles. The particle sizes for both the carbon and silica gel ranged from about 35\u00d760 mesh to 20\u00d750 mesh.","In a typical synthesis, 2 g of the porous substrate was mixed thoroughly with an aqueous solution containing 0.1 g of 2-HMP solids (or 2-HMP analogue) and about 2 g of water. The mixture was then dried overnight at room temperature in a venting oven, resulting in about 3.6 g of surface modified adsorbent.","Table 1 sets forth examples of various reagents loaded on G-277 carbon wherein the reagents are identified as follows: 2-hydroxymethylpiperidine (2-HMP), 2-(2-piperidine)ethanol (2-PE), N-piperidineethanol (N-PE), 2-(4-piperidine)ethanol (4-PE), 3-hydroxypiperidine hydrochloride (3-HPH), 4-hydroxypiperidine (4-HP), 3-N-piperidinyl-1,2-propanediol (3-PDP), 2-amino-1-phenylethanol (2-APE), 2-(N-anilino)ethanol (2-AE), and S-(\u2212)2-phenylglycinol (2-PG). Table 4 shows that the preparation of modified carbon can be an efficient process with nearly 100% recovery. The relatively low yield of 89% (for 2-APE) is believed to be due to loss of sample during handling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Synthesis of Surface Modified Carbon."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Reagent","G-277C","Water","Products",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Reagent","added (g)","added (g)","added (g)","(g)","Yield %"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","2-HMP","0.50","9.50","2.00","10.00","100%"]},{"entry":["2","3-HPH","0.52","9.50","2.01","9.86","98%"]},{"entry":["3","2-PG","0.50","9.50","3.00","9.93","99%"]},{"entry":["4","3-PDP","0.50","9.50","2.00","9.96","100%"]},{"entry":["5","2-APE","0.50","9.51","2.00","8.88","89%"]},{"entry":["6","2-PE","0.52","9.54","2.10","9.96","99%"]},{"entry":["7","N-PE","0.52","9.50","3.00","10.02","100%"]},{"entry":["8","4-PE","0.50","9.56","2.00","9.92","99%"]},{"entry":["9","2-AE","0.58","9.56","2.20","10.01","99%"]},{"entry":["10","4-HP","0.50","9.51","2.01","10.00","100%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 2 sets forth examples of various reagents loaded on silica gel.

As shown in , the overall performance of the carbon in removing cigarette smoke gas phase constituents can be improved by varying the loading of reagent. At 5 wt. % loading, for example, the surface activated carbon can adsorb compounds that are chemically reactive with 2-HMP (e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, ketones, diacetyl hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) and compounds that are substantially non-chemically reactive (e.g., dienes, aromatic compounds, furans, and pyrroles). In , formaldehyde is abbreviated CHO, acetaldehyde is abbreviated CHCHO, and hydrogen cyanide is abbreviated HCN.","In general, the filtration performance of porous adsorbent materials (i.e., via physisorption and\/or chemisorption) can be improved by incorporating therein an effective amount of reagent. Physisorption is a process whereby a molecule adheres to a surface without the formation of a chemical bond, usually by van der Waals forces or electrostatic attraction. The formation of a chemical bond leads to chemisorption.","The improvement achieved using 2-HMP impregnated carbon can be seen in the puff-by-puff gas delivery data shown in . In each of the respective , the total gas delivery of acrolein, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide and 1,3 butadiene is plotted for untreated carbon (0%) and 2-HMP treated carbon at reagent loadings of 1%, 5% and optionally 25%. As seen in , by increasing the loading of 2-HMP up to 5 wt. %, the percent reduction for each of the aforementioned smoke constituents can be increased. However, if targeted reduction in formaldehyde is desired, loadings of 25% and above can provide selective removal of formaldehyde.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"From the foregoing, it can be seen that relatively low levels of impregnation (3-10%) provide retained or improved reactivity for a broad range of smoke constituents. On the other hand, high loadings (25% and above) can provide targeted selectivity for constituents such as formaldehyde, acrolein, diacetyl and hydrogen cyanide.","The degree of modification depends on the chemical treatment levels. Under a high level of chemical loading, e.g., at least 25% of 2-HMP by weight, it is believed that the pores of the substrate can be filled with the chemical reagents whereby adsorbent materials with very exclusive high selectivity to hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, acrolein, diacetyl can be obtained. Under a lower level of chemical loading, e.g., 5-10% of 2-HMP by weight, materials with improved overall activity to a broad range of smoke constituents may be obtained. For instance, for a 1R4F cigarette comprising 100 mg of modified carbon incorporated in the filter region (e.g., 5-10 wt. % 2-HMP), the concentration of 1,3-butadiene and acrolein in mainstream smoke can be reduce by more than 90%. Replacing the non-impregnated carbon in a test cigarette with 10 wt. % 2-HMP (or analogue thereof) results in undetectable acrolein delivery (<0.08 microgram\/cigarette) and no change in dienes delivery (2.4 micrograms\/cigarette).
