However, it is preferable that the site(s) be out of high-preservation region. The \u201chigh-preservation region\u201d is location in which amino acids in an amino acid sequence of one aminotransferase derived from one origin are identical with amino acids in an amino acid sequence of another aminotransferase derived from another origin when the amino acid sequences are compared in optimum alignment.","The number of the amino acids deleted, replaced, inserted, or added is preferably 10 or less, more preferably 5 or less, and further preferably 3 or less. The modified amino acid sequence may have one modification (e.g., replacement) or two more modifications (e.g., replacement and insertion).

The DNA of the present invention may include any non-translation region. If the polypeptide can be obtained via purification, a person skilled in the art can adopt a well known method to obtain such a DNA from a microorganism from which the polypeptide is derived.","It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the later-described example using KNK08-18 (FERM BP-10599).","Firstly, the polypeptide (enzyme) purified from the cell-free extract prepared from the microorganism is digested with an appropriate endopeptidase, thereby cleaving the polypeptide into fragments, which are then purified via reverse-phase HPLC. Then, part of the amino acid sequence thereof is determined by, for example, protein sequencer ABI492 (Applied Biosystems). From the amino acid sequence information thus obtained, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) primers for amplifying part of DNA that encodes the polypeptide is synthesized. Next, using a general DNA isolation method, for example, a method introduced by Murray et al. (Nucl., Acids Res., 8, 4321-4325, 1980), a genomic DNA of the microorganism is prepared. Using this genomic DNA as a template, PCR is carried out with the PCR primers, thereby to amplify the part of the DNA that encodes the polypeptide. In this ways, a base sequence of the part of the DNA is determined. The base sequence can be determined by using the DNA Sequencer ABI373A (Applied Biosystems) or the like. Once the base sequence of part of the DNA that encodes the polypeptide, it is possible to determine a whole sequence thereof by, for example, Inverse-PCR (Nucl. Acids Res. 16,8186 (1988)).","One example of DNA obtainable in this way is the DNA having the base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the sequence list. The DNA of the present invention is not limited to this example and encompasses any DNA that encodes the polypeptide of the present invention. For example, the present invention encompasses DNA that is hybridizable with the DNA having a base sequence complementary with the base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the sequence list under stringent conditions and that encodes a polypeptide having an activity to produce acetophenone and 1-benzyl-3-aminopyrrolidine from 1-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinone and optically active (S)-\u03b1-phenethylamine.","Here, the \u201cDNA that is hybridizable with the DNA having a base sequence complementary with the base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the sequence list under stringent conditions\u201d is a DNA that contains the base sequence complementary with the base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the sequence list and forms a hybrid when treated with a colony hybridization method, plaque hybridization method, or southern hybridization method, or the like.","An example of the \u201cstringent conditions\u201d is such conditions that hybridization is carried out at 65\u00b0 C. in the presence of NaCl of 0.7M to 1.0M with a filter on which a polynucleotide derived from a colony or plaque is immobilized, and then the filter is washed at 65\u00b0 C. with a 2\u00d7SSC solution (a 1\u00d7SSC solution contains 150 mM sodium chloride and 15 mM sodium citrate). A preferable example thereof is such conditions that the post-hybridization washing is carried out at 65\u00b0 C. with a 0.5\u00d7SSC solution. A more preferable example thereof is such conditions that the post-hybridization washing is carried out at 65\u00b0 C. with a 0.2\u00d7SSC solution. A further more preferable example thereof is such conditions that the post-hybridization washing is carried out at 65\u00b0 C. with a 0.1\u00d7SSC solution.","A vector of the present invention may be any vector that can introduce the DNA into a host cell so as to express a polypeptide encoded the DNA in the host cell. Examples of such a vector DNA encompass a plasmid vector, phage vector, cosmid vector, and the like. Moreover, a shuttle vector, which can exchange a gene with another host strain, can be used as the vector of the present invention.","Preferably the vector may contain a workably-bonded control factor such as a promoter (e.g. lacUV5 promoter, trp promoter, trc promoter, tac promoter, lpp promoter, tufB promoter, recA promoter, pL promoter), so that the vector contains an expression unit bonded workably with the DNA of the present invention. For example, pUCNT (WO94\/03613) and the like can be used preferably.","The term \u201ccontrol factor\u201d used herein is a base sequence having a functional promoter and a given relating transcription element (e.g., enhancer, CCAAT box, TATA box, SPI site, etc.).","The term \u201cworkably bonded\u201d used herein means that the gene and an adjusting element of various type such as the promoter, enhancer, or the like, which adjusts the expression of the gene, are bonded with each other in such a manner that they can work in the host cell. A person skilled in the art can understand that the type and kind of the control factor is variable depending on the host.","Examples of the host cell applicable in the present invention encompass microorganism cells such as bacteria, yeasts, filamentous bacteria, and the like, plant cells, animal cells, and the like. The microorganism cells are preferable and is especially preferable. The vector containing the DNA of the present invention can be introduced into the host cells by a well-known method. In the case where the host cell is , the vector can be introduced by, for example, calcium chloride method.
