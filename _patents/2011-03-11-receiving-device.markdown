As one of the multiplexing techniques, a system which is called an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is proposed. In the OFDM system, many orthogonal sub-carriers are provided in a transmission frequency band and pieces of data are allocated to the amplitude and the phase of each sub-carrier to perform digital modulation.","In the case that an OFDM signal, that is, a frequency multiplexing signal which has been sent from a base station is radio-received, the OFDM signal which has been sent from the base station strikes an obstacle such as a building or a topological obstacle and is reflected and diffracted. A receiving device receives OFDM signals which have been sent passing through a plurality of paths generated by signal reflection and diffraction. The plurality of paths generated by signal reflection and diffraction are generally called a multipath. Distances over which the respective OFDM signals are propagated through the multipath are different from one another. Owing to a difference in propagated distance among the signals, the receiving device receives the plurality of OFDM signals which are different from one another in amplitude and phase.","In the case that an OFDM signal is influenced by the multipath, the amplitudes and phases of sub-carriers in the OFDM signal are changed. In order to eliminate the influence of the multipath on each sub-carrier, the receiving device performs a path estimating process to estimate the characteristic of a propagation path through which a received signal is propagated. In performing the path estimating process, the receiving device uses pilot signals which have been inserted into the OFDM signal. The pilot signal has the previously defined amplitude and phase. The receiving device compares a received pilot signal with the pilot signal having the previously defined amplitude and phase to estimate the characteristic of the propagation path. The receiving device performs an equalizing process on a received signal on the basis of a result of path estimation performed.","The receiving device performs the path estimating process on the basis of a time-domain waveform signal obtained by performing Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) processing on a plurality of pilot signals which have been inserted into the OFDM signal at fixed frequency intervals. A maximum analysis range which the path estimating process is allowed is limited by the frequency intervals of the pilot signals.","In addition, the receiving device is allowed to perform the path estimating process by calculating an autocorrelation of the received signal by using a correlation unit such as a matched filter or the like. The receiving device is allowed to increase the path estimable range and the accuracy in path estimation by combining a result of path estimation performed on the basis of the pilot signals with a result of path estimation performed on the basis of autocorrelation arithmetic processing. In addition, the receiving device is allowed to estimate the characteristic of the propagation path which is the frequency domain by performing Fourier transformation on the result of path estimation to transform the received signal to a frequency signal and then is allowed to perform propagation path compensation to compensate for the received signal on the basis of the estimated propagation path characteristic. Techniques relating to path estimating processes and propagation path compensation performed on the basis of the result of path estimation performed on the basis of the pilot signals or the result of path estimation performed on the basis of autocorrelation arithmetic processing are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-288450 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2008-72224. In addition, a technique relating to the mode 3 of ISDB-T which is the standard for digital broadcasting is disclosed, for example, in \u201cTRANSMISSION SYSTEM FOR DIGITAL TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION BROADCASTING ARIB STD-B31\u201d, Association of Radio Industries and Businesses, 2001.","According to an aspect of the embodiment, a receiving device includes: a receiver that receives frequency multiplex signal; a first Fourier transformation unit that transforms the received frequency multiplex signal to frequency domain signal; a first time-domain waveform generator that generates a first time-domain waveform by performing inverse Fourier transformation of a plurality of pilot signals which are inserted into the frequency multiplex signal; a second time-domain waveform generator that generates a second time-domain waveform having an aliasing period on the basis of the received frequency multiplex signal; a second Fourier transformation unit that synthesizes the first time-domain waveform to the second time-domain waveform and transforms the synthesized time-domain waveform to frequency-domain information; and a propagation-path compensation unit that compensates a propagation-path of the frequency multiplex signal which is output from the first Fourier transformation unit in accordance with information transformed by the second Fourier transformation unit.","Next, preferred embodiments will be described. Incidentally, combinations of configurations in the respective embodiments are also included in the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","20","10","21","1","2","22","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","14"]},"The receiving device  performs fast Fourier transformation (FFT) processing on an OFDM signal which has been received via the antenna  in units of OFDM symbols and outputs an OFDM signal which has been converted to a frequency domain signal (a signal which is in a frequency domain). The receiving device  adjusts a start position of a window that determines a range over which FFT processing is performed in order to convert the received OFDM signal to the frequency domain signal with accuracy. In addition, the receiving device  adjusts a phase shift of the OFDM signal which has been converted to the frequency domain signal in order to increase the accuracy in decoding the signal. Next, details of the receiving device  will be described in units of function blocks.","The antenna  receives the OFDM signal, that is, the frequency multiplex signal sent from a base station and outputs an RF signal. The RF unit  frequency-converts the received RF signal to an IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal. The RF unit  performs a filtering process on the frequency-converted IF signal using a band-pass filter or the like to output an IF signal which is in a specific frequency band. The ADC  digitizes the received IF signal.","The orthogonal modulation unit  orthogonally modulates the digitized IF signal with a carrier signal of a predetermined frequency (a carrier frequency) and outputs an OFDM signal  which is in the base band. The OFDM signal  is transmitted in units of symbols called OFDM symbols. The OFDM symbol includes an effective symbol which is subjected to IFFT processing when it is sent from the base station and a guard interval obtained by copying the waveform of a part of the latter half of the effective symbol.","The FFT unit  performs FFT arithmetic processing on one OFDM signal that has been extracted from one OFDM symbol except the range corresponding to a guard interval. The FFT unit  performs FFT arithmetic processing to convert the time domain OFDM signal (the signal which is in the time domain) to the frequency domain OFDM signal. Execution of FFT arithmetic processing is started at a position situated somewhere between the boundary of the OFDM symbols and the position at which the guard interval terminates. A range over which FFT arithmetic processing is performed is called an FFT window. The position at which execution of arithmetic processing on the FFT window is started is controlled using the window control unit q which will be described later. Next, the position at which execution of arithmetic processing on the FFT window is started will be described in detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["23","24","25","12","24","14","1","2"]},"Description will be further made returning to explanation of the example illustrated in .

A double circle indicates a pilot signal and a blank circle indicates a data signal. In the first embodiment, each pilot signal is inserted every twelve sub-carriers in a sub-carrier direction and inserted in a state in which it is shifted every three sub-carriers in a symbol direction.","Description will be further made returning to explanation of the example illustrated in . The time direction interpolation unit  interpolates the extracted pilot signal in a time axis direction. Objects to be subjected to interpolation arithmetic processing are both a real axis component (an I channel signal) and an imaginary axis component (a Q channel signal) of each pilot signal.

The propagation path compensation unit  removes a propagation path causing distortion of each OFDM signal which has been converted to the frequency domain signal using the FFT unit  on the basis of the transmission path characteristics which have been estimated using the frequency direction interpolation unit . The rate of occurrence of data errors in decoding may be reduced by decoding the OFDM signal from which the distortion has been removed using the propagation path compensation unit , for example, by using a decoding unit (not illustrated in the drawing).","In addition, the receiving device  is allowed to reduce the rate of occurrence of data errors in decoding by appropriately setting a position at which execution of FFT processing on the FFT window is started using the FFT unit . Next, appropriate setting of the position at which execution of FFT processing on the FFT window is started using pilot signals will be described.","The IFFT unit  performs inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) processing on the frequency domain pilot signals so subjected to interpolation arithmetic processing using the time direction interpolation unit  to obtain an impulse response of the transmission path in the time domain. The pilot signals which have been subjected to interpolation arithmetic processing using the time direction interpolation unit  are present every three carriers and hence the length of a time range obtained by performing IFFT processing on the pilot signal will be reduced to one-third the length of the effective symbol. Thus, if a delayed wave which is longer than the time range which is one-third the effective symbol length is present in a group of signals as multipath signal candidates (candidates for a multipath signal), aliasing (folding) will occur. Next, an aliasing phenomenon will be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["1","1","1"]},"Description will be further made returning to explanation of the example in . The IFFT type estimator  extracts a group of signals as the multipath signal candidates in the OFDM signal on the basis of the time-domain waveform signal that has been generated by performing IFFT processing on a plurality of pilot signals which are inserted into the OFDM signal so converted to the frequency domain signal at fixed frequency intervals. The IFFT type estimator  copies the time-domain waveform signal which has been generated by being subjected to IFFT processing so as to be also generated at a time which is shifted for a time period which is integer times as long as the maximum analysis range. For example, as illustrated in the example in , it is assumed that the pilot signals which are present every three carriers are subjected to IFFT processing and the impulse response appears at the time T. In the above mentioned case, the impulse response is copied so as to be also generated at a time (T\u2212B\/3) taking the above aliasing phenomenon into consideration. It may become possible to extract the group of signals as the multipath signal candidates by extending the range up to the section of the effective symbol which may generate beyond the maximum analysis range by copying and generating the impulse response taking the aliasing phenomenon into consideration. The IFFT type estimator  compares the amplitude of the generated impulse response with a threshold value which has been set in advance and outputs path delay information  on the impulse response of the amplitude which is larger than the threshold value. The path delay information  is information indicating the delay time and signal strength of each impulse response.","In the first embodiment, the IFFT unit  uses the pilot signals which have been subjected to interpolation arithmetic processing using the time direction interpolation unit . As an alternative, the time-domain waveform signal may be generated by performing IFFT processing on pilot signals which are present every twelve carriers (the carrier interval K=12) and are not yet subjected to interpolation arithmetic processing. The more the carrier interval K increases, the more the maximum analysis range obtained by IFFT processing is reduced and the more the number of multipath signal candidates which are estimated using the IFFT type estimator  is increased. The number of multipath signal candidates to be estimated may be reduced by generating a time-domain waveform signal which has been subjected to IFFT processing with the pilot signals which have been subjected to interpolation arithmetic processing and are present at a carrier interval K of a small number of carriers. The number of TAPs of the matched filter which will be described later may be reduced by reducing the number of multipath signal candidates.","The matched filter type estimator  extracts a multipath signal from within a group of signals as the multipath signal candidates on the basis of an autocorrelation arithmetic value between the time domain OFDM signal  that has been output from the orthogonal modulation unit  and a signal that has been delayed in accordance with the pulse width and the pulse generation timing of a multipath signal candidate which has been extracted using the IFFT type estimator . The matched filter type estimator  compares the path delay information that has been estimated by performing the autocorrelation arithmetic processing with the path delay information  that has been estimated using the IFFT type estimator . The matched filter type estimator  outputs path detection information  which may serve as a reference of the FFT processing start timing that the window control unit  sets in accordance with a result of comparison between two pieces of path delay information. The FFT unit  is allowed to convert the time domain OFDM signal  to the frequency domain OFDM signal with accuracy by setting the FFT processing start timing on the basis of results of two estimations performed.
