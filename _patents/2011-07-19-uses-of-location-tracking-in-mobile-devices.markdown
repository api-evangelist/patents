No. 61\/365,633 filed Jul. 19, 2010.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. Copyright 2011, WMS Gaming, Inc.","Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems, and more particularly to wagering game systems including mobile phone applications.","Wagering game machines (WGMs), such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such WGMs depends on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the WGM and the intrinsic entertainment value of the WGM relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing WGMs and the expectation of winning at each WGM is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting WGMs, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator.","This description of the embodiments is divided into four sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments of the invention, while the second section describes example mobile phone architectures and wagering game networks. The third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section presents some general comments.","This section provides an introduction to some embodiments of the invention. According to some embodiments of the inventive subject matter, casinos (and other wagering establishments) can leverage mobile phones to provide a richer wagering experience inside the casinos, and extend the wagering experience outside the casinos. Inside casinos, some embodiments allow players to automatically log into WGMs using mobile phones. Some embodiments also allow players to configure mobile phones to operate as auxiliary input devices for WGMs. Thus, players can use their mobile phones to provide input for placing wagers, spinning reels, selecting cards, etc. Some embodiments use mobile phone location tracking technologies to 1) locate players and direct them to points of interest in casinos (e.g., particular WGMs), 2) enable celebration events (e.g., light shows) to follow players as the players move around the casino, 3) provide social networking status updates related player location\/movements.","As players leave casinos, some embodiments use mobile phones to track player movements outside casinos. By tracking player movements outside casinos, the casinos can offer promotions that draw players back into the casinos. Some embodiments enhance player experiences in other ways. For example, some embodiments enable players to download mobile versions of wagering games to the players' mobile phones. The mobile wagering games allow players to participate in monetary wagering when players are in jurisdictions that allow wagering. If the players are in jurisdictions where wagering is not allowed, the mobile phones can activate non-wagering (or \u201ccasual\u201d) versions of the wagering games. By playing wagering and non-wagering games on mobile phones, players can unlock exclusive content (e.g., new game episodes), earn trophies and rewards, etc. In some instances, after content is unlocked by game play on mobile phones, players can access the content by playing inside casinos (e.g., on WGMs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","107","105","103","107","105","107","103","100"]},"At stage A, the mobile phone  determines that a connection should be established with the WGM . In some instances, a player  prompts the mobile phone  to connect to a WGM. In other instances, the mobile phone  detects WGMs without player input. If the mobile phone  determines it is in proximity to the WGM  (e.g., by detecting wireless signals such as Bluetooth\u00ae signals, radio frequency identification (RFID) signals, etc.), the mobile phone  will attempt to establish a connection to the WGM . In some cases, more than one WGM may be in proximity to the mobile phone , so the mobile phone  can select one of many WGMs with which to connect. According to some embodiments, the mobile phone  selects a WGM based on input from a player . For example, the mobile phone  may receive a plurality of WGM identifiers from WGMs that are in range. The mobile phone  can then utilize a client application to display the identifiers in a graphical user interface. In turn, the player  can select a WGM based on the identifiers displayed in the graphical user interface. As another example, the mobile phone  can utilize the client application to download and display a map of WGMs near the player's location. The player  can choose one of the WGMs from the map. In some instances, instead of allowing a player to select a WGM, the mobile phone  itself selects a WGM with which to connect. Some embodiments offer another way by which the mobile phone  determines that it should connect to a WGM. The WGM  can display an image in which its WGM identifier is encoded. The player's mobile phone can photograph the image, and the phone's client application can decode the image to determine the WGM's identifier. After the mobile phone  has determined that it should connect to a WGM, it continues with the operations of stage B.","At stage B, the mobile phone  requests a connection with the WGM . In some instances, the mobile phone  requests the connection based on an identifier associated with the WGM . For example, the mobile phone  uses an identifier provided by the player  to request a wireless connection (e.g., via Bluetooth) with the WGM . In response, the WGM  accepts the request, and the WGM  and mobile phone  establish a wireless connection.","At stage C, the WGM  advances the player log-in process by authenticating the player. In some embodiments, the WGM  queries the mobile phone  for player authentication information. The player  may enter log-in information into the mobile phone , which forwards the log-in information to the WGM . Player authentication information can include usernames, passwords, personal identification numbers, account numbers, player email addresses, phone numbers, etc. The WGM  can forward the player authentication information to the wagering game server . In some embodiments, the mobile phone  automatically provides the player authentication information in the connection request.","At stage D, the WGM  requests and receives the player's  account information from the wagering game server . In some instances, the wagering game server  uses the player identifier to locate a database record including the player's account information. The server  may also mark the player's account as active, and return the account information to the WGM . The player's account information can include information identifying the player  (e.g., name, address, etc.), awards, trophies, persistent game state information, financial information, customizations for the gaming experience, etc.","At stage E, the WGM  configures a wagering game based on the player's account information. For example, the WGM  can configure buttons on its touch screen according to preferences indicated in the account information. As another example, the WGM  can present the player's avatar, and customize display colors and\/or music based on the preferences. As another example, the WGM  can determine, based on the account information, that the mobile phone  has been configured as an auxiliary input device for the WGM . In response, the WGM  can configure a wagering game to accept input from the mobile phone . As yet another example, the WGM  can determine, based on persistent state information indicated in the player's account information, the player's progress in an episodic wagering game. Using the persistent state information, the WGM  can start the episodic wagering game at the same level at which the player  ended a previous wagering session.","Although  depicts the WGM  retrieving the player's  account information from the wagering game server , other embodiments operate differently. The WGM  can retrieve the player's  account information from the mobile phone , a web server that provides an interface for accessing the account outside casinos, or any other suitable component. Some account information can be stored on the wagering game server , while other account information can be stored on the mobile phone  and\/or other components. For example, the wagering game server  may store wagering statistics and loyalty account balances, whereas the mobile phone  may store the persistent game state information and the customization preferences.","Casinos can provide incentives\/benefits for creating and using accounts, so players are more likely to use the accounts while playing wagering games. As noted above, the accounts can track loyalty rewards, trophies, and other awards earned while playing wagering games. Some wagering games are episodic, so accounts can store persistent game state information that allows players to resume wagering games wherever they ended previous wagering game sessions. Additionally, account information can indicate player customizations, such as customized buttons on a touch screen, custom buttons that configures slots game paylines according to player preferences, player-selected music for celebration events (e.g., jackpots), custom avatar settings, etc.","Some embodiments of the wagering game system  can use the accounts to extend gaming experiences outside the casino. The system can allow players to access statistics, view rewards and trophies, and customize preferences by logging into a website. For example, a player may want the wagering game system to play a certain song to celebrate winning events, such as hitting big jackpots. If the song is stored on the player's mobile phone, the player can log into the account via mobile phone, and upload the song to the wagering game system. The player can also configure the mobile phone as an auxiliary input device, so that the phone behaves like a \u201cremote control\u201d for WGMs. The mobile phone can store account credentials, automatically connect to WGMs, and automatically log the player into an account.","Although  describes some embodiments, the following sections describe many other capabilities and embodiments.","In some instances, the mobile phones can operate as auxiliary input devices to the WGMs. That is, the mobile phones can serve as \u201cremote controls,\u201d allowing players to move away from WGMs while playing games. The mobile phones may offer input capabilities not available on the WGMs, so the mobile phones may allow players to \u201cunlock\u201d certain game options and content. The discussion of  (see below) provides more details about how mobile phones can operate as auxiliary input devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["203","205","203","205","203","205","201","205","203","201","205","205","201","201","203","205","203","205","203","203","203","203","205"]},"At stage B, the WGM  determines that the mobile phone  should be configured as an auxiliary input device. The WGM  may do this by retrieving the player's preferences from the player's account or from the player's mobile phone . The preferences can indicate a configuration of input buttons that should be displayed on the mobile phone  and\/or by the WGM , based on games supported by the WGM . For example, for a slots game, the preferences may indicate that \u201cMax Bet\u201d and \u201cSpin\u201d buttons should be displayed on the mobile phone . The WGM  may also display a \u201cSpin\u201d button and other buttons used for betting. The preferences can also indicate other game elements (e.g., playing cards, financial information, wagering statistics, etc.) that should be displayed on the mobile phone . For example, for a video blackjack game, the preferences may indicate that the player's cards and winnings should be displayed on the mobile phone  rather than the WGM . In some instances, the WGM  configures the phone  without player preferences. For example, the WGM  can configure the phone's input options based on pre-selected defaults, or based on results of executing an input configuration wizard by which the player selects input configuration options.","At Stage C, the WGM  configures a wagering game to accept input from the mobile phone . For example, if the player preferences indicate that certain buttons should be displayed on the mobile phone , the WGM  configures a wagering game to receive certain inputs from the mobile phone . In some embodiments, the WGM  configures the wagering game to receive certain input data via one or more input ports configured to receive wireless data from the mobile phone . After the wagering game is configured to accept input from the mobile phone , the WGM  can start a wagering session, and notify the mobile phone  about the wagering session. In response, the mobile phone  can display input buttons, financial information, game elements, etc.","At stage D, the mobile phone  detects wagering game input and transmits the wagering input to the WGM . For example, the mobile phone  can detect that the player  placed a wager for a video blackjack game. In detecting the wager, the phone's client application (or other component) may detect that the player  has input a numerical wager amount, and clicked a \u201cBet\u201d button. The mobile phone  can then transmit a message indicating the wager amount to the WGM . For a slots game, the mobile phone  may detect that the player pressed a \u201cSpin\u201d button. In turn, the mobile phone  can transmit, to the WGM , a message indicating that a spin was detected.","At stage E, the WGM  responds to the wagering game input and presents the wagering game. If the wagering game information includes a wager amount, the WGM's wagering game can receive the wager amount from the mobile phone , and display it to the player . Then, the game can \u201cdeal\u201d cards for a video blackjack game. In some embodiments, the WGM's wagering game can instruct the mobile phone  to display the player's cards. For games other than blackjack, the WGM's wagering game can receive messages indicating various game play selections, and present results associated with those selections. Stage E concludes the flow shown in .","In addition to the capabilities described above, some embodiments can use mobile phones to track players' locations in casinos. A celebration server and other components can utilize player locations to present celebration events near the players. If players move around in casino, celebration events (e.g., music presentations, light shows, etc.) may follow them. Celebration events may accompany big wager awards (e.g., awards of $500), rare accomplishments (e.g., royal flush in poker), milestones (e.g., 100win), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","303","305","311","313","315","317","319","307","309","305","301","301","305","301","303","303","311","313","315","317","319","305","305","303","305","301","303"]},"Using the location information, the celebration server  can determine presentation devices for presenting the celebration event. For example, the celebration server  determines presentation devices (e.g., video displays, speakers, lighting systems, etc.) near the player's location based on a map of the casino floor. In the example shown in , the celebration event is presented on an overhead display device . Although not shown, the celebration server  can present a light show, play music, play video, etc. in addition to the presentation on the display device . The celebration server  can also present the celebration event based on celebration preferences indicated in the player's  account. For example, the player  can set a celebration preference for songs that should be played for different events. As another example, the player preferences can indicate an image (e.g., a picture of the player) to be displayed during the celebration event. The celebration server  can determine the player's  celebration preferences from the mobile phone  and\/or a wagering game server.","At stage B, after presenting the celebration event, the celebration server  determines that the player  moved. The mobile phone's client application can update the celebration server  about player's  movements (e.g., when the player's  location changes, on a periodic basis, etc.). In some instances, the mobile phone  detects movements because it detects new WGM identifiers. In other instances, the mobile phone detects changes in its GPS coordinates. In any case, the mobile phone  can notify the celebration server  about movements. In response to determining that the player  has moved, the celebration server  can determine presentation devices near the player's new location , and present the celebration event on the presentation devices. In , after the player  moves along the dotted path, the celebration server  presents the celebration event on the display device , which is near the player's  new location.","Although some embodiments use location tracking to move celebration events around a casino, other embodiments use location tracking to facilitate other capabilities. For example, in some wagering game systems, certain wagering game events can trigger play-while-away bonus games. Play-while-away bonus games allow players to automatically accrue bonus points and\/or prizes while players are not playing wagering games. One play-while-away bonus game entails a virtual fish tank. In the virtual fish tank game, after a player triggers a bonus event in a wagering game, the player's fish is introduced into a virtual fish tank hosted by a casino. While the fish is in the fish tank, the fish can swim around (without input by the player) trying to collect as many coins as possible. The fish will \u201clive\u201d in the fish tank for a certain period of time The player  can check on the fish at kiosks in the wagering establishment, on WGMs, online through a Website provided by the wagering establishment, etc. In cities like Las Vegas, Nev., many different wagering establishments are in very close proximity to each other, so players tend to visit more than one wagering establishment in a short time period. As the player  visits different wagering establishments, the player's  fish can automatically be moved into fish tanks hosted by the different wagering establishments. The client application on the player's  mobile phone  can periodically report the player's  location to a web server that communicates with wagering servers associated with the wagering establishments. When the web server detects that the player  has moved from a first wagering establishment to a second wagering establishment, the web server can move the fish from a first fish tank associated with the first wagering establishment and to a second first tank associated with the second wagering establishment. Moving the fish can comprise removing an instance of the fish stored on a first wagering server and instantiating the instance of the fish on a second wagering game server. When the fish is moved, the web server can preserve state information of the fish (e.g., awards collected, bonus points accrued, etc.).","Although the celebration server  is depicted in  as a standalone entity, embodiments are not so limited. For example, the celebration server  can be integrated into a wagering game server.","In addition to the uses described above, players can use the mobile phones' location services to find wagering games in casinos and elsewhere. For example, a player can use the phone to specify a particular wagering game, such as Lucky Spades Video Poker. The mobile phone can find a near-by casino based on the player's location. The phone can also present a map show the how the casino has arranged its WGMs on the casino floor, and plot directions on the map, so the player can quickly find the game in the casino.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"At stage A, a mobile phone  submits, to a wagering game server , a request for a location of a wagering game. For example, a player  may input a wagering game title into a client application (not shown) on the mobile phone . Alternatively, the client application may display suggestions from which the player chooses a wagering game. The suggestions may be based on wagering games previously played by the player , and\/or wagering games played by other players who have played the wagering game title entered by the player . In other instances, the suggestions can be based on wagering games that the player's social contacts are currently playing, so the player  can find and join them in a casino. In yet other instances, the player's preferences may indicate the player's favorite wagering game. If the mobile phone  determines that the player  has entered a casino, the mobile phone  can automatically send a request for the location of the favorite wagering game.","Requesting the location of the desired wagering game can also include selecting a wagering game server to which the request is sent. For example, if the player  is outside a casino, the phone's client application may send the request to a web server (not shown). As part of the request, the mobile phone  can provide the player's location (e.g., GPS coordinates) to the web server. In response, the web server can determine a wagering establishment closest to player's  location, and query the appropriate wagering game server  for a location of WGMs that hosts the desired game.","At stage B, the wagering game server  determines a location of a WGM that offers the wagering game. The wagering game server  can determine WGMs that offer the wagering game based on a wagering game database. If multiple WGMs offer the wagering game, the wagering game server  can choose one. The wagering game server  may select a WGM based on availability (i.e., whether the WGM is currently occupied by a player), proximity to the player's location, the player's preferred denominations, the player's preferred location, etc. As shown in , the wagering game server  determines that the WGM  presents the desired wagering game. The wagering game server  can determine the WGM's location using a casino floor map, and return the map with an indication of the WGM's  location. The wagering game server  can return the map over a mobile phone network (e.g., a 3G network, a WiFi network, etc.). The wagering game  server can also indicate locations of other WGMs that present the desired wagering game. A casino floor may include WGMs , , , , , , and . Thus, the casino map can show how the WGMs , , , , , , and  are arranged on the casino floor. In the map, a symbol (e.g., an arrow, a dot, etc.) indicates the WGM's  location.","At stage C, the mobile phone  receives the map indicating the location of the WGM  on the casino floor.","At stage D, the mobile phone  uses the map to determine a path to the WGM  (e.g., based on the location of the mobile phone ). The map can include information that allows the client application to determine distances between objects (e.g., WGMs, walls, furniture, etc.) on the map and walkways between the objects. For example, the map can indicate locations (e.g., in GPS coordinates) of the WGMs , , , , , , and . The map can shows that the WGMs , , , , , , and  are arranged in rows. As shown in , a first row comprises the WGMs , , , and , whereas a second row comprises the WGMS , , and . The map indicates that walkways exist behind the rows. The mobile phone  can determine a path to the desired wagering game machine. In addition, the mobile phone  can provide directions to the player , as the player  traverses the path. For example, as the player  approaches the WGM , the mobile phone  can prompt the player  to turn right. As another example, if the player  has not arrived at the casino, the mobile phone  can also determine a route to the casino from the player's location. If there are multiple WGMs capable of presenting the desired wagering game, the client application can determine which of the WGMs to direct the player. For example, the client application can determine which WGM is closest to the player  and direct the player  to the closest WGM. As another example, the client application can also prompt the player  to determine which of the WGMs the player  prefers.","When the player  arrives at the WGM , the mobile phone  can automatically log the player  into the WGM . To log the player into the WGM , the mobile phone  can establish a connection with the WGM  when the mobile phone  is in proximity to the WGM . In some instances, the mobile phone  uses the map and its location to determine proximity to the WGM . The mobile phone  can determine an identifier of the WGM  based on information received with or included in the map. The mobile phone  can connect to the WGM  using the identifier.","In some embodiments, the mobile phones can provide additional location-tracking functionality. Some casinos can offer promotions based on the players' locations. For example, a casino may offer a virtual trophy for visiting multiple casinos and\/or businesses (e.g., restaurants, shops, etc.). The mobile phones can track player movements and notify a casino's web server (or other component) when players enter certain properties. After players enter all properties necessary for the trophy, the casino's web server can award the virtual trophies by adding the trophies to player accounts. As another example, casinos may offer players free credits, bonus games, or other game-related incentives as they detect players within a certain distance of the casinos. The casinos can use these incentives to motivate players to go inside and play wagering games.","This section describes an example operating environment and presents structural aspects of some embodiments.

The location unit  can determine locations of WGMs, paths to WGMs, paths to casinos, and other location-based information. In some instances, the location unit  uses geographic location information from the GPS unit  and maps received from remote machines (e.g., wagering game servers, web servers, etc.).","In one embodiment, the wagering game unit  can present wagering games, such as video poker, video black jack, video slots, video lottery, etc., in whole or part. The wagering game unit  can, at locations where wager gaming is not permitted, disable monetary wagering (e.g., based on location information determined by the GPS unit  and\/or the location unit ). The wagering game unit  can use location information to determine whether players are eligible for promotions. The account unit  can automatically connect to WGMs and automatically log-in players.","In some embodiments, one or more of the wagering game unit , location unit , and account unit  constitute a client application, as described in the discussion of .","The mobile phone  can include additional components and\/or more than one of each component shown in . For example, in some embodiments, the mobile phone  can include a touch screen display, qwerty keyboard, etc. In one embodiment, any of the components can be integrated or subdivided.","Any component described herein can include hardware, firmware, and\/or machine-readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine-readable storage media includes any mechanism that stores information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a wagering game machine, computer, etc.). For example, machine-readable storage media can be configured as read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), or any other suitable configuration. Machine-readable storage media can be embodied as any suitable magnetic storage media (e.g., magnetic disk media), optical storage media (e.g. DVD media), semi-conductor storage media (e.g., flash memory machines), etc. Any components described herein can also include signal media, which can include media for transmitting software over a network, such as fiber optic media, Ethernet media, etc.","Although embodiments are described with reference to \u201cmobile phones,\u201d some embodiments can work with mobile devices that do not include mobile telephony. For example, instead of mobile phones, embodiments can include mobile computing devices capable of wireless communications (WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). More specifically, embodiments can include mobile devices such as Apple's iPod Touch\u00ae devices, Apple's iPad devices, wireless-enable laptop computers and personal digital assistants, etc.","While  describes an example mobile phone architecture, this section continues with a discussion of wagering game networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","612","614"]},"Each casino  includes a local area network , which includes an access point , a wagering game server , wagering game machines , a web server , and a social networking server . The access point  provides wireless communication links  and wired communication links . The wired and wireless communication links can employ any suitable connection technology, such as Bluetooth, 802.11, Ethernet, public switched telephone networks, SONET, etc. In some embodiments, the wagering game server  can serve wagering games and distribute content to devices located in other casinos  or at other locations on the communications network . In some instances, the wagering game server  includes player account information, while in other instances other components include such information.","The wagering game machines  described herein can take any suitable form, such as floor standing models, handheld mobile units, bartop models, workstation-type console models, etc. Further, the wagering game machines  can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games, or can include non-dedicated devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal computers, etc. In one embodiment, the wagering game network  can include other network devices, such as accounting servers, wide area progressive servers, player tracking servers, and\/or other devices suitable for use in connection with embodiments of the invention.","In some embodiments, wagering game machines  and wagering game servers  work together such that a wagering game machine  can be operated as a thin, thick, or intermediate client. For example, one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the wagering game machine  (client) or the wagering game server  (server). Game play elements can include executable game code, lookup tables, configuration files, game outcome, audio or visual representations of the game, game assets or the like. In a thin-client example, the wagering game server  can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets, while the wagering game machine  can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user (e.g., player). In a thick-client example, the wagering game machines  can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server  for recording or managing a player's account.","As shown, the wagering game machines  can interact with mobile phones , and perform any of the operations described herein. Additionally, the mobile phones  can interact with the wagering game server  and web server .","In some embodiments, either the wagering game machines  (client) or the wagering game server  can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example, account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally (e.g., by the wagering game server ) or locally (e.g., by the wagering game machine ). Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management, presentation of advertising, software or firmware updates, system quality or security checks, etc. For example, the wagering game server can present a celebration event near a location of a player.
