{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to mobile devices and, more particularly, to hardware interface access control for mobile applications.","Mobile device security is becoming increasingly important with increases in the spread of malicious applications or other fraudulent code (e.g., malware) targeted towards mobile devices. Many mobile devices also include functionality that enables the mobile devices to connect to more than one type of wireless network. For example, a mobile device with cellular functionality and WiFi functionality may connect to a cellular wireless network and\/or a WiFi wireless network. In this example, some applications on the mobile device (e.g., voice communications, global positioning system (GPS)-related applications, service provider-related functions) may connect to the cellular network while other applications (e.g., web browsing, text messaging, media streaming) may connect to the WiFi network. In at least some prior mobile devices, the applications on the mobile device may access a wireless network without a user knowing which wireless network the applications are utilizing. Moreover, in at least some prior mobile devices, applications may have uncontrolled access to the network and\/or other hardware interfaces of the mobile device.","Example methods, articles of manufacture, and apparatus for hardware interface access control for mobile applications are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes restricting a first application from accessing a set of hardware interfaces of a mobile device. The example method also includes providing a virtual interface to the first application via which the first application is to access a particular hardware interface in the set of hardware interfaces. The virtual interface is provided by a second application integrated in a kernel layer of an operating system of the mobile device. Furthermore, the particular hardware interface that is accessible via the virtual interface is unknown to the first application.","A disclosed example mobile device includes a set of hardware interfaces, and an example policy engine (e.g., an example app policy engine or application policy engine) to determine whether a first application is authorized to access one or more of the set of hardware interfaces. The mobile device further includes an example hardware access engine to restrict the first application from accessing the set of hardware interfaces. The hardware access engine also is to provide a virtual interface to the first application via which the first application is to access a particular hardware interface in the set of hardware interfaces. The virtual interface is provided by a second application integrated in a kernel layer of an operating system of the mobile device. Additionally, the particular hardware interface that is accessible via the virtual interface is unknown to the first application, but is one of the one or more hardware interfaces the first application is permitted to access.","Mobile device security is becoming important as software worms, viruses, and other malicious code are designed to target mobile devices. Mobile devices include, for example, any laptop, smartphone, cellular phone, computing pad, personal digital assistant, tablet personal computer, personal communicator, etc. Because many mobile devices have relatively small memories, these mobile devices typically do not include anti-malware protection. However, many mobile devices are primarily used to access data and\/or communications from servers via a wireless network. In some instances, malicious code may be embedded within data, which then penetrates an operating system of a mobile device. In many instances, malicious code can expose sensitive information stored on a mobile device. In other instances, malicious code can use the mobile device as a launching pad to propagate to other mobile devices. In yet other instances, the malicious code may use the mobile device as a host to perform denial of service attacks on web servers and\/or wireless networks.","To prevent and\/or limit a mobile device from receiving malicious code, some mobile devices include a VPN client that encrypts, keys, and\/or authenticates data and\/or communication transmissions through a wireless network. In many instances, a mobile device uses a VPN client to create a secure connection to a host server located in a private enterprise network or a carrier network (e.g., a wireless network). The VPN client establishes a relatively secure virtual tunnel and\/or virtual circuit from a mobile device to a host server and\/or network.","However, some issues with existing VPN clients can expose mobile devices to malicious code. In some instances, malicious code can bypass a VPN client on a mobile device. For example, some mobile devices are configured to connect to more than one wireless network. These mobile devices grant applications access to connect (e.g., communicatively couple) to the wireless networks via corresponding wireless hardware interfaces. In many of these instances, the mobile devices may enable any application to connect to a wireless network without prompting a user for permission. In these instances, a malicious application may bypass a VPN connecting to a first wireless network and connect to a second wireless network instead. In this way, the malicious application can bypass the VPN and any corresponding firewalls on the mobile device by, for example, accessing the second wireless network at the link layer of the mobile device (e.g., an application programming interface (API) for processing network traffic).","In other instances, user installed applications may not be configured to access a wireless network through a VPN client. A malicious application may use the connections of these applications to bypass the VPN. Additionally, some mobile device users may disable and\/or uninstall VPN clients, thereby exposing the mobile devices to potentially malicious code. In yet other instances, malicious applications and\/or code can utilize tools and\/or components that are used by VPN clients to protect a mobile device. The malicious applications can utilize the tools and\/or components to connect to a wireless network in parallel with the VPN client, thereby bypassing the security of the VPN client.","Some example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein integrate an app (e.g., application) policy engine with a kernel of an operating system of a mobile device to control which application on the mobile device can be executed and\/or to control which of the applications are authorized to access device interfaces and\/or network interfaces of the mobile device. These example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein interact with an application execution manager of an operating system, a certificate validation processor, and\/or a mandatory access control (MAC) module to enforce execution of device and\/or network interface access policies. Additionally or alternatively, some example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein employ a hardware access engine to control access by applications to hardware interfaces of the mobile device. Thus, the example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein block applications and\/or services that are not authorized and\/or certified from accessing security sensitive interfaces including, for example, a wireless network, a VPN, and\/or host service platform.","Some example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described restrict application access to hardware interfaces, such as device and\/or network interfaces, of the mobile device and, instead, provide a virtual interface to control application access to these hardware interfaces. Additionally or alternatively, some example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein restrict application execution and\/or restrict application access to device and\/or network interfaces by assigning a process identifier to each application and\/or service on a mobile device. These example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture use the process identifiers to determine if each of the applications is authorized to be executed on the mobile device and\/or to access requested device interfaces and\/or network interfaces. The example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein can determine which applications and\/or services are authorized to be executed on the device by checking a digital application certificate provided by a certificate authority.","A certificate authority may provide a digital certificate for each application or, alternatively, provide a digital certificate for more than one of the authorized applications on a mobile device. A list of certificate authorities that are recognized by a mobile device as valid authorities to sign applications may be preconfigured and\/or hard coded into an example app policy engine (also referred to as an application policy engine). Alternatively, the list of certificate authorities may be provided through a network via a local memory module of the mobile device such as, for example, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card. In examples where a digital certificate is assigned to each application, the example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture described herein can use the digital certificate to identify that the corresponding application is authorized to be executed on the mobile device. The digital certificate may also indicate which device interfaces and\/or network interfaces of the mobile device the application is authorized to access.","An application, service, and\/or function on a mobile device includes any software and\/or firmware routine and\/or algorithm that performs a function within a mobile device. An application and\/or a service includes, for example, a messaging application, an e-mail service, a social network application, a gaming application, a web browsing application, a word processing application, a database management application, etc. In some disclosed examples, when an authorized application is executed on a mobile device, the app policy engine configures the example MAC module to grant only the application access to device interface(s) and\/or network interface(s) on the mobile device. In this manner, the example app policy engine manages which applications with process identifiers are granted permission to interfaces of the mobile device. The example MAC module may then enable authorized applications and\/or services to access the device and\/or network interfaces and block and\/or restrict unauthorized applications from accessing those interfaces.","A MAC module provides access control between an operating system layer and device interfaces (e.g., an interface to a camera, a microphone, a memory card, etc.) and\/or network interfaces (e.g., network interface cards (NICs)) of a mobile device. Network interfaces may be communicatively coupled to a network and\/or server. By providing access control, a MAC module determines which applications and\/or services may transmit and\/or receive data from networks and\/or servers via the network interfaces. By providing a MAC module with a list of authorized applications for a network that identifies which device and\/or network interfaces the applications are authorized to access, example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein can create a controlled environment for application execution and\/or application access to device and\/or network interfaces, thereby preventing unauthorized applications from being executed on a mobile device and\/or from applications improperly accessing the device and\/or network interfaces. In this manner, example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein ensure that application execution and\/or device and\/or network interface access privileges correspond to specified polices of a certificate authority.","Example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein also enable applications and\/or services that are authorized and\/or certified (e.g., signed) in a digital certificate by a host service platform (e.g., a certificate authority) to access physical network interfaces of a network, thereby blocking malicious and\/or unauthorized applications from executing on a mobile device. Further, some example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein permit exclusive privileges to be granted to a specific application (e.g., a VPN client). By granting relative higher privileges to, for example, a VPN client, other applications with relatively lower privileges have to abide by the privileges granted to the VPN client. For example, a VPN client may have exclusive authorized access to a wireless network interface. Other certified and\/or authorized applications on the mobile device with relatively lower privileges are forced to go through the VPN to obtain access to the wireless network.","In the interest of brevity and clarity, throughout the following disclosure, reference will be made to an example wireless environment  of . However, the methods, articles of manufacture, and apparatus described herein to control mobile device application access to wireless networks are applicable to other types of networks constructed using other network technologies, topologies and\/or protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","102","102","102"]},"In the illustrated example, the mobile device  is capable of communicatively coupling to a cellular network  and a WiFi network . The example networks  and  include any number and\/or types of routers, switches, servers, etc. to enable communications (e.g., packet-based data) between the mobile device  and a packet switched network (e.g., the Internet). Further, the networks  and  may utilize and\/or conform to any routing and\/or communication protocols. For example, the cellular network  may include components, network elements, and\/or controllers that conform to the 3Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless communication standard, the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for second generation (2G) protocol, the Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA)-based third generation (3G) protocol, the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) protocol, and\/or the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocol. In other examples, the wireless environment  may include other wireless protocols compatible with the mobile device  including, for example, Bluetooth IP and\/or IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN).","In the example of , the example mobile device  is within a coverage area  of the cellular network  and a coverage area  of the WiFi network . By being within the coverage areas  and , applications within the mobile device  may communicatively couple to either of the wireless networks  and . To manage which of the wireless networks  and  the applications may access, the example mobile device  includes the app policy engine .","A prior mobile device without the app policy engine  may establish a VPN link to a VPN within, for example, the cellular network . In such a prior mobile device, applications that are configured to connect to the VPN on the mobile device may transfer data with the VPN. However, other applications (including malicious code) may bypass the VPN and access the WiFi network . By being able to bypass the VPN, applications may transfer data through the WiFi network  to known and\/or unknown destinations without a user of the mobile device  knowing of the connection to the WiFi network .","The example app policy engine  establishes a VPN tunnel within the mobile device  so that application access to the cellular network  is restricted at the device interface and\/or the network interface (e.g., NIC) level. By restricting application access to the hardware interface level (e.g., locking a physical interface of the mobile device ), a MAC module within the mobile device  can determine which applications are to be granted access to a VPN within the cellular network  and which applications are to be blocked and\/or not granted access to the VPN. In this manner, the example app policy engine  ensures that only authorized applications are able to connect to a network while preventing unauthorized applications from transmitting and\/or receiving data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","202","202","204","206","01","03","102","102","202","202"]},"The application layer  includes software and\/or firmware routines, algorithms, and\/or programs that are configured to perform at least one predetermined function. In the illustrated example, the application layer  includes the applications APP -. In this example, APP  is a VPN client  and the applications APP - may include any type of software application.","The example VPN client  within the application layer  enables the applications APP - to securely communicatively couple to a VPN within, for example, the cellular network . Through the exchange of encrypted registration messages with a VPN, the example VPN client  establishes a virtual connection (e.g., a virtual circuit) through a public network (e.g., the wireless network ). The VPN client  uses this virtual connection to relatively securely transmit and receive data from servers, processors, and\/or computers within a private network of a host service platform connected to the VPN. In this manner, the applications APP - may transmit and\/or receive data securely with a VPN via the VPN client  and a MAC module .","In the example of , the mobile device  includes a user interface  for displaying the applications APP - including the VPN client . A user of the mobile device  may connect to a VPN by selecting the VPN client  (or an icon representing the VPN client ) displayed within the user interface . A user may execute the certified applications APP - to transmit and\/or receive data from a VPN by selecting the applications APP - (or an icon representing the applications APP -) displayed within the user interface .","To connect to a VPN, each of the applications APP - includes respective digital certificates - (e.g., an application, and\/or electronic certificate). The example digital certificates - certify that the certificates - belong to a user, organization, server, and\/or other entity. The digital certificates - may also be used to establish an encryption scheme and\/or security protocol with a VPN. The VPN client  connects to a VPN by transmitting the certificate  to a VPN authorization agent that grants access to a VPN. The VPN authorization agent verifies the credentials within the certificate  and provides the VPN client  access to a VPN. After establishing a connection to a VPN, the VPN client  encrypts data from the applications APP - to transmit to the VPN and decrypts data from the VPN for the applications APP -. In many instances, the digital certificates - are provided by a certificate authority and\/or a service administrator (e.g., such as an administrator of a VPN).","In the example of , the digital certificates - includes a list of device interfaces and\/or network interfaces that are authorized to be accessed by the applications APP -. In some examples, a service administrator or the like may only allow certain applications and\/or certain types of applications to access device and\/or network interfaces. For example, a service administrator may only allow certain applications that have trusted security properties, applications that are business appropriate, and\/or applications that are relevant to the purpose of a VPN. As an illustrative example, a service administrator may specify in the certificates  and  that the application APP  and the VPN client  are authorized to access a VPN via a network interface. Further, the service administrator may specify within the digital certificate  that the VPN client  is to have relatively greater privileges to access network interfaces and specify within the certificates  and  that the applications APP - are to have relatively fewer privileges to access network interfaces. The relatively fewer privileges may cause the applications APP - to go through the VPN client  to access the network interfaces.","In other examples, a user of the mobile device  may request from a service administrator that certain applications are to have access to a VPN. For example, a user may request to have a digital certificate (e.g., the digital certificate ) assigned to the application APP  by sending a request to a certificate authority. The service administrator and\/or a certificate authority may respond by providing the digital certificate  to reflect that the application APP  is authorized to access a VPN. Alternatively, the service administrator and\/or the certificate authority may assign a single digital certificate that specifies which of the applications APP - may be executed on the mobile device  and\/or specify which interfaces of the applications APP - may access.","The example operating system (OS) kernel layer  provides services to execute the applications APP - and the VPN client  within the application layer . For many hardware functions (e.g., input functions, output functions, memory allocation, and\/or wireless communication functions) of the mobile device , the OS kernel layer  functions as an interface so that the hardware functions are interpreted properly by the applications APP - and the VPN client . The example OS kernel layer  includes the app policy engine  for interfacing between the VPN client  and the MAC module .","The example OS kernel layer  may also bridge (e.g., interface) the application layer  with a hardware layer (not shown) for processing data from the applications APP -. The hardware level includes device interface(s) and network interface(s) of the mobile device . The example OS kernel layer  in the illustrated example manages data from the application layer  for transmission to the networks  and  via, for example NICs (e.g., wireless network cards). The example OS kernel layer  also propagates data received from the networks  and  to the appropriate applications APP -.","In addition to the MAC module , the example OS kernel layer  includes a network tunnel  and a network tap . Together, the example MAC module , the example network tunnel , and the example network tap  operate at the OS kernel level  to provide security prior to data reaching the applications APP - within the application layer . While the example OS kernel layer  includes the MAC module , the network tunnel , and the network tap , the OS kernel layer  may include additional or fewer components to establish and\/or manage VPN security.","The example network tunnel (TUN)  creates a VPN tunnel through the device OS platform  and\/or the mobile device  by encapsulating data within a packet data payload conforming to a protocol of a packet switched network. In this manner, the network tunnel  enables communications to propagate securely from, for example, the VPN client  to a destination via a VPN within, for example, the cellular network . The example network tunnel  may create a virtual circuit and\/or a VPN tunnel upon the VPN client  receiving permission to connect to a VPN.","The example network tap  monitors data propagating within a VPN tunnel to detect a network intrusion from an unauthorized third party. The example network tap  may also be used for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) recording to monitor a Quality of Service (QoS) for a VPN connection. The example network tap  may operate in conjunction with the example network tunnel  to provide relatively secure data communications through a VPN tunnel.","The example MAC module  of  provides access control to hardware interface(s) of the wireless device . Specifically, the example MAC module  provides access control for the applications APP - to connect to wireless NICs, which provide a wireless connection to, for example, the wireless networks  and . The example MAC module  may also determine which of the applications APP - maybe executed and\/or operated on the mobile device  by restricting unauthorized applications from access device interfaces of the mobile device . For example, the MAC module  may prevent unauthorized applications from accessing a microphone and enabling authorized telephony applications to access the microphone. In this example, the MAC module  prevents any unauthorized applications (e.g., malware) from secretly accessing the microphone and recording, for example, confidential conversations.","In the illustrated example of , the MAC module  includes an interface to an NIC configured to connect to the cellular network  and an interface to an NIC configured to connect to the WiFi network . For example, communications approved by the MAC module  for the cellular network  are routed through the appropriate cellular interface to the wireless NIC configured for the wireless network . In other examples, the MAC module  may include additional or fewer interfaces to other hardware interfaces of the wireless device .","In the example of , the app policy engine  configures the MAC module  to grant specific applications access to a VPN and\/or host service platform via one of the wireless networks  and . To grant certain applications access, an operating system within the OS layer  assigns a unique process identifier to each of the applications APP -. For example, the operating system assigns process identifier PID to the application APP  and assigns process identifier PID to the VPN client . The process identifiers PID- are numbers and\/or names assigned to the respective applications APP -. An operating system, the MAC module , and\/or the app policy engine  may use the process identifiers PID- to locate, identify, and\/or access the appropriate applications APP -. In some instances, the process identifiers PID- may be used in a function call to access the applications APP -.","The example app policy engine  uses the process identifiers PID- as a reference for the MAC module  to indicate which of the applications APP - are authorized to access a VPN. For example, after the process identifiers PID- are assigned to the respective applications APP -, the app policy engine  checks the digital certificates - to determine which of the applications APP - are authorized to access device and\/or network interfaces of the mobile device . The example app policy engine  sends an instruction to the MAC module  with the process identifiers of the applications APP - that are authorized to access a VPN. The example MAC module  stores the allowed process identifiers to later determine if an application requesting to access a VPN, a wireless network, and\/or a host service platform is authorized.","In some examples, the app policy engine  may provide the MAC module  with a list of authorized applications upon the mobile device  requesting to connect to a VPN. In other examples, the app policy engine  may detect that one of the applications APP - is attempting to transmit data to one of the wireless networks  and . In response to detecting the attempted transmission, the app policy engine  determines if the application APP  is authorized to access a network interface to transmit the data by checking the certificate  and sending an instruction to the MAC module  to allow the application APP  to access the wireless network  and\/or  if the application APP  is authorized. In these other examples, the app policy engine  provides the MAC module  application access permission as each of the applications APP - attempts to access a network. In yet other examples, the app policy engine  may provide a list of authorized process identifiers to the MAC module  periodically and\/or after the VPN client  receives updated and\/or new digital certificates.","In examples where the mobile device  includes more than one VPN client, the app policy engine  may identify for the MAC module  which of the applications APP - are authorized to access each of the VPNs via respective network interfaces. For example, the application APP  may be authorized to access a first VPN via the cellular network  and the application APP  may be authorized to access a second VPN via the WiFi network . In this example, the app policy engine  instructs the MAC module  to allow the application APP  to access an NIC for the cellular network  and instructs the MAC module  to allow the application APP  to access an NIC for the WiFi network . Thus, the app policy engine  prevents the MAC module  from allowing the application APP  to access the VPN on the WiFi network  and prevents the MAC module  from allowing the application APP  from accessing the VPN on the cellular network . Further, in examples where more than one VPN client may connect to respective VPNs through, for example, the cellular network , the app policy engine  ensures that the appropriate applications connect to the respective VPNs through the appropriate VPN client by having the MAC module  restrict applications from accessing a VPN on the cellular network  that are not authorized to access the VPN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1-2","FIG. 2"],"b":["104","104","206","104","202","102","212","210","104","210","212","104"]},"The example app policy engine  includes application execution unit  to interface within an operating system of the mobile device . The example application execution unit  also assigns process identifiers (e.g., process IDs) to each of the applications (e.g., the applications APP -) within the mobile device . The example MAC module  uses the process identifiers to grant and\/or restrict application access to device and\/or network interfaces of the mobile device .","Further, the application execution unit  may determine which applications may be executed on the mobile device. For example, the app policy engine  may receive an indication that an application is attempting to operate and\/or initialize. The application execution unit  determines if the application is associated with a digital certificate and that indicates the application may be executed. If the digital certificate indicates the application may be executed, the example application execution unit  enables the application to operate (e.g., execute) on the mobile device .","To identify privileges of applications, the example app policy engine  includes a certificate processor . The example certificate processor  requests to access, for example, the certificate  stored on the mobile device . The certificate processor  reads the certificate  to determine if the associated application APP  is authorized to be executed, access device and\/or network interfaces, access a VPN, access a wireless network, and\/or access a host service platform. In some instances the certificate processor  identifies applications by a name included within a digital certificate and references the name to determine the corresponding application within the application layer . In other instances, the certificate processor  examines a digital certificate for any other identifying information (e.g., file names, application metadata, application identifiers, etc.) to locate a corresponding application with the application layer .","After determining which applications are authorized to be executed, access device and\/or network interfaces, access a VPN, access a wireless network, and\/or access a host service platform, the example certificate processor  stores an identifier of the authorized applications to a database . The example certificate processor  may create a separate group of authorized applications within the database  for each device and\/or network interface. Additionally, the certificate processor  may group authorized applications within the database  based on a relatively amount of granted privileges.","The certificate processor  may also query the application execution unit  for process identifiers assigned to the applications and store the respective process identifiers with the identifiers of the authorized application to the database . In this manner, the certificate processor  maintains a group of applications that are authorized to be executed, access device and\/or network interfaces, access a VPN, access a wireless network, and\/or access a host service platform. The database  may be implemented by Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Random Access Memory (RAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), and\/or any other type of memory.","In some examples, the certificate processor  may identify applications that are unauthorized to be executed, access device and\/or network interfaces, access a VPN, access a wireless network, and\/or access a host service platform. In these examples, the certificate processor  stores the process identifies of these applications to the database . Further, the certificate processor  may periodically query the VPN client  (and\/or a SIM card of the mobile device ) to determine if new and\/or updated versions of digital certificates are available. In other examples, the VPN client  may notify the certificate processor  that new and\/or modified certificates have been received. In instances where digital certificate have been updated and\/or replaced, the certificate processor  updates the database  with identifiers of authorized applications.","To provide the MAC module  of  with instructions specifying authorized applications, the example app policy engine  includes a policy processor . The example policy processor  of  accesses the database  to identify privileges of applications. The example policy processor  then configures the MAC module  by providing the list of process identifiers that correspond to the authorized applications.","The example policy processor  of the illustrated example may provide the MAC module  with a list of authorized applications periodically, upon a request to connect to a wireless network, upon a request to execute, upon a request to connect to a VPN, and\/or host service platform, upon an application accessing a wireless network, upon powering of the mobile device , upon updating of digital certificate(s), and\/or upon a request from the MAC module . In examples where the MAC module  does not include a list of authorized applications, the policy processor  responds to queries from the MAC module  asking an application is authorized to be executed and\/or access device and\/or network interfaces of the mobile device . In these examples, the policy processor  determines which applications are authorized by accessing the database  and searching for privileges associated with process identifiers of the applications.","The example policy processor  of  communicatively couples the app policy engine  to the MAC module . The example policy processor  receives instructions including process identifiers corresponding to authorized applications and transmits the instructions to the MAC module . Further, the policy processor  may detect that a VPN tunnel has been established via, for example, the VPN client . Alternatively, the MAC module  may inform the policy processor  that a VPN tunnel has been created. In response to the policy processor  receiving an indication of a VPN tunnel, the policy processor  may transmit instructions to the MAC module  providing a list of authorized applications.","In some examples, the VPN client  creates a VPN tunnel though the device OS platform  to device and\/or network interfaces of the mobile device  upon detecting and\/or receiving an indication that a user has selected to connect to a VPN and\/or host service platform. To create a VPN tunnel, the VPN client  may instruct the network tunnel  to establish a VPN tunnel from the VPN client  to a wireless hardware interface of the mobile device  via the MAC module . The VPN client  may also instruct the access controller  to send instructions to the MAC module  to identify authorized applications that can transmit and\/or receive communications via the VPN tunnel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIGS. 2 and 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["102","402","202","402","104","102","402","104"]},"The example mobile device  of  includes the hardware access engine  to control application access to any, some or all of the hardware (or physical) interfaces  of the mobile device . Additionally or alternatively, the hardware access engine  can control the methods by which application(s) can access any, some or all of the hardware (or physical) interfaces  of the mobile device . The hardware interfaces  for which the hardware access engine  provides access control can include, for example, one or more NICs that enable the mobile device  to connect to the networks  and\/or , one or more device interfaces, such as one or more memory interfaces to one or more storage devices, a microphone interface to a microphone, a speaker interface to a speaker, a camera interface to a camera, a keypad interface to a keypad, a touchscreen interface to a touchscreen, etc. The hardware access engine  controls access to these one or more hardware interfaces  by preventing one or more of the applications APP - that execute in the application layer  (e.g., which may be similar to or different from the applications APP - of ) from accessing these hardware interfaces  directly. Instead, hardware access engine  provides a virtual interface(s) through which one or more of the applications APP - are permitted to access the one or more hardware interfaces , as described in greater detail below. Additionally or alternatively, the hardware access engine  can control access to one or more of the hardware interfaces  by one or more applications, or one or more portions of an application, executing in the network (e.g., such as one or more cloud-based application) and that can interact with the hardware interfaces  of the mobile device .","In the illustrated example, the hardware access engine  is implemented by a set of example embedded programs ,  and  integrated or otherwise included in an execution layer  of the OS kernel  (also referred to as the OS kernel execution layer ).

In some examples, because the embedded programs ,  and  are integrated in the OS kernel execution layer , the embedded programs ,  and  can be modified, added and\/or removed only by upgrading or downgrading the version of the OS kernel  executing in the mobile device . In the example of , each of the embedded programs ,  and  provides access control for a respective set (e.g., class) of hardware interfaces  of the mobile device . For example, the embedded program  may be an example embedded VPN client  that provides access control for a set of NICs included in the mobile device . Additionally or alternatively, the embedded program  may be an example embedded file encryption system (FES) client  that provides access control for a set of memory interfaces for interfacing with a respective set of memory devices included in the mobile device . Additionally or alternatively, the embedded program  may be an example embedded driver client  that provides access control for a set of user interfaces, such as microphone interface, a speaker interface, a keypad interface, a touchscreen interface, a camera interface, etc., or any combination thereof.","In some examples, OS kernel  and\/or the hardware access engine  (or an appropriate one of the embedded programs - included in the hardware access engine ), prevents the applications APP - from accessing a set of hardware interfaces  (e.g., such as a set of NICs and\/or a set of memory interfaces, etc.) and, instead, provides one virtual interface to this set of hardware interfaces  that is based on (e.g., tailored to) a set of access permissions determined for the applications APP -. For example, when the hardware access engine  determines that the application APP  is attempting to (e.g., requesting access to or a list of) a set of hardware interfaces , the OS kernel  and\/or hardware access engine  prevents the application APP  from accessing this set of hardware interfaces  directly but, instead, provides a virtual interface that enables the application APP  to access a particular hardware interface in this set of hardware interfaces  in a particular manner (e.g, via a particular access method). The particular hardware interface accessible via the virtual interface (e.g., and the method of accessing the hardware interface) is configured (e.g., selected) by the hardware access engine  based on access permissions determined for the application APP . In some examples, the particular hardware interface that the hardware access engine  makes accessible to the application APP  via the virtual interface (as well as, for example, any other processing performed between the virtual and physical interfaces) is unknown to the application APP . In other words, the abstraction from the set of hardware interfaces  to a single virtual interface provided by the hardware access engine  is transparent to the application APP . Such abstraction can prevent unauthorized (e.g., malicious) applications from gaining direct access to the hardware interfaces  of the mobile device .","In some examples, the hardware access engine  utilizes the processing performed by the app policy engine  described above to determine the hardware access permissions for the applications APP -. In such examples, and as described in greater detail above in connections with , the app policy engine  can process digital certificates - (which may be similar to or different from the certificates - of ) associated respectively with the applications APP - to determine which, if any, of the hardware interfaces  the applications APP - have permission to access (e.g., by processing a list of authorized interfaces included in the digital certificates -). For example, the app policy engine  can process the certificate  associated with the application APP  to determine which, if any, of a set of hardware interfaces  the certificate  indicates that the application APP  has permission to access. If app policy engine  determines that the application APP  does not have permission to access any of the set of hardware interfaces , the hardware access engine  prevents the application APP  from accessing any of these hardware interfaces by not providing a virtual interface for accessing this set of hardware interfaces  to the application APP . However, if the policy engine  determines that the application APP  does have permission to access at least one of the set of hardware interfaces , the hardware access engine  provides a virtual interface to the application APP  that is configured, based on the application's determined access permissions, to provide access to a particular one of set of hardware interfaces  that the application APP  is permitted to access (e.g., with the particular hardware interface that is accessible via the virtual interface being unknown to the application APP , as described above).","Because different application APP - may have different access permissions, the particular hardware interface in a set of hardware interfaces  that is accessible via the virtual interface provide by the hardware access engine  may be different for different applications APP -. Also, depending on the access permissions and capabilities of a particular application APP -, the virtual interface provided by the hardware access engine  to a particular application APP - may enable access to more than one of the hardware interfaces included in the set of hardware interfaces  the particular application APP - is attempting to access.","For example, consider an example scenario in which the embedded program  included in the hardware access engine  corresponds to an embedded VPN client  that is to provide access control for a set of NICs included in the hardware interfaces . In such an example, the embedded VPN client  is integrated in the OS kernel application layer , and the OS kernel  prevents the applications APP - from accessing the set of NICs of the mobile device  (e.g., by disabling application layer access to the set of NICs). Additionally, the OS kernel  grants the embedded VPN client  exclusive access to the set of NICs. To enable the applications APP - to access the set of NICs, the embedded VPN client  logically creates and provides a virtual interface (e.g., such as a virtual NIC) to the applications APP -.","For example, assume that application APP  is attempting to establish a network connection to a specific destination (e.g., host). For example, the application APP  could implement a web browser that is attempting to access a web site. To establish the network connection, the application APP  queries the OS kernel  for a set of available NICs via which network connections can be established. The embedded VPN client  detects or is otherwise made aware of this query and, in response, establishes a VPN connection with the specific network destination using one of the physical NICs selected in accordance with the access permissions determined (e.g., by the app policy engine ) for the application APP . Also in response to the query by the application APP , the embedded VPN client  provides a list indicating that one NIC (e.g., a virtual NIC) is available and provides a virtual interface for interfacing with this one NIC. The virtual interface provided by the embedded VPN client  corresponds to the end point of the VPN tunnel established (e.g., via the network tunnel ) with the specific network destination. The application APP  then establishes a network connection with the specific network destination (e.g., host\/server) using the virtual interface.","In the preceding example, the embedded VPN client  is transparent to the application APP . In other words, the application APP  is unaware that its network connection with the specific network destination is being implemented by a VPN connection (tunnel) and that the ingress and egress IP packets being received and transmitted, respectively, over this network connection are undergoing encryption. Furthermore, the particular physical NIC being used to implement the network connection is unknown to the application APP . Instead, the application APP  perceives that the virtual NIC represented by the virtual interface provided by the embedded VPN client  is implementing the network connection to the specific network destination.","Such an embedded VPN client  can be advantageous over prior VPN clients executed, for example, at the application layer . For example, the embedded VPN client  can be executed persistently in the background (e.g., in a background process) and, thus, have always-on behavior such that the user applications APP - cannot bypass the embedded VPN client  when establishing network connections. In such an example, all network connections established by the mobile device  are VPN connections, which are secure and bond the mobile device  to one or more trusted hosts\/servers (e.g., such as one or more security nodes) in the network (e.g., which can monitor and prevent malicious and\/or unwanted data from being exchanged with the mobile device ). The embedded VPN client  can also maintain connection persistence across different IP addresses and\/or access technologies (e.g., to support mobile device mobility).","As another example, consider an example scenario in which the embedded program  included in the hardware access engine  corresponds to an embedded FES client  that is to provide access control for a set of memory interfaces (e.g., for internal memory, memory card(s), etc.) included in the hardware interfaces . In such an example, the embedded FES client  is integrated in the OS kernel application layer , and the OS kernel  prevents the applications APP - from accessing the set of memory interfaces of the mobile device  (e.g., by disabling application layer access to the set of memory interfaces). Additionally, the OS kernel  grants the embedded FES client  exclusive access to the set of memory interfaces. To enable the applications APP - to access the set of memory interfaces, the embedded FES client  logically creates and provides a virtual interface (e.g., such as a virtual memory interfaces) to the applications APP -.","For example, assume that application APP  is attempting to store (e.g., write) data to a storage device of the mobile device . For example, the application APP  could implement an email client that is attempting to write an email attachment, such as a file, to memory. To store the data, the application APP  queries the OS kernel  for a set of available storage devices. The embedded FES client  detects or is otherwise made aware of this query and, in response, configures (e.g., selects) a particular memory interface associated with a particular one of the set of storage devices in accordance with the access permissions determined (e.g., by the app policy engine ) for the application APP . The particular storage device is subject to file encryption as implemented by the FES client . Also in response to the query by the application APP , the embedded FES client  provides a list indicating that one storage device (e.g., a virtual storage device) is available and provides a virtual interface for interfacing with this one storage device. The application APP  then opens a file in the virtual storage device using the virtual interface and writes the data to the virtual interface for storage in the virtual storage device. The FES client  receives the data written by the application APP  to the virtual interface, encrypts the data (e.g., on-the-fly) and writes the encrypted data to the particular physical storage device configured (e.g., selected) by the FES client .","As another example, assume that application APP  is attempting to retrieve (e.g., read) data from a file stored in the mobile device . To read the data, the application APP  queries the OS kernel  for the location of the stored file. In response to the query by the application APP , the embedded FES client  determines the physical storage device in which the file is stored (e.g., based on access authorization and storage device configuration\/selection performed previously during a memory write operation performed by the application APP ). The embedded FES client  provides a virtual interface to the application APP  for interfacing with a virtual storage device that abstracts the physical storage device. The application APP  then opens a file in the virtual storage device using the virtual interface to retrieve the data. The FES client  retrieves the data from the physical memory device, decrypts the data (e.g., on-the-fly) and returns the encrypted data to the virtual interface for retrieval by the application APP .","Like the example embedded VPN client  described above, the example embedded FES client  can be advantageous over prior memory management techniques employed in mobile devices. For example, the embedded FES client  can be executed persistently in the background (e.g., in a background process) and, thus, have always-on behavior such that the user applications APP - cannot bypass the embedded FES client  when writing data to and\/or retrieving data from storage device(s) in the mobile device . In such an example, all application (e.g., user) data stored in the mobile device  can be subject to encryption by the embedded FES client , thereby protecting the stored data from unauthorized access (e.g., by malicious code, malware, etc.).","A block diagram illustrating an example implementation of one of the embedded programs - of  is illustrated in . For clarity, the example implementation of  is described from the perspective of implementing the embedded program . However, the example of  could additionally or alternatively be used to implement the embedded programs  and\/or .","Turning to , the example embedded program  illustrated therein includes one or more example physical interface modules  to interface with a set of one or more respective hardware interfaces  of the mobile device . The physical interface module(s)  can correspond to, for example, a set of NIC drivers for a respective set of NICs included in the mobile device , a set of memory drivers for a respective set of memory interfaces for storage devices in the mobile device , a set of user interface drivers for a respective set of user interfaces (e.g., microphone, speaker, keypad, touchscreen, camera, etc., interfaces) of the mobile device , etc.","The example embedded program  of  also includes an example virtual interface module  to implement a virtual interface to provide access to one (or more) of the physical interface module(s) . The virtual interface can represent, for example, a virtual NIC that abstracts and provides access to a particular physical NIC, a virtual storage device that abstracts and provides access to a particular physical storage device, a virtual user interface that abstracts and provides access to a particular physical user interface, etc. In some examples, the particular physical interface module or modules  to which the virtual interface  provides access is (are) configured based on an application's access permissions, as described above. Also, in some example, the virtual interface module  implements one or more data processing operations (e.g., such as data encryption\/decryption, VPN tunnel establishment, etc.) between the virtual interface provided by the virtual interface module  and the particular hardware (physical) interface(s) to which the virtual interface provides access. As described above, such processing by the virtual interface module  and the particular hardware interface(s) to which the virtual interface module  provides access may be transparent to (e.g., unknown by) an application using the embedded program  to gain access to the hardware interfaces  of the mobile device .","While an example app policy engine  has been illustrated in , one or more of the servers, platforms, interfaces, data structures, elements, processes and\/or devices illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and\/or implemented in any way.

If privileges for the application are specified within the certificate, the example policy processor  next configures, for example, the MAC module  of  (block ).
