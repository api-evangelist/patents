No. 13\/088,009 filed on Apr. 15, 2011, which claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/325,003 filed on Apr. 16, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/387,220 filed on Sep. 28, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted in ASCII format via EFS-Web and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on May 10, 2011, is named 067443US1.txt and is 7,199,444 bytes in size.","The field of the invention relates to synthetic, modified RNAs and uses thereof.","The ability to change the phenotype of a cell or cells, either to express a desired protein or to change the differentiated phenotype of the cell to that of another, desired cell type, has applications in both research and therapeutic settings. The phenotype of a cell is most commonly modified by expression of protein(s) from exogenous DNA or from recombinant viral vectors. These approaches have the potential for unintended mutagenic effects.","One area of interest is the modification of cellular differentiation such that cells are directed to different developmental lineages. As one example, generating insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2 cells from acinar pancreatic cells or other somatic cell types, has the potential to treat diabetes. As but one other example, the ability to redifferentiate a tumor cell or tumor stem cell to a non-cancerous cell type can provide a therapy for cancer. Current protocols for altering cell fate tend to focus on the expression of factors, such as differentiation factors, dedifferentiation factors, transdifferentiation factors, and reprogramming factors, using viral- or DNA-mediated expression.","An area of recent focus is the production of pluripotent or multipotent stem cells from non-embryonic sources. Induction of pluripotency was originally achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues using retroviral vectors to enforce expression of four transcription factors, KLF4, c-MYC, OCT4, and SOX2 (KMOS) (Takahashi, K. and S. Yamanaka, 2006. 126(4): p. 663-76; Takahashi, K., et al., 2007. 131(5): p. 861-72). Attempts to derive induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have also been made using excisable lentiviral and transposon vectors, or through repeated application of transient plasmid, episomal, and adenovirus vectors (Chang, C.-W., et al., 2009. 27(5): p. 1042-1049; Kaji, K., et al., 2009. 458(7239): p. 771-5; Okita, K., et al., 2008. 322(5903): p. 949-53; Stadtfeld, M., et al., 2008. 322(5903): p. 945-9; Woltjen, K., et al., 2009; Yu, J., et al., 2009: p. 1172482; Fusaki, N., et al., 2009. 85(8): p. 348-62). Human pluripotent cells have also been derived using two DNA-free methods: serial protein transduction with recombinant proteins incorporating cell-penetrating peptide moieties (Kim, D., et al., 2009. 4(6): p. 472-476; Zhou, H., et al., 2009. 4(5): p. 381-4), and infectious transgene delivery using the Sendai virus, which has a completely RNA-based reproductive cycle (Fusaki, N., et al., 2009. 85(8): p. 348-62).","Provided herein are compositions, methods, and kits for changing the phenotype of a cell or cells. These methods, compositions, and kits can be used either to express a desired protein in a cell or tissue, or to change the differentiated phenotype of a cell to that of another, desired cell type. Significantly, the methods, compositions, and kits described herein do not utilize exogenous DNA or viral vector-based methods for the expression of protein(s), and thus, do not cause permanent modification of the genome or have the potential for unintended mutagenic effects.","The compositions, methods, and kits described herein are based upon the direct introduction of synthetic RNAs into a cell, which, when translated, provide a desired protein or proteins. Higher eukaryotic cells have evolved cellular defenses against foreign, \u201cnon-self,\u201d RNA that ultimately result in the global inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, resulting in cellular toxicity. This response involves, in part, the production of Type I or Type II interferons, and is generally referred to as the \u201cinterferon response\u201d or the \u201ccellular innate immune response.\u201d The cellular defenses normally recognize synthetic RNAs as foreign, and induce this cellular innate immune response. The inventors have recognized that the ability to achieve sustained or repeated expression of an exogenously directed protein using synthetic RNA is hampered by the induction of this innate immune response. In the methods described herein, the effect of the cellular innate immune response is mitigated by using synthetic RNAs that are modified in a manner that avoids or reduces the response. Avoidance or reduction of the innate immune response permit sustained expression from exogenously introduced RNA necessary, for example, to modify the developmental phenotype of a cell. In one aspect, sustained expression is achieved by repeated introduction of synthetic, modified RNAs into a target cell or its progeny.","The modified, synthetic RNAs described herein, in one aspect, can be introduced to a cell in order to induce exogenous expression of a protein of interest in a cell. The ability to direct exogenous expression of a protein of interest using the modified, synthetic RNAs described herein is useful, for example, in the treatment of disorders caused by an endogenous genetic defect in a cell or organism that impairs or prevents the ability of that cell or organism to produce the protein of interest. Accordingly, in some embodiments, compositions and methods comprising the modified, synthetic RNAs described herein can be used for the purposes of gene therapy.","The modified, synthetic RNAs described herein can advantageously be used in the alteration of cellular fates and\/or developmental potential. The ability to express a protein from an exogenous RNA permits both the alteration or reversal of the developmental potential of a cell, i.e., the reprogramming of the cell, and the directed differentiation of a cell to a more differentiated phenotype. A critical aspect in altering the developmental potential of a cell is the requirement for sustained and prolonged expression of one or more developmental potential altering factors in the cell or its immediate progeny. Traditionally, such sustained expression has been achieved by introducing DNA or viral vectors to a cell. These traditional approaches have limited therapeutic utility due to the potential for insertional mutagenesis. The compositions and methods described herein completely avoid such risks related to genomic alterations.","One of the areas that can most benefit from the ability to express a desired protein or proteins over a sustained period of time from exogenous synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein is the generation of pluripotent or multipotent cells from cells initially having a more differentiated phenotype. In this aspect, synthetic, modified RNAs encoding a reprogramming factor or factors are used to reprogram cells to a less differentiated phenotype, i.e., having a greater developmental potential. Unexpectedly, the inventors have discovered that the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein permit both dramatically enhanced efficiency and rate of cellular reprogramming relative to DNA- or viral vector-mediated reprogramming methods.","A major goal of stem cell technology is to make the stem cell differentiate into a desired cell type, i.e., directed differentiation. Not only are the compositions and methods described herein useful for reprogramming cells, they are also applicable to this directed differentiation of cells to a desired phenotype. That is, the same technology described herein for reprogramming is directly applicable to the differentiation of the reprogrammed cell, or any other stem cell or precursor cell, for that matter, to a desired cell type.","Accordingly, in one aspect, provided herein are synthetic, modified RNA molecules encoding a polypeptide, where the synthetic, modified RNA molecule comprises one or more modifications, such that introducing the synthetic, modified RNA molecule to a cell results in a reduced innate immune response relative to a cell contacted with a synthetic RNA molecule encoding the polypeptide not comprising the one or more modifications.","In some embodiments of this aspect and all such aspects described herein, the synthetic, modified RNA molecule comprises at least two modified nucleosides.

Unless stated otherwise, or implicit from context, the following terms and phrases include the meanings provided below. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, or apparent from context, the terms and phrases below do not exclude the meaning that the term or phrase has acquired in the art to which it pertains. The definitions are provided to aid in describing particular embodiments, and are not intended to limit the claimed invention, because the scope of the invention is limited only by the claims. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.","As used herein, the terms \u201cdevelopmental potential\u201d or \u201cdevelopmental potency\u201d refer to the total of all developmental cell fates or cell types that can be achieved by a cell upon differentiation. Thus, a cell with greater or higher developmental potential can differentiate into a greater variety of different cell types than a cell having a lower or decreased developmental potential. The developmental potential of a cell can range from the highest developmental potential of a totipotent cell, which, in addition to being able to give rise to all the cells of an organism, can give rise to extra-embryonic tissues; to a \u201cunipotent cell,\u201d which has the capacity to differentiate into only one type of tissue or cell type, but has the property of self-renewal, as described herein; to a \u201cterminally differentiated cell,\u201d which has the lowest developmental potential. A cell with \u201cparental developmental potential\u201d refers to a cell having the developmental potential of the parent cell that gave rise to it.","The term \u201ctotipotency\u201d refers to a cell with a developmental potential to make all of the cells in the adult body as well as the extra-embryonic tissues, including the placenta. The fertilized egg (zygote) is totipotent, as are the cells (blastomeres) of the morula (up to the 16-cell stage following fertilization).","The term \u201cpluripotent\u201d as used herein refers to a cell with the developmental potential, under different conditions, to differentiate to cell types characteristic of all three germ cell layers, i.e., endoderm (e.g., gut tissue), mesoderm (including blood, muscle, and vessels), and ectoderm (such as skin and nerve). A pluripotent cell has a lower developmental potential than a totipotent cell. The ability of a cell to differentiate to all three germ layers can be determined using, for example, a nude mouse teratoma formation assay. In some embodiments, pluripotency can also evidenced by the expression of embryonic stem (ES) cell markers, although the preferred test for pluripotency of a cell or population of cells generated using the compositions and methods described herein is the demonstration that a cell has the developmental potential to differentiate into cells of each of the three germ layers. In some embodiments, a pluripotent cell is termed an \u201cundifferentiated cell.\u201d Accordingly, the terms \u201cpluripotency\u201d or a \u201cpluripotent state\u201d as used herein refer to the developmental potential of a cell that provides the ability for the cell to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm). Those of skill in the art are aware of the embryonic germ layer or lineage that gives rise to a given cell type. A cell in a pluripotent state typically has the potential to divide in vitro for a long period of time, e.g., greater than one year or more than 30 passages.","The term \u201cmultipotent\u201d when used in reference to a \u201cmultipotent cell\u201d refers to a cell that has the developmental potential to differentiate into cells of one or more germ layers, but not all three. Thus, a multipotent cell can also be termed a \u201cpartially differentiated cell.\u201d Multipotent cells are well known in the art, and examples of multipotent cells include adult stem cells, such as for example, hematopoietic stem cells and neural stem cells. \u201cMultipotent\u201d indicates that a cell may form many types of cells in a given lineage, but not cells of other lineages. For example, a multipotent hematopoietic cell can form the many different types of blood cells (red, white, platelets, etc. . . . ), but it cannot form neurons. Accordingly, the term \u201cmultipotency\u201d refers to a state of a cell with a degree of developmental potential that is less than totipotent and pluripotent.","The terms \u201cstem cell\u201d or \u201cundifferentiated cell\u201d as used herein, refer to a cell in an undifferentiated or partially differentiated state that has the property of self-renewal and has the developmental potential to differentiate into multiple cell types, without a specific implied meaning regarding developmental potential (i.e., totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, etc.). A stem cell is capable of proliferation and giving rise to more such stem cells while maintaining its developmental potential. In theory, self-renewal can occur by either of two major mechanisms. Stem cells can divide asymmetrically, which is known as obligatory asymmetrical differentiation, with one daughter cell retaining the developmental potential of the parent stem cell and the other daughter cell expressing some distinct other specific function, phenotype and\/or developmental potential from the parent cell. The daughter cells themselves can be induced to proliferate and produce progeny that subsequently differentiate into one or more mature cell types, while also retaining one or more cells with parental developmental potential. A differentiated cell may derive from a multipotent cell, which itself is derived from a multipotent cell, and so on. While each of these multipotent cells may be considered stem cells, the range of cell types each such stem cell can give rise to, i.e., their developmental potential, can vary considerably. Alternatively, some of the stem cells in a population can divide symmetrically into two stem cells, known as stochastic differentiation, thus maintaining some stem cells in the population as a whole, while other cells in the population give rise to differentiated progeny only. Accordingly, the term \u201cstem cell\u201d refers to any subset of cells that have the developmental potential, under particular circumstances, to differentiate to a more specialized or differentiated phenotype, and which retain the capacity, under certain circumstances, to proliferate without substantially differentiating. In some embodiments, the term stem cell refers generally to a naturally occurring parent cell whose descendants (progeny cells) specialize, often in different directions, by differentiation, e.g., by acquiring completely individual characters, as occurs in progressive diversification of embryonic cells and tissues. Some differentiated cells also have the capacity to give rise to cells of greater developmental potential. Such capacity may be natural or may be induced artificially upon treatment with various factors. Cells that begin as stem cells might proceed toward a differentiated phenotype, but then can be induced to \u201creverse\u201d and re-express the stem cell phenotype, a term often referred to as \u201cdedifferentiation\u201d or \u201creprogramming\u201d or \u201cretrodifferentiation\u201d by persons of ordinary skill in the art.","The term \u201cembryonic stem cell\u201d as used herein refers to naturally occurring pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the embryonic blastocyst (see, for e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,780; 6,200,806; 7,029,913; 7,584,479, which are incorporated herein by reference). Such cells can similarly be obtained from the inner cell mass of blastocysts derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,945,577, 5,994,619, 6,235,970, which are incorporated herein by reference). Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the placenta, i.e., are not totipotent.","As used herein, the distinguishing characteristics of an embryonic stem cell define an \u201cembryonic stem cell phenotype.\u201d Accordingly, a cell has the phenotype of an embryonic stem cell if it possesses one or more of the unique characteristics of an embryonic stem cell, such that that cell can be distinguished from other cells not having the embryonic stem cell phenotype. Exemplary distinguishing embryonic stem cell phenotype characteristics include, without limitation, expression of specific cell-surface or intracellular markers, including protein and microRNAs, gene expression profiles, methylation profiles, deacetylation profiles, proliferative capacity, differentiation capacity, karyotype, responsiveness to particular culture conditions, and the like. In some embodiments, the determination of whether a cell has an \u201cembryonic stem cell phenotype\u201d is made by comparing one or more characteristics of the cell to one or more characteristics of an embryonic stem cell line cultured within the same laboratory.","The term \u201csomatic stem cell\u201d is used herein to refer to any pluripotent or multipotent stem cell derived from non-embryonic tissue, including fetal, juvenile, and adult tissue. Natural somatic stem cells have been isolated from a wide variety of adult tissues including blood, bone marrow, brain, olfactory epithelium, skin, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. Each of these somatic stem cells can be characterized based on gene expression, factor responsiveness, and morphology in culture. Exemplary naturally occurring somatic stem cells include, but are not limited to, neural stem cells, neural crest stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and pancreatic stem cells. In some aspects described herein, a \u201csomatic pluripotent cell\u201d refers to a somatic cell, or a progeny cell of the somatic cell, that has had its developmental potential altered, i.e., increased, to that of a pluripotent state by contacting with, or the introduction of, one or more reprogramming factors using the compositions and methods described herein.","The term \u201cprogenitor cell\u201d is used herein to refer to cells that have greater developmental potential, i.e., a cellular phenotype that is more primitive (e.g., is at an earlier step along a developmental pathway or progression) relative to a cell which it can give rise to by differentiation. Often, progenitor cells have significant or very high proliferative potential. Progenitor cells can give rise to multiple distinct cells having lower developmental potential, i.e., differentiated cell types, or to a single differentiated cell type, depending on the developmental pathway and on the environment in which the cells develop and differentiate.","As used herein, the term \u201csomatic cell\u201d refers to any cell other than a germ cell, a cell present in or obtained from a pre-implantation embryo, or a cell resulting from proliferation of such a cell in vitro. Stated another way, a somatic cell refers to any cell forming the body of an organism, as opposed to a germline cell. In mammals, germline cells (also known as \u201cgametes\u201d) are the spermatozoa and ova which fuse during fertilization to produce a cell called a zygote, from which the entire mammalian embryo develops. Every other cell type in the mammalian body\u2014apart from the sperm and ova, the cells from which they are made (gametocytes) and undifferentiated, pluripotent, embryonic stem cells\u2014is a somatic cell: internal organs, skin, bones, blood, and connective tissue are all made up of somatic cells. In some embodiments the somatic cell is a \u201cnon-embryonic somatic cell,\u201d by which is meant a somatic cell that is not present in or obtained from an embryo and does not result from proliferation of such a cell in vitro. In some embodiments the somatic cell is an \u201cadult somatic cell,\u201d by which is meant a cell that is present in or obtained from an organism other than an embryo or a fetus or results from proliferation of such a cell in vitro. Unless otherwise indicated, the compositions and methods for reprogramming a somatic cell described herein can be performed both in vivo and in vitro (where in vivo is practiced when a somatic cell is present within a subject, and where in vitro is practiced using an isolated somatic cell maintained in culture).","The term \u201cdifferentiated cell\u201d encompasses any somatic cell that is not, in its native form, pluripotent, as that term is defined herein. Thus, the term a \u201cdifferentiated cell\u201d also encompasses cells that are partially differentiated, such as multipotent cells, or cells that are stable, non-pluripotent partially reprogrammed, or partially differentiated cells, generated using any of the compositions and methods described herein. In some embodiments, a differentiated cell is a cell that is a stable intermediate cell, such as a non-pluripotent, partially reprogrammed cell. It should be noted that placing many primary cells in culture can lead to some loss of fully differentiated characteristics. Thus, simply culturing such differentiated or somatic cells does not render these cells non-differentiated cells (e.g. undifferentiated cells) or pluripotent cells. The transition of a differentiated cell (including stable, non-pluripotent partially reprogrammed cell intermediates) to pluripotency requires a reprogramming stimulus beyond the stimuli that lead to partial loss of differentiated character upon placement in culture. Reprogrammed and, in some embodiments, partially reprogrammed cells, also have the characteristic of having the capacity to undergo extended passaging without loss of growth potential, relative to parental cells having lower developmental potential, which generally have capacity for only a limited number of divisions in culture. In some embodiments, the term \u201cdifferentiated cell\u201d also refers to a cell of a more specialized cell type (i.e., decreased developmental potential) derived from a cell of a less specialized cell type (i.e., increased developmental potential) (e.g., from an undifferentiated cell or a reprogrammed cell) where the cell has undergone a cellular differentiation process.","The term \u201creprogramming\u201d as used herein refers to a process that reverses the developmental potential of a cell or population of cells (e.g., a somatic cell). Stated another way, reprogramming refers to a process of driving a cell to a state with higher developmental potential, i.e., backwards to a less differentiated state. The cell to be reprogrammed can be either partially or terminally differentiated prior to reprogramming. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, reprogramming encompasses a complete or partial reversion of the differentiation state, i.e., an increase in the developmental potential of a cell, to that of a cell having a pluripotent state. In some embodiments, reprogramming encompasses driving a somatic cell to a pluripotent state, such that the cell has the developmental potential of an embryonic stem cell, i.e., an embryonic stem cell phenotype. In some embodiments, reprogramming also encompasses a partial reversion of the differentiation state or a partial increase of the developmental potential of a cell, such as a somatic cell or a unipotent cell, to a multipotent state. Reprogramming also encompasses partial reversion of the differentiation state of a cell to a state that renders the cell more susceptible to complete reprogramming to a pluripotent state when subjected to additional manipulations, such as those described herein. Such manipulations can result in endogenous expression of particular genes by the cells, or by the progeny of the cells, the expression of which contributes to or maintains the reprogramming. In certain embodiments, reprogramming of a cell using the synthetic, modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein causes the cell to assume a multipotent state (e.g., is a multipotent cell). In some embodiments, reprogramming of a cell (e.g. a somatic cell) using the synthetic, modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein causes the cell to assume a pluripotent-like state or an embryonic stem cell phenotype. The resulting cells are referred to herein as \u201creprogrammed cells,\u201d \u201csomatic pluripotent cells,\u201d and \u201cRNA-induced somatic pluripotent cells.\u201d The term \u201cpartially reprogrammed somatic cell\u201d as referred to herein refers to a cell which has been reprogrammed from a cell with lower developmental potential by the methods as disclosed herein, such that the partially reprogrammed cell has not been completely reprogrammed to a pluripotent state but rather to a non-pluripotent, stable intermediate state. Such a partially reprogrammed cell can have a developmental potential lower that a pluripotent cell, but higher than a multipotent cell, as those terms are defined herein. A partially reprogrammed cell can, for example, differentiate into one or two of the three germ layers, but cannot differentiate into all three of the germ layers.","The term \u201cdevelopmental potential altering factor,\u201d as used herein, refers to a factor such as a protein or RNA, the expression of which alters the developmental potential of a cell, e.g., a somatic cell, to another developmental state, e.g., a pluripotent state. Such an alteration in the developmental potential can be a decrease (i.e., to a more differentiated developmental state) or an increase (i.e., to a less differentiated developmental state). A developmental potential altering factor, can be for example, an RNA or protein product of a gene encoding a reprogramming factor, such as SOX2, an RNA or protein product of a gene encoding a cell-type specific polypeptide transcription factor, such as myoD, a microRNA, a small molecule, and the like.","The term a \u201creprogramming factor,\u201d as used herein, refers to a developmental potential altering factor, as that term is defined herein, such as a protein, RNA, or small molecule, the expression of which contributes to the reprogramming of a cell, e.g. a somatic cell, to a less differentiated or undifferentiated state, e.g. to a cell of a pluripotent state or partially pluripotent state. A reprogramming factor can be, for example, transcription factors that can reprogram cells to a pluripotent state, such as SOX2, OCT3\/4, KLF4, NANOG, LIN-28, c-MYC, and the like, including as any gene, protein, RNA or small molecule, that can substitute for one or more of these in a method of reprogramming cells in vitro. In some embodiments, exogenous expression of a reprogramming factor, using the synthetic modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein, induces endogenous expression of one or more reprogramming factors, such that exogenous expression of one or more reprogramming factors is no longer required for stable maintenance of the cell in the reprogrammed or partially reprogrammed state. \u201cReprogramming to a pluripotent state in vitro\u201d is used herein to refer to in vitro reprogramming methods that do not require and\/or do not include nuclear or cytoplasmic transfer or cell fusion, e.g., with oocytes, embryos, germ cells, or pluripotent cells. A reprogramming factor can also be termed a \u201cde-differentiation factor,\u201d which refers to a developmental potential altering factor, as that term is defined herein, such as a protein or RNA, that induces a cell to de-differentiate to a less differentiated phenotype, that is a de-differentiation factor increases the developmental potential of a cell.","As used herein, the term \u201cdifferentiation factor\u201d refers to a developmental potential altering factor, as that term is defined herein, such as a protein, RNA, or small molecule, that induces a cell to differentiate to a desired cell-type, i.e., a differentiation factor reduces the developmental potential of a cell. In some embodiments, a differentiation factor can be a cell-type specific polypeptide, however this is not required. Differentiation to a specific cell type can require simultaneous and\/or successive expression of more than one differentiation factor. In some aspects described herein, the developmental potential of a cell or population of cells is first increased via reprogramming or partial reprogramming using synthetic, modified RNAs, as described herein, and then the cell or progeny cells thereof produced by such reprogramming are induced to undergo differentiation by contacting with, or introducing, one or more synthetic, modified RNAs encoding differentiation factors, such that the cell or progeny cells thereof have decreased developmental potential.","In the context of cell ontogeny, the term \u201cdifferentiate\u201d, or \u201cdifferentiating\u201d is a relative term that refers to a developmental process by which a cell has progressed further down a developmental pathway than its immediate precursor cell. Thus in some embodiments, a reprogrammed cell as the term is defined herein, can differentiate to a lineage-restricted precursor cell (such as a mesodermal stem cell), which in turn can differentiate into other types of precursor cells further down the pathway (such as a tissue specific precursor, for example, a cardiomyocyte precursor), and then to an end-stage differentiated cell, which plays a characteristic role in a certain tissue type, and may or may not retain the capacity to proliferate further.","As used herein, the term \u201ccell-type specific polypeptide\u201d refers to a polypeptide that is expressed in a cell having a particular phenotype (e.g., a muscle cell, a pancreatic \u03b2 cell) but is not generally expressed in other cell types with different phenotypes. As but one example, MyoD is expressed specifically in muscle cells but not in non-muscle cells, thus MyoD is a cell-type specific polypeptide.","As used herein, the term \u201cwithout the formation of a pluripotent intermediate cell\u201d refers to the transdifferentiation of one cell type to another cell type, preferably, in one step; thus a method that modifies the differentiated phenotype or developmental potential of a cell without the formation of a pluripotent intermediate cell does not require that the cell be first dedifferentiated (or reprogrammed) and then differentiated to another cell type. Instead, the cell type is merely \u201cswitched\u201d from one cell type to another without going through a less differentiated phenotype. Accordingly, transdifferentiation refers to a change in the developmental potential of a cell whereby the cell is induced to become a different cell having a similar developmental potential, e.g., a liver cell to a pancreatic cell, a pancreatic \u03b1 cell into a pancreatic \u03b2 cell, etc.","The term \u201cexpression\u201d refers to the cellular processes involved in producing RNA and proteins and as appropriate, secreting proteins, including where applicable, but not limited to, for example, transcription, translation, folding, modification and processing. \u201cExpression products\u201d include RNA transcribed from a gene, and polypeptides obtained by translation of mRNA transcribed from a gene. In some embodiments, an expression product is transcribed from a sequence that does not encode a polypeptide, such as a microRNA.","As used herein, the term \u201ctranscription factor\u201d refers to a protein that binds to specific parts of DNA using DNA binding domains and is part of the system that controls the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA.","As used herein, the term \u201csmall molecule\u201d refers to a chemical agent which can include, but is not limited to, a peptide, a peptidomimetic, an amino acid, an amino acid analog, a polynucleotide, a polynucleotide analog, an aptamer, a nucleotide, a nucleotide analog, an organic or inorganic compound (e.g., including heterorganic and organometallic compounds) having a molecular weight less than about 10,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 5,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 1,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 500 grams per mole, and salts, esters, and other pharmaceutically acceptable forms of such compounds.","The term \u201cexogenous\u201d as used herein refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., a synthetic, modified RNA encoding a transcription factor), or a protein (e.g., a transcription factor) that has been introduced by a process involving the hand of man into a biological system such as a cell or organism in which it is not normally found, or in which it is found in lower amounts. A factor (e.g. a synthetic, modified RNA encoding a transcription factor, or a protein, e.g., a polypeptide) is considered exogenous if it is introduced into an immediate precursor cell or a progeny cell that inherits the substance. In contrast, the term \u201cendogenous\u201d refers to a factor or expression product that is native to the biological system or cell (e.g., endogenous expression of a gene, such as, e.g., SOX2 refers to production of a SOX2 polypeptide by the endogenous gene in a cell). In some embodiments, the introduction of one or more exogenous factors to a cell, e.g., a developmental potential altering factor, using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, induces endogenous expression in the cell or progeny cell(s) thereof of a factor or gene product necessary for maintenance of the cell or progeny cell(s) thereof in a new developmental potential.","The term \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cpartially purified\u201d as used herein refers, in the case of a nucleic acid or polypeptide, to a nucleic acid or polypeptide separated from at least one other component (e.g., nucleic acid or polypeptide) that is present with the nucleic acid or polypeptide as found in its natural source and\/or that would be present with the nucleic acid or polypeptide when expressed by a cell, or secreted in the case of secreted polypeptides. A chemically synthesized nucleic acid or polypeptide or one synthesized using in vitro transcription\/translation is considered \u201cisolated\u201d.","The term \u201cisolated cell\u201d as used herein refers to a cell that has been removed from an organism in which it was originally found, or a descendant of such a cell. Optionally the cell has been cultured in vitro, e.g., in the presence of other cells. Optionally, the cell is later introduced into a second organism or re-introduced into the organism from which it (or the cell or population of cells from which it descended) was isolated.","The term \u201cisolated population\u201d with respect to an isolated population of cells as used herein refers to a population of cells that has been removed and separated from a mixed or heterogeneous population of cells. In some embodiments, an isolated population is a \u201csubstantially pure\u201d population of cells as compared to the heterogeneous population from which the cells were isolated or enriched. In some embodiments, the isolated population is an isolated population of pluripotent cells which comprise a substantially pure population of pluripotent cells as compared to a heterogeneous population of somatic cells from which the pluripotent cells were derived.","The term \u201cimmediate precursor cell\u201d is used herein to refer to a parental cell from which a daughter cell has arisen by cell division.","As used herein, the terms \u201csynthetic, modified RNA\u201d or \u201cmodified RNA\u201d refer to an RNA molecule produced in vitro, which comprise at least one modified nucleoside as that term is defined herein below. The synthetic, modified RNA composition does not encompass mRNAs that are isolated from natural sources such as cells, tissue, organs etc., having those modifications, but rather only synthetic, modified RNAs that are synthesized using in vitro techniques. The term \u201ccomposition,\u201d as applied to the terms \u201csynthetic, modified RNA\u201d or \u201cmodified RNA,\u201d encompasses a plurality of different synthetic, modified RNA molecules (e.g., at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at least 19, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 75, at least 90, at least 100 synthetic, modified RNA molecules or more). In some embodiments, a synthetic, modified RNA composition can further comprise other agents (e.g., an inhibitor of interferon expression or activity, a transfection reagent, etc.). Such a plurality can include synthetic, modified RNA of different sequences (e.g., coding for different polypeptides), synthetic, modified RNAs of the same sequence with differing modifications, or any combination thereof.","As used herein the term \u201cmodified nucleoside\u201d refers to a ribonucleoside that encompasses modification(s) relative to the standard guanine (G), adenine (A), cytidine (C), and uridine (U) nucleosides. Such modifications can include, for example, modifications normally introduced post-transcriptionally to mammalian cell mRNA, and artificial chemical modifications, as known to one of skill in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a polymer of amino acids comprising at least 2 amino acids (e.g., at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, at least 100, at least 125, at least 150, at least 175, at least 200, at least at least 250, at least 275, at least 300, at least 350, at least 400, at least 450, at least 500, at least 600, at least 700, at least 800, at least 900, at least 1000, at least 2000, at least 3000, at least 4000, at least 5000, at least 6000, at least 7000, at least 8000, at least 9000, at least 10,000 amino acids or more). The terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d are used interchangeably herein. As used herein, the term \u201cpeptide\u201d refers to a relatively short polypeptide, typically between about 2 and 60 amino acids in length.","As used herein, the term \u201cadded co-transcriptionally\u201d refers to the addition of a feature, e.g., a 5\u2032 diguanosine cap or other modified nucleoside, to a synthetic, modified RNA during transcription of the RNA molecule (i.e., the modified RNA is not fully transcribed prior to the addition of the 5\u2032 cap).","The term \u201ccontacting\u201d or \u201ccontact\u201d as used herein in connection with contacting a cell with one or more synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein, includes subjecting a cell to a culture medium which comprises one or more synthetic, modified RNAs at least one time, or a plurality of times, or to a method whereby such a synthetic, modified RNA is forced to contact a cell at least one time, or a plurality of times, i.e., a transfection system. Where such a cell is in vivo, contacting the cell with a synthetic, modified RNA includes administering the synthetic, modified RNA in a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition, to a subject via an appropriate administration route, such that the compound contacts the cell in vivo.","The term \u201ctransfection\u201d as used herein refers the use of methods, such as chemical methods, to introduce exogenous nucleic acids, such as the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, into a cell, preferably a eukaryotic cell. As used herein, the term transfection does not encompass viral-based methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acids into a cell. Methods of transfection include physical treatments (electroporation, nanoparticles, magnetofection), and chemical-based transfection methods. Chemical-based transfection methods include, but are not limited to, cyclodextrin, polymers, liposomes, and nanoparticles. In some embodiments, cationic lipids or mixtures thereof can be used to transfect the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, into a cell, such as DOPA, Lipofectamine and UptiFectin. In some embodiments, cationic polymers such as DEAE-dextran or polyethylenimine, can be used to transfect a synthetic, modified RNAs described herein.","The term \u201ctransduction\u201d as used herein refers to the use of viral particles or viruses to introduce exogenous nucleic acids into a cell.","As used herein, the term \u201ctransfection reagent\u201d refers to any agent that induces uptake of a synthetic, modified RNA into a host cell. Also encompassed are agents that enhance uptake e.g., by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, at least 1-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 25-fold, at least 500-fold, at least 100-fold, at least 1000-fold, or more, compared to a synthetic, modified RNA administered in the absence of such a reagent. In one embodiment, a cationic or non-cationic lipid molecule useful for preparing a composition or for co-administration with a synthetic, modified RNA is used as a transfection reagent. In other embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNA comprises a chemical linkage to attach e.g., a ligand, a peptide group, a lipophillic group, a targeting moiety etc. In other embodiments, the transfection reagent comprises a charged lipid, an emulsion, a liposome, a cationic or non-cationic lipid, an anionic lipid, or a penetration enhancer as known in the art or described herein.","As used herein, the term \u201crepeated transfections\u201d refers to repeated transfection of the same cell culture with a synthetic, modified RNA a plurality of times (e.g., more than once or at least twice). In some embodiments, the cell culture is transfected at least twice, at least 3 times, at least 4 times, at least 5 times, at least 6 times, at least 7 times, at least 8 times, at least 9 times, at least 10 times, at least 11 times, at least 12 times, at least 13 times, at least 14 times, at least 15 times, at least 16 times, at least 17 times at least 18 times, at least 19 times, at least 20 times, at least 25 times, at least 30 times, at least 35 times, at least 40 times, at least 45 times, at least 50 times or more. The transfections can be repeated until a desired phenotype of the cell is achieved.","The time between each repeated transfection is referred to herein as the \u201cfrequency of transfection.\u201d In some embodiments, the frequency of transfection occurs every 6 h, every 12 h, every 24 h, every 36 h, every 48 h, every 60 h, every 72 h, every 96 h, every 108 h, every 5 days, every 7 days, every 10 days, every 14 days, every 3 weeks, or more during a given time period in any developmental potential altering regimen, such as a reprogramming, transdifferentiation or differentiation regimen. The frequency can also vary, such that the interval between each dose is different (e.g., first interval 36 h, second interval 48 h, third interval 72 h etc). It should be understood depending upon the schedule and duration of repeated transfections, it will often be necessary to split or passage cells or change or replace the media during the transfection regimen to prevent overgrowth and replace nutrients. For the purposes of the methods described herein, transfections of a culture resulting from passaging an earlier transfected culture is considered \u201crepeated transfection,\u201d \u201crepeated contacting\u201d or \u201ccontacting a plurality of times,\u201d unless specifically indicated otherwise.","As used herein, the term \u201cpermits repeated transfections\u201d refers to a synthetic, modified RNA or synthetic, modified RNA composition that can be transfected into a given cell culture with reduced cytotoxicity compared to an RNA or RNA composition having the same sequence(s) which lacks modifications to the RNA. As used herein, the term \u201creduced cytotoxicity\u201d refers to the death of less than 50% of the cells in a cell culture repeatedly transfected with a synthetic, modified RNA or synthetic, modified RNA composition, e.g., less than 40%, less than 30%, less than 20%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 1%, less than 0.1% or fewer compared to transfection with a composition having the same sequence(s) but lacking modifications to the RNA. The amount of cell death in a culture can be determined using a standard Trypan Blue Exclusion assay, which turns dead cells blue while leaving living cells uncolored. Alternatively \u201creduced cytotoxicity\u201d can be assessed by measuring apoptosis using e.g., a TUNEL assay. Other useful measures for determining \u201creduced cytotoxicity\u201d include e.g., flow cytometric and bead based measurements of viability, cell growth, cellularity (measured e.g., microscopically and quantitated by a hemocytometer), global protein production, secretion of cytokines (e.g., Type 1 IFNs), and expression level of interferon response signature genes (e.g., IFIT1, IFITM1, OAS1, IFNA1, IFNB1, PKR, RIG-I, TLR7, TLR8 etc).","As used herein, the term \u201ctargeting moiety\u201d refers to an agent that homes to or preferentially associates or binds to a particular tissue, cell type, receptor, infecting agent or other area of interest. The addition of a targeting moiety to an RNA delivery composition will enhance the delivery of the composition to a desired cell type or location. The addition to, or expression of, a targeting moiety in a cell enhances the localization of that cell to a desired location within an animal or subject.","As used herein, the terms \u201cinnate immune response\u201d or \u201cinterferon response\u201d refers to a cellular defense response initiated by a cell in response to recognition of infection by a foreign organism, such as a virus or bacteria or a product of such an organism, e.g., an RNA lacking the modifications characteristic of RNAs produced in the subject cell. The innate immune response protects against viral and bacterial infection by inducing the death of cells that detect exogenous nucleic acids e.g., by detection of single- or double-stranded RNA that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors such as RIG-I, protein kinase R (PKR), MDA5, or nucleic acid-recognizing Toll-like receptors, e.g., TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, and activating an interferon response. As used herein, the innate immune response or interferon response operates at the single cell level causing cytokine expression, cytokine release, global inhibition of protein synthesis, global destruction of cellular RNA, upregulation of major histocompatbility molecules, and\/or induction of apoptotic death, induction of gene transcription of genes involved in apoptosis, anti-growth, and innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Some of the genes induced by type I IFNs include PKR, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), OAS (2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase), RNase L, and Mx proteins. PKR and ADAR lead to inhibition of translation initiation and RNA editing, respectively. OAS is a dsRNA-dependent synthetase that activates the endoribonuclease RNase L to degrade ssRNA.","Accordingly, as used herein, the phrases \u201cinnate immune response signature\u201d or \u201cinterferon response signature\u201d genes refer to the set of genes that are expressed or up-regulated upon an interferon response of a cell, and include, but are not limited to, IFN\u03b1, IFNB1, IFIT, OAS1, PKR, RIGI, CCL5, RAP1A, CXCL10, IFIT1, CXCL11, MX1, RP11-167P23.2, HERC5, GALR3, IFIT3, IFIT2, RSAD2, CDC20, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9.","As used herein, the term \u201cinhibitor of interferon expression or activity\u201d refers to an agent (e.g., small molecule, antibody, antibody fragment, soluble receptor, RNA interference molecule etc.) that: (a) inhibits translation of an interferon polypeptide from an mRNA transcript, (b) inactivates an interferon polypeptide, (c) prevents interferon binding to its receptor or (d) binds\/sequesters an interferon polypeptide e.g., for degradation.","As used herein, the term \u201cunsupervised clustering analysis\u201d or \u201cunsupervised cluster analysis\u201d refers to methods used in multivariate analysis to divide up objects into similar groups, or, in some embodiments, groups whose members are all close to one another on various dimensions being measured in the various objects. In cluster analysis, one does not start with any a priori notion of group characteristics. As used herein, \u201chierarchical cluster analysis\u201d or \u201chierarchical clustering\u201d refer to a general approach to unsupervised cluster analysis, in which the purpose is to group together objects or records that are \u201cclose\u201d to one another. A key component of the analysis is repeated calculation of distance measures between objects, and between clusters once objects begin to be grouped into clusters. The outcome is typically represented graphically as a dendrogram. Hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed using any of a variety of unbiased computational methods, algorithms and software programs known to one of skill in the art that identify clusters or natural data structures from large data sets, such as, for example, gene expression data sets. Such methods include, but are not limited to, bottom-up hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering Affinity Propagation, non-Negative Matrix Factorization, spectral clustering, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithms, and the like. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, a SOM-based method for use in unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of cells contacted with the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein is the Automatic clustering using density-equalized SOM Ensembles (AUTOsome) method as described in A. M. Newman and J. B. Cooper (2010, Cell Stem Cell, 7:258-262) and A. M. Newman and J. B. Cooper (2010, BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:117), the contents of each of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference. After a clustering analysis of a given data set, such as a gene expression data set, appropriate class-based statistical tests like Student's t-test, ANOVA, or Gene Set Enrichment Analysis can be used to evaluate significance.","As used herein the term \u201ccomprising\u201d or \u201ccomprises\u201d is used in reference to compositions, methods, and respective component(s) thereof, that are essential to the invention, yet open to the inclusion of unspecified elements, whether essential or not.","As used herein the term \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d refers to those elements required for a given embodiment. The term permits the presence of elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel or functional characteristic(s) of that embodiment of the invention.","The term \u201cconsisting of\u201d refers to compositions, methods, and respective components thereof as described herein, which are exclusive of any element not recited in that description of the embodiment.","Described herein are novel compositions, methods, and kits for changing the phenotype of a cell or cells. These methods, compositions, and kits can be used either to express a desired protein in a cell or tissue, or to change the developmental potential or differentiated phenotype of a cell to that of another, desired cell type. Significantly, the methods and compositions described herein do not utilize exogenous DNA or viral vector-based methods for the expression of protein(s), and thus, do not cause permanent modification of the genome or unintended mutagenic effects.","RNAs and RNA Modification","Described herein are synthetic, modified RNAs for changing the phenotype of a cell, such as expressing a polypeptide or altering the developmental potential. As used herein, the term \u201csynthetic, modified RNA\u201d refers to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a factor, such as a polypeptide, to be expressed in a host cell, which comprises at least one modified nucleoside and has at least the following characteristics as the term is used herein: (i) it can be generated by in vitro transcription and is not isolated from a cell; (ii) it is translatable in a mammalian (and preferably human) cell; and (iii) it does not provoke or provokes a significantly reduced innate immune response or interferon response in a cell to which it is introduced or contacted relative to a synthetic, non-modified RNA of the same sequence. A synthetic, modified RNA as described herein permits repeated transfections in a target cell; that is, a cell or cell population transfected with a synthetic, modified RNA molecule as described herein tolerates repeated transfection with such synthetic, modified RNA without significant induction of an innate immune response or interferon response. These three primary criteria for a synthetic, modified RNA molecule described above are described in greater detail below.","First, the synthetic, modified RNA must be able to be generated by in vitro transcription of a DNA template. Methods for generating templates are well known to those of skill in the art using standard molecular cloning techniques. An additional approach to the assembly of DNA templates that does not rely upon the presence of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites is also described herein (termed \u201csplint-mediated ligation\u201d). The transcribed, synthetic, modified RNA polymer can be modified further post-transcription, e.g., by adding a cap or other functional group.","To be suitable for in vitro transcription, the modified nucleoside(s) must be recognized as substrates by at least one RNA polymerase enzyme. Generally, RNA polymerase enzymes can tolerate a range of nucleoside base modifications, at least in part because the naturally occurring G, A, U, and C nucleoside bases differ from each other quite significantly. Thus, the structure of a modified nucleoside base for use in generating the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can generally vary more than the sugar-phosphate moieties of the modified nucleoside. That said, ribose and phosphate-modified nucleosides or nucleoside analogs are known in the art that permit transcription by RNA polymerases. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the RNA polymerase is a phage RNA polymerase. The modified nucleotides pseudouridine, m5U, s2U, m6A, and m5C are known to be compatible with transcription using phage RNA polymerases, while N1-methylguanosine, N1-methyladenosine, N7-methylguanosine, 2\u2032-)-methyluridine, and 2\u2032-O-methylcytidine are not. Polymerases that accept modified nucleosides are known to those of skill in the art.","It is also contemplated that modified polymerases can be used to generate synthetic, modified RNAs, as described herein. Thus, for example, a polymerase that tolerates or accepts a particular modified nucleoside as a substrate can be used to generate a synthetic, modified RNA including that modified nucleoside.","Second, the synthetic, modified RNA must be translatable by the translation machinery of a eukaryotic, preferably mammalian, and more preferably, human cell. Translation generally requires at least a ribosome binding site, a methionine start codon, and an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide. Preferably, the synthetic, modified RNA also comprises a 5\u2032 cap, a stop codon, a Kozak sequence, and a polyA tail. In addition, mRNAs in a eukaryotic cell are regulated by degradation, thus a synthetic, modified RNA as described herein can be further modified to extend its half-life in the cell by incorporating modifications to reduce the rate of RNA degradation (e.g., by increasing serum stability of a synthetic, modified RNA).","Nucleoside modifications can interfere with translation. To the extent that a given modification interferes with translation, those modifications are not encompassed by the synthetic, modified RNA as described herein. One can test a synthetic, modified RNA for its ability to undergo translation and translation efficiency using an in vitro translation assay (e.g., a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay, a reporter activity assay, or measurement of a radioactive label in the translated protein) and detecting the amount of the polypeptide produced using SDS-PAGE, Western blot, or immunochemistry assays etc. The translation of a synthetic, modified RNA comprising a candidate modification is compared to the translation of an RNA lacking the candidate modification, such that if the translation of the synthetic, modified RNA having the candidate modification remains the same or is increased then the candidate modification is contemplated for use with the compositions and methods described herein. It is noted that fluoro-modified nucleosides are generally not translatable and can be used herein as a negative control for an in vitro translation assay.","Third, the synthetic, modified RNA provokes a reduced (or absent) innate immune response or interferon response by the transfected cell or population of cells thereof. mRNA produced in eukaryotic cells, e.g., mammalian or human cells, is heavily modified, the modifications permitting the cell to detect RNA not produced by that cell. The cell responds by shutting down translation or otherwise initiating an innate immune or interferon response. Thus, to the extent that an exogenously added RNA can be modified to mimic the modifications occurring in the endogenous RNAs produced by a target cell, the exogenous RNA can avoid at least part of the target cell's defense against foreign nucleic acids. Thus, in some embodiments, synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein include in vitro transcribed RNAs including modifications as found in eukaryotic\/mammalian\/human RNA in vivo. Other modifications that mimic such naturally occurring modifications can also be helpful in producing a synthetic, modified RNA molecule that will be tolerated by a cell. With this as a background or threshold understanding for the requirements of a synthetic, modified RNA, the various modifications contemplated or useful in the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein are discussed further herein below.","RNA Modifications","In some aspects, provided herein are synthetic, modified RNA molecules encoding polypeptides, where the synthetic, modified RNA molecules comprise one or more modifications, such that introducing the synthetic, modified RNA molecules to a cell results in a reduced innate immune response relative to a cell contacted with synthetic RNA molecules encoding the polypeptides not comprising the one or more modifications.","The synthetic, modified RNAs described herein include modifications to prevent rapid degradation by endo- and exo-nucleases and to avoid or reduce the cell's innate immune or interferon response to the RNA. Modifications include, but are not limited to, for example, (a) end modifications, e.g., 5\u2032 end modifications (phosphorylation dephosphorylation, conjugation, inverted linkages, etc.), 3\u2032 end modifications (conjugation, DNA nucleotides, inverted linkages, etc.), (b) base modifications, e.g., replacement with modified bases, stabilizing bases, destabilizing bases, or bases that base pair with an expanded repertoire of partners, or conjugated bases, (c) sugar modifications (e.g., at the 2\u2032 position or 4\u2032 position) or replacement of the sugar, as well as (d) internucleoside linkage modifications, including modification or replacement of the phosphodiester linkages. To the extent that such modifications interfere with translation (i.e., results in a reduction of 50% or more in translation relative to the lack of the modification\u2014e.g., in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation assay), the modification is not suitable for the methods and compositions described herein. Specific examples of synthetic, modified RNA compositions useful with the methods described herein include, but are not limited to, RNA molecules containing modified or non-natural internucleoside linkages. Synthetic, modified RNAs having modified internucleoside linkages include, among others, those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the internucleoside linkage. In other embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNA has a phosphorus atom in its internucleoside linkage(s).","Non-limiting examples of modified internucleoside linkages include phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3\u2032-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3\u2032-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having normal 3\u2032-5\u2032 linkages, 2\u2032-5\u2032 linked analogs of these, and those) having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3\u2032-5\u2032 to 5\u2032-3\u2032 or 2\u2032-5\u2032 to 5\u2032-2\u2032. Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.","Representative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat.

Modified nucleosides also include natural bases that comprise conjugated moieties, e.g. a ligand. As discussed herein above, the RNA containing the modified nucleosides must be translatable in a host cell (i.e., does not prevent translation of the polypeptide encoded by the modified RNA). For example, transcripts containing s2U and m6A are translated poorly in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, while pseudouridine, m5U, and m5C are compatible with efficient translation. In addition, it is known in the art that 2\u2032-fluoro-modified bases useful for increasing nuclease resistance of a transcript, leads to very inefficient translation. Translation can be assayed by one of ordinary skill in the art using e.g., a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation assay.","Further modified nucleobases include those disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Ligands can be particularly useful where, for example, a synthetic, modified RNA is administered in vivo. Such moieties include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. USA, 1989, 86: 6553-6556, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Biorg. Med. Chem.

Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765-2770, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20:533-538, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J, 1991, 10:1111-1118; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259:327-330; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75:49-54, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethyl-ammonium 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651-3654; Shea et al., Nucl.

Ther., 1996, 277:923-937, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can further comprise a 5\u2032 cap. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the synthetic, modified RNAs comprise a 5\u2032 cap comprising a modified guanine nucleotide that is linked to the 5\u2032 end of an RNA molecule using a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate linkage. As used herein, the term \u201c5\u2032 cap\u201d is also intended to encompass other 5\u2032 cap analogs including, e.g., 5\u2032 diguanosine cap, tetraphosphate cap analogs having a methylene-bis(phosphonate) moiety (see e.g., Rydzik, A M et al., (2009) 7(22):4763-76), dinucleotide cap analogs having a phosphorothioate modification (see e.g., Kowalska, J. et al., (2008) 14(6):1119-1131), cap analogs having a sulfur substitution for a non-bridging oxygen (see e.g., Grudzien-Nogalska, E. et al., (2007) 13(10): 1745-1755), N7-benzylated dinucleoside tetraphosphate analogs (see e.g., Grudzien, E. et al., (2004) 10(9):1479-1487), or anti-reverse cap analogs (see e.g., Jemielity, J. et al., (2003) RNA 9(9): 1108-1122 and Stepinski, J. et al., (2001) RNA 7(10):1486-1495). In one such embodiment, the 5\u2032 cap analog is a 5\u2032 diguanosine cap. In some embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNA does not comprise a 5\u2032 triphosphate.","The 5\u2032 cap is important for recognition and attachment of an mRNA to a ribosome to initiate translation. The 5\u2032 cap also protects the synthetic, modified RNA from 5\u2032 exonuclease mediated degradation. It is not an absolute requirement that a synthetic, modified RNA comprise a 5\u2032 cap, and thus in other embodiments the synthetic, modified RNAs lack a 5\u2032 cap. However, due to the longer half-life of synthetic, modified RNAs comprising a 5\u2032 cap and the increased efficiency of translation, synthetic, modified RNAs comprising a 5\u2032 cap are preferred herein.","The synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can further comprise a 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). Untranslated regions are regions of the RNA before the start codon (5\u2032) and after the stop codon (3\u2032), and are therefore not translated by the translation machinery. Modification of an RNA molecule with one or more untranslated regions can improve the stability of an mRNA, since the untranslated regions can interfere with ribonucleases and other proteins involved in RNA degradation. In addition, modification of an RNA with a 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 untranslated region can enhance translational efficiency by binding proteins that alter ribosome binding to an mRNA. Modification of an RNA with a 3\u2032 UTR can be used to maintain a cytoplasmic localization of the RNA, permitting translation to occur in the cytoplasm of the cell. In one embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein do not comprise a 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 UTR. In another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNAs comprise either a 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 UTR. In another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein comprise both a 5\u2032 and a 3\u2032 UTR. In one embodiment, the 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 UTR is selected from an mRNA known to have high stability in the cell (e.g., a murine alpha-globin 3\u2032 UTR). In some embodiments, the 5\u2032 UTR, the 3\u2032 UTR, or both comprise one or more modified nucleosides.","In some embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein further comprise a Kozak sequence. The \u201cKozak sequence\u201d refers to a sequence on eukaryotic mRNA having the consensus (gcc)gccRccAUGG (SEQ ID NO: 1481), where R is a purine (adenine or guanine) three bases upstream of the start codon (AUG), which is followed by another \u2018G\u2019. The Kozak consensus sequence is recognized by the ribosome to initiate translation of a polypeptide. Typically, initiation occurs at the first AUG codon encountered by the translation machinery that is proximal to the 5\u2032 end of the transcript. However, in some cases, this AUG codon can be bypassed in a process called leaky scanning. The presence of a Kozak sequence near the AUG codon will strengthen that codon as the initiating site of translation, such that translation of the correct polypeptide occurs. Furthermore, addition of a Kozak sequence to a synthetic, modified RNA will promote more efficient translation, even if there is no ambiguity regarding the start codon. Thus, in some embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein further comprise a Kozak consensus sequence at the desired site for initiation of translation to produce the correct length polypeptide. In some such embodiments, the Kozak sequence comprises one or more modified nucleosides.","In some embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein further comprise a \u201cpoly (A) tail\u201d, which refers to a 3\u2032 homopolymeric tail of adenine nucleotides, which can vary in length (e.g., at least 5 adenine nucleotides) and can be up to several hundred adenine nucleotides). The inclusion of a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail can protect the synthetic, modified RNA from degradation in the cell, and also facilitates extra-nuclear localization to enhance translation efficiency. In some embodiments, the poly(A) tail comprises between 1 and 500 adenine nucleotides; in other embodiments the poly(A) tail comprises at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, at least 100, at least 110, at least 120, at least 130, at least 140, at least 150, at least 160, at least 170, at least 180, at least 190, at least 200, at least 225, at least 250, at least 275, at least 300, at least 325, at least 350, at least 375, at least 400, at least 425, at least 450, at least 475, at least 500 adenine nucleotides or more. In one embodiment, the poly(A) tail comprises between 1 and 150 adenine nucleotides. In another embodiment, the poly(A) tail comprises between 90 and 120 adenine nucleotides. In some such embodiments, the poly(A) tail comprises one or more modified nucleosides.","It is contemplated that one or more modifications to the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein permit greater stability of the synthetic, modified RNA in a cell. To the extent that such modifications permit translation and either reduce or do not exacerbate a cell's innate immune or interferon response to the synthetic, modified RNA with the modification, such modifications are specifically contemplated for use herein. Generally, the greater the stability of a synthetic, modified RNA, the more protein can be produced from that synthetic, modified RNA. Typically, the presence of AU-rich regions in mammalian mRNAs tend to destabilize transcripts, as cellular proteins are recruited to AU-rich regions to stimulate removal of the poly(A) tail of the transcript. Loss of a poly(A) tail of a synthetic, modified RNA can result in increased RNA degradation. Thus, in one embodiment, a synthetic, modified RNA as described herein does not comprise an AU-rich region. In particular, it is preferred that the 3\u2032 UTR substantially lacks AUUUA sequence elements.","In one embodiment, a ligand alters the cellular uptake, intracellular targeting or half-life of a synthetic, modified RNA into which it is incorporated. In some embodiments a ligand provides an enhanced affinity for a selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, intracellular compartment, e.g., mitochondria, cytoplasm, peroxisome, lysosome, as, e.g., compared to a composition absent such a ligand. Preferred ligands do not interfere with expression of a polypeptide from the synthetic, modified RNA.","Ligands can include a naturally occurring substance, such as a protein (e.g., human serum albumin (HSA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or globulin); carbohydrate (e.g., a dextran, pullulan, chitin, chitosan, inulin, cyclodextrin or hyaluronic acid); or a lipid. The ligand can also be a recombinant or synthetic molecule, such as a synthetic polymer, e.g., a synthetic polyamino acid. Examples of polyamino acids include polylysine (PLL), poly L aspartic acid, poly L-glutamic acid, styrene-maleic acid anhydride copolymer, poly(L-lactide-co-glycolied) copolymer, divinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer (HMPA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyurethane, poly(2-ethylacryllic acid), N-isopropylacrylamide polymers, or polyphosphazine. Example of polyamines include: polyethylenimine, polylysine (PLL), spermine, spermidine, polyamine, pseudopeptide-polyamine, peptidomimetic polyamine, dendrimer polyamine, arginine, amidine, protamine, cationic lipid, cationic porphyrin, quaternary salt of a polyamine, or an alpha helical peptide.","Ligands can also include targeting groups, e.g., a cell targeting agent, (e.g., a lectin, glycoprotein, lipid or protein), or an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a fibroblast cell. A targeting group can be, for example, a thyrotropin, melanotropin, lectin, glycoprotein, surfactant protein A, Mucin carbohydrate, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine multivalent mannose, multivalent fucose, glycosylated polyaminoacids, multivalent galactose, transferrin, bisphosphonate, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, a lipid, cholesterol, a steroid, bile acid, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, or an RGD peptide or RGD peptide mimetic, among others.","Other examples of ligands include dyes, intercalating agents (e.g. acridines), cross-linkers (e.g. psoralene, mitomycin C), porphyrins (TPPC4, texaphyrin, Sapphyrin), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., phenazine, dihydrophenazine), artificial endonucleases (e.g. EDTA), lipophilic molecules, e.g., cholesterol, cholic acid, adamantane acetic acid, 1-pyrene butyric acid, dihydrotestosterone, 1,3-Bis-O(hexadecyl)glycerol, geranyloxyhexyl group, hexadecylglycerol, borneol, menthol, 1,3-propanediol, heptadecyl group, palmitic acid, myristic acid, O3-(oleoyl)lithocholic acid, O3-(oleoyl)cholenic acid, dimethoxytrityl, or phenoxazine) and peptide conjugates (e.g., antennapedia peptide, Tat peptide), alkylating agents, amino, mercapto, PEG (e.g., PEG-40K), MPEG, [MPEG]2, polyamino, alkyl, substituted alkyl, radiolabeled markers, enzymes, haptens (e.g. biotin), and transport\/absorption facilitators (e.g., aspirin, vitamin E, folic acid).","Ligands can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a specific affinity for a co-ligand, or antibodies e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a fibroblast cell, or other cell useful in the production of polypeptides. Ligands can also include hormones and hormone receptors. They can also include non-peptidic species, such as lipids, lectins, carbohydrates, vitamins, cofactors, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine multivalent mannose, or multivalent fucose.","The ligand can be a substance, e.g., a drug, which can increase the uptake of the synthetic, modified RNA or a composition thereof into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by disrupting the cell's microtubules, microfilaments, and\/or intermediate filaments. The drug can be, for example, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, cytochalasin, nocodazole, japlakinolide, latrunculin A, phalloidin, swinholide A, indanocine, or myoservin.","One exemplary ligand is a lipid or lipid-based molecule. A lipid or lipid-based ligand can (a) increase resistance to degradation, and\/or (b) increase targeting or transport into a target cell or cell membrane. A lipid based ligand can be used to modulate, e.g., binding of the modified RNA composition to a target cell.","In another aspect, the ligand is a moiety, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a host cell. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other exemplary vitamins include B vitamin, e.g., folic acid, B12, riboflavin, biotin, pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up, for example, by cancer cells. Also included are HSA and low density lipoprotein (LDL).","In another aspect, the ligand is a cell-permeation agent, preferably a helical cell-permeation agent. Preferably, the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a peptidylmimetic, invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of D-amino acids. The helical agent is preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.","A \u201ccell permeation peptide\u201d is capable of permeating a cell, e.g., a microbial cell, such as a bacterial or fungal cell, or a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. A microbial cell-permeating peptide can be, for example, an \u03b1-helical linear peptide (e.g., LL-37 or Ceropin P1), a disulfide bond-containing peptide (e.g., \u03b1-defensin, \u03b2-defensin or bactenecin), or a peptide containing only one or two dominating amino acids (e.g., PR-39 or indolicidin). For example, a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite amphipathic peptide, such as MPG, which is derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV-1 gp41 and the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (Simeoni et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31:2717-2724, 2003).","Synthesis of Synthetic, Modified RNAs","The synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can be synthesized and\/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in \u201cCurrent Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry,\u201d Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Transcription methods are described further herein in the Examples.","In one embodiment of the aspects described herein, a template for a synthetic, modified RNA is synthesized using \u201csplint-mediated ligation,\u201d which allows for the rapid synthesis of DNA constructs by controlled concatenation of long oligos and\/or dsDNA PCR products and without the need to introduce restriction sites at the joining regions. It can be used to add generic untranslated regions (UTRs) to the coding sequences of genes during T7 template generation. Splint mediated ligation can also be used to add nuclear localization sequences to an open reading frame, and to make dominant-negative constructs with point mutations starting from a wild-type open reading frame. Briefly, single-stranded and\/or denatured dsDNA components are annealed to splint oligos which bring the desired ends into conjunction, the ends are ligated by a thermostable DNA ligase and the desired constructs amplified by PCR. A synthetic, modified RNA is then synthesized from the template using an RNA polymerase in vitro. After synthesis of a synthetic, modified RNA is complete, the DNA template is removed from the transcription reaction prior to use with the methods described herein.","In some embodiments of these aspects, the synthetic, modified RNAs are further treated with an alkaline phosphatase.","Plurality of Synthetic, Modified RNAs","In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, a plurality of different synthetic, modified RNAs are contacted with, or introduced to, a cell, population of cells, or cell culture and permit expression of at least two polypeptide products in the cell. In some embodiments, synthetic, modified RNA compositions comprise two or more synthetic, modified RNAs, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more synthetic, modified RNAs. In some embodiments, the two or more synthetic, modified RNAs are capable of increasing expression of a desired polypeptide product (e.g., a transcription factor, a cell surface marker, a death receptor, etc.).","In some embodiments, when a plurality of different synthetic, modified RNAs, synthetic, modified RNA compositions, or media comprising a plurality of different synthetic, modified RNAs are used to modulate expression of a desired set of polypeptides, the plurality of synthetic, modified RNAs can be contacted with, or introduced to, a cell, population of cells, or cell culture simultaneously. In other embodiments, the plurality of synthetic, modified RNAs can be contacted with, or introduced to, a cell, population of cells, or cell culture separately. In addition, each synthetic, modified RNA can be administered according to its own dosage regime. For example, in one embodiment, a composition can be prepared comprising a plurality of synthetic, modified RNAs, in differing relative amounts or in equal amounts, that is contacted with a cell such that the plurality of synthetic, modified RNAs are administered simultaneously. Alternatively, one synthetic, modified RNA at a time can be administered to a cell culture (e.g., sequentially). In this manner, the expression desired for each target polypeptide can be easily tailored by altering the frequency of administration and\/or the amount of a particular synthetic, modified RNA administered. Contacting a cell with each synthetic, modified RNA separately can also prevent interactions between the synthetic, modified RNAs that can reduce efficiency of expression. For ease of use and to prevent potential contamination, it is preferred to administer to or contact a cell, population of cells, or cell culture with a cocktail of different synthetic, modified RNAs, thereby reducing the number of doses required and minimizing the chance of introducing a contaminant to the cell, population of cells, or cell culture.","The methods and compositions described herein permit the expression of one or more polypeptides to be tuned to a desired level by varying the amount of each synthetic, modified RNA transfected. One of skill in the art can easily monitor the expression level of the polypeptide encoded by a synthetic, modified RNA using e.g., Western blotting techniques or immunocytochemistry techniques. A synthetic, modified RNA can be administered at a frequency and dose that permit a desired level of expression of the polypeptide. Each different synthetic, modified RNA can be administered at its own dose and frequency to permit appropriate expression. In addition, since the synthetic, modified RNAs administered to the cell are transient in nature (i.e., are degraded over time) one of skill in the art can easily remove or stop expression of a synthetic, modified RNA by halting further transfections and permitting the cell to degrade the synthetic, modified RNA over time. The synthetic, modified RNAs will degrade in a manner similar to cellular mRNAs.","Introducing a Synthetic, Modified RNA into a Cell","A synthetic, modified RNA can be introduced into a cell in any manner that achieves intracellular delivery of the synthetic, modified RNA, such that expression of the polypeptide encoded by the synthetic, modified RNA can occur. As used herein, the term \u201ctransfecting a cell\u201d refers to the process of introducing nucleic acids into cells using means for facilitating or effecting uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. As the term is used herein, \u201ctransfection\u201d does not encompass viral- or viral particle based delivery methods. Absorption or uptake of a synthetic, modified RNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. Further approaches are described herein below or known in the art.","A synthetic, modified RNA can be introduced into a target cell, for example, by transfection, nucleofection, lipofection, electroporation (see, e.g., Wong and Neumann, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 107:584-87 (1982)), microinjection (e.g., by direct injection of a synthetic, modified RNA), biolistics, cell fusion, and the like. In an alternative embodiment, a synthetic, modified RNA can be delivered using a drug delivery system such as a nanoparticle, a dendrimer, a polymer, a liposome, or a cationic delivery system. Positively charged cationic delivery systems facilitate binding of a synthetic, modified RNA (negatively charged polynucleotides) and also enhances interactions at the negatively charged cell membrane to permit efficient cellular uptake. Cationic lipids, dendrimers, or polymers can either be bound to modified RNAs, or induced to form a vesicle or micelle (see e.g., Kim S H., et al (2008) Journal of Controlled Release 129(2):107-116) that encases the modified RNA. Methods for making and using cationic-modified RNA complexes are well within the abilities of those skilled in the art (see e.g., Sorensen, D R., et al (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 327:761-766; Verma, UN., et al (2003) Clin. Cancer Res. 9:1291-1300; Arnold, A S et al (2007) J. Hypertens. 25:197-205, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).","In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the composition further comprises a reagent that facilitates uptake of a synthetic, modified RNA into a cell (transfection reagent), such as an emulsion, a liposome, a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, an anionic lipid, a charged lipid, a penetration enhancer or alternatively, a modification to the synthetic, modified RNA to attach e.g., a ligand, peptide, lipophillic group, or targeting moiety.","The process for delivery of a synthetic, modified RNA to a cell will necessarily depend upon the specific approach for transfection chosen. One preferred approach is to add the RNA, complexed with a cationic transfection reagent (see below) directly to the cell culture media for the cells.","It is also contemplated herein that a first and second synthetic, modified RNA are administered in a separate and temporally distinct manner. Thus, each of a plurality of synthetic, modified RNAs can be administered at a separate time or at a different frequency interval to achieve the desired expression of a polypeptide. Typically, 100 fg to 100 pg of a synthetic, modified RNA is administered per cell using cationic lipid-mediated transfection. Since cationic lipid-mediated transfection is highly inefficient at delivering synthetic, modified RNAs to the cytosol, other techniques can require less RNA. The entire transcriptome of a mammalian cell constitutes about 1 pg of mRNA, and a polypeptide (e.g., a transcription factor) can have a physiological effect at an abundance of less than 1 fg per cell.","Transfection Reagents","In certain embodiments of the aspects described herein, a synthetic, modified RNA can be introduced into target cells by transfection or lipofection. Suitable agents for transfection or lipofection include, for example, calcium phosphate, DEAE dextran, lipofectin, lipofectamine, DIMRIE C\u2122, Superfect\u2122, and Effectin\u2122 (Qiagen\u2122), Unifectin\u2122, Maxifectin\u2122, DOTMA, DOGS\u2122 (Transfectam; dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine), DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane), DDAB (dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide), DHDEAB (N,N-di-n-hexadecyl-N,N-dihydroxyethyl ammonium bromide), HDEAB (N-n-hexadecyl-N,N-dihydroxyethylammonium bromide), polybrene, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), and the like. (See, e.g., Banerjee et al., Med. Chem. 42:4292-99 (1999); Godbey et al., Gene Ther. 6:1380-88 (1999); Kichler et al., Gene Ther. 5:855-60 (1998); Birchaa et al., J. Pharm. 183:195-207 (1999)).","A synthetic, modified RNA can be transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers (e.g., Oligofectamine\u2122) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g., Transit-TKOTM\u2122, Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, Wis.). Successful introduction of a modified RNA into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient transfection can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Successful transfection of a modified RNA can also be determined by measuring the protein expression level of the target polypeptide by e.g., Western Blotting or immunocytochemistry.","In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the synthetic, modified RNA is introduced into a cell using a transfection reagent. Some exemplary transfection reagents include, for example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al., PCT Application WO 97\/30731). Examples of commercially available transfection reagents include, for example Lipofectamine\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), Lipofectamine 2000\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), 293Fectin\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), Cellfectin\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), DMRIE-C\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), FreeStyle\u2122 MAX (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 CD (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), Lipofectamine\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), RNAiMAX (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), Oligofectamine\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), Optifect\u2122 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), X-tremeGENE Q2 Transfection Reagent (Roche; Grenzacherstrasse, Switzerland), DOTAP Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Grenzacherstrasse, Switzerland), DOSPER Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Grenzacherstrasse, Switzerland), or Fugene (Grenzacherstrasse, Switzerland), Transfectam\u00ae Reagent (Promega; Madison, Wis.), TransFast\u2122 Transfection Reagent (Promega; Madison, Wis.), Tfx\u2122-20 Reagent (Promega; Madison, Wis.), Tfx\u2122-50 Reagent (Promega; Madison, Wis.), DreamFect\u2122 (OZ Biosciences; Marseille, France), EcoTransfect (OZ Biosciences; Marseille, France), TransPassD1 Transfection Reagent (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, Mass., USA), LyoVec\u2122\/LipoGen\u2122 (Invitrogen; San Diego, Calif., USA), PerFectin Transfection Reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), NeuroPORTER Transfection Reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), GenePORTER Transfection reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), GenePORTER 2 Transfection reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), Cytofectin Transfection Reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), BaculoPORTER Transfection Reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), TroganPORTER\u2122 transfection Reagent (Genlantis; San Diego, Calif., USA), RiboFect (Bioline; Taunton, Mass., USA), PlasFect (Bioline; Taunton, Mass., USA), UniFECTOR (B-Bridge International; Mountain View, Calif., USA), SureFECTOR (B-Bridge International; Mountain View, Calif., USA), or HiFect\u2122 (B-Bridge International, Mountain View, Calif., USA), among others.","In other embodiments, highly branched organic compounds, termed \u201cdendrimers,\u201d can be used to bind the exogenous nucleic acid, such as the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, and introduce it into the cell.","In other embodiments of the aspects described herein, non-chemical methods of transfection are contemplated. Such methods include, but are not limited to, electroporation (methods whereby an instrument is used to create micro-sized holes transiently in the plasma membrane of cells under an electric discharge), sono-poration (transfection via the application of sonic forces to cells), and optical transfection (methods whereby a tiny (\u02dc1 \u03bcm diameter) hole is transiently generated in the plasma membrane of a cell using a highly focused laser). In other embodiments, particle-based methods of transfections are contemplated, such as the use of a gene gun, whereby the nucleic acid is coupled to a nanoparticle of an inert solid (commonly gold) which is then \u201cshot\u201d directly into the target cell's nucleus; \u201cmagnetofection,\u201d which refers to a transfection method, that uses magnetic force to deliver exogenous nucleic acids coupled to magnetic nanoparticles into target cells; \u201cimpalefection,\u201d which is carried out by impaling cells by elongated nanostructures, such as carbon nanofibers or silicon nanowires which have been coupled to exogenous nucleic acids.","Other agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids, including glycols, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones, and terpenes, such as limonene and menthone.","Synthetic, Modified RNA Compositions","In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, particularly embodiments involving in vivo administration of synthetic, modified RNAs or compositions thereof, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein are formulated in conjunction with one or more penetration enhancers, surfactants and\/or chelators. Suitable surfactants include fatty acids and\/or esters or salts thereof, bile acids and\/or salts thereof. Suitable bile acids\/salts include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxychenodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, glucholic acid, glycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate and sodium glycodihydrofusidate. Suitable fatty acids include arachidonic acid, undecanoic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a monoglyceride, a diglyceride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., sodium). In some embodiments, combinations of penetration enhancers are used, for example, fatty acids\/salts in combination with bile acids\/salts. One exemplary combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid, capric acid and UDCA. Further penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether.","The compositions described herein can be formulated into any of many possible administration forms, including a sustained release form. In some preferred embodiments of the aspects described herein, formulations comprising a plurality of different synthetic, modified RNAs are prepared by first mixing all members of a plurality of different synthetic, modified RNAs, and then complexing the mixture comprising the plurality of different synthetic, modified RNAs with a desired ligand or targeting moiety, such as a lipid. The compositions can be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions can further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and\/or dextran. The suspension can also contain stabilizers.","The compositions described herein can be prepared and formulated as emulsions for the delivery of synthetic, modified RNAs. Emulsions are typically heterogeneous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 \u03bcm in diameter (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Volume 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions can be of either the water-in-oil (w\/o) or the oil-in-water (o\/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase, the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w\/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o\/w) emulsion. Emulsions can contain further components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug (i.e., synthetic, modified RNA) which can be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants can also be present in emulsions as needed. Emulsions can also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o\/w\/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w\/o\/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o\/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w\/o\/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o\/w\/o emulsion. Emulsifiers can broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).","Naturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w\/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.","A large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).","Hydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.","As noted above, liposomes can optionally be prepared to contain surface groups to facilitate delivery of liposomes and their contents to specific cell populations. For example, a liposome can comprise a surface groups such as antibodies or antibody fragments, small effector molecules for interacting with cell-surface receptors, antigens, and other like compounds.","Surface groups can be incorporated into the liposome by including in the liposomal lipids a lipid derivatized with the targeting molecule, or a lipid having a polar-head chemical group that can be derivatized with the targeting molecule in preformed liposomes. Alternatively, a targeting moiety can be inserted into preformed liposomes by incubating the preformed liposomes with a ligand-polymer-lipid conjugate.","A number of liposomes comprising nucleic acids are known in the art. WO 96\/40062 (Thierry et al.) discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,221 (Tagawa et al.) discloses protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes can include an RNA molecule. U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,710 (Rahman et al.) describes certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. WO 97\/04787 (Love et al.) discloses liposomes comprising RNAi molecules targeted to the raf gene. In addition, methods for preparing a liposome composition comprising a nucleic acid can be found in e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,011,020; 6,074,667; 6,110,490; 6,147,204; 6, 271, 206; 6,312,956; 6,465,188; 6,506,564; 6,750,016; and 7,112,337. Each of these approaches can provide delivery of a synthetic, modified RNA as described herein to a cell.","In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the synthetic, modified RNA described herein can be encapsulated in a nanoparticle. Methods for nanoparticle packaging are well known in the art, and are described, for example, in Bose S, et al (Role of Nucleolin in Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 Infection of Human Lung Epithelial Cells.

The decrease in cytotoxicity stems, in part, from the presence of modified nucleoside(s) in the RNA, which reduce or prevent the development of a cellular interferon response. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the cellular innate immune or interferon response comprises expression of a Type I or Type II interferon. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the cellular innate immune response comprises expression of one or more IFN signature genes selected from the group consisting of IFN\u03b1, IFNB1, IFIT, OAS1, PKR, RIGI, CCL5, RAP1A, CXCL10, IFIT1, CXCL11, MX1, RP11-167P23.2, HERC5, GALR3, IFIT3, IFIT2, RSAD2, and CDC20. As noted herein, such modifications for reducing or preventing the cellular innate response include, but are not limited to, 5-methylcytidine (5mC), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 3,2\u2032-O-dimethyluridine (m4U), 2-thiouridine (s2U), 2\u2032 fluorouridine, pseudouridine, 2\u2032-O-methyluridine (Um), 2\u2032 deoxyuridine (2\u2032 dU), 4-thiouridine (s4U), 5-methyluridine (m5U), 2\u2032-O-methyladenosine (m6A), N6,2\u2032-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), N6,N6,2\u2032-O-trimethyladenosine (m6Am), 2\u2032-O-methylcytidine (Cm), 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 2\u2032-O-methylguanosine (Gm), N2,7-dimethylguanosine (m-2,7G), N2, N2,7-trimethylguanosine (m-2,2,7G), and inosine (I). In some preferred embodiments, the modifications comprise 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine.","However, the cells transfected with the synthetic, modified RNA compositions described herein can further be treated or used with other measures to prevent or reduce any remaining cytotoxicity caused by the transfection procedure, the synthetic, modified RNAs, or a combination thereof. The cytotoxicity of synthetic, unmodified RNAs involves a cellular innate immune response designed to recognize a foreign pathogen (e.g., virus) and to produce interferons, which in turn stimulates the activity of the protein kinase PKR, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-1, among others, to mediate anti-viral actions. A significant part of an individual cell's innate immune response to foreign RNA is represented by the so-called \u201cPKR response\u201d triggered largely by double-stranded RNA. To the extent that all or part of the PKR response pathway can be activated by foreign single-stranded RNA, such as synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, the response is discussed herein below.","Double stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a member of a family of kinases that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of protein synthesis initiation factor, eIF-2 (eIF-2\u03b1) and plays a role in the translational down regulation of gene expression (Clemens et al. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; vol. 19: 210-10). Activation of PKR involves two molecules binding in tandem to double stranded RNA and then phosphorylating each other in an intramolecular event. (Wu et al. 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:1291-1296). PKR has been implicated in processes that rely on apoptosis as control mechanisms in vivo including antiviral activities, cell growth regulation and tumorigenesis (Donze et al. EMBO J. 1995, vol. 14: 3828-34; Lee et al. Virology 1994, vol. 199: 491-6; Jagus et al. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1989, vol. 9: 1576-86). Regulation of protein synthesis through activated PKR arises from the interaction of PKR with foreign RNA.","It has been shown that the PKR response can be reduced by removing the 5\u2032-triphosphate on an RNA molecule, and that RNAs having a 5\u2032-monophosphate, -diphosphate or -7-methyl guanosine cap do not activate PKR. Thus, in one embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA described herein comprises a 5\u2032-monophosphate, a 5\u2032-diphosphate, or a 5\u2032 7-methyl guanosine cap to escape the immune response initiated by PKR. In another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA as described herein is treated to remove the 5\u2032-triphosphate using an alkaline phosphatase, e.g., calf intestinal phosphatase. Other modifications to prevent activation of the immune response mediators (e.g., PKR, TLRs, and RIG-1) are discussed in detail in Nallagatla, S R, et al., (2008) 5(3):140-144, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","TLR7 is known to recognize single stranded RNA and binds exogenous RNAs, such as viral single-stranded RNAs in endosomes. Modifications to the RNA that reduce recognition and\/or signaling by TLR7 can reduce this aspect of the innate immune response to the RNA. TLR7 signals through MyD88 and can activate a type I IFN pathway as well as an NF-\u03baB\/IL-8 pathway.","In one embodiment, the innate immune response or interferon response can be further decreased in cells transfected with a synthetic, modified RNA as described herein by co-transfection of a dominant negative mutant of a protein involved in the immunity pathways, such as RIG-1, MYD88, VISA, PKR and Toll-like receptors. Alternatively, RNA interference (e.g., siRNA, shRNA, etc.) can be used to inhibit expression of RIG-1, MYD88, VISA, PKR, TRIF, TRL7, or TLR8, which will result in a lower innate immune mediated response in the cells.","Another approach to reduce the innate immune mediated response is to inhibit the effect of secreted interferon on cellular receptors, for example, by scavenging secreted interferon using a soluble interferon receptor (e.g., B18R) or a neutralizing antibody. In one embodiment, a modified RNA encoding an interferon scavenging agent (e.g., a soluble interferon receptor) can be administered to cells to further reduce the innate immune response of the cells.","In one embodiment, the cells transfected with synthetic, modified RNA as described herein can be grown with genetically-engineered feeder cells that secrete B18R or neutralizing antibodies to type-1 interferons.","Small molecules that inhibit the innate immune response in cells, such as chloroquine (a TLR signaling inhibitor) and 2-aminopurine (a PKR inhibitor), can also be administered into the culture media of cells transfected with the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein. Some non-limiting examples of commercially available TLR-signaling inhibitors include BX795, chloroquine, CLI-095, OxPAPC, polymyxin B, and rapamycin (all available for purchase from INVIVOGEN\u2122). In addition, inhibitors of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (which are involved in innate immunity signaling) such as 2-aminopurine, BX795, chloroquine, and H-89, can also be used in the compositions and methods described herein. Media supplementation with cell-penetrating peptides that inhibit proteins in the immunity pathways described above can also be combined with the use of synthetic, modified RNAs provided herein. Some non-limiting examples of commercially available cell-penetrating peptides include Pepin-MYD (INVIVOGEN\u2122) or Pepinh-TRIF (INVIVOGEN\u2122). An oligodeoxynucleotide antagonist for the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway can also be added to the cell culture media to reduce immunity signaling.","Another method for reducing the immune response of a cell transfected with the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein is to co-transfect mRNAs that encode negative regulators of innate immunity such as NLRX1. Alternatively, one can co-transfect viral proteins known to modulate host cell defenses such as NS1, NS3\/4A, or A46R.","In another embodiment, a synthetic, modified RNA composition encoding inhibitors of the innate immune system can be used to avoid the innate immune response generated in the cell.","It is also contemplated herein that, in some embodiments, in a research setting one of skill in the art can avoid the innate immune response generated in the cell by using cells genetically deficient in antiviral pathways (e.g., VISA knockout cells).","Since induction of the innate immune response results in cytokine release and death of the cells in culture, one can determine the extent of activation of an innate immune or interferon response by measuring e.g., apoptosis (using e.g., a TUNEL assay), reduced growth rate, reduced cellularity, reduction in global protein production, or secretion of cytokines (e.g., type-I interferons such as IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, type II interferons, such as IFN\u03b3), or upregulation of interferon stimulated genes or interferon signature genes (e.g., IFN\u03b1, IFNB1, IFIT, OAS1, PKR, RIGI, CCL5, RAP1A, CXCL10, IFIT1, CXCL11, MX1, RP11-167P23.2, HERC5, GALR3, IFIT3, IFIT2, RSAD2, and CDC20. The level of cytokine release or cell death in a transfected cell culture treated with one of the above measures described for further reducing the innate immune response can be compared to the level of an equivalent cell culture not treated to further reduce the innate immune response.","Cell Types","Provided herein are cells contacted with a synthetic, modified RNA molecule encoding a polypeptide, or a progeny cell of the contacted cell, where the synthetic, modified RNA molecule comprises one or more modifications, such that introducing the synthetic, modified RNA molecule to the cell results in a reduced innate immune response relative to the cell contacted with a synthetic RNA molecule encoding the polypeptide not comprising the one or more modifications. In some embodiments of these aspects, at least two nucleosides are modified. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the cellular innate immune or interferon response comprises expression of a Type I or Type II interferon. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the cellular innate immune response comprises expression of one or more IFN signature genes selected from the group consisting of IFN\u03b1, IFNB1, IFIT, OAS1, PKR, RIGI, CCL5, RAP1A, CXCL10, IFIT1, CXCL11, MX1, RP11-167P23.2, HERC5, GALR3, IFIT3, IFIT2, RSAD2, and CDC20. As described herein, such modifications for reducing or preventing the cellular innate immune response include, but are not limited to, 5-methylcytidine (5mC), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 3,2\u2032-O-dimethyluridine (m4U), 2-thiouridine (s2U), 2\u2032 fluorouridine, pseudouridine, 2\u2032-O-methyluridine (Um), 2\u2032 deoxyuridine (2\u2032 dU), 4-thiouridine (s4U), 5-methyluridine (m5U), 2\u2032-O-methyladenosine (m6A), N6,2\u2032-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), N6,N6,2\u2032-O-trimethyladenosine (m6Am), 2\u2032-O-methylcytidine (Cm), 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 2\u2032-O-methylguanosine (Gm), N2,7-dimethylguanosine (m-2,7G), N2, N2,7-trimethylguanosine (m-2,2,7G), and inosine (I). In some preferred embodiments, the modifications comprise 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine.","Essentially any cell type can be transfected with synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein to alter the phenotype of the cell. Thus, differentiated somatic cells and stem cells, as well of cells of a cell line, can be transfected with synthetic, modified RNA as described herein. Provided herein are exemplary somatic cells, stem cells, and cell line sources useful with the methods and compositions described herein. However, the description herein is not meant to be limiting and any cell known or used in the art can be phenotypically modified by introducing one or more synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein. In embodiments relating to tissue regeneration or transplantation in a subject, the cells can be from an autologous, i.e., from the same subject, or from heterologous sources.","Somatic Cells","Essentially any primary somatic cell type can be used in the preparation of cells with an altered phenotype or altered developmental potential described herein. Some non-limiting examples of primary cells include, but are not limited to, fibroblast, epithelial, endothelial, neuronal, adipose, cardiac, skeletal muscle, immune cells, hepatic, splenic, lung, circulating blood cells, gastrointestinal, renal, bone marrow, and pancreatic cells. The cell can be a primary cell isolated from any somatic tissue including, but not limited to, brain, liver, lung, gut, stomach, intestine, fat, muscle, uterus, skin, spleen, endocrine organ, bone, etc. The term \u201csomatic cell\u201d further encompasses primary cells grown in culture, provided that the somatic cells are not immortalized.","Where the cell is maintained under in vitro conditions, conventional tissue culture conditions and methods can be used, and are known to those of skill in the art. Isolation and culture methods for various cells are well within the abilities of one skilled in the art.","Further, the parental cell can be from any mammalian species, with non-limiting examples including a murine, bovine, simian, porcine, equine, ovine, or human cell. In some embodiments, the cell is a human cell. In an alternate embodiment, the cell is from a non-human organism such as a non-human mammal.","Stem Cells","One of the most intriguing aspects of the technologies comprising the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein is the ability to use such synthetic, modified RNAs to both generate a stem cell from a differentiated cell, and to then direct the differentiation of the stem cell to one or more desired cell types.","Stem cells are undifferentiated cells defined by their ability at the single cell level to both self-renew and differentiate to produce progeny cells, including self-renewing progenitors, non-renewing progenitors, and terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells, depending on their level of differentiation, are also characterized by their ability to differentiate in vitro into functional cells of various cell lineages from multiple germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm), as well as to give rise to tissues of multiple germ layers following transplantation and to contribute substantially to most, if not all, tissues following injection into blastocysts. (See, e.g., Potten et al., Development 110: 1001 (1990); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,376, 5,851,832, 5,753,506, 5,589,376, 5,824,489, 5,654,183, 5,693,482, 5,672,499, and 5,849,553, all herein incorporated in their entireties by reference). The stem cells for use with the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can be naturally occurring stem cells or \u201cinduced\u201d stem cells generated using the compositions, kits, and methods described herein, or by any method or composition known to one of skill in the art.","It is specifically noted that stem cells are useful not only for exploiting their differentiation potential to make desired cells, but also as a source for high quality iPS cells. That is, a non-pluripotent stem cell can be the starting point for the generation of high quality iPS cells by transfecting the non-pluripotent stem cell with one or more synthetic, modified RNAs encoding reprogramming factors, as described herein.","Stem cells are classified by their developmental potential as: (1) totipotent, meaning able to give rise to all embryonic and extraembryonic cell types; (2) pluripotent, meaning able to give rise to all embryonic cell types; (3) multipotent, meaning able to give rise to a subset of cell lineages, but all within a particular tissue, organ, or physiological system (for example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can produce progeny that include HSC (self-renewal), blood cell restricted oligopotent progenitors and the cell types and elements (e.g., platelets) that are normal components of the blood); (4) oligopotent, meaning able to give rise to a more restricted subset of cell lineages than multipotent stem cells; and (5) unipotent, meaning able to give rise to a single cell lineage (e.g., spermatogenic stem cells).","Transfection with synthetic, modified RNAs directing the reprogramming of somatic, differentiated cells to pluripotency is specifically demonstrated herein. However, as also demonstrated herein, transfection with synthetic, modified RNAs can also be used to drive the differentiation, i.e., decrease the developmental potential of stem cells other than iPS cells,","Stem cells of interest for producing cells with a desired phenotype or a reduced differentiation potential include embryonic cells of various types, exemplified by human embryonic stem (hES) cells, described by Thomson et al. (1998) Science 282:1145; embryonic stem cells from other primates, such as Rhesus stem cells (Thomson et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:7844); marmoset stem cells (Thomson et al. (1996) Biol. Reprod. 55:254); and human embryonic germ (hEG) cells (Shambloft et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:13726, 1998). Also of interest are lineage committed stem cells, such as hematopoietic or pancreatic stem cells. In some embodiments, the host cell transfected with synthetic, modified RNA is a multipotent stem cell or progenitor cell. Examples of multipotent cells useful in methods provided herein include, but are not limited to, murine embryonic stem (ES-D3) cells, human umbilical vein endothelial (HuVEC) cells, human umbilical artery smooth muscle (HuASMC) cells, human differentiated stem (HKB-II) cells, and human mesenchymal stem (hMSC) cells. An additional stem cell type of interest for use with the compositions and methods described herein are cancer stem cells.","Adult stem cells are generally limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. However, if the starting stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the embryo, they can generate many cell types of the body derived from all three embryonic cell types: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Stem cells with this property are said to be pluripotent. Embryonic stem cells are one kind of pluripotent stem cell. Thus, pluripotent embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into many specific cell types, and that differentiation can be driven by the expression of polypeptides from synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein. Since the embryo is a potential source of all types of precursor cells, it is possible to differentiate embryonic stem cells into other lineages by providing the appropriate signals, such as the expression of proteins from synthetic, modified RNAs, to embryonic stem cells. Somatic stem cells also have major advantages, for example, using somatic stem cells allows a patient's own cells to be expanded in culture and then re-introduced into the patient. In addition and importantly, iPS cells generated from a patient provide a source of cells that can be expanded and re-introduced to the patient, before or after stimulation to differentiate to a desired lineage or phenotype. It is also contemplated that the compositions, methods and kits comprising the synthetic, modified RNAs described can be used to alter the developmental potential of a cancer stem cell, and thus render that cancer cell non-cancerous.","Cells derived from embryonic sources can include embryonic stem cells or stem cell lines obtained from a stem cell bank or other recognized depository institution. Other means of producing stem cell lines include the method of Chung et al (2006) which comprises taking a blastomere cell from an early stage embryo prior to formation of the blastocyst (at around the 8-cell stage). The technique corresponds to the pre-implantation genetic diagnosis technique routinely practiced in assisted reproduction clinics. The single blastomere cell is then co-cultured with established ES-cell lines and then separated from them to form fully competent ES cell lines.","Cells can also be derived from human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC), which are recognized as a rich source of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells (Broxmeyer et al., 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4109-4113). Cord blood cells are used as a source of transplantable stem and progenitor cells and as a source of marrow repopulating cells for the treatment of malignant diseases (e.g. acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and nueroblastoma) and non-malignant diseases such as Fanconi's anemia and aplastic anemia (Kohli-Kumar et al., 1993 Br. J. Haematol. 85:419-422; Wagner et al., 1992 Blood 79; 1874-1881; Lu et al., 1996 Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol 22:61-78; Lu et al., 1995 Cell Transplantation 4:493-503). One advantage of HUCBC for use with the methods and compositions described herein is the immature immunity of these cells, which is very similar to fetal cells, and thus significantly reduces the risk for rejection by the host (Taylor & Bryson, 1985 J. Immunol. 134:1493-1497).","In other embodiments of the aspects described herein, cancer stem cells are used with the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, in order to, for example, differentiate or alter the phenotype of a cancer stem cell to a non-tumorigenic state. It has been recently discovered that stem-like cells are present in some human tumors and, while representing a small minority of the total cellular mass of the tumor, are the subpopulation of tumor cells responsible for growth of the tumor. In contrast to normal stem cells, \u201ctumor stem cells\u201d or \u201ccancer stem cells\u201d are defined as cells that can undergo self-renewal, as well as abnormal proliferation and differentiation to form a tumor. Functional features of tumor stem cells are that they are tumorigenic; they can give rise to additional tumorigenic cells by self-renewal; and they can give rise to non-tumorigenic tumor cells. As used herein, particularly in reference to an isolated cell or isolated cell population, the term \u201ctumorigenic\u201d refers to a cell derived from a tumor that is capable of forming a tumor, when dissociated and transplanted into a suitable animal model such as an immunocompromised mouse. The developmental origin of tumor stem cells can vary among different types of cancers. It is believed, without wishing to be bound or limited by theory, that tumor stem cells may arise either as a result of genetic damage that deregulates normal mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of stem cells (Lapidot et al., Nature 367(6464): 645-8 (1994)), or by the dysregulated proliferation of populations of cells that acquire stem-like properties.","Tumors contain a distinct subset of cells that share the properties of normal stem cells, in that they proliferate extensively or indefinitely and that they efficiently give rise to additional solid tumor stem cells. Within an established tumor, most cells may have lost the ability to proliferate extensively and form new tumors, while tumor stem cells proliferate extensively and give rise to additional tumor stem cells as well as to other tumor cells that lack tumorigenic potential. An additional trait of tumor stem cells is their resistance to therapeutics, such as chemotherapy. It is the small fraction of tumor stem cells and their immediate daughter cell population that proliferates and ultimately proves fatal.","Examples of tumors from which samples containing cancer stem cells can be isolated from or enriched, for use with the compositions and methods described herein, include sarcomas and carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, astrocytic tumors (e.g., diffuse, infiltrating gliomas, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma), oligodendroglial tumors and mixed gliomas (e.g., oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma), ependymal tumors (e.g., ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, subependymoma), choroid plexus tumors, neuroepithelial tumors of uncertain origin (astroblastoma, chordoid glioma, gliomatosis cerebri), neuronal and mixed-neuronal-glial tumors (e.g., ganglioglioma and gangliocytoma, desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, central neurocytoma, cerebellar liponeurocytoma, paraganglioglioma), pineal parenchymal tumors, embryonal tumors (medulloepithelioma, ependymoblastoma, medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodemmal tumor, atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor), peripheral neuroblastic tumors, tumors of cranial and peripheral nerves (e.g., schwannoma, neurinofibroma, perineurioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor), meningeal tumors (e.g., meningeomas, mesenchymal, non-meningothelial tumors, haemangiopericytomas, melanocytic lesions), germ cell tumors, tumors of the sellar region (e.g., craniopharyngioma, granular cell tumor of the neurohypophysis), hemangioblastoma, melanoma, and retinoblastoma. Additionally, the stem cell isolation methods of the invention are applicable to isolating stem cells from tissues other than characterized tumors (e.g., from tissues of diseases such as the so called \u201cstem cell pathologies\u201d).","Stem cells may be obtained from any mammalian species, e.g. human, primate, equine, bovine, porcine, canine, feline, rodent, e.g. mice, rats, hamster, etc. Embryonic stem cells are considered to be undifferentiated when they have not committed to a specific differentiation lineage. Such cells display morphological characteristics that distinguish them from differentiated cells of embryo or adult origin. Undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells are easily recognized by those skilled in the art, and typically appear in the two dimensions of a microscopic view in colonies of cells with high nuclear\/cytoplasmic ratios and prominent nucleoli.","In some embodiments, the stem cell is isolated. Most conventional methods to isolate a particular stem cell of interest involve positive and negative selection using markers of interest. For example, agents can be used to recognize stem cell markers, for instance labeled antibodies that recognize and bind to cell-surface markers or antigens on desired stem cells can be used to separate and isolate the desired stem cells using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), panning methods, magnetic particle selection, particle sorter selection and other methods known to persons skilled in the art, including density separation (Xu et al. (2002) Circ. Res. 91:501; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 20030022367) and separation based on other physical properties (Doevendans et al. (2000) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 32:839-851).","In those embodiments involving cancer stem cells, cancer stem cells can be identified using cell surface markers that also identify normal stem cells in the tissue of origin. As a non-limiting example, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) express the CD34 surface marker and lack the CD38 surface antigen, as is the case for normal (i.e., non-leukemic) hematopoietic stem cells (Bonnet and Dick, 1997). Cancer stem cells identified by cell surface marker expression can be purified by methods known to one of skill in the art, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Methods of isolating cancer stem cells can be found in United States Patent Application 20100003265, the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.","Alternatively, genetic selection methods for isolating stem cells can be used, where a stem cell can be genetically engineered to express a reporter protein operatively linked to a tissue-specific promoter and\/or a specific gene promoter, therefore the expression of the reporter can be used for positive selection methods to isolate and enrich the desired stem cell. For example, a fluorescent reporter protein can be expressed in the desired stem cell by genetic engineering methods to operatively link the marker protein to a promoter active in a desired stem cell (Klug et al. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 98:216-224; U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,054). Other means of positive selection include drug selection, for instance as described by Klug et al., supra, involving enrichment of desired cells by density gradient centrifugation. Negative selection can be performed, selecting and removing cells with undesired markers or characteristics, for example fibroblast markers, epithelial cell markers etc.","Undifferentiated ES cells express genes that can be used as markers to detect the presence of undifferentiated cells, and whose polypeptide products can be used as markers for negative selection. For example, see U.S. application Ser. No. 2003\/0224411 A1; Bhattacharya (2004) Blood 103(8):2956-64; and Thomson (1998), supra., each herein incorporated by reference. Human ES cell lines express cell surface markers that characterize undifferentiated nonhuman primate ES and human EC cells, including stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and alkaline phosphatase. The globo-series glycolipid GL7, which carries the SSEA-4 epitope, is formed by the addition of sialic acid to the globo-series glycolipid Gb5, which carries the SSEA-3 epitope. Thus, GL7 reacts with antibodies to both SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. Undifferentiated human ES cell lines do not stain for SSEA-1, but differentiated cells stain strongly for SSEA-1. Methods for proliferating hES cells in the undifferentiated form are described in WO 99\/20741, WO 01\/51616, and WO 03\/020920.","In some embodiments, the methods further provide for enrichment and isolation of stem cells. The stem cells are selected for a characteristic of interest. In some embodiments, a wide range of markers may be used for selection. One of skill in the art will be able to select markers appropriate for the desired cell type. The characteristics of interest include expression of particular markers of interest, for example specific subpopulations of stem cells and stem cell progenitors will express specific markers.","In some embodiments, the stem cells used with the compositions and methods described herein are expanded. The cells are optionally collected, separated, and further expanded generating larger populations of progenitor cells for use in making cells of a particular cell type or cells having a reduced differentiation potential.","Cell Lines","In some embodiments, the cells used with the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein are cells of a cell line. In one such embodiment, the host cell is a mammalian cell line. In one such embodiment, the mammalian cell line is a human cell line.","Examples of human cell lines useful in methods provided herein include, but are not limited to, 293T (embryonic kidney), BT-549 (breast), DMS 114 (small cell lung), DU145 (prostate), HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma), HEK 293 (embryonic kidney), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), HL-60(TB) (leukemia), HS 578T (breast), HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma), Jurkat (T lymphocyte), M14 (melanoma), MCF7 (mammary), MDA-MB-453 (mammary epithelial), PERC6\u00ae (E1-transformed embryonal retina), RXF 393 (renal), SF-268 (CNS), SF-295 (CNS), THP-1 (monocyte-derived macrophages), TK-10 (renal), U293 (kidney), UACC-257 (melanoma), and XF 498 (CNS).","Examples of rodent cell lines useful in methods provided herein include, but are not limited to, mouse Sertoli (TM4) cells, mouse mammary tumor (MMT) cells, rat hepatoma (HTC) cells, mouse myeloma (NS0) cells, murine hybridoma (Sp2\/0) cells, mouse thymoma (EL4) cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and CHO cell derivatives, murine embryonic (NIH\/3T3, 3T3 L1) cells, rat myocardial (H9c2) cells, mouse myoblast (C2C12) cells, and mouse kidney (miMCD-3) cells.","Examples of non-human primate cell lines useful in methods provided herein include, but are not limited to, monkey kidney (CVI-76) cells, African green monkey kidney (VERO-76) cells, green monkey fibroblast (Cos-1) cells, and monkey kidney (CVI) cells transformed by SV40 (Cos-7). Additional mammalian cell lines are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are catalogued at the American Type Culture Collection catalog (ATCC\u00ae, Mamassas, Va.).","Other Cell Types","While mammalian cells are preferred, in some embodiments, the host cell transfected with a modified RNA is a plant cell, such as a tobacco plant cell.","In some embodiments, the transfected cell is a fungal cell, such as a cell from , a cell, or a cell.","In some embodiments, the transfected cell is an insect cell, such as SF9 or SF-21 cells from or S2 cells from ","Cell Culture Methods","In general, cells useful with the methods described herein can be maintained and\/or expanded in a culture medium that is available to and well-known in the art. Such media include, but are not limited to, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium\u00ae (DMEM), DMEM F12 Medium\u00ae, Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium\u00ae, F-12K Medium\u00ae, Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium\u00ae, RPMI-1640 Medium\u00ae, and serum-free medium for culture and expansion of progenitor cells SFEM\u00ae. Many media are also available as low-glucose formulations, with or without sodium.","Cells can be cultured in low-serum or serum-free \u201cdefined\u201d culture medium. Serum-free medium used to culture cells is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,015,037. Many cells have been grown in serum-free or low-serum medium. For example, the medium can be supplemented with one or more growth factors. Commonly used growth factors include, but are not limited to, bone morphogenic protein, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor, Stem cell factor, and thrombopoietin. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,169,610; 7,109,032; 7,037,721; 6,617,161; 6,617,159; 6,372,210; 6,224,860; 6,037,174; 5,908,782; 5,766,951; 5,397,706; and 4,657,866; all incorporated by reference herein for teaching growing cells in serum-free medium.","Cells in culture can be maintained either in suspension or attached to a solid support, such as extracellular matrix components. Progenitor cells may require additional factors that encourage their attachment to a solid support, such as type I and type II collagen, chondroitin sulfate, fibronectin, \u201csuperfibronectin\u201d and fibronectin-like polymers, gelatin, poly-D and poly-L-lysine, thrombospondin and vitronectin. Progenitor cells can also be cultured in low attachment flasks such as but not limited to Corning Low attachment plates.","In some embodiments, the host cells are suitable for growth in suspension cultures. Suspension-competent host cells are generally monodisperse or grow in loose aggregates without substantial aggregation. Suspension-competent host cells include cells that are suitable for suspension culture without adaptation or manipulation (e.g., hematopoietic cells, lymphoid cells) and cells that have been made suspension-competent by modification or adaptation of attachment-dependent cells (e.g., epithelial cells, fibroblasts).","In some embodiments, the host cell is an attachment dependent cell which is grown and maintained in adherent culture.","Altering Cellular Phenotypes and Developmental Potentials","The compositions and methods comprising the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein permit long-term, safe, and efficient alteration of cellular phenotypes or cellular developmental potentials, without the risk of permanent genomic alterations. Such compositions and methods are useful for a variety of applications, indications, and modalities, including, but not limited to, gene therapy, regenerative medicine, cancer therapies, tissue engineering, and drug screening.","Accordingly, provided herein are cells contacted with a synthetic, modified RNA molecule encoding a polypeptide, or a progeny cell of the contacted cell, where expression of the encoded polypeptide in the contacted cell alters a function or a developmental phenotype or developmental potential of the cell, and results in a reduced innate immune response relative to the cell contacted with a synthetic RNA molecule encoding the polypeptide not comprising any modifications. In some embodiments, the developmental potential of the contacted cell is decreased. In some embodiments, the developmental potential of the contacted cell is increased. As such, the polypeptide encoded by the synthetic, modified RNA molecule can be a reprogramming factor, a differentiation factor, or a de-differentiation factor.","Also provided herein are cells comprising an exogenously introduced modified, synthetic RNA encoding a developmental potential altering factor. In some embodiments, the cell is a human cell. In some embodiments of these aspects, the cells or immediate precursor cell(s) have been subjected to at least 3 separate rounds of contacting with the modified, synthetic RNA encoding the developmental potential altering factor. In some such embodiments, the cells have a reduced expression of a Type I or Type II IFN relative to a cell subjected to at least 3 separate rounds of contacting with an exogenously introduced non-modified synthetic RNA encoding the developmental potential altering factor. In some such embodiments, the cell has a reduced expression of at least one IFN-signature gene relative to a human cell subjected to at least 3 separate rounds of contacting with an exogenously introduced non-modified synthetic RNA encoding the developmental potential altering factor. As described herein, the IFN-signature gene can be selected from the group consisting of IFN\u03b1, IFNB1, IFIT, OAS1, PKR, RIGI, CCL5, RAP1A, CXCL10, IFIT1, CXCL11, MX1, RP11-167P23.2, HERC5, GALR3, IFIT3, IFIT2, RSAD2, and CDC20. The polypeptide encoded by the exogenous synthetic, modified RNA molecule can be a reprogramming factor, a differentiation factor, or a de-differentiation factor. The cell or its immediate precursor cell(s) can be derived from a somatic cell, a partially reprogrammed somatic cell, a pluripotent cell, a multipotent cell, a differentiated cell, or an embryonic cell.","As used herein, the term \u201cdevelopmental potential of a cell\u201d refers to the total of all developmental cell fates or cell types that can be achieved by a cell upon differentiation. It should be understood that the developmental potential of a cell represents a spectrum: a terminally differentiated cell, e.g., a cardiac myocyte, has essentially no developmental potential under natural conditions\u2014that is, under normal circumstances, it cannot differentiate to another cell type; while at the other end of the spectrum, a totipotent embryonic stem cell has the potential to differentiate to or give rise to cells of every type in an organism, as well as the extra-embryonic structures. A cell with \u201cparental developmental potential\u201d refers to a cell having the developmental potential of the parent cell that gave rise to it.","The term \u201cdevelopmental potential of a cell\u201d is relative. For example, where a stem cell undergoes differentiation to a more differentiated or specialized phenotype, the resulting cell has a reduced developmental potential relative to the stem cell that produced it. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the developmental potential of a cell is the potential it has assuming no further manipulation of its potential\u2014that is, while it is acknowledged that the technology is available (as described herein) to artificially increase, decrease or otherwise alter the developmental potential of nearly any cell, to say that a cell has \u201creduced developmental potential\u201d means that, without further artificial manipulation to force the cell to a less differentiated phenotype, the cell can give rise to at least one fewer cell types than its immediate predecessor cell. That is, the cell resulting from a differentiation event has a reduced developmental potential despite the fact that it could possibly be manipulated to again become less differentiated. Thus, a cell with greater or higher developmental potential can differentiate into a greater variety of different cell types than a cell having a lower or decreased developmental potential.","Where, for example, a terminally- or only partially-differentiated cell is induced by artificial manipulation to become an induced pluripotent stem cell (an iPS cell), the resulting cell has increased developmental potential relative to the cell that produced it. As used herein, a \u201cchange\u201d or \u201calteration\u201d in the developmental potential of a cell occurs when the range of phenotypes to which a given cell can differentiate or give rise increases or decreases relative to the range naturally available to the cell prior to a differentiation, dedifferentiation or trans-differentiation event. By \u201cincrease\u201d in this context is meant that there is at least additional one cell type or lineage to which a given cell can differentiate relative to the potential of the starting cell. By \u201cdecrease\u201d in this context is meant that there is at least one fewer cell type or lineage to which the given cell can differentiate or give rise, relative to the potential of the starting cell.","Methods of manipulating the developmental potential of a cell, both to increase the potential and to decrease it, are described herein and others are known in the art. A \u201cchange\u201d or \u201calteration\u201d in the developmental potential of a cell can occur naturally, where, for example, a cell differentiates to a more specialized phenotype in its native environment in vivo. In various preferred aspects described herein, developmental potential or cell fate are directed by outside manipulation, and preferably by transfection with synthetic, modified RNA, as that term is defined herein. Thus, in one aspect, cells are contacted or transfected with synthetic, modified RNAs encoding one or more factors that re-direct or modify the phenotype of the cells.","Synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein can be made that direct the expression of essentially any gene product whose coding sequences can be cloned. The expression of the gene product from synthetic, modified RNA introduced to a cell that does not normally express that gene product necessarily results in a change in the phenotype of the cell whether or not it changes the differentiation status or differentiation potential of the cell. Simply put, the new phenotype is the cell's expression of the new gene product. Thus, in one aspect, encompassed herein is the expression of a protein from a synthetic, modified RNA introduced to a cell. Expression that does not necessarily change the differentiation status of the cell can nonetheless be useful in such embodiments, for example, where one wishes to correct or replace a defective function in a cell, due to a genetic defect or polymorphism, or in embodiments to target a cell to a particular location, e.g., by expressing a receptor or where one wishes to induce cell death in e.g., a tumor by expressing a death receptor, a death ligand, a cell cycle inhibitor etc.","In other aspects, the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein are well suited for directing the expression of any gene sequence, but are particularly well suited for modifying the differentiation status or the developmental potential of a cell, and for doing so without permanent change to the genome of the cell. This is true in part because reprogramming, differentiation and transdifferentiation each require relatively prolonged expression of one or more polypeptide factors in a target cell. Non-modified RNA is recognized as foreign by the cell's innate immune defenses against viral and bacterial RNA. If the cell transfected with non-modified RNA is not induced to undergo apoptosis or to otherwise shut down protein synthesis by a first transfection event, it will likely do so upon a subsequent transfection event with unmodified RNA.","Reprogramming","The production of cells having an increased developmental potential (e.g., iPS cells) is generally achieved by the introduction of nucleic acid sequences, specifically DNA, encoding stem cell-associated genes into an adult, somatic cell. Historically, these nucleic acids have been introduced using viral vectors and the expression of the gene products results in cells that are morphologically, biochemically, and functionally similar to pluripotent stem cells (e.g., embryonic stem cells). This process of altering a cell phenotype from a somatic cell phenotype to a pluripotent stem cell phenotype is termed \u201creprogramming.\u201d In the reprogramming methods described herein, the reprogramming is achieved by repeated transfection with synthetic, modified RNAs encoding the necessary reprogramming factors. The repeated transfection provides prolonged expression of the factors encoded by the synthetic, modified RNAs necessary to shift the developmental potential of the cell.","Accordingly, provided herein are pluripotent cells that are not embryonic stem cells, and which were not induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors, and which when subjected to an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis, cluster more closely to embryonic stem cells than do pluripotent cells induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors, exogenous protein introduction of one or more reprogramming factors, small molecule mediated expression or induction of one or more reprogramming factors, or any combination thereof. In some aspects, provided herein are pluripotent cells that are not embryonic stem cells, and which were not induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors. In such aspects, the pluripotent cell subjected to an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis clusters more closely to a human embryonic stem cell than does a pluripotent cell induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors. The pluripotent cell is generated from a precursor somatic cell, such as a precursor human somatic cell. The pluripotent cell or its immediate precursor cell(s) can also be derived from a somatic cell, partially reprogrammed somatic cell, a pluripotent cell, a multipotent cell, a differentiated cell, or an embryonic cell.","Reprogramming to generate pluripotent cells, as described herein, can be achieved by introducing a one or more synthetic, modified RNAs encoding stem cell-associated genes including, for example Oct-4 (also known as Oct-3\/4 or Pouf51) (SEQ ID NO: 788), Sox1, Sox2 (SEQ ID NO: 941 or SEQ ID NO: 1501), Sox3, Sox 15, Sox 18, NANOG, Klf1, Klf2, Klf4 (SEQ ID NO: 501), Klf5, NR5A2, c-Myc (SEQ ID NO: 636), 1-Myc, n-Myc, Rem2, Tert, LIN28 (SEQ ID NO: 524), and Sal14. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the reprogramming factor is selected from the group consisting of: OCT4, SOX1, SOX 2, SOX 3, SOX15, SOX 18, NANOG, KLF1, KLF 2, KLF 4, KLF 5, NR5A2, c-MYC, 1-MYC, n-MYC, REM2, TERT, and LIN28. In general, successful reprogramming is accomplished by introducing at least Oct-4, a member of the Sox family, a member of the Klf family, and a member of the Myc family to a somatic cell. In some embodiments, LIN28 is also introduced. The generation of iPS cells using transfection of the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, also referred to herein as \u201cRiPS,\u201d from a variety of starting cell types, including an adult somatic cell, is demonstrated in the Examples herein. The generation of reprogrammed cells using the compositions and methods described herein preferably causes the induction of endogenous stem-cell associated genes, such as SOX2, REX1, DNMT3B, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA3, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG. In some embodiments, at least two endogenous stem-cell-associated genes are induced. Preferably, the endogenous expression is at a level comparable to an embryonic stem cell, such as an embryonic stem cell cultured within the same laboratory.","The methods to reprogram cells using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can involve repeated contacting of the cells, such as somatic cells, in order to permit sufficient expression of the encoded reprogramming factors to maintain a stable change in the developmental potential of the cells, or progeny cells thereof, being contacted. Such methods can involve repeated transfections, such as for example, at least two, at least five, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at least 19, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, or more transfections. In other words, the methods comprise repeating transfection using the synthetic, modified RNAs until a desired phenotype of the cell or population of cells is achieved. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise contacting with or introducing the reprogramming factors to the cells under low-oxygen conditions.","The efficiency of reprogramming (i.e., the number of reprogrammed cells) can be enhanced by the addition of various small molecules as shown by Shi, Y., et al (2008) -2:525-528, Huangfu, D., et al (2008) 26(7):795-797, and Marson, A., et al (2008) -3:132-135, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It is contemplated that the methods described herein can also be used in combination with a single small molecule (or a combination of small molecules) that enhances the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell production or replaces one or more reprogramming factors during the reprogramming process. Some non-limiting examples of agents that enhance reprogramming efficiency include soluble Wnt, Wnt conditioned media, BIX-01294 (a G9a histone methyltransferase), PD0325901 (a MEK inhibitor), DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, valproic acid, 5\u2032-azacytidine, dexamethasone, suberoylanilide, hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and trichostatin (TSA), among others.","In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, an inhibitor of p53 can be used to reduce the stress response during a reprogramming regimen to direct the cell fate away from an apoptotic stimulus and towards reprogramming. Thus, treatment with a p53 inhibitor can enhance reprogramming in a population of cells. In one such embodiment, the inhibitor of p53 comprises an siRNA directed against p53 that is administered or expressed in the reprogramming cell. In another embodiment, a small molecule inhibitor of p53 (e.g., pifithrin-\u03b1) is administered to cells during the reprogramming process. In one embodiment, a modified RNA encoding Bcl2 is administered to the cells prior to, or in conjunction with, a modified RNA composition encoding at least one reprogramming factor to prevent apoptosis of cells during the process of reprogramming.","To confirm the induction of pluripotent stem cells, isolated clones can be tested for the expression of an endogenous stem cell marker. Such expression identifies the cells as induced pluripotent stem cells. Stem cell markers can be selected from the non-limiting group including SSEA1, CD9, Nanog, Fbx15, Ecat1, Esg1, Eras, Gdf3, Fgf4, Cripto, Dax1, Zpf296, Slc2a3, Rex1, Utf1, and Nat1. Methods for detecting the expression of such markers can include, for example, RT-PCR and immunological methods that detect the presence of the encoded polypeptides. Further evidence of reprogramming is shown by a reduction in or the loss of lamin A\/C protein expression. Alternatively, reprogramming is detected by measuring an increase in acetylation, such as increased acetylation of H3 and H4 within the promoter of Oct4, or by measuring a decrease in methylation, for example, by measuring the demethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3. In each of these cases, reprogramming is measured relative to a control cell. In other embodiments, reprogramming is assayed by any other method that detects chromatin remodeling leading to the activation of an embryonic stem cell marker, such as Oct4.","The pluripotent stem cell character of the isolated cells can be confirmed by any of a number of tests evaluating the expression of ES markers and the ability to differentiate to cells of each of the three germ layers. As one example, teratoma formation in nude mice can be used to evaluate the pluripotent character of the isolated clones. The cells are introduced to nude mice and histology and\/or immunohistochemistry is performed on a tumor arising from the cells. The growth of a tumor comprising cells from all three germ layers further indicates that the cells are pluripotent stem cells.","The pluripotent cells generated using the compositions and methods comprising the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein cluster more closely to a human embryonic stem cell than do pluripotent cells induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors, when subjected to an unsupervised hierarchical analysis, i.e., the pluripotent cells have a phenotype closer to a embryonic stem cell phenotype than do pluripotent cells induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors. In some embodiments, the unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis is performed using a Euclidean distance with average linkage method in which the similarity metric for comparison between different cells is indicated on the height of cluster dendrogram. The unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed on any data set available to a skilled artisan, such as gene expression data, protein expression data, DNA methylation data, histone modification data, and microRNA data.","Clustering, including, \u201cunsupervised clustering analysis\u201d or \u201cunsupervised cluster analysis\u201d refers to methods used in multivariate analysis to divide up objects into similar groups, or, in some embodiments, groups whose members are all close to one another on various dimensions being measured in the various objects. A key component of the analysis is repeated calculation of distance measures between objects, and between clusters once objects begin to be grouped into clusters. The outcome is typically represented graphically as a dendrogram. Hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed using any of a variety of unbiased computational methods, algorithms and software programs known to one of skill in the art that identify clusters or natural data structures from large data sets, such as, for example, gene expression data sets. Such methods include, but are not limited to, bottom-up hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering Affinity Propagation, non-Negative Matrix Factorization, spectral clustering, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithms, and the like. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, one SOM-based method for use in unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of cells contacted with the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein is the Automatic clustering using density-equalized SOM Ensembles (AUTOsome) method as described in A. M. Newman and J. B. Cooper (2010, Cell Stem Cell, 7:258-262) and A. M. Newman and J. B. Cooper (2010, BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:117), the contents of each of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference.","Accordingly, also provided herein are compositions for generating such pluripotent cells, comprising at least one synthetic, modified RNA encoding a reprogramming factor, and cell growth media. The synthetic, modified RNAs can comprise any modification for reducing the innate immune response, as described herein, such as a 5\u2032 cap, a poly(A) tail, a Kozak sequence, a 3\u2032 untranslated region, a 5\u2032 untranslated region, or any combination thereof. In preferred embodiments, the synthetic, modified RNAs comprise at least two nucleoside modifications, preferably 5-methylcytidine (5mC) and pseudouridine.","In some embodiments, the compositions permit an efficiency of pluripotent cell generation from a starting population of cells, such as somatic cells, of at least 1%. In some embodiments, the efficiency of pluripotent cell generation is at least 1.1%, at least 1.2%, at least 1.3%, at least 1.4%, at least 1.5%, at least 1.6%, at least 1.7%, at least 1.8%, at least 1.9%, at least 2.0%, at least 2.1%, at least 2.2%, at least 2.3%, at least 2.4%, at least 2.5%, at least 2.6%, at least 2.7%, at least 2.8%, at least 2.9%, at least 3.0%, at least 3.1%, at least 3.2%, at least 3.3%, at least 3.4%, at least 3.5%, at least 3.6%, at least 3.7%, at least 3.8%, at least 3.9%, at least 4.0%, at least 4.1%, at least 4.2%, at least 4.3%, at least 4.4%, at least 4.5%, at least 4.6%, at least 4.7%, at least 4.8%, at least 4.9%, at least 5.0%, 5.1%, at least 5.2%, at least 5.3%, at least 5.4%, at least 5.5%, at least 5.6%, at least 5.7%, at least 5.8%, at least 5.9%, at least 6.0%, 6.1%, at least 6.2%, at least 6.3%, at least 6.4%, at least 6.5%, at least 6.6%, at least 6.7%, at least 6.8%, at least 6.9%, at least 7.0%, 7.1%, at least 8.2%, at least 8.3%, at least 8.4%, at least 8.5%, at least 8.6%, at least 8.7%, at least 8.8%, at least 8.9%, at least 9.0%, 9.1%, at least 9.2%, at least 9.3%, at least 9.4%, at least 9.5%, at least 1.6%, at least 9.7%, at least 9.8%, at least 9.9%, at least 10.0%, or more.","In some embodiments, the compositions permit a rate of pluripotent cell generation from a starting population of cells, such as somatic cells of less than 25 days, less than 24 days, less than 23 days, less than 22 days, less than 21 days, 20 days, less than 19 days, less than 18 days, less than 17 days, less than 16 days, less than 15 days, less than 14 days, and greater than 7 days.","The reprogramming factor(s) for use in the compositions, methods, and kits for reprogramming cells described herein is selected from the group consisting of: OCT4 (SEQ ID NO: 788), SOX1, SOX 2 (SEQ ID NO: 941 or SEQ ID NO: 1501), SOX 3, SOX15, SOX 18, NANOG, KLF1, KLF 2, KLF 4 (SEQ ID NO: 501), KLF 5, NR5A2, c-MYC (SEQ ID NO: 636), 1-MYC, n-MYC, REM2, TERT, and LIN28 (SEQ ID NO: 524). In some embodiments, the compositions comprise at least 4 synthetic, modified RNAs encoding at least 4 different reprogramming factors. In some such embodiments, the at least 4 different reprogramming factors encoded by the at least 4 modified synthetic RNAs comprise OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. The compositions can further comprise a modified synthetic RNA encoding a LIN28 reprogramming factor. In some embodiments, the composition does not comprise a modified, synthetic RNA encoding the reprogramming factor c-MYC.","Transdifferentiation","Transdifferentiation refers to a process by which the phenotype of a cell can be switched to that of another cell type, without the formation of a pluripotent intermediate cell. Thus, the methods do not require that the cell first be de-differentiated (or reprogrammed) and then differentiated to another cell type; rather the cell type is merely \u201cswitched\u201d from one cell type to another without first forming a less differentiated phenotype. Thus, \u201ctransdifferentiation\u201d refers to the capacity of differentiated cells of one type to lose identifying characteristics and to change their phenotype to that of other fully differentiated cells.","Transdifferentiation can be achieved by introducing into a cell a synthetic, modified RNA composition that permits expression of a cell-type specific differentiation factor. For example, to transdifferentiate a cell to a myogenic lineage one can express MyoD using a modified RNA as described herein. While the introduction of a single differentiation factor can be enough to transdifferentiate a cell, it is also contemplated herein that a plurality of different differentiation factors are introduced to the cell during the transdifferentiation regime. Alternatively, synthetic, modified RNAs that inhibit expression of cell-type specific polypeptides of the original cell-type can also be introduced to the cell, in effect \u201cturning off\u201d the original phenotype of the cell. In one embodiment, modified RNAs that express a desired cell-type specific polypeptide to turn on a desired phenotype are used in combination with modified RNA interference molecules used to turn off the existing cell phenotype, in order to cause transdifferentiation of the cell from one phenotype to another.","Transdifferentiation can be useful in tissue engineering at e.g., an injury or disease site. In one embodiment, transdifferentiation is performed in vivo at the site of injury or disease. In another embodiment, an organ or tissue can be transdifferentiated\/regenerated in vitro, and then introduced back into the body.","Differentiation","Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized (\u201cuncommitted\u201d) or less specialized cell acquires the features of a specialized cell (e.g., a terminally differentiated cell) such as, for example, a cardiomyocyte, a nerve cell or a skeletal muscle cell. A differentiated or differentiation-induced cell is one that has taken on a more specialized (\u201ccommitted\u201d) position within the lineage of a cell (e.g., reduced differentiation potential). The term \u201ccommitted\u201d, when applied to the process of differentiation, refers to a cell that has proceeded in the differentiation pathway to a point where, under normal circumstances, it will continue to differentiate into a specific cell type or subset of cell types, and cannot, under normal circumstances, differentiate into a different cell type or revert to a less differentiated cell type. De-differentiation refers to the process by which a cell reverts to a less specialized (or committed) position within the lineage of a cell (i.e., increased developmental potential). As used herein, the lineage of a cell defines the heredity or fate of the cell, i.e., which cells it came from and what cells it can give rise to. The lineage of a cell places the cell within a hereditary scheme of development and differentiation. A lineage-specific marker refers to a characteristic specifically associated with the phenotype of cells of a lineage of interest and can be used to assess the differentiation of an uncommitted cell to the lineage of interest.","Cells that are differentiated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs, as described herein, can be differentiated into any cell type or lineage known to one of skill in the art. Such cells can be of a lineage selected from an ecotodermal lineage, a mesodermal lineage, or an endodermal lineage. Exemplary ectodermal lineage cells include, but are not limited to, cells of the epidermis (skin cells, melanocytes), and cells of the neuronal lineage. Exemplary mesodermal lineage cells include, but are not limited to, cells of the circulatory system (cardiac cells and blood vessel cells), cells of the connective tissue, bone cells, dermal cells, myocytes (smooth and skeletal), certain cells of the urinary system, such as kidney cells, splenic cells, mesothelial cells (cells of the peritoneum, pleura, and pericardium), non-germ cells of the reproductive system, and hematopoietic lineage cells. Exemplary endodermal lineage cells include, but are not limited to, cells of the gastrointestinal system, cells of the respiratory tract, cells of the endocrine glands, cells of the auditory system, and certain cells of the urinary system, such as the bladder and parts of the urethra.","Accordingly, compositions and methods described herein include a method for programming or directing the differentiation of cells (e.g., stem cells) comprising contacting the cells desired to be differentiated with a synthetic, modified RNA or synthetic, modified RNA composition. The cells can be transfected a plurality of times until the desired differentiated phenotype is achieved, as measured by e.g., a gene expression array of cell-type specific markers, Western blotting, cell function assays etc. A selection compound may be added to the mixture, but is not required.","Typically, the synthetic, modified RNA composition transfected into the cells to promote their differentiation encodes a cell-type specific differentiation factor or factors. For example, to differentiate a cell to a neuronal cell phenotype, a synthetic, modified RNA encoding at least one neuronal differentiation factor, for example Ascl1, Brn2, Mytl1, or a combination thereof is transfected into the cell. To promote differentiation to a myogenic phenotype, a synthetic, modified RNA such as one encoding MyoD can be transfected into a cell. To differentiate a cell to a macrophage phenotype, a macrophage factor such as e.g., CEBP-alpha or PU.1 is transfected into the cell. In one embodiment, a modified RNA that encodes Ngn3, Pdx1, MAFA, or any combination thereof can be used to differentiate cells to a pancreatic beta cell phenotype. A synthetic, modified RNA encoding PRDM16 can be applied to Myf5-expressing progenitors to induce differentiation into brown fat cells. Oligodendrocytes may be specified from neural precursors using a synthetic, modified RNA encoding Ascl1. It has been reported that hepatocyte differentiation requires the transcription factor HNF-4-\u03b1. (Li et al., Genes Dev. 14:464, 2000). A synthetic, modified RNA can be applied to a cell, such as a stem cell or induced pluripotent stem cell generated using the compositions described herein, that inhibit or suppress one or more component of the wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway to become a cardiovascular progenitor cell. These examples are not meant to be limiting and essentially any cell-type specific factor or differentiation factor known in the art can be expressed in a cell using a synthetic, modified RNA or synthetic, modified RNA composition as described herein. Table 1 provides a non-limiting list of exemplary transcription factors and corresponding mRNA sequence identifiers that can be used to alter the developmental potential or phenotype of a cell.","In other embodiments, cells with higher or increased developmental potential, e.g., pluripotent cells, multipotent cells, etc., can be induced to differentiate by manipulating their external environment. For example, cells can be maintained under culture conditions that induce differentiation of the cells to a desired lineage. As but one example, in some embodiments, cells with higher or increased developmental potential, generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, can be differentiated into islet-like cells for administration to a patient in need thereof, for example, a patient having or at risk for diabetes. In such embodiments, islet-like cells, which includes insulin-producing cells and glucagon-producing cells, can be differentiated using any of the methods described in US Patent Publication No.: 20100240130, the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. For example, cells can be differentiated whereby the first culturing step takes place in the presence of an Activin, the next culturing step utilizes a suspension culture that takes place in the presence of a noggin, an FGF-2, and an EGF, and a final culturing step in which the cells are cultured with nicotinamide. In certain embodiments, sodium butyrate can be included in the culture medium. In other embodiments, pluripotent cells can be differentiated into islet-like cells by directed differentiation. In certain embodiments, expression of additional genes at the site of islet-like cell administration, using the compositions and methods described herein, can facilitate adoption of the functional \u03b2-islet cell phenotype, enhance the beneficial effect of the administered cells, and\/or increase proliferation and\/or activity of host cells neighboring the treatment site.","In other embodiments, cells with higher or increased developmental potential, generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, can be differentiated, for example, into neuronal cells, such as oligodendrocytes, for example, for treatment of spinal cord injuries. In such embodiments, pluripotent cells can be differentiated using any of the compositions or methods found in US Patent Publication No.: 20090232779 or US Patent Publication No.: 20090305405, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference. For example, cells can be differentiated to neural or glial lineages, using medium including any of the following factors in an effective combination: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neutrotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4, epidermal growth factor (EGF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), nerve growth factor (NGF), retinoic acid (RA), sonic hedgehog, FGF-8, ascorbic acid, forskolin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs).","In other exemplary embodiments, cells with higher or increased developmental potential generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can be differentiated into heptaocyte-like cells for treatment of liver diseases, such as cirrhosis. For example, cells can be differentiated to hepatocyte-like cells, using medium including any of the following factors in an effective combination or sequence: a hepatocyte supportive extracellular matrix, such as collagen or Matrigel; suitable differentiation agents, such as various isomers of butyrate and their analogs, exemplified by n-butyrate; a hepatocyte maturation factor, such as an organic solvent like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); a maturation cofactor such as retinoic acid; a cytokine or hormone such as a glucocorticoid, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, transforming growth factors (TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2), fibroblast growth factors (FGF), heparin, hepatocyte growth factors (HGF), interleukins (IL-1 and IL-6), insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II), and heparin-binding growth factors (HBGF-1).","The success of a differentiation program can be monitored by any of a number of criteria, including characterization of morphological features, detection or quantitation of expressed cell markers and enzymatic activity, and determination of the functional properties of the desired end cell types in vitro or in vivo. The level of mRNA corresponding to a marker can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats. The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. Protein markers can be measured e.g., by immunohistochemical techniques or the morphology of the cell can be monitored. Biochemical approaches, e.g., the ability of the differentiated cell to respond to a cell-type specific stimulus can also be monitored. An increase in the expression of a cell specific marker may be by about 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%. In one embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA composition can direct cell fate towards different germ layers without definitively specifying a terminally differentiated cell type. For example, a synthetic, modified RNA encoding Sox17 or GATA6 can be used for definitive endodermal specification from pluripotent cells, such as an iPS or embryonic stem cell. Similarly, a synthetic, modified RNA encoding T (Brachyury) can be used for specification of mesoderm. For example, markers for neural cells include, but are not limited to: \u03b2-tubulin III or neurofilament, which are characteristic of neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), present in astrocytes; galactocerebroside (GalC) or myelin basic protein (MBP), characteristic of oligodendrocytes; nestin, characteristic of neural precursors and other cells, and A2B5 and NCAM, characteristic of glial progenitors and neural progenitors, respectively. Similarly, an adipocyte can be detected by assaying for Oil-Red-O staining or acetylated LDL uptake. Cardiomyocytes can be detected by assaying for the expression of one or more cardiomyocyte specific markers, such as cardiotroponin I, Mef2c, connexin43, Nkx2.5, GATA-4, sarcomeric actinin, cariotroponin T and TBX5, and sarcomeric actinin, \u03b1-cardiac myosin heavy chain, actin, or ventricular myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2v). For skeletal muscle, markers include myoD, myogenin, and myf-5. Markers of interest for identifying liver cells include \u03b1-fetoprotein (liver progenitors); albumin, \u03b1-antitrypsin, glucose-6-phosphatase, cytochrome p450 activity, transferrin, asialoglycoprotein receptor, and glycogen storage (hepatocytes); CK7, CK19, and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (bile epithelium). The presence of endothelial cells can be detected by assaying the presence of an endothelial cell specific marker, such as CD31+, PECAM (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule), Flk-1, tie-1, tie-2, vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin, MECA-32, and MEC-14.7. For pancreatic cells, pdx and insulin secretion can be used for determination of differentiation. The level of expression can be measured in a number of ways, including, but not limited to: measuring the mRNA encoded by the markers; measuring the amount of protein encoded by the markers; or measuring the activity of the protein encoded by the markers.","In some embodiments, differentiation is detected by measuring an alteration in the morphology or biological function or activity of a differentiated cell. An alteration in biological function may be assayed, for example, by measuring an increase in acetylated LDL uptake in a reprogrammed adipocyte. For example, GABA-secreting neurons can be identified by production of glutamic acid decarboxylase or GABA. Dopaminergic neurons can be identified by production of dopa decarboxylase, dopamine, or tyrosine hydroxylase. Also, for example, differentiated hepatocyte lineage cells differentiated can be identified by \u03b1-antitrypsin (AAT) synthesis, albumin synthesis, evidence of glycogen storage, evidence of cytochrome p450 activity, and evidence of glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Other methods for assaying cell morphology and function are known in the art and are described in the Examples.","In some embodiments, the cells of the compositions and methods described herein are further cultured in the presence of cell specific growth factors, such as angiogenin, bone morphogenic protein-1, bone morphogenic protein-2, bone morphogenic protein-3, bone morphogenic protein-4, bone morphogenic protein-5, bone morphogenic protein-6, bone morphogenic protein-7, bone morphogenic protein-8, bone morphogenic protein-9, bone morphogenic protein-10, bone morphogenic protein-11, bone morphogenic protein-12, bone morphogenic protein-13, bone morphogenic protein-14, bone morphogenic protein-15, bone morphogenic protein receptor IA, bone morphogenic protein receptor IB, brain derived neurotrophic factor, ciliary neutrophic factor, ciliary neutrophic factor receptor-alpha, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemotactic factor 1, cytokine-induced neutrophil, chemotactic factor 2-alpha, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemotactic factor 2-beta, beta-endothelial cell growth factor, endothelia 1, epidermal growth factor, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant, fibroblast growth factor 4, fibroblast growth factor 5, fibroblast growth factor 6 fibroblast growth factor 7, fibroblast growth factor 8, fibroblast growth factor b, fibroblast growth factor c, fibroblast growth factor 9, fibroblast growth factor 10, fibroblast growth factor acidic, fibroblast growth factor basic, glial cell line-derived neutrophil factor receptor-alpha-1, glial cell line-derived neutrophil factor receptor-alpha-2, growth related protein, growth related protein-alpha, growth related protein-beta, growth related protein-gamma, heparin binding epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor I, insulin-like growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein, keratinocyte growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-alpha, nerve growth factor, nerve growth factor receptor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, placenta growth factor, placenta growth factor 2, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, platelet derived growth factor A chain, platelet derived growth factor AA, platelet derived growth factor AB, platelet derived growth factor B chain, platelet derived growth factor BB, platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha, platelet derived growth factor receptor-beta, pre-B cell growth stimulating factor, stem cell factor, stem cell factor receptor, transforming growth factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, transforming growth factor-beta-1, transforming growth factor-beta-1-2, transforming growth factor-beta-2, transforming growth factor-beta-3, transforming growth factor-beta-5, latent transforming growth factor-beta-1, transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein I, transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein II, transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein III, tumor necrosis factor receptor type I, tumor necrosis factor receptor type II, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and chimeric proteins and biologically or immunologically active fragments thereof. Such factors can also be injected or otherwise administered directly into an animal system for in vivo integration.","Cell Modifications","Homing Moieties and Cell-Surface Receptors","In some aspects and embodiments of the aspects described herein, a synthetic, modified RNA can be used to express a ligand or ligand receptor on the surface of a cell (e.g., a homing moiety). A ligand or ligand receptor moiety attached to a cell surface permits the cell to have a desired biological interaction with a tissue or an agent in vivo. A ligand can be an antibody, an antibody fragment, an aptamer, a peptide, a vitamin, a carbohydrate, a protein or polypeptide, a receptor, e.g., cell-surface receptor, an adhesion molecule, a glycoprotein, a sugar residue, a therapeutic agent, a drug, a glycosaminoglycan, or any combination thereof. For example, a ligand can be an antibody that recognizes a cancer-cell specific antigen, rendering the cell capable of preferentially interacting with tumor cells to permit tumor-specific localization of a modified cell. A ligand can confer the ability of a cell composition to accumulate in a tissue to be treated, since a preferred ligand is capable of interacting with a target molecule on the external face of a tissue to be treated. Ligands having limited cross-reactivity to other tissues are generally preferred.","In some cases, a ligand can act as a homing moiety which permits the cell to target to a specific tissue or interact with a specific ligand. Such homing moieties can include, for example, any member of a specific binding pair, antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, or derivatives or analogs thereof, including without limitation: Fv fragments, single chain Fv (scFv) fragments, Fab\u2032 fragments, F(ab\u2032)fragments, single domain antibodies, camelized antibodies and antibody fragments, humanized antibodies and antibody fragments, and multivalent versions of the foregoing; multivalent binding reagents including without limitation: monospecific or bispecific antibodies, such as disulfide stabilized Fv fragments, scFv tandems ((scFv)fragments), diabodies, tribodies or tetrabodies, which typically are covalently linked or otherwise stabilized (i.e., leucine zipper or helix stabilized) scFv fragments; and other homing moieties include for example, aptamers, receptors, and fusion proteins.","In some embodiments, the homing moiety is a surface-bound antibody, which can permit tuning of cell targeting specificity. This is especially useful since highly specific antibodies can be raised against an epitope of interest for the desired targeting site. In one embodiment, multiple antibodies are expressed on the surface of a cell, and each antibody can have a different specificity for a desired target. Such approaches can increase the avidity and specificity of homing interactions.","A skilled artisan can select any homing moiety based on the desired localization or function of the cell, for example an estrogen receptor ligand, such as tamoxifen, can target cells to estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells that have an increased number of estrogen receptors on the cell surface. Other non-limiting examples of ligand\/receptor interactions include CCR1 (e.g., for treatment of inflamed joint tissues or brain in rheumatoid arthritis, and\/or multiple sclerosis), CCR7, CCR8 (e.g., targeting to lymph node tissue), CCR6, CCR9, CCR10 (e.g., to target to intestinal tissue), CCR4, CCR10 (e.g., for targeting to skin), CXCR4 (e.g., for general enhanced transmigration), HCELL (e.g., for treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders, bone marrow), Alpha4beta7 (e.g., for intestinal mucosa targeting), VLA-4\/VCAM-1 (e.g., targeting to endothelium). In general, any receptor involved in targeting (e.g., cancer metastasis) can be harnessed for use in the methods and compositions described herein. Table 2 and Table 3 provide non-limiting examples of CD (\u201ccluster of differentiation\u201d) molecules and other cell-surface\/membrane bound molecules and receptors that can be expressed using the synthetic, modified RNA compositions and methods described herein for targeting and homing to cells of interest, or for changing the phenotype of a cell.","Mediators of Cell Death","In one embodiment, a synthetic, modified RNA composition can be used to induce apoptosis in a cell (e.g., a cancer cell) by increasing the expression of a death receptor, a death receptor ligand or a combination thereof. This method can be used to induce cell death in any desired cell and has particular usefulness in the treatment of cancer where cells escape natural apoptotic signals.","Apoptosis can be induced by multiple independent signaling pathways that converge upon a final effector mechanism consisting of multiple interactions between several \u201cdeath receptors\u201d and their ligands, which belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor\/ligand superfamily. The best-characterized death receptors are CD95 (\u201cFas\u201d), TNFR1 (p55), death receptor 3 (DR3 or Apo3\/TRAMO), DR4 and DR5 (apo2-TRAIL-R2). The final effector mechanism of apoptosis is the activation of a series of proteinases designated as caspases. The activation of these caspases results in the cleavage of a series of vital cellular proteins and cell death. The molecular mechanism of death receptors\/ligands-induced apoptosis is well known in the art. For example, Fas\/FasL-mediated apoptosis is induced by binding of three FasL molecules which induces trimerization of Fas receptor via C-terminus death domains (DDs), which in turn recruit an adapter protein FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) and Caspase-8. The oligomerization of this trimolecular complex, Fas\/FAIDD\/caspase-8, results in proteolytic cleavage of proenzyme caspase-8 into active caspase-8 that, in turn, initiates the apoptosis process by activating other downstream caspases through proteolysis, including caspase-3. Death ligands in general are apoptotic when formed into trimers or higher order of structures. As monomers, they may serve as antiapoptotic agents by competing with the trimers for binding to the death receptors.","In one embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA composition encodes for a death receptor (e.g., Fas, TRAIL, TRAMO, TNFR, TLR etc). Cells made to express a death receptor by transfection of modified RNA become susceptible to death induced by the ligand that activates that receptor. Similarly, cells made to express a death ligand, e.g., on their surface, will induce death of cells with the receptor when the transfected cell contacts the target cell. In another embodiment, the modified RNA composition encodes for a death receptor ligand (e.g., FasL, TNF, etc). In another embodiment, the modified RNA composition encodes a caspase (e.g., caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 etc). Where cancer cells often exhibit a failure to properly differentiate to a non-proliferative or controlled proliferative form, in another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA composition encodes for both a death receptor and its appropriate activating ligand. In another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA composition encodes for a differentiation factor that when expressed in the cancer cell, such as a cancer stem cell, will induce the cell to differentiate to a non-pathogenic or non-self-renewing phenotype (e.g., reduced cell growth rate, reduced cell division etc) or to induce the cell to enter a dormant cell phase (e.g., Gresting phase).","One of skill in the art will appreciate that the use of apoptosis-inducing techniques will require that the synthetic, modified RNAs are appropriately targeted to e.g., tumor cells to prevent unwanted wide-spread cell death. Thus, one can use a delivery mechanism (e.g., attached ligand or antibody, targeted liposome etc) that recognizes a cancer antigen such that the modified RNAs are expressed only in cancer cells.","Cellular Therapies and Cellular Administration","The compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs are particularly useful for generating cells, such as differentiated cells, for use in patients in need of cellular therapies or regenerative medicine applications. Accordingly, various embodiments of the methods and compositions described herein involve administration of an effective amount of a cell or a population of cells, generated using any of the compositions or methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, to an individual or subject in need of a cellular therapy. The cell or population of cells being administered can be an autologous population, or be derived from one or more heterologous sources. The cell can be, for example, a stem cell, such as a lineage-restricted progenitor cell, multipotent cell, or an oligopotent cell, or a fully or partially differentiated progeny of a stem cell. In some embodiments, the stem cell can be generated through the introduction of synthetic, modified RNAs encoding differentiation factor(s) as described herein. In addition, the population of cells administered can be of a lineage selected from one of an ecotodermal lineage, a mesodermal lineage, or an endodermal lineage. The cell can also be a cell modified to express a targeting moiety or a mediator of targeted cell death, using synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein. Further, such differentiated cells can be administered in a manner that permits them to graft to the intended tissue site and reconstitute or regenerate the functionally deficient area. In some such embodiments, differentiated cells can be introduced to a scaffold or other structure to generate, for example, a tissue ex vivo, that can then be introduced to a patient. For example, islet precursor cells or their derivatives can be generated to restore islet function in a patient having any condition relating to inadequate production of a pancreatic endocrine (insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin), or the inability to properly regulate secretion, e.g., Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.","A variety of means for administering cells to subjects are known to those of skill in the art. Such methods can include systemic injection, for example i.v. injection, or implantation of cells into a target site in a subject. Cells may be inserted into a delivery device which facilitates introduction by injection or implantation into the subject. Such delivery devices can include tubes, e.g., catheters, for injecting cells and fluids into the body of a recipient subject. In one preferred embodiment, the tubes additionally have a needle, e.g., through which the cells can be introduced into the subject at a desired location. The cells can be prepared for delivery in a variety of different forms. For example, the cells can be suspended in a solution or gel or embedded in a support matrix when contained in such a delivery device. Cells can be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in which the cells remain viable.","Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents include saline, aqueous buffer solutions, solvents and\/or dispersion media. The use of such carriers and diluents is well known in the art. The solution is preferably sterile and fluid. Preferably, prior to the introduction of cells as described herein, the solution is stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi through the use of, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.","It is preferred that the mode of cell administration is relatively non-invasive, for example by intravenous injection, pulmonary delivery through inhalation, topical, or intranasal administration. However, the route of cell administration will depend on the tissue to be treated and may include implantation. Methods for cell delivery are known to those of skill in the art and can be extrapolated by one skilled in the art of medicine for use with the methods and compositions described herein.","Direct injection techniques for cell administration can also be used to stimulate transmigration of cells through the entire vasculature, or to the vasculature of a particular organ, such as for example liver, or kidney or any other organ. This includes non-specific targeting of the vasculature. One can target any organ by selecting a specific injection site, e.g., a liver portal vein. Alternatively, the injection can be performed systemically into any vein in the body. This method is useful for enhancing stem cell numbers in aging patients. In addition, the cells can function to populate vacant stem cell niches or create new stem cells to replenish the organ, thus improving organ function. For example, cells may take up pericyte locations within the vasculature. In another example, neural stem cells or precursor cells generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs are transplanted directly into parenchymal or intrathecal sites of the central nervous system, according to the disease being treated, such as for example, a spinal cord injury. Grafts can be done using single cell suspension or small aggregates at a density of 25,000-500,000 cells per mL (U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,829, the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference). A successful transplant can show, for example, transplant-derived cells present in the lesion 2-5 weeks later, differentiated into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and\/or neurons, and migrating along the cord from the lesioned end.","If so desired, a mammal or subject can be pre-treated with an agent, for example an agent is administered to enhance cell targeting to a tissue (e.g., a homing factor) and can be placed at that site to encourage cells to target the desired tissue. For example, direct injection of homing factors into a tissue can be performed prior to systemic delivery of ligand-targeted cells.","Scaffolds and Tissue Engineering","It is further contemplated that, in some embodiments of these aspects, cells generated by differentiation or transdifferentiation using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, can not only be administered as cells in suspension, but also as cells populating a matrix, scaffold, or other support to create an artificial tissue, for use in cellular therapies in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.","Tissue engineering refers to the use of a combination of cells, engineering and materials methods, and suitable biochemical and physio-chemical factors for the de novo generation of tissue or tissue structures. Such engineered tissue or tissue structures are useful for therapeutic purposes to improve or replace biological functions. As used herein, \u201cengineered tissue\u201d encompasses a broad range of applications, including, but not limited to, utility in the repair or replace portions of, or whole tissues (e.g., heart, cardiac tissue, ventricular myocardium, and other tissues such as bone, cartilage, pancreas, liver, kidney, blood vessels, bladder, etc.), or in assays for identifying agents which modify the function of parts of, or entire organs without the need to obtain such organs from a subject.","In some embodiments, a \u201csupport\u201d i.e., any suitable carrier material to which cells generated using the methods and compositions comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein are able to attach themselves or adhere, is used in order to form a corresponding cell composite, e.g. an artificial tissue. In some embodiments, a matrix or carrier material, respectively, is present already in a three-dimensional form desired for later application. For example, bovine pericardial tissue can be used as matrix which is crosslinked with collagen, decellularized and photofixed.","In some such embodiments, a scaffold, which can also be referred to as a \u201cbiocompatible substrate,\u201d can be used as a material that is suitable for implantation into a subject onto which a cell population can be deposited. A biocompatible substrate does not cause toxic or injurious effects once implanted in the subject. In one embodiment, the biocompatible substrate is a polymer with a surface that can be shaped into a desired structure that requires repairing or replacing. The polymer can also be shaped into a part of a structure that requires repairing or replacing. The biocompatible substrate provides the supportive framework that allows cells to attach to it, and grow on it. Cultured populations of cells can then be grown on the biocompatible substrate, which provides the appropriate interstitial distances required for cell-cell interaction.","A structure or scaffold can be used to aid in further controlling and directing a cell or population of cells undergoing differentiation or transdifferentiation using the compositions and methods described herein. A structure or scaffold, such as a biopolymer structure, can be designed to provide environmental cues to control and direct the differentiation of cells to a functionally active engineered tissue, e.g., multipotent cells undergoing differentiation, using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, into ventricular cardiomyocytes to generate a functional, contracting tissue myocardium structure. By \u201cfunctionally active,\u201d it is meant that the cell attached to the scaffold comprises at least one function of that cell type in its native environment. A structure or scaffold can be engineered from a nanometer to micrometer to millimeter to macroscopic length, and can further comprise or be based on factors such as, but not limited to, material mechanical properties, material solubility, spatial patterning of bioactive compounds, spatial patterning of topological features, soluble bioactive compounds, mechanical perturbation (cyclical or static strain, stress, shear, etc. . . . ), electrical stimulation, and thermal perturbation.","The construction of an engineered tissue can be carried out by first assembling the scaffolds, and then seeding with a cell type that has undergone differentiation or partial differentiation using the synthetic, modified RNA compositions and methods described herein. Alternatively, an engineered tissue can be made by seeding a matrix or other scaffold component cell with cells, such as iPS cells or human ES cells, and applying or introducing a desired synthetic, modified RNA composition directly to the scaffold comprising the cells. A scaffold can be in any desired geometric conformation, for example, a flat sheet, a spiral, a cone, a v-like structure and the like. A scaffold can be shaped into, e.g., a heart valve, vessel (tubular), planar construct or any other suitable shape. Such scaffold constructs are known in the art (see, e.g., WO02\/035992, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,479,064, 6,461,628, the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference). In some embodiments, after culturing the cells on the scaffold, the scaffold is removed (e.g., bioabsorbed or physically removed), and the layers of differentiation or transdifferentiated cells maintain substantially the same conformation as the scaffold, such that, for example, if the scaffold was spiral shaped, the cells form a 3D-engineered tissue that is spiral shaped. In addition, it is contemplated that different synthetic, modified RNA compositions can be contacted with or applied to a scaffold comprising cells in order to allow the growth and differentiation of a plurality of different, differentiated cells types to form a desired engineered tissue. For example, for construction of muscle tissue with blood vessels, a scaffold can be seeded with different population of cells which make up blood vessels, neural tissue, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and the like.","Biopolymer structures can be generated by providing a transitional polymer on a substrate; depositing a biopolymer on the transitional polymer; shaping the biopolymer into a structure having a selected pattern on the transitional polymer (poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide); and releasing the biopolymer from the transitional polymer with the biopolymer's structure and integrity intact. A biopolymer can be selected from an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, growth factor, lipid, fatty acid, steroid, sugar and other biologically active carbohydrates, a biologically derived homopolymer, nucleic acids, hormone, enzyme, pharmaceutical composition, cell surface ligand and receptor, cytoskeletal filament, motor protein, silks, polyprotein (e.g., poly(lysine)) or any combination thereof. The biopolymers used in the generation of the scaffolds for the embodiments directed to tissue engineering described herein include, but are not limited to, a) extracellular matrix proteins to direct cell adhesion and function (e.g., collagen, fibronectin, laminin, etc.); (b) growth factors to direct cell function specific to cell type (e.g., nerve growth factor, bone morphogenic proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor, etc.); (c) lipids, fatty acids and steroids (e.g., glycerides, non-glycerides, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, corticosteroids, sex steroids, etc.); (d) sugars and other biologically active carbohydrates (e.g., monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, sucrose, glucose, glycogen, etc.); (e) combinations of carbohydrates, lipids and\/or proteins, such as proteoglycans (protein cores with attached side chains of chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, and\/or keratan sulfate); glycoproteins [e.g., selectins, immunoglobulins, hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin, Alpha-fetoprotein and Erythropoietin (EPO), etc.]; proteolipids (e.g., N-myristoylated, palmitoylated and prenylated proteins); and glycolipids (e.g., glycoglycerolipids, glycosphingolipids, glycophosphatidylinositols, etc.); (f) biologically derived homopolymers, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acids and poly-L-lysine; (g) nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA, etc.); (h) hormones (e.g., anabolic steroids, sex hormones, insulin, angiotensin, etc.); (i) enzymes (types: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases; examples: trypsin, collegenases, matrix metallproteinases, etc.); (j) pharmaceuticals (e.g., beta blockers, vasodilators, vasoconstrictors, pain relievers, gene therapy, viral vectors, anti-inflammatories, etc.); (k) cell surface ligands and receptors (e.g., integrins, selectins, cadherins, etc.); (l) cytoskeletal filaments and\/or motor proteins (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules, actin filaments, dynein, kinesin, myosin, etc.), or any combination thereof. For example, a biopolymer can be selected from the group consisting of fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, collagen, fibrinogen, silk or silk fibroin.","Following or during construction of a biopolymer scaffold, cells can be integrated into or onto the scaffold. In some embodiments, the cells to be differentiated are human ES-derived cells or iPS-derived cells, and the methods further comprise growing the cells in the scaffold where the structure, composition, ECM type, growth factors and\/or other cell types can assist in differentiation of the cells into the desired differentiated cell type. In some embodiments, such engineered tissue can be further used in drug screening applications. For example, an engineered myocardium tissue composition can be useful as a tool to identify agents which modify the function of cardiac muscle (e.g., to identify cardiotoxic agents).","Other exemplary materials suitable for polymer scaffold fabrication include, but are not limited to, polylactic acid (PLA), poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA), polyglycolide, polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), polydioxanone, polygluconate, polylactic acid-polyethylene oxide copolymers, modified cellulose, collagen, polyhydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxpriopionic acid, polyphosphoester, poly(alpha-hydroxy acid), polycaprolactone, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyanhydrides, polyamino acids, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polycyanoacrylates, degradable urethanes, aliphatic polyester polyacrylates, polymethacrylate, acyl substituted cellulose acetates, non-degradable polyurethanes, polystyrenes, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl flouride, polyvinyl imidazole, chlorosulphonated polyolifins, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, Teflon\u2122, nylon silicon, and shape memory materials, such as poly(styrene-block-butadiene), polynorbornene, hydrogels, metallic alloys, and oligo(\u03b5-caprolactone)diol as switching segment\/oligo(p-dioxyanone)diol as physical crosslink. Other suitable polymers can be obtained by reference to The Polymer Handbook, 3rd edition (Wiley, N.Y., 1989), the contents of which are herein incorporated in their reference by entirety.","In some embodiments, additional bioactive substances can be added to a biopolymer scaffold comprising cells being differentiated using the synthetic, modified RNA compositions described herein, such as, but not limited to, demineralized bone powder as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,373 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference; collagen, insoluble collagen derivatives, etc., and soluble solids and\/or liquids dissolved therein; antiviricides, particularly those effective against HIV and hepatitis; antimicrobials and\/or antibiotics such as erythromycin, bacitracin, neomycin, penicillin, polymycin B, tetracyclines, biomycin, chloromycetin, and streptomycins, cefazolin, ampicillin, azactam, tobramycin, clindamycin and gentamycin, etc.; biocidal\/biostatic sugars such as dextran, glucose, etc.; amino acids; peptides; vitamins; inorganic elements; co-factors for protein synthesis; hormones; endocrine tissue or tissue fragments; synthesizers; enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, collagenase, peptidases, oxidases, etc.; polymer cell scaffolds with parenchymal cells; angiogenic agents and polymeric carriers containing such agents; collagen lattices; antigenic agents; cytoskeletal agents; cartilage fragments; living cells such as chondrocytes, bone marrow cells, mesenchymal stem cells; natural extracts; genetically engineered living cells or otherwise modified living cells; expanded or cultured cells; DNA delivered by plasmid, viral vectors or other means; tissue transplants; demineralized bone powder; autogenous tissues such as blood, serum, soft tissue, bone marrow, etc.; bioadhesives; bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs); osteoinductive factor (IFO); fibronectin (FN); endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); cementum attachment extracts (CAE); ketanserin; human growth hormone (HGH); animal growth hormones; epidermal growth factor (EGF); interleukins, e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2); human alpha thrombin; transforming growth factor (TGF-beta); insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1, IGF-2); platelet derived growth factors (PDGF); fibroblast growth factors (FGF, BFGF, etc.); periodontal ligament chemotactic factor (PDLGF); enamel matrix proteins; growth and differentiation factors (GDF); hedgehog family of proteins; protein receptor molecules; small peptides derived from growth factors above; bone promoters; cytokines; somatotropin; bone digestors; antitumor agents; cellular attractants and attachment agents; immuno-suppressants; permeation enhancers, e.g., fatty acid esters such as laureate, myristate and stearate monoesters of polyethylene glycol, enamine derivatives, alpha-keto aldehydes, etc.; and nucleic acids. The amounts of such optionally added bioactive substances can vary widely with optimum levels being readily determined in a specific case by routine experimentation.","Diseases Treatable by Cell Transplantation","A wide range of diseases are recognized as being treatable with cellular therapies. Accordingly, also provided herein are compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs for generating cells for use in cellular therapies, such as stem cell therapies. As non-limiting examples, these include diseases marked by a failure of naturally occurring stem cells, such as aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Others include, for example: acute leukemias, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute biphenotypic leukemia and acute undifferentiated leukemia; chronic leukemias, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); myeloproliferative disorders, including acute myelofibrosis, angiogenic myeloid metaplasia (myelofibrosis), polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia; lysosomal storage diseases, including mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), Hurler's syndrome (MPS-1H), Scheie syndrome (MPS-IS), Hunter's syndrome (MPS-II), Sanfilippo syndrome (MPS-III), Morquio syndrome (MPS-IV), Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome (MPS-VI), Sly syndrome, beta-glucuronidase deficiency (MPS-VII), adrenoleukodystrophy, mucolipidosis II (I-cell Disease), Krabbe disease, Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Wolman disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy; histiocytic disorders, including familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, histiocytosis-X and hemophagocytosis; phagocyte disorders, including Chediak-Higashi syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, neutrophil actin deficiency and reticular dysgenesis; inherited platelet abnormalities, including amegakaryocytosis\/congenital thrombocytopenia; plasma cell disorders, including multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Other malignancies treatable with stem cell therapies include but are not limited to breast cancer, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma and renal cell carcinoma, among others. Also treatable with stem cell therapy are: lung disorders, including COPD and bronchial asthma; congenital immune disorders, including ataxia-telangiectasia, Kostmann syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, bare lymphocyte syndrome, Omenn's syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), SCID with adenosine deaminase deficiency, absence of T & B cells SCID, absence of T cells, normal B cell SCID, common variable immunodeficiency and X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder; other inherited disorders, including Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Glanzmann thrombasthenia, and osteopetrosis; neurological conditions, including acute and chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and epilepsy; cardiac conditions, including atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction; metabolic disorders, including diabetes; and ocular disorders including macular degeneration and optic atrophy. Such diseases or disorders can be treated either by administration of stem cells themselves, permitting in vivo differentiation to the desired cell type with or without the administration of agents to promote the desired differentiation, or by administering stem cells differentiated to the desired cell type in vitro. Efficacy of treatment is determined by a statistically significant change in one or more indicia of the targeted disease or disorder.","Dosage and Administration","Dosage and administration will vary with the condition to be treated and the therapeutic approach taken in a given instance.","Depending on the disease or disorder being treated and on the approach being taken, cells over a range of, for example, 2-5\u00d710, or more, e.g., 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 5\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 5\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 5\u00d710or more can be administered. Where differentiated cells are to be administered, the dose will most often be higher than where stem cells are administered, because differentiated cells will have reduced or limited capacity for self-renewal compared to stem cells. Repeat administration of differentiated cells may be necessary if the cells are not capable of self-renewal.","It is contemplated that cells generated by differentiation or transdifferentiation can be administered as cells in suspension, or as cells populating a matrix, scaffold, or other support to create an artificial tissue. To this end, resorbable matrices and scaffolds are known in the art, as are approaches for populating them with cells, as has been described herein. As but one example, matrices fabricated out of silk proteins are well suited as supports for cells, and are known to be well tolerated for implantation. Cells as described herein can be seeded on such matrices either alone or in combination with other cells, including autologous cells from the intended recipient, to provide the necessary environment for growth and maintenance of the cells in the desired differentiated (or non-differentiated) state. It is also contemplated that the cells generated by differentiation or transdifferentiation can be administered to a subject in need thereof, in an encapsulated form, according to known encapsulation technologies, including microencapsulation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,352,883; 4,353,888; and 5,084,350, which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference). Where the differentiated or transdifferentiated cells are encapsulated, in some embodiments the cells are encapsulated by macroencapsulation, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,284,761; 5,158,881; 4,976,859; 4,968,733; 5,800,828 and published PCT patent application WO 95\/05452, which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference. In such embodiments, cells on the order of 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 5\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 5\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 5\u00d710or more can be administered alone or on a matrix or support.","In other embodiments, cells can be suspended in a gel for administration to keep them relatively localized.","The success of treatment can be evaluated by the ordinarily skilled clinician by monitoring one or more symptoms or markers of the disease or disorder being treated by administration of the cells. Effective treatment includes any statistically significant improvement in one or more indicia of the disease or disorder. Where appropriate, a clinically accepted grade or scaling system for the given disease or disorder can be applied, with an improvement in the scale or grade being indicative of effective treatment.","In those aspects and embodiments where synthetic, modified RNAs are to be administered directly, instead of cells treated with or resulting from treatment with synthetic, modified RNA, the dosages will also vary depending upon the approach taken, the mode of delivery and the disease to be treated. For example, systemic administration without a targeting approach will generally require greater amounts of synthetic, modified RNA than either local administration or administration that employs a targeting or homing approach. Depending upon the targeted cell or tissue and the mode of delivery, effective dosages of synthetic, modified RNA can include, for example, 1 ng\/kg of body weight up to a gram or more per kg of body weight and any amount in between. Preferred amounts can be, for example, in the range of 5 \u03bcg\/kg body weight to 30 \u03bcg\/kg of body weight or any amount in between. Dosages in such ranges can be administered once, twice, three times, four times or more per day, or every two days, every three days, every four days, once a week, twice a month, once a month or less frequently over a duration of days, weeks or months, depending on the condition being treated\u2014where the therapeutic approach treats or ameliorates but does not permanently cure the disease or disorder, e.g., where the synthetic, modified RNA effects treatment of a metabolic disorder by expression of a protein that is deficient in the subject, administration of modified RNA can be repeated over time as needed. Where, instead, the synthetic, modified RNA leads to the establishment of a cell compartment that maintains itself and treats the disease or disorder, readministration may become unnecessary. Sustained release formulations of synthetic, modified RNA compositions are specifically contemplated herein. Continuous, relatively low doses are contemplated after an initial higher therapeutic dose.","A pharmaceutical composition that includes at least one synthetic, modified RNA described herein can be delivered to or administered to a subject by a variety of routes depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Exemplary routes include parenteral, intrathecal, parenchymal, intravenous, nasal, oral, and ocular delivery routes. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, or intrathecal or intraventricular administration. A synthetic, modified RNA can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. For example, compositions can include one or more synthetic, modified RNAs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. Compositions for intrathecal or intraventricular administration of synthetic, modified RNAs can include sterile aqueous solutions that can also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives.","In some embodiments, the effective dose of a synthetic, modified RNA can be administered in a single dose or in two or more doses, as desired or considered appropriate under the specific circumstances. If desired to facilitate repeated or frequent infusions, a non-implantable delivery device, e.g., needle, syringe, pen device, or implantatable delivery device, e.g., a pump, semi-permanent stent (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracisternal or intracapsular), or reservoir can be advisable. In some such embodiments, the delivery device can include a mechanism to dispense a unit dose of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA. In some embodiments, the device releases the pharmaceutical composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA continuously, e.g., by diffusion. In some embodiments, the device can include a sensor that monitors a parameter within a subject. For example, the device can include pump, e.g., and, optionally, associated electronics. Exemplary devices include stents, catheters, pumps, artificial organs or organ components (e.g., artificial heart, a heart valve, etc.), and sutures.","As used herein, \u201ctopical delivery\u201d can refer to the direct application of a synthetic, modified RNA to any surface of the body, including the eye, a mucous membrane, surfaces of a body cavity, or to any internal surface. Formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, sprays, and liquids. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Topical administration can also be used as a means to selectively deliver the synthetic, modified RNA to the epidermis or dermis of a subject, or to specific strata thereof, or to an underlying tissue.","Formulations for parenteral administration can include sterile aqueous solutions which can also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic.","A synthetic, modified RNA can be administered to a subject by pulmonary delivery. Pulmonary delivery compositions can be delivered by inhalation by the patient of a dispersion so that the composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA, within the dispersion can reach the lung where it can be readily absorbed through the alveolar region directly into the lung cells to directly transfect the lung cells, and\/or enter the blood circulation. Direct transfection by inhalation will allow expression of a desired protein, for example CFTR, by the transfected lung cells. Accordingly, pulmonary delivery can be effective both for systemic delivery and for localized delivery to treat diseases of the lungs. Pulmonary delivery can be achieved by different approaches, including the use of nebulized, aerosolized, micellular and dry powder-based formulations of the compositions comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein. Delivery can be achieved with liquid nebulizers, aerosol-based inhalers, and dry powder dispersion devices. Metered-dose devices are preferred. One of the benefits of using an atomizer or inhaler is that the potential for contamination is minimized because the devices are self contained. Dry powder dispersion devices, for example, deliver drugs that can be readily formulated as dry powders. A synthetic, modified RNA composition can be stably stored as lyophilized or spray-dried powders by itself or in combination with suitable powder carriers. The delivery of a composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA for inhalation can be mediated by a dosing timing element which can include a timer, a dose counter, time measuring device, or a time indicator which when incorporated into the device enables dose tracking, compliance monitoring, and\/or dose triggering to a patient during administration of the aerosol medicament.","A synthetic, modified RNA can be modified such that it is capable of traversing the blood brain barrier. For example, the synthetic, modified RNA can be conjugated to a molecule that enables the agent to traverse the barrier. Such conjugated synthetic, modified RNA can be administered by any desired method, such as by intraventricular or intramuscular injection, or by pulmonary delivery, for example.","A composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA described herein can also be delivered through the use of implanted, indwelling catheters that provide a means for injecting small volumes of fluid containing the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein directly into local tissues. The proximal end of these catheters can be connected to an implanted, access port surgically affixed to the patient's body, or to an implanted drug pump located in, for example, the patient's torso.","Alternatively, implantable delivery devices, such as an implantable pump can be employed. Examples of the delivery devices for use with the compositions comprising a synthetic, modified RNA described herein include the Model 8506 investigational device (by Medtronic, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn.), which can be implanted subcutaneously in the body or on the cranium, and provides an access port through which therapeutic agents can be delivered. In addition to the aforementioned device, the delivery of the compositions comprising a synthetic, modified RNA described herein can be accomplished with a wide variety of devices, including but not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,735,814, 5,814,014, and 6,042,579, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Using the teachings described herein, those of skill in the art will recognize that these and other devices and systems can be suitable for delivery of compositions comprising the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein.","In some such embodiments, the delivery system further comprises implanting a pump outside the body, the pump coupled to a proximal end of the catheter, and operating the pump to deliver the predetermined dosage of a composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA described herein through the discharge portion of the catheter. A further embodiment comprises periodically refreshing a supply of the composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA to the pump outside the body.","A synthetic, modified RNA can be administered ocularly, such as to treat retinal disorders, e.g., a retinopathy. For example, the pharmaceutical compositions can be applied to the surface of the eye or nearby tissue, e.g., the inside of the eyelid. They can be applied topically, e.g., by spraying, in drops, as an eyewash, or an ointment. Ointments or droppable liquids can be delivered by ocular delivery systems known in the art, such as applicators or eye droppers. Such compositions can include mucomimetics such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or poly(vinyl alcohol), preservatives such as sorbic acid, EDTA or benzylchronium chloride, and the usual quantities of diluents and\/or carriers. The pharmaceutical composition can also be administered to the interior of the eye, and can be introduced by a needle or other delivery device which can introduce it to a selected area or structure. The composition containing the synthetic, modified RNA can also be applied via an ocular patch.","A synthetic, modified RNA can be administered by an oral or nasal delivery. For example, drugs administered through these membranes have a rapid onset of action, provide therapeutic plasma levels, avoid first pass effect of hepatic metabolism, and avoid exposure of the drug to the hostile gastrointestinal (GI) environment. Additional advantages include easy access to the membrane sites so that the drug can be applied, localized and removed easily.","Administration of a composition comprising a synthetic, modified RNA can be provided by the subject or by another person, e.g., a another caregiver. A caregiver can be any entity involved with providing care to the human: for example, a hospital, hospice, doctor's office, outpatient clinic; a healthcare worker such as a doctor, nurse, or other practitioner; or a spouse or guardian, such as a parent. The medication can be provided in measured doses or in a dispenser which delivers a metered dose.","Where cells expressing proteins encoded by synthetic, modified RNA as described herein are administered to treat a malignancy or disease or disorder, the dose of cells administered will also vary with the therapeutic approach. For example, where the cell expresses a death ligand targeting the tumor cell, the dosage of cells administered will vary with the mode of their administration, e.g., local or systemic (smaller doses are required for local), and with the size of the tumor being treated\u2014generally more cells or more frequent administration is warranted for larger tumors versus smaller ones. The amount of cells administered will also vary with the level of expression of the polypeptide or polypeptides encoded by the modified RNA\u2014this is equally true of the administration of cells expressing proteins encoded by modified RNA for any purpose described herein. An important advantage of the methods described herein is that where, for example, more than one factor or polypeptide is expressed from a modified RNA introduced to a cell, the relative dosage of the expressed proteins can be tuned in a straightforward manner by adjusting the relative amounts of the modified RNAs introduced to the cell or subject. This is in contrast to the difficulty of tuning the expression of even a single gene product in a cell transduced with a viral or even a plasmid vector.","Therapeutic compositions containing at least one synthetic, modified-NA can be conventionally administered in a unit dose. The term \u201cunit dose\u201d when used in reference to a therapeutic composition refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required physiologically acceptable diluent, i.e., carrier, or vehicle.","The compositions are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in a therapeutically effective amount. The quantity to be administered and timing depends on the subject to be treated, capacity of the subject's system to utilize the active ingredient, and degree of therapeutic effect desired.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","The present invention involves therapeutic compositions useful for practicing the therapeutic methods described herein. Therapeutic compositions contain a physiologically tolerable carrier together with an active compound (synthetic, modified RNA, a cell transfected with a synthetic, modified RNA, or a cell differentiated, de-differentiated or transdifferentiated with a synthetic, modified RNA) as described herein, dissolved or dispersed therein as an active ingredient. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic composition is not immunogenic when administered to a mammal or human patient for therapeutic purposes, unless so desired. As used herein, the terms \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable,\u201d \u201cphysiologically tolerable,\u201d and grammatical variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents, are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable or unacceptable physiological effects such as toxicity, nausea, dizziness, gastric upset, immune reaction and the like. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will not promote the raising of an immune response to an agent with which it is admixed, unless so desired. The preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited based on formulation. Typically such compositions are prepared as injectable either as liquid solutions or suspensions, however, particularly where synthetic, modified RNA itself is administered, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified or presented as a liposome composition. The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient. Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Saline-based carriers are most useful for the administration of cells or cell preparations. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes.","Kits","Provided herein are kits comprising synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein and kits for preparing such synthetic, modified RNAs.","Provided herein, in some aspects, are kits for altering the phenotype or the developmental potential of a cell, and comprise (a) a synthetic, modified RNA composition comprising at least one synthetic, modified RNA molecule comprising: (i) a 5\u2032 cap, (ii) an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide, and (iii) at least one modified nucleoside, and (b) packaging and instructions therefor.","In one embodiment of this aspect, the synthetic, modified RNA composition can further comprise a 3\u2032 untranslated region (e.g., murine alpha-globin 3\u2032 untranslated region) to enhance the stability of the synthetic, modified RNA.

In some embodiments, the device can include a sensor that monitors a parameter within a subject. For example, the device can include pump, e.g., and, optionally, associated electronics.","Screening Methods","The ability to safely and efficiently reprogram, differentiate, transdifferentiate cells using the synthetic, modified RNAs compositions and methods thereof described herein, as well as generate engineered tissues using such cells, compositions and methods, has high applicability for use in high-throughput screening technologies of disease model systems and assays for the characterization of candidate agents for identifying novel agents for use in the treatment of human disease. Such screening methods and platforms can be used, for example, to identify novel agents for treating a desired disorder; to identify novel agents involved in reprogramming and differentiation, and\/or alteration\/maintenance of developmental states; or to identify effects of a candidate agent on one or more parameters of a particular cell type or engineered tissue generated using the compositions and methods described herein. Characterization of candidate agents can include aspects such as compound development, identifying cell-specific toxicity and cell-specific survival, and assessments of compound safety, compound efficacy, and dose-response parameters. For example, an engineered myocardium tissue can be contacted with a test agent, and the effect, if any, of the test agent on a parameter, such as an electrophysiological parameter, associated with normal or abnormal myocardium function, such as contractibility, including frequency and force of contraction, can be determined, or e.g., whether the agent has a cardiotoxic effect.","The drug discovery process is time-consuming and costly, in part owing to the high rate of attrition of compounds in clinical trials. Thus, modifications and alternative platforms that could accelerate the advancement of promising drug candidates, or reduce the likelihood of failure, would be extremely valuable. High-throughput screening technologies refer to the platforms and assays used to rapidly test thousands of compounds. For example, reporter systems used in cell lines can be used to assess whether compounds activate particular signaling pathways of interest.","The compositions and methods using synthetic, modified RNAs for reprogramming, differentiating, and transdifferentiating cells, as well as generating engineered tissues, described herein provide a reliable source of cells that can be generated and expanded in an efficient manner to quantities necessary for drug screening and toxicology studies. Further, because the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein minimize the cellular interferon responses, and do not result in permanent genome modifications, the effects of a candidate agent can be studied with minimal confounding factors. As has been described herein, cells can be differentiated to generate specific cell types (for example, neurons, blood cells, pancreatic islet cells, muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes), and induced pluripotent stem cells can be generated from patients with specific diseases, such as, for example, a patient with cystic fibrosis, as demonstrated herein.","One particular advantage of cells and engineered tissues generated using the compositions, methods, and kits comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein for use in screening platforms, is that from a single and potentially limitless starting source, most of the major cells within the human body that could be affected by a drug or other agent can be produced. Such cells provide a better predictive model of both drug efficacy and toxicity than rodent cell lines or immortalized human cell lines that are currently used in high-throughput screens. While such immortalized cell and animal models have contributed a wealth of information about the complexity of various disease processes, compounds that show a significant benefit in such models can fail to show effectiveness in clinical trials. For example, use of a transgenic mouse that overexpresses mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD), a gene found to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, enabled the identification of several compounds that alter disease characteristics, including vitamin E and creatine. However, when these compounds were tested in humans, no clinical improvements were observed (A. D. Ebert and C. N. Svendsen, \u201cHuman stem cells and drug screening: opportunities and challenges.\u201d 2010 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 9, p. 1-6). Furthermore, toxic effects of compounds are often missed in cell and animal models due to specific interactions with human biological processes that cannot be recapitulated in these systems.","Accordingly, in some aspects, the compositions comprising synthetic, modified RNAs, and the methods described herein, can be used for evaluating the effects of novel candidate agents and compounds on specific human cell types that are relevant to drug toxicity effects. In some embodiments, cells can be induced to undergo differentiation to a particular cell type or tissue, using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, that the test drug or compound is discovered or known to affect, and then used for performing dose-response toxicity studies. In such embodiments, human stem cells, such as iPS cells, derived from patients can be exposed to appropriate differentiation factors using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein, and instructed to form the various cell types found in the human body, which could then be useful for assessing multiple cellular parameters and characteristics upon exposure to a candidate agent or compound. For example, the cells could be used to assess the effects of drug candidates on functional cardiomyocytes, or on cardiomyocytes having a specific genetic mutation, because drug development is often stalled by adverse cardiac effects. Thus, measurable disruption of electrophysiological properties by known and novel agents and compounds can be assessed in a clinically relevant, consistent, and renewable cell source. Also, for example, such cells can be used to identify metabolic biomarkers in neural tissues derived from human stem cells after toxin exposure. Such embodiments allow potentially toxic compounds to be eliminated at an early stage of the drug discovery process, allowing efforts to be directed to more promising candidates. As another example, islet cells generated using the methods and compositions comprising synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can be used to screen candidate agents (such as solvents, small molecule drugs, peptides, polynucleotides) or environmental conditions (such as culture conditions or manipulation) that affect the characteristics of islet precursor cells and their various progeny. For example, islet cell clusters or homogeneous \u03b2 cell preparations can be tested for the effect of candidate agents, such as small molecule drugs, that have the potential to up- or down-regulate insulin synthesis or secretion. The cells are combined with the candidate agent, and then monitored for change in expression or secretion rate of insulin, using, for example, RT-PCR or immunoassay of the culture medium.","In other aspects, the compositions comprising synthetic, modified RNAs, and the methods thereof described herein, are used in differentiation screens, i.e., for identifying compounds that increase self-renewal or differentiation, promote maturation, or enhance cell survival of cells, such as stem cells, differentiated cells, or cancer cells.","In other aspects, the compositions comprising the synthetic, modified RNAs, and the methods thereof, described herein, can be used to screen for drugs that may correct an observed disease phenotype. In such aspects, cells can be expanded, differentiated into the desired cell type using synthetic, modified RNAs, and then used to screen for drugs that may correct the observed disease phenotype. A candidate agent or drug can be used to directly contact the surface of a reprogrammed, differentiated, transdifferentiated cell population, or engineered tissue by applying the candidate agent to a media surrounding the cell or engineered tissue. Alternatively, a candidate agent can be intracellular as a result of introduction of the candidate agent into a cell.","As used herein, \u201ccellular parameters\u201d refer to quantifiable components of cells or engineered tissues, particularly components that can be accurately measured, most desirably in a high-throughput system. A cellular parameter can be any measurable parameter related to a phenotype, function, or behavior of a cell or engineered tissue. Such cellular parameters include, changes in characteristics and markers of a cell or cell population, including but not limited to changes in viability, cell growth, expression of one or more or a combination of markers, such as cell surface determinants, such as receptors, proteins, including conformational or posttranslational modification thereof, lipids, carbohydrates, organic or inorganic molecules, nucleic acids, e.g. mRNA, DNA, global gene expression patterns, etc. Such cellular parameters can be measured using any of a variety of assays known to one of skill in the art. For example, viability and cell growth can be measured by assays such as Trypan blue exclusion, CFSE dilution, and H incorporation. Expression of protein or polyeptide markers can be measured, for example, using flow cytometric assays, Western blot techniques, or microscopy methods. Gene expression profiles can be assayed, for example, using microarray methodologies and quantitative or semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays. A cellular parameter can also refer to a functional parameter, such as a metabolic parameter (e.g., expression or secretion of a hormone, such as insulin or glucagon, or an enzyme, such as carboxypeptidase), an electrophysiological parameter (e.g., contractibility, such as frequency and force of mechanical contraction of a muscle cell; action potentials; conduction, such as conduction velocity), or an immunomodulatory parameter (e.g., expression or secretion of a cytokine or chemokine, such as an interferon, or an interleukin; expression or secretion of an antibody; expression or secretion of a cytotoxin, such as perforin, a granzyme, and granulysin; and phagocytosis).","The \u201ccandidate agent\u201d used in the screening methods described herein can be selected from a group of a chemical, small molecule, chemical entity, nucleic acid sequences, an action; nucleic acid analogues or protein or polypeptide or analogue of fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA, and nucleic acid analogues, for example can be PNA, pcPNA and LNA. A nucleic acid may be single or double stranded, and can be selected from a group comprising; nucleic acid encoding a protein of interest, oligonucleotides, PNA, etc. Such nucleic acid sequences include, for example, but not limited to, nucleic acid sequence encoding proteins that act as transcriptional repressors, antisense molecules, ribozymes, small inhibitory nucleic acid sequences, for example but not limited to RNAi, shRNAi, siRNA, micro RNAi (mRNAi), antisense oligonucleotides etc. A protein and\/or peptide agent or fragment thereof, can be any protein of interest, for example, but not limited to; mutated proteins; therapeutic proteins; truncated proteins, wherein the protein is normally absent or expressed at lower levels in the cell. Proteins of interest can be selected from a group comprising; mutated proteins, genetically engineered proteins, peptides, synthetic peptides, recombinant proteins, chimeric proteins, antibodies, humanized proteins, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, modified proteins and fragments thereof. A candidate agent also includes any chemical, entity or moiety, including without limitation synthetic and naturally-occurring non-proteinaceous entities. In certain embodiments, the candidate agent is a small molecule having a chemical moiety. Such chemical moieties can include, for example, unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, aromatic, or heterocyclyl moieties and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, frequently at least two of the functional chemical groups, including macrolides, leptomycins and related natural products or analogues thereof. Candidate agents can be known to have a desired activity and\/or property, or can be selected from a library of diverse compounds.","Also included as candidate agents are pharmacologically active drugs, genetically active molecules, etc. Such candidate agents of interest include, for example, chemotherapeutic agents, hormones or hormone antagonists, growth factors or recombinant growth factors and fragments and variants thereof. Exemplary of pharmaceutical agents suitable for use with the screening methods described herein are those described in, \u201cThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,\u201d Goodman and Gilman, McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y., (1996), Ninth edition, under the sections: Water, Salts and Ions; Drugs Affecting Renal Function and Electrolyte Metabolism; Drugs Affecting Gastrointestinal Function; Chemotherapy of Microbial Diseases; Chemotherapy of Neoplastic Diseases; Drugs Acting on Blood-Forming organs; Hormones and Hormone Antagonists; Vitamins, Dermatology; and Toxicology, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Also included are toxins, and biological and chemical warfare agents, for example see Somani, S. M.

For example, numerous means are available for random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds, including biomolecules, including expression of randomized oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily produced. Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical and biochemical means, and may be used to produce combinatorial libraries. Known pharmacological agents may be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, amidification, etc. to produce structural analogs. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the candidate compounds for use in the screening methods described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock (1989) Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers; T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference.","Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: DeWitt et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6909; Erb et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11422; Zuckermann et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:2678; Cho et al. (1993) Science 261:1303; Carrell et al.

Polypeptides useful with the methods described herein include, but are not limited to, transcription factors, targeting moieties and other cell-surface polypeptides, cell-type specific polypeptides, differentiation factors, death receptors, death receptor ligands, reprogramming factors, and\/or de-differentiation factors.","Transcription Factors","In some embodiments, a synthetic, modified RNA or composition thereof encodes for a transcription factor. As used herein the term \u201ctranscription factor\u201d refers to a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences and thereby controls the transfer (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. In one embodiment, the transcription factor encoded by the synthetic, modified RNA is a human transcription factor, such as those described in e.g., Messina D M, et al. (2004) 14(10B):2041-2047, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Some non-limiting examples of human transcription factors (and their mRNA IDs and sequence identifiers) for use

FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) gene encodes for a protein involved in immune system responses. A member of the FOX protein family, FOXP3 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the development and function of regulatory T cells. The induction or administration of Foxp3 positive T cells in animal studies indicate marked reductions in (autoimmune) disease severity in models of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroiditis and renal disease.","The FoxP3 protein can be expressed in a cell using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein.","Targeting Moiety","As used herein, the term \u201ctargeting moiety\u201d refers to an agent that directs a composition to a particular tissue, cell type, receptor, or other area of interest. As per this definition, a targeting moiety can be attached directly to a synthetic, modified RNA or indirectly to a composition used for delivering a synthetic, modified RNA (e.g., a liposome, polymer etc) to direct expression in a particular cell etc. A targeting moiety can also be encoded or expressed by a synthetic, modified-NA as described herein, such that a cell expresses a targeting moiety on it surface, permitting a cell to be targeted to a desired tissue, organ etc. For the avoidance of confusion, targeting moieties expressed on a cell surface are referred to herein as \u201choming moieties.\u201d","Non-limiting examples of a targeting moiety or homing moiety include, but are not limited to, an oligonucleotide, an antigen, an antibody or functional fragment thereof, a ligand, a cell-surface receptor, a membrane-bound molecule, one member of a specific binding pair, a polyamide including a peptide having affinity for a biological receptor, an oligosaccharide, a polysaccharide, a steroid or steroid derivative, a hormone, e.g., estradiol or histamine, a hormone-mimic, e.g., morphine, or hormone-receptor, or other compound having binding specificity for a target. In the methods of the present invention, a targeting moiety promotes transport or preferential localization of a synthetic, modified RNA to a target cell, while a homing moiety permits the targeting of a cell modified using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein to a particular tissue in vivo. It is contemplated herein that the homing moiety can be also encoded in a cell by a synthetic, modified RNA as described herein.","A synthetic, modified RNA or composition thereof can be targeted by means of a targeting moiety, including, e.g., an antibody or targeted liposome technology. In some embodiments, a synthetic, modified RNA or composition thereof is targeted to a specific tissue by using bispecific antibodies, for example produced by chemical linkage of an anti-ligand antibody (Ab) and an Ab directed toward a specific target. To avoid the limitations of chemical conjugates, molecular conjugates of antibodies can be used for production of recombinant, bispecific single-chain Abs directing ligands and\/or chimeric inhibitors at cell surface molecules. The addition of an antibody to a synthetic, modified RNA composition permits the agent attached to accumulate additively at the desired target site. Antibody-based or non-antibody-based targeting moieties can be employed to deliver a ligand or the inhibitor to a target site. Preferably, a natural binding agent for an unregulated or disease associated antigen is used for this purpose.","Table 2 and Table 3 provide non-limiting examples of CD (\u201ccluster of differentiation\u201d) molecules and other cell-surface\/membrane bound molecules and receptors, such as transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, ABC transporters, and integrins, that can be expressed using the synthetic, modified RNA compositions and methods described herein for targeting and homing to cells of interest, or for changing the phenotype of a

a polypeptide that is expressed in a cell having a particular phenotype (e.g., a muscle cell) but is not generally expressed in other cell types with different phenotypes. For example, MyoD is expressed specifically in muscle cells but not in non-muscle cells, thus MyoD is a cell-type specific polypeptide. As another example, albumin is expressed in hepatocytes and is thus an hepatocyte-specific polypeptide.","Such cell-specific polypeptides are well known in the art or can be found using a gene array analysis and comparison of at least two different cell types. Methods for gene expressional array analysis is well known in the art.","Differentiation factors, reprogramming factors and transdifferentiation factors are further discussed herein in their appropriate sub-sections.","Death Receptors and Death Receptor Ligands","By \u201cdeath receptor\u201d is meant a receptor that induces cellular apoptosis once bound by a ligand. Death receptors include, for example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily members having death domains (e.g., TNFR1, Fas, DR3, 4, 5, 6) and TNF receptor superfamily members without death domains LTbetaR, CD40, CD27, HVEM. Death receptors and death receptor ligands are well known in the art or are discussed herein.","The synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can encode for death receptors to be expressed on the surface of a cell to enhance the vulnerability of a cell to apoptosis. The death ligand can also be encoded or can be provided e.g., at a tumor site. This is particularly useful in the treatment of cancer, where cells evade apoptosis and continue to divide. Alternatively, the synthetic, modified RNAs or compositions thereof can encode for a death receptor ligand, which will induce apoptosis in cells that express a cell surface death receptor and can increase the efficiency of programmed cell death in targeted cells of a subject.","Some non-limiting examples of death receptors include FAS (CD95, Apo1), TNFR1 (p55, CD120a), DR3 (Apo3, WSL-1, TRAMP, LARD), DR4, DR5 (Apo2, TRAIL-R2, TRICK2, KILLER), CAR1, and the adaptor molecules FADD, TRADD, and DAXX. Some non-limiting examples of death receptor ligands include FASL (CD95L), TNF, lymphotoxin alpha, Apo3L (TWEAK), and TRAIL (Apo2L).","Mitogen Receptors","The synthetic, modified RNAs described herein can be used to express a mitogen receptor on a cell surface. Activation of a mitogen receptor with the mitogen induces cell growth and\/or differentiation of the cell.","Mitogen receptors include those that bind ligands including, but not limited to: insulin, insulin-like growth factor (e.g., IGF1, IGF2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and -beta, among others.","In addition, cytokines that promote cell growth can also be encoded by synthetic, modified RNAs herein. For example, cytokines such as erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and other cytokines from the IL-2 sub-family tend to induce cell proliferation and growth.","Protein Therapeutics","Synthetic, modified RNAs as described herein can also be used to express protein therapeutically in cells by either administration of a synthetic, modified RNA composition to an individual or by administering a synthetic, modified RNA to cells that are then introduced to an individual. In one aspect, cells can be transfected with a modified RNA to express a therapeutic protein using an ex vivo approach in which cells are removed from a patient, transfected by e.g., electroporation or lipofection, and re-introduced to the patient. Continuous or prolonged administration in this manner can be achieved by electroporation of blood cells that are re-infused to the patient.","Some exemplary protein therapeutics include, but are not limited to: insulin, growth hormone, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), thrombopoietin, clotting factor VII, Factor IX, interferon, glucocerebrosidase, anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, and Etanercept, among others.","As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus for example, references to \u201cthe method\u201d includes one or more methods, and\/or steps of the type described herein and\/or which will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure and so forth. In addition, the term \u2018cell\u2019 can be construed as a cell population, which can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous in nature, and can also refer to an aggregate of cells.","It is understood that the foregoing detailed description and the following examples are illustrative only and are not to be taken as limitations upon the scope of the invention. Various changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments, which will be apparent to those of skill in the art, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Further, all patents, patent applications, and publications identified are expressly incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the methodologies described in such publications that might be used in connection with the present invention. These publications are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing in this regard should be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention or for any other reason. All statements as to the date or representation as to the contents of these documents are based on the information available to the applicants and do not constitute any admission as to the correctness of the dates or contents of these documents.","All references cited herein in the specification are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Currently, clinical applications using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are impeded by low efficiency of iPS derivation, and the use of protocols that permanently modify the genome to effect cellular reprogramming. Moreover, safe, reliable, and effective means of directing the fate of patient-specific iPS cells towards clinically useful cell types are lacking. Described herein are novel, non-mutagenic strategies for altering cellular phenotypes, such as reprogramming cell fate, based on the administration of synthetic, modified mRNAs that are modified to overcome innate cellular anti-viral responses. The compositions and approaches described herein can be used to reprogram multiple human cell types to pluripotency with surprising and unexpected efficiencies that greatly surpass established protocols. Also described herein are novel compositions and methods for directing the fate of cells towards clinically useful cell types, and a non-limiting example that demonstrates that this technology can be used to efficiently direct the differentiation of RNA-induced pluripotent stem (RiPS) cells into terminally differentiated myogenic cells. Thus, the compositions and methods described herein represent safe, highly efficient strategies for altering cellular developmental potentials, such as somatic cell reprogramming and directing differentiated cell fates, that have broad applicability for basic research, disease modeling and regenerative and personalized medicine.","Experimental Procedures","Construction of IVT Templates","The pipeline for production of IVT template constructs and subsequent RNA synthesis is schematized in . The oligonucleotide sequences used in the construction of IVT templates are shown in Table 4. All oligos were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). ORF PCRs were templated from plasmids bearing human KLF4, c-MYC, OCT4, SOX2, human ES cDNA (LIN28), Clontech pIRES-eGFP (eGFP), pRVGP (d2eGFP) and CMV-MyoD from Addgene. The ORF of the low-stability nuclear GFP was constructed by combining the d2eGFP ORF with a 3\u2032 nuclear localization sequence. PCR reactions were performed using HiFi Hotstart (KAPA Biosystems, Woburn, Mass.) per the manufacturer's instructions. Splint-mediated ligations were carried out using Ampligase Thermostable DNA Ligase (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, Wis.). UTR ligations were conducted in the presence of 200 nM UTR oligos and 100 nM splint oligos, using 5 cycles of the following annealing profile: 95\u00b0 C. for 10 seconds; 45\u00b0 C. for 1 minute; 50\u00b0 C. for 1 minute; 55\u00b0 C. for 1 minute; 60\u00b0 C. for 1 minute. A phosphorylated forward primer was employed in the ORF PCRs to facilitate ligation of the top strand to the 5\u2032 UTR fragment. The 3\u2032 UTR fragment was also 5\u2032-phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.). All intermediate PCR and ligation products were purified using QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) before further processing. Template PCR amplicons were sub-cloned using the pcDNA 3,3-TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Plasmid inserts were excised by restriction digest and recovered with SizeSelect gels (Invitrogen) before being used to template tail PCRs.","5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR oligos are ligated to the top strand of gene-specific ORF amplicons to produce a basic template construct for cloning. Underlined bases in the 5\u2032 UTR oligo sequence indicate the upstream T7 promoter, and in the 3\u2032 UTR oligo sequence show downstream restriction sites, introduced to facilitate linearization of template plasmids. Template PCR primers are used to amplify ligation products for sub-cloning. Tail PCR primers are used to append an oligo(dT) sequence immediately after the 3\u2032 UTR to drive templated addition of a poly(A) tail during IVT reactions. Gene-specific ORF primers are used to capture the coding region (minus the start codon) from cDNA templates. Splint oligos mediate ligation of UTR oligos to the top strand of ORF

Media was replaced daily, four hours after transfection, and supplemented with 100 ng\/mL bFGF (Stemgent) and 200 ng\/mL B18R before use. Where applied, VPA was added to media at 1 mM final concentration on days 8-15 of reprogramming. Low-oxygen culture experiments were carried out in a NAPCO 8000 WJ incubator (Thermo Scientific) supplied by NF300 compressed nitrogen cylinders (Airgas, Radnor, Pa.). Media were equilibrated at 5% Ofor approximately 4 hours before use. Cultures were passaged using TrypLE Select recombinant protease (Invitrogen). Y27632 ROCK inhibitor (Watanabe et al., 2007) was purchased from Stemgent and included at 10 uM in recipient plates until the next media change, except where otherwise indicated. The daily RNA dose applied in the RiPS derivations was 1200 ng per well (6-well plate format) or 8 ug to a 10-cm dish.","For the RNA vs. retrovirus trial, both arms of the experiment were started with the same number of dH1f cells, and the passaging of the cultures was synchronized. Starting cultures were seeded with 100,000 cells in individual wells of a 6-well plate using fibroblast media (DMEM+10% FBS). The following day (day 1) KMOS RNA transfections were initiated in the RNA plate, and the viral plate was transduced with a KMOS retroviral cocktail (MOI=5 for each virus). All wells were passaged on day 6, using split ratios of 1:6 for the RNA wells and 1:3 for the virus wells. The conditions applied in the RNA arm of the trial were as in the initial RiPS derivation, including the use of Nutristem supplemented with 100 ng\/mL bFGF, 5% O2 culture, and human fibroblast feeders. Ambient oxygen tension and other conventional iPS derivation conditions were used in the viral arm, the cells being grown in fibroblast media without feeders until the day 6 split, then being replated onto CF1 MEF feeders (GlobalStem) with a switch to hES media based on Knockout Serum Replacement (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 ng\/mL bFGF.","Culture of RiPS Cell Colonies","Emerging RiPS cell colonies were picked and clonally transferred to MEF-coated 24-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.) with standard hES medium containing 5 uM Y27632 (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, Pa.). The hES media comprised DMEM\/F12 supplemented with 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 10 ng\/mL of bFGF (Gembio, West Sacramento, Calif.), 1\u00d7 non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM \u03b2-ME (Sigma), 1 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), plus antibiotics. Clones were mechanically passaged once more to MEF-coated 6-well plates (Nunc), and then expanded using enzymatic passaging with collagenase IV (Invitrogen). For RNA and DNA preparation, cells were plated onto hES-qualified Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in mTeSR (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC), and further expanded by enzymatic passaging using dispase (Stem Cell Technologies).","Immunostaining of Pluripotency Markers","For fixed-cell imaging, RiPS colonies were mechanically picked and plated onto MEF feeders in black 96-well plates (Matrix Technologies, Maumee, Ohio). Two days post-plating, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. After 3 PBS washes, cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X (Sigma) in PBS for 30 minutes to allow nuclear permeation. Cells were washed 3\u00d7 in PBS and blocked in blocking buffer containing 3% BSA (Invitrogen) and 5% donkey serum (Sigma) for 2 hours at room temperature. After three PBS washes, cells were stained in blocking buffer with primary and conjugated antibodies at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. After washing 3\u00d7 with PBS, cells were stained with secondary antibodies and 1 ug\/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 3 hours at 4\u00b0 C. or for 1 hour at room temperature, protected from light. Cells were washed 3\u00d7 with PBS before visualization. The following antibodies were used, at 1:100 dilution:TRA-1-60-Alexa Fluor 647, TRA-1-81-Alexa Fluor 488, SSEA-4-Alexa Fluor 647, and SSEA-3-Alexa 488 (BD Biosciences). Primary OCT4 and NANOG antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.) were used at 0.5 ug\/mL, and an anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was used as the secondary. Images were acquired with a Pathway 435 bioimager (BD Biosciences) using a 10\u00d7 objective. Live imaging was performed as described previously (Chan et al., 2009). Briefly, wells were stained by adding 1:100-diluted TRA-1-60-Alexa 647 and SSEA-4-Alexa 555 antibodies (BD Biosciences) to culture media. After 1.5 hours, Hoechst 33342 was added at a final concentration of 0.25 ug\/mL, and wells were incubated for an additional 30 minutes. Wells were washed 3\u00d7 with DMEM\/F12 base media lacking phenol red, and imaged in hES media lacking phenol red. Images were acquired with a Pathway 435 bioimager using 4\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 objectives. Post-acquisition image processing and analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop for pseudocoloring and ImageJ (http:\/\/rsbweb.nih.gov\/ij) for flat-field correction, background subtraction, and colony quantitation.","For pluripotency factor time course experiments, transfected human epidermal keratinocytes were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Fixed cells were washed with 0.1M glycine, then blocked and permeabilized in PBS\/0.5% saponin\/1% goat serum (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, Pa.) for 20 minutes. Cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 1:100 diluted primary antibodies for KLF4, OCT4, SOX2 (Stemgent), washed, then for 45 minutes at room temperature with 1:200-diluted DyLight 488-labeled secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM and goat anti-rabbit IgG). Cells suspended in PBS were analyzed by flow cytometry.","Gene Expression Analysis","RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was primed with oligo(dT) primers and qPCR was performed with primer sets as described previously (Park et al., 2008), using Brilliant SYBR Green master mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). For the microarray analysis, RNA probes were prepared and hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.) per the manufacturer's instructions. Arrays were processed by the Coriell Institute Genotyping and Microarray Center (Camden, N.J.). Microarray data will be uploaded to the GEO database. Gene expression levels were normalized with the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using the Euclidean distance with average linkage method. The similarity metric for comparison between different cell lines is indicated on the height of cluster dendrogram.","Bisulfite Sequencing","DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was carried out using EZ DNA Methylation\u2122 Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For pyrosequencing analysis, the bisulfite treated DNA was first amplified by HotStar Taq Polymerase (Qiagen) for 45 cycles of (95\u00b0 C. 30 s; 53\u00b0 C. 30 s; 72\u00b0 C. 30 s). The analysis was performed by EpigenDx using the PSQ\u212296HS system according to standard procedures using primers that were developed by EpigenDx for the CpG sites at positions (\u221250) to (+96) from the start codon of the OCT4 gene.","Tri-Lineage Differentiation","Embryoid body (EB) hematopoietic differentiation was performed as previously described (Chadwick et al., 2003). Briefly, RiPS cells and hES cell controls were passaged with collagenase IV and transferred (3:1) in differentiation medium to 6-well low-attachment plates and placed on a shaker in a 37\u00b0 C. incubator overnight. Starting the next day, media was supplemented with the following hematopoietic cytokines: 10 ng\/mL of interleukin-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) and interleukin-6 (R&D), 50 ng\/mL of G-CSF (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.) and BMP-4 (R&D), and 300 ng\/mL of SCF (Amgen) and Flt-3 (R&D). Media was changed every 3 days. On day 14 of differentiation, EBs were dissociated with collagenase B (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.). 2\u00d710differentiated cells were plated into methylcellulose H4434 (Stem Cell Technologies) and transferred using a blunt needle onto 35 mm dishes (Stem Cell Technologies) in triplicate and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 5\u00b0 CO2 for 14 days. Colony Forming Units (CFUs) were scored based on morphological characteristics.","For neuronal differentiation, cells were differentiated at 70% confluency as a monolayer in neuronal differentiation medium (DMEM\/F12, Glutamax 1%, B27-Supplement 1%, N2-Supplement 2%, P\/S 1% and noggin 20 ng\/ml). After 7 days neuronal structures were visible. For endoderm differentiation (AFP stain), cells were differentiated as a monolayer in endoderm differentiation medium (DMEM, B27(-RA) and 100 ng\/ml activin-a) for 7 days, then switched to growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% P\/S) and continued differentiation for 7 days. Primary antibodies used in immunostaining were as follows: Anti-\u03b2-Tubulin III (Tuj1rabbit anti-human (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 1:500; AFP (h-140) rabbit polyclonal IgG, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.), 1:100 dilution. All secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594 and raised in donkey.","For cardiomyocyte differentiation, colonies were digested at 70% confluency using dispase and placed in suspension culture for embryoid body (EB) formation in differentiation medium (DMEM, 15% FBS, 100 uM ascorbic acid). After 11 days, EBs were plated to adherent conditions using gelatin and the same medium. Beating cardiomyocytes were observed 3 days after replating.","For the teratoma assay, 2.5\u00d710cells were harvested, spun down, and all excess media was removed. In a 20-week old female SCID mouse, the capsule of the right kidney was gently elevated, and one droplet of concentrated cells was inserted under the capsule. At week 6, when adequate tumor size was observed, the tumor was harvested, fixed in 4% PFA, run through an ethanol gradient, and stored in 70% ethanol. Specimens were sectioned and H&E staining. Slides were imaged with a Leica light microscope.","Myogenic Differentiation of RiPS Cells","Validated RiPS cells were plated into wells coated with 0.1% gelatin (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.), and cultured in DMEM+10% FBS for 4 weeks with passaging every 4-6 days using trypsin. The culture media was switched to Opti-MEM+2% FBS, and the cells were transfected with modified RNA encoding either murine MYOD or GFP the following day, and for the following two days. Media was supplemented with B18R, and replaced 4 hours after each transfection. After the third and final transfection, the media was switched to DMEM+3% horse serum, and cultures were incubated for a further 3 days. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA and immuno-stained as previously described (Shea et al., 2010). The percentage of myogenin-positive nuclei\/total nuclei and nuclei\/MyHC-positive myotubes was quantified, with a minimum of 500 nuclei counted per condition.","Thus far, the reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotency shows great utility as a tool for studying normal cellular development, while also having the potential for generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that can be used to model disease, or to generate clinically useful cell types for autologous therapies aimed at repairing deficits arising from injury, illness, and aging. Induction of pluripotency was originally achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues by enforced expression of four transcription factors, KLF4, c-MYC, OCT4, and SOX2 (KMOS) using retroviral vectors (Takahashi et al., 2007; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006).","A formidable obstacle to therapeutic use of iPS cells has been presented by the requirement for viral integration into the genome. The search for ways to induce pluripotency without incurring genetic change has become the focus of intense research effort. Towards this end, attempts to derive iPS cells using excisable lentiviral and transposon vectors, or through repeated application of transient plasmid, episomal, and adenovirus vectors have been made (Chang et al., 2009; Kaji et al., 2009; Okita et al., 2008; Stadtfeld et al., 2008; Woltjen et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009). Human iPS cells have also been derived using two DNA-free methods: serial protein transduction with recombinant proteins incorporating cell-penetrating peptide moieties (Kim et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009), and transgene delivery using the Sendai virus, which has a completely RNA-based reproductive cycle (Fusaki et al., 2009).","Considerable limitations accompany the non-integrative iPS derivation strategies devised thus far. For example, DNA transfection-based methodologies still entail risk of genomic recombination or insertional mutagenesis, even though they are supposedly safer than viral-based delivery methods. In the protein-based strategies thus far derived, the recombinant proteins used are difficult and challenging to generate and purify in the quantities required, and result in even lower efficiencies of pluripotent stem cell generation that conventional viral-based methods (Zhou et al., 2009). Use of Sendai virus requires stringent steps to purge reprogrammed cells of replicating virus, and the sensitivity of the viral RNA replicase to transgene sequence content can further limit the generality of this reprogramming vehicle (Fusaki et al., 2009). Importantly, the methods discussed that rely on repeat administration of transient vectors, whether DNA or protein-based, have shown very low reprogramming and iPS derivation efficiencies (Jia et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009; Okita et al., 2008; Stadtfeld et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009), presumably due, without wishing to be bound or limited by theory, to weak or inconstant expression of reprogramming factors.","As demonstrated herein, the inventors have discovered and shown that repeated administration of synthetic, modified messenger RNAs that incorporate novel modifications designed to bypass innate cellular anti-viral responses can reprogram differentiated human cells to pluripotency with conversion efficiencies and kinetics vastly and unexpectedly superior to established protein- and viral-based protocols. Accordingly, described herein are methods and compositions demonstrating that this non-mutagenic, efficient, and highly controllable technology is applicable to a wide range of cellular engineering tasks involving altering cellular developmental potentials, such as the reprogramming of differentiated cells, and the differentiation of reprogrammed cells to a differentiated cell type, such as RNA-iPS (RiPS)-derived fibroblasts to terminally differentiated myogenic cells.","Development of Synthetic, Modified RNAs for Directing Cell Fate","mRNA was manufactured using in vitro transcription (IVT) reactions templated by PCR amplicons (). To promote efficient translation and boost RNA half-life in the cytoplasm, a 5\u2032 guanine cap was incorporated by inclusion of a synthetic cap analog in the IVT reactions (Yisraeli et al., 1989). Within the IVT templates described herein, the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene of interest is flanked by a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) containing a strong Kozak translational initiation signal, and an alpha-globin 3\u2032 UTR terminating with an oligo(dT) sequence for templated addition of a polyA tail.","Cytosolic delivery of mRNA into mammalian cells can be achieved using electroporation or by complexing the RNA with a cationic vehicle to facilitate uptake by endocytosis (Audouy and Hoekstra, 2001; Elango et al., 2005; Holtkamp et al., 2006; Van den Bosch et al., 2006; Van Tendeloo et al., 2001). The latter approach was utilized by the inventors as it would allow for repeated transfection to sustain ectopic protein expression over the days to weeks required for cellular reprogramming. In experiments in which synthetic RNA encoding GFP was transfected into murine embryonic fibroblasts and human epidermal keratinocytes, high, dose-dependent cytotoxicity was noted, which was not attributable to the cationic vehicle, and which was exacerbated on repeated transfections. These experiments demonstrated a serious impediment to achieving sustained protein expression by repeated mRNA transfection.","It is has been reported that exogenous single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) activates antiviral defenses in mammalian cells through interferon and NF-\u03baB dependent pathways (Diebold et al., 2004; Hornung et al., 2006; Kawai and Akira, 2007; Pichlmair et al., 2006; Uematsu and Akira, 2007). In order to increase the sustainability of RNA-mediated protein expression, approaches were sought to reduce the immunogenic profile of the synthetic RNA. The co-transcriptional capping technique yields a significant fraction of uncapped IVT product bearing 5\u2032 triphosphates, which has been reported to trigger the ssRNA sensor RIG-I (Hornung et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006), and have also been reported to activate PKR, a global repressor of cellular protein translation (Nallagatla and Bevilacqua, 2008). However, treatment of the synthesized RNA with a phosphatase only resulted in modest reductions in the observed cytotoxicity upon repeated transfections.","Eukaryotic mRNA is extensively modified in vivo, and the presence of modified nucleobases has been shown to reduce signaling by RIG-I and PKR, as well as by the less widely expressed but inducible endosomal ssRNA sensors TLR7 and TLR8 (Kariko et al., 2005; Kariko et al., 2008; Kariko and Weissman, 2007; Nallagatla and Bevilacqua, 2008; Nallagatla et al., 2008; Uzri and Gehrke, 2009). In an attempt to further reduce innate immune responses to transfected RNA, mRNAs were synthesized incorporating modified ribonucleoside bases. Complete substitution of either 5-methylcytidine (5mC) for cytidine or pseudouridine (psi) for uridine in GFP-encoding transcripts markedly improved viability and increased ectopic protein expression.","However, the most significant improvements in viability and protein expression were observed when both 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine were used together (). It was discovered that these modifications dramatically attenuated interferon signaling as revealed by qRT-PCR for a panel of interferon response genes, although residual upregulation of some interferon targets was still detected (). Innate cellular anti-viral defenses can self-prime through a positive-feedback loop involving autocrine and paracrine signaling by Type I interferons (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). It was found that media supplementation with a recombinant version of B18R protein, a Vaccinia virus decoy receptor for Type I interferons (Symons et al., 1995), further increased cellular viability following RNA transfection, especially in some cell types. It was discovered that synthesis of RNA with a combination of both modified 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine ribonucleotides and phosphatase treatment (herein termed \u201csynthetic, modified RNAs\u201d), combined with media supplementation with the interferon inhibitor B18R allowed high, dose-dependent levels of protein expression ().","It was discovered that transfection of synthetic, modified RNA encoding GFP into six different human cell types resulted in highly penetrant expression (50-90% positive cells), and demonstrated the applicability of these novel methods and compositions to diverse cell types (). Simultaneous delivery of synthetic, modified RNAs encoding cytosolic-localized red, and nuclear-localized green fluorescent proteins into keratinocytes revealed that generalized co-expression of multiple proteins could be achieved in mammalian cells, and that the resulting proteins were correctly localized to the cytosol and nucleus, respectively ().","Ectopic protein expression after RNA transfection is transient owing to RNA and protein degradation and the diluting effect of cell division. To establish the kinetics and persistence of protein expression, synthetic, modified RNA encoding GFP variants designed for high and low protein stability (Li et al., 1998) were synthesized and transfected into keratinocytes. Time-course analysis by flow cytometry showed that protein expression persisted for several days for the high-stability variant, but peaked within 12 hours and decayed rapidly thereafter for the destabilized GFP (). These results indicated that a repetitive transfection regimen would be necessary in order to sustain high levels of ectopic expression for short-lived proteins over an extended time course.","To assess this and further address the impact of repeated RNA transfection on cell growth and viability, BJ fibroblasts were transfected daily for 10 days with either unmodified, or synthetic, modified RNAs encoding GFP. It was discovered that daily transfection with synthetic, modified RNA permitted sustained protein expression without substantially compromising the viability of the culture beyond a modest reduction in growth kinetics that was attributable to the transfection reagent vehicle (). Microarray analysis established that prolonged daily transfection with synthetic, modified RNA did not significantly alter the molecular profile of the transfected cells (), although a modest upregulation of a number of interferon response genes was noted, consistent with the fact that the modifications described herein did not completely abrogate interferon signaling (, ). In complete contrast, repeated transfections with unmodified RNA severely compromised the growth and viability of the culture through, in part, elicitation of a massive interferon response (), demonstrating that the use of unmodified RNA is not a viable strategy for sustaining long-term polypeptide expression in cells ().","To determine if modified RNAs could be used to directly alter cell fate, synthetic, modified RNA was synthesized encoding the myogenic transcription factor MYOD (Davis et al., 1987) and transfected into murine C3H10T1\/2 cells over the course of 3 days, followed by continued culturing in a low serum media for an additional 3 days. The emergence of large, multi-nucleated myotubes that stained positive for the myogenic markers myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) provided proof that transfection with synthetic, modified RNAs could be utilized to efficiently direct cell fate ().","Generation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Using Modified RNAs","The determination of whether induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) could be derived using synthetic, modified RNAs was next attempted. To this end, synthetic, modified RNAs encoding the four canonical Yamanaka factors, KLF4 (K), c-MYC (M), OCT4 (O), and SOX2 (S), were synthesized, transfected into cells. It was discovered that the synthetic, modified RNAs encoding transcription factors yielded robust protein expression that localized to the nucleus (). Time-course analysis monitored by flow cytometry yielded expression kinetics and stability similar to destabilized GFP (), demonstrating rapid turnover of these transcription factors (). From this, it was concluded that daily transfections would be required to maintain sufficient expression of the Yamanaka factors during long-term, multi-factor reprogramming regimens.","A protocol to ensure sustained high-level protein expression with daily transfection was next discovered by exploring a matrix of conditions encompassing a variety of different transfection reagents, culture media, feeder cell types, and RNA doses. Long-term reprogramming experiments were initiated with human ES-derived dH1f fibroblasts, which display relatively efficient viral-mediated iPS cell conversion (Chan et al., 2009; Park et al., 2008). Low-oxygen (5% O2) culture conditions and a KMOS stoichiometry of 1:1:3:1 were also employed, as these have been reported to promote efficient iPS conversion in viral-based methods (Kawamura et al., 2009; Papapetrou et al., 2009; Utikal et al., 2009; Yoshida et al., 2009). Synthetic, modified RNA encoding a short half-life nuclear GFP was spiked into the KMOS RNA cocktail to allow visualization of continued protein expression from modified RNA during the course of the experiment (). Experiments conducted in this manner revealed widespread transformation of fibroblast morphology to a compact, epithelioid morphology within the first week of synthetic, modified RNA transfection, which was followed by emergence of canonical hES-like colonies with tight morphology, well-defined borders, and prominent nucleoli (). RNA transfection was terminated on day 17, and three days later colonies were mechanically picked and expanded to establish 14 prospective iPS lines, designated dH1f-RiPS(RNA-derived iPS) 1-14.","It was next attempted to reprogram somatically-derived cells to pluripotency using a similar reprogramming regimen. A five-factor cocktail including a modified RNA encoding LIN28 (KMOSL) (Yu et al., 2007) was employed and the media was supplemented with valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, which has been reported to increase reprogramming efficiency (Huangfu et al., 2008). Four human cell types were tested: Detroit 551 (D551) and MRC-5 fetal fibroblasts, BJ post-natal fibroblasts, and fibroblast-like cells cultured from a primary skin biopsy taken from an adult cystic fibrosis patient (CF cells). Daily transfection with the modified RNA KMOSL cocktail gave rise to numerous hES-like colonies in the D551, BJ, and CF cultures that were mechanically picked at day 18, while MRC-5-derived colonies were picked at day 25. Multiple RiPS colonies were expanded for each of the somatic lines, and immunostaining confirmed the expression of hES markers TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA3, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG in all the RiPS lines examined (, ). Three RiPS cell clones from each of these four derivations were analyzed and confirmed to originate from the seeded somatic cells by DNA fingerprinting, and all presented normal karyotypes. In the experiments described above, the transfected fibroblast cultures were passaged once at an early time point (day 6 or 7) in order to promote fibroblast proliferation, which has been shown to facilitate reprogramming (Hanna et al., 2009). However, in independent experiments, RiPS cells were also derived from BJ and Detroit 551 fibroblasts in the absence of cell passaging, indicating that this was not required for modified RNA iPS-derivation ().","Molecular Characterization and Functional Potential of RiPS Cells","A number of molecular and functional assays were performed to assess whether the RiPS cells described herein had been reprogrammed to pluripotency (Table 6). Multiple RiPS lines derived from each of the five starting cell types were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and all demonstrated robust expression of the pluripotency-associated transcripts OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and hTERT (). RiPS clones derived from dH1f, MRC5, BJ, and CF fibroblasts were further analyzed by bisulfite sequencing, which revealed extensive demethylation of the OCT4 locus relative to the parental fibroblasts, an epigenetic state equivalent to human ES cells ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0503","num":"0502"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Pluripotency validation assays performed in this study."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Bisulfite","Developmental Potential"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Immunostaining","qRT-PCR","Sequencing","Microarray","In vitro","Teratoma"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["dH1F-RiPS-1.3","dH1F-RiPS-1.2","dH1F-RiPS-1.2","dH1F-RiPS-1.2","dH1F-RiPS-1.2{circumflex over (\u2009)}*","dH1F-RiPS-1.3"]},{"entry":["dH1F-RiPS-1.6","dH1F-RiPS-1.3","dH1F-RiPS-1.3","dH1F-RiPS-1.3","dH1F-RiPS-1.6{circumflex over (\u2009)}","dH1F-RiPS-1.5"]},{"entry":["dH1F-RiPS-1.13","dH1F-RiPS-1.6","dH1F-RiPS-1.6","dH1F-RiPS-1.6","dH1F-RiPS-1.13{circumflex over (\u2009)}","dH1F-RiPS-1.6"]},{"entry":["BJ-RiPS-1.1","dH1F-RiPS-1.7","BJ-RiPS-1.2","dH1F-RiPS-1.7","dH1F-RiPS-1.14{circumflex over (\u2009)}","dH1F-RiPS-1.7"]},{"entry":["BJ-RiPS-1.2","BJ-RiPS-1.1","BJ-RiPS-1.3","BJ-RiPS-1.1","MCR5-RiPS-1.8{circumflex over (\u2009)}*","dH1F-RiPS-1.11"]},{"entry":["BJ-RiPS-1.3","BJ-RiPS-1.2","MCR5-RiPS-1.8","BJ-RiPS-1.2","MCR5-RiPS-1.9{circumflex over (\u2009)}*","BJ-RiPS-1.1"]},{"entry":["MCR5-RiPS-1.2","BJ-RiPS-1.3","MCR5-RiPS-1.9","BJ-RiPS-1.3","MCR5-RiPS-1.11{circumflex over (\u2009)}*","BJ-RiPS-1.2"]},{"entry":["MCR5-RiPS-1.3","MCR5-RiPS-1.8","MCR5-RiPS-1.11","MCR5-RiPS-1.8","BJ-RiPS-1.1{circumflex over (\u2009)}*","CF-RiPS-1.2"]},{"entry":["MCR5-RiPS-1.11","MCR5-RiPS-1.9","CF-RiPS-1.2","MCR5-RiPS-1.9","BJ-RiPS-1.2{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":["CF-RiPS-1.2","MCR5-RiPS-1.11","CF-RiPS-1.3","MCR5-RiPS-1.11","BJ-RiPS-1.3{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":["CF-RiPS-1.3","CF-RiPS-1.2","CF-RiPS-1.4","CF-RiPS-1.2","CF-RiPS-1.2{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":["CF-RiPS-1.4","CF-RiPS-1.3",{},"CF-RiPS-1.3","CF-RiPS-1.3{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":["D551-RiPS-1.1","CF-RiPS-1.4",{},"CF-RiPS-1.4","CF-RiPS-1.4{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":["D551-RiPS-1.2","D551-RiPS-1.1",{},{},"D551-RiPS-1.1{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":["D551-RiPS-1.3","D551-RiPS-1.2",{},{},"D551-RiPS-1.2{circumflex over (\u2009)}*",{}]},{"entry":[{},"D551-RiPS-1.3",{},{},"D551-RiPS-1.3{circumflex over (\u2009)}*"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Table 6 shows the RiPS clones that were validate in each assay.

These analyses revealed that all synthetic, modified RNA-derived iPS clones examined had a molecular signature that very closely recapitulated that of human ES cells while being highly divergent from the profile of the parental fibroblasts (). Importantly, pluripotency-associated transcripts including SOX2, REX1, NANOG, OCT4, LIN28 and DNMT3B were substantially upregulated in the RiPS cells compared to the parental fibroblast lines to levels comparable to human ES cells (). Furthermore, when the transcriptional profiles were subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, all RiPS clones analyzed clustered more closely to human ES cells than did virally-derived iPS cells, indicating that synthetic, modified RNA-derived iPS cells more fully recapitulated the molecular signature of human ES cells ().","To evaluate the developmental potential of RiPS cells, embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated from multiple clones representing five independent RiPS derivations. Beating cardiomyocytes were observed for vast majority of the EBs (Table 6). Mesodermal potential was further evaluated in methylcellulose assays which showed that all lines tested were able to differentiate into hematopoietic precursors capable of giving rise to colony numbers and a spectrum of blood colony types comparable to human ES cells (, Table 6). A subset of clones was further plated onto matrigel and differentiated into Tuj1-positive neurons (ectoderm), and alpha-fetoprotein-positive endodermal cells (, Table 6). Finally, tri-lineage differentiation potential was confirmed in vivo by the formation of teratomas from dH1F-, CF- and BJ-RiPS cells, that histologically revealed cell types of the three germ layers (, , Table 6).","Taken together, these data demonstrate by the most stringent molecular and functional criteria available in regard to human pluripotent cells (Chan et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009), that the synthetic, modified RNA-derived iPS clones from multiple independent derivations described herein were reprogrammed to pluripotency, and closely recapitulated the functional and molecular properties of human ES cells. Significantly, these synthetic, modified RNA-derived iPS clones had molecular properties more similar to human ES cells than did cells that were reprogrammed using standard, viral-based methods.","Modified RNAs Generate iPS Cells at Very High Efficiency","During the course of the experiments, surprisingly high reprogramming efficiencies and rapid kinetics of iPS cell generation using the synthetic, modified RNAs described herein were observed. To quantify the efficiency of RiPS derivation more thoroughly, a number of reprogramming experiments were undertaken and results quantitated based on the expression of the iPS-specific markers TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81, (Chan et al., 2009; Lowry et al., 2008). In one set of experiments, BJ fibroblasts transfected with a five-factor modified RNA cocktail (KMOSL), this time without the use of VPA, demonstrated an iPS conversion efficiency of over 2%, which is two orders of magnitude higher than typically reported for virus-based derivations (, Table 7).

The yield of TRA-1-60\/TRA-1-81-positive colonies in the ambient (20%) oxygen condition was four-fold lower than in the cultures maintained at 5% O2 when using KMOS RNA, but this deficit was negated when LIN28 was added to the cocktail (, Table 7). The highest conversion efficiency (4.4%), which is higher than any reported conversion efficiency, was observed when low-oxygen culture and the five-factor KMOSL cocktail were combined.","To directly compare the kinetics and efficiency of the RiPS derivation protocol against an established viral protocol, an experiment in which dH1f fibroblasts were transfected with KMOS synthetic, modified RNAs, or transduced with KMOS retroviruses in parallel was conducted. As had been observed in the previous experiments described herein, ES-like colonies began to emerge by day 13 from the synthetic, modified RNA-transfected cultures, and the plates became overgrown with ES-like colonies by the 16th and final day of transfection. These synthetic, modified RNA-derived cultures were therefore fixed for analysis on day 18 (). Notably, at this time, no ES-like colonies had appeared in the retrovirally transduced cultures, and colonies only began to emerge on the 24th day post-transduction, which is a time point consistent with previous reports describing iPS derivations by retroviruses (Lowry et al., 2008; Takahashi et al., 2007). These retroviral-derived cultures were fixed for analysis on day 32. Both arms of the experiment were then immunostained and TRA-1-60-positive colonies were counted. These experiments revealed that the kinetics of modified RNA iPS derivation were almost twice as fast as retroviral iPS derivation. Further, and importantly, iPS derivation efficiencies were 1.4% for synthetic, modified RNA cultures, and only 0.04% for retroviral cultures, corresponding to a surprising 36-fold higher conversion efficiency with the synthetic, modified RNA compositions and protocols (, Table 7). Thus, by the combined criteria of colony numbers and kinetics of reprogramming, the efficiency of synthetic, modified RNA iPS derivation greatly exceeds that of conventional retroviral approaches.","Utilization of Synthetic, Modified RNA to Direct Differentiation of Pluripotent Rips Cells to a Terminally-Differentiated Cell Fate.","To realize the promise of iPS cell technology for regenerative medicine or disease modeling, it is imperative that the multi-lineage differentiation potential of pluripotent cells be harnessed. Although limited progress has been made in directing the differentiation of pluripotent ES cells to various lineages by modulating the extracellular cytokine milieu, such protocols remain inefficient. Given the high efficiency of iPS derivation by the novel synthetic, modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein, whether this technology could also be utilized to redirect pluripotent or multipotent cells towards differentiated cell fates was also determined. To test this, one of the validated RIPS lines described herein was subjected to an in vitro differentiation protocol in which FGF was withdrawn, serum added, and the cells plated onto gelatin (). Cells obtained under these conditions were subjected to three consecutive days of transfection with a MYOD-encoding synthetic, modified RNA to provoke myogenic differentiation. The cells were then cultured an additional three days and then immunostained for the myogenic markers myogenin and MyHC, which revealed a high percentage of large multi-nucleated myogenin and MyHC double positive myotubes ().","Taken together, the experiments described herein provide clear proof that synthetic, modified RNAs can be used to both reprogram cells to a pluripotent state at high and unexpected efficiencies, and also direct the fate of such cells and other pluripotent or multipotent cells to cells having lower developmental potential, such as a terminally differentiated somatic cell type.","Discussion","Described herein are novel compositions and technologies that use a combination of synthetic RNA modifications, and in some embodiments, a soluble interferon inhibitor, to overcome innate anti-viral responses and permit repeated transfections with RNA, thus enabling highly efficient alterations in cellular phenotypes and developmental potentials, such as highly efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency, and directing the differentiation of pluripotent cells towards a desired lineage. The novel methodologies and compositions described herein offer several key advantages over established reprogramming techniques. By obviating the need to perform experiments under stringent biological containment, synthetic, modified RNA technology makes reprogramming accessible to a wider community of researchers. More fundamentally, the approaches described herein allow protein stoichiometry to be regulated globally within cultures, while avoiding the stochastic variation of expression typical of integrating vectors, as well as the uncontrollable and undesired effects of viral silencing. Given the stepwise character of the phenotypic changes observed during pluripotency induction (Chan et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2010), individual transcription factors can play distinct, stage-specific roles during reprogramming. The unprecedented potential for temporal control over factor expression afforded by the technologies described herein can help researchers unravel these nuances, yielding further insights that can be applied to further enhance the efficiency and kinetics of reprogramming.","While the risk of mutagenesis is a major safety concern holding back clinical exploitation of induced pluripotency, other factors also play a role. It has become increasingly apparent that all iPS cells are not created equal with respect to epigenetic landscape and developmental plasticity (Hu et al., 2010; Miura et al., 2009). In this regard, the most stringent molecular and functional criteria for reprogramming human cells have been applied herein (Chan et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009), to demonstrate that the iPS clones derived from synthetic, modified RNAs from multiple independent derivations were reprogrammed to pluripotency, and also closely recapitulated the functional and molecular properties of human ES cells. Significantly, as described herein, synthetic, modified RNA derived iPS cells more faithfully recapitulated the global transcriptional signature of human ES cells than retrovirally-derived iPS cells, indicating that the compositions and methods for RNA reprogramming described herein produce higher quality iPS cells, possibly owing, without wishing to be bound or limited by theory, to the fact that they are transgene-free.","The transient and non-mutagenic character of RNA-based protein expression can also deliver important clinical benefits, in some embodiments, outside the domain of lineage reprogramming and alteration of cellular developmental potential. The use of RNA transfection to express cancer or pathogen antigens for immunotherapy is already an active research area (Rabinovich et al., 2008; Rabinovich et al., 2006; Van den Bosch et al., 2006; Weissman et al., 2000), and the synthetic, modified RNA can be used, in some embodiments, to transiently express surface proteins, such as homing receptors, to target cellular therapies toward specific organs, tissues, or diseased cells (Ryser et al., 2008).","For tissue engineering to progress further, there is a pressing need for safe and efficient means to alter cellular fates. In terms of personalized medicine applications, iPS cells are a starting point for patient-specific therapies, and specification of clinically useful cell types is required to produce autologous tissues for transplantation or for disease modeling. Importantly, the inventors have demonstrated that the synthetic, modified RNA-based technologies described herein that enable highly efficient reprogramming, can are equally applicable to efficiently alter pluripotent cell fate to terminally differentiated fates without compromising genomic integrity. In light of these considerations, the novel compositions and approaches described herein can become central enabling technology for cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["This patent application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.
