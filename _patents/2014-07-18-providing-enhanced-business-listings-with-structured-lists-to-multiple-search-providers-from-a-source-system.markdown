title: Providing enhanced business listings with structured lists to multiple search providers from a source system
abstract: A source server receives listing identification data for transmission of an enhanced listing comprising enhanced content to a plurality of provider servers. For each provider server of the plurality of provider servers, the source server transmits to the provider server the listing identification data. When the source server determines that an identifier corresponding to the listing identification data that indicates the listing is present on the provider server does not exist in a database associated with the source server, the source server searches the provider server for a matching listing based on the received listing identification data. When the source server determines that a matching listing exits on the provider server, the source server transmits to the provider server the enhanced listing with the identifier employed by the provider server as an indication to the provider server to update the listing on the provider server with the enhanced content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14\/152,119 filed Jan. 10, 2014, which is a continuation-in-part of and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/342,540 filed Jan. 3, 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates generally to Internet search methods, and more particularly, to a method and system for providing enhanced business listings to multiple search service providers from a single source system in an integrated fashion.","A consumer and\/or merchant may rely heavily on services rendered via the Internet. One such service is searchable listings provided by a search service (also known in some instances as \u201cyellow pages\u201d or \u201cInternet yellow pages,\u201d e.g., Google.com, Amazon.com, Yahoo.com, Yelp.com, MapQuest.com, Superpages.com, etc.). Searchable listings may include businesses, such as restaurants, people information, product information, etc. The information provided may include, for example, a name of a person or business, addresses, telephone numbers (i.e., a name, address, and phone number (NAP)). The information provided may also include web site URLs, photos, videos e-mail addresses, etc. The consumer may be presented with other information about a business by either clicking anywhere in the listing, or placing a mouse pointer or finger over a portion of the listing.","Certain search service providers, such as Google.com, WhitePages.com, MapQuest.com, provide some or all of the requested information in alphabetical, \u201cmost visited\u201d, or distance order (i.e., distance from a location that the consumer entered for a search or a distance from a location of the search provider). A merchant may wish to ensure that the NAP information provided in the search results is correct, so that a consumer may find a listing when searching in her local area, and if the consumer does choose to call or visit the merchant's business, the consumer is provided with correct information. Furthermore, a merchant may desire to maximize the chance that a consumer will select the merchant's listing from among those returned. The listing may be displayed higher in the search results and\/or be featured in a more prominent and attractive fashion. The ordering of the listings is sometimes influenced by the extent to which content is available for the listing. Further still, the merchant may desire to maximize the probability that a consumer that views additional information about a business will have a favorable impression of the business.","The above goals may be achieved by maximizing the presence and quality of content associated with a listing. The merchant associated with a listing may therefore desire to be listed with multiple search services. Unfortunately, the merchant currently needs to obtain their listing from each search service provider separately, i.e., they need to contact each of the search service providers separately, provide the listing information to each of the search service providers, and pay each of the search service providers separately. Moreover, if they wish to update their listing, each service provider needs to be contacted separately.","Assuming a listing is updatable at each of the search service providers, an update may take days, weeks, or more to be reflected at a consumer-facing Web site, mobile directory, application, etc., of each of the search service providers. Therefore, in the related art, updates cannot occur in real time or near real time. Moreover, the merchant cannot provide their customers with information about real-time or near real-time services, such as, for example, an offer of a discount coupon \u201cfor the next hour only.\u201d","The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for providing listings that include both NAP information and enhanced content (hereinafter \u201cenhanced listings\u201d) to multiple search service providers from a source system. As used herein, the term \u201cenhanced content\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, information provided in a listing in addition to identification information of a listing (e.g., name, address, telephone number, etc.) which may include, but is not limited to, web site URLs, photos, videos e-mail addresses, a special tagline to be used for promotional purposes, the latter included in a visual \u201ctag\u201d highlight. As used herein, a tag or a tag line refers to a real-time promotional message associated with a listing. Enhanced content may also include one or more structured lists. As used herein, a \u201cstructured list\u201d refers to a type of enhanced content, e.g., lists of formatted real-world information that follows a distinct, easily recognizable pattern. Examples of structured listings may include, but are not limited to, restaurant menu lists, biographies of employees (\u201cbios\u201d), lists of products and services, lists of events, etc. (together, \u201cenhanced content\u201d).","In one example, the source system receives listing identification data from a merchant. The listing identification data is transmitted to each individual provider system. Potential matching listings are received from each provider system. The potential matching listings are matched to the listing identification data previously supplied by the merchant, and a measure of certainty of a match for each provider system is determined. If a match is found for a given provider system that equals or exceeds a predetermined level or more of certainty, then a provider-supplied external identifier (hereinafter \u201cExternal ID\u201d) for that match is recorded in the source system and is associated with the listing information provided by the merchant, and the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system. If no such match is found, the source system presents the listing information from the provider system to the merchant (or an analyst working on behalf of the merchant).","In one example, when the source system presents the listing information from the provider system to the merchant, the source system may receive from the merchant an indication as to whether returned listing data from a provider system matches the merchant's listing. If the merchant confirms a match, the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system. If the merchant indicates that the returned listing data is incorrect, or if no probable match of returned listing data from the provider system was found, then the merchant searches directly for their listing on the provider system via a source system interface. If the provider system returns listing data that the merchant confirms as a match, then the provider-supplied External ID is recorded for the listing that the merchant confirmed in the database of the provider system. The listing data is also recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system after a cross check by a human operator.","In one example, after completing a search on the provider system via a source system interface, the merchant may indicate that no listing on the provider system matches the merchant listing. In such circumstances, the source system records an indication in the source system database that the listing should be delivered to the provider system as a new listing to be added to the provider system after a cross check by a human operator.","In one example, a cross check by a human operator may be conducted when the merchant has indicated that the merchant listing did not match the provider data automatically selected, and then has either indicated that another provider listing matches or that no provider listing matches. The human operator either accepts as a match returned listing data from the provider system that the merchant indicated as a non-match, accepts as a match the provider listing selected by the merchant, searches and selects the provider system himself for a different match of listing data via a source system interface, or indicates that no valid listing is present on the provider system. Accordingly, the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system, either with the \u201cExternal ID\u201d included in the provider listing data selected as a match or, if no such listing was selected, with an indication that the merchant listing is to be added to the provider site.","In one example, when listing data is recorded in the source system database as being ready for delivery, one or more methods of delivery may be selected to deliver an enhanced listing to the provider system. The selection of a deliver method may be based on (1) which methods are available on the provider system, (2) which data fields are included in the enhanced listing to be provided, and (3) which methods may cause the data fields associated with the enhanced listing to be sent to the provider system as quickly as possible. In one embodiment, all fields may be delivered through a single method. In another embodiment, some fields may be delivered through one method to provide faster delivery, while other fields may be delivered through a slower method.","In one example, the following delivery methods are provided: (1) periodic feed files, (2) real-time API integration; (3) JavaScript enhanced content; and (4) frequent delta updates.","In one example, in the periodic feed files listings delivery method, at periodic intervals, a file for each provider system containing associated target listings that are to become enhanced listings is generated for each provider system by the source system. This file contains NAP information and enhanced content for each of the merchant listings, and possibly the provider-supplied External ID previously identified and associated with the listing. If the provider-supplied external ID for a given listing is not provided, this is an indication that the listing does not exist on the provider system and should be created by the provider system. For each of the provider systems, the generated file is transmitted to the corresponding provider system.","In one example, the provider system processes the received listings. If at least one new listing is found that does not have an External ID supplied, the provider system adds a listing into the provider database and generates an External ID for it. The provider then updates the listings in the provider database with the listing information (NAP and enhanced content) provided by the source system for each listing, identifying each by External ID. In this manner, the merchant listing information on each provider is added and updated from a single point, and, as a result, the enhanced listing is now present on each provider.","In one example, in the real-time application programming interface (API) integration listings delivery method, as soon as new or updated merchant listing information is provided to the source system and, as applicable, approved according to the methods described above, the source system contacts the provider system through a real-time API, and provides merchant listing information, including, but not limited to, NAP and enhanced content, as well as the corresponding \u201cExternal ID\u201d for the listing on the provider system (or an indication that this listing is to be added to the provider system). The provider system updates its database with the new listing information, and is made available to consumers searching for business listings on the provider site. If the source system is contacting the provider system concerning a listing for the first time, the provider system provides the source system (either substantially immediately, or after some interval) with a source system assigned listing identifier (hereinafter \u201cListing ID\u201d), the provider assigned External ID, and a universal resource locator (URL) where the consumer can expect to see the listing on the provider system. For any listings appearing for the first time, the merchant is provided with an indication that the listing is now in service on that provider, and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the provider listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen.","In one example, the periodic feed files delivery method or the real-time API integration delivery method may be augmented by a JavaScript enhanced content delivery method. The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method permits enhanced content to be updated for a listing in real-time even if a provider does not support real-time updates to its database (e.g., as in the periodic feed files delivery method), or if the provider does support updates to its database but cannot substantially immediately display the updates to a consumer (as may happen in the real-time API integration listings delivery method).","The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method is executed after completing the steps of the periodic feed files delivery method or the real-time API integration delivery method. In the JavaScript enhanced content delivery method, in one example, the provider system is configured to store in its database an indication that the listing with a particular External ID is to include JavaScript based enhanced content, possibly to include a promotional highlight and a list of one or more structured listings, when displayed in a consumer Web browser. When the provider system provides listing information for any such listings to the consumer, the provider system may include a JavaScript in the Web page of a web browser associated with the consumer. The JavaScript runs on the consumer's Web browser, and may be configured to (1) contact the provider system, which may contact the source system to obtain the enhanced content, or (2) may contact the source system directly to obtain the enhanced content. For either method of contacting the source system, the source system may render the enhanced content in real time along with other parts of a listing when the Web page of the consumer is first loaded, or when the consumer interacts with an element on the Web page (e.g., an icon of a type of structured listing). The source system returns the most up-to-date enhanced content for the listing, which is then displayed to the consumer. Thus, the most up-to-date enhanced content, including, but not limited to, one or more real-time promotional highlight messages and\/or one or more structured lists of a selected type of structured lists is displayed to the consumer.","In one example, the periodic feed files delivery method may be augmented with the frequent delta updates delivery method. In the frequent delta updates delivery method, the source system keeps track of all merchant listing records that are recorded either for the first time or for which the merchant has provided updated information. At regular intervals, for example, every five minutes, the provider system contacts the source system for an update. The source system delivers all of the updated listing information from the time since the last contact. The provider system processes this information by updating its own listing records based on the listing information supplied in the delta update. This up-to-date information is presented to consumers.","In one example, in connection with the periodic feed files delivery method, the provider system may assemble a list of all of the listings with listing information controlled and updated by the source system, may generate a \u201creceipt file\u201d containing these listings, and may transmit the receipt file to the source system. The receipt file may include, for each listing, the source system-assigned Listing ID, the provider system-supplied External ID, and a URL where the consumer can expect to see the listing on the provider system. For any listings appearing for the first time, the merchant is provided with an indication that the listing is now in service on that provider, and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the provider listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the methods described for delivering listings may be employed both when a listing is initially provided by the merchant to the source system, and when updates to the NAP or enhanced content for a listing is provided by the merchant to the source system.","In one example, enhanced content may be rendered on a Web page associated with the consumer using a client-side Javascript. The client-side Javascript running in a Web browser of the consumer may search through the source-specific elements of the Web page (e.g., structures of lists, structures of sections, structures of items, etc.), and may contact the source system directly to obtain relevant Web elements (e.g., HTML markups, Javascripts, CSS). The client-side Javascript may be triggered when the Web page is first loaded in the Web browser associated with the consumer (to display a promotion tag with a listing) or when the consumer interacts with an element on the Web page (e.g., the consumer clicks on a specific icon to cause a pop-up).","In one example, enhanced content may be rendered on a Web page associated with the consumer using a server-side Javascript. The server-side Javascript running in a Web browser of the consumer may search through the source-specific elements of the Web page (e.g., structures of lists, structures of sections, structures of items, etc.), and may contact the provider system to obtain relevant Web elements (e.g., HTML markups, Javascripts, CSS). In response, the provider system may contact the source system to retrieve relevant Web elements (e.g., HTML markups, Javascripts, CSS). The server-side exchange may be triggered when the Web page is first loaded in the Web browser associated with the consumer (to display the enhanced content with the listing) or when consumer interacts with an element on the Web page (e.g., the consumer clicks on a specific icon to cause a pop-up).","Enhanced content may be identified by a provider ID (e.g., an identifier that the source system may assign to a provider system), an external ID (an identifier that provider system may assign to a merchant listing), and content type (e.g., a type of a structured listing). The provider system needs to provide the source system with at least these three pieces of information to retrieve the appropriate enhanced content on behalf of the consumer. The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for delivering enhanced listings (i.e., listings with enhanced content) to multiple search service providers from a source system. The source system receives listing identification data for delivery of enhanced listings to a plurality of provider systems. For each provider system of the plurality of provider systems the source system transmits to the provider system identification data. The source system receives corresponding identification data. When the corresponding identification data is valid identification data, the source system delivers the enhanced listing to the provider system with a provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the provider system to update a listing with the enhanced content. When the corresponding identification data is not valid identification data, the source system delivers the enhanced listing to the provider system without the provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the provider system to create a listing using the enhanced content.","In an example, the enhanced content may comprise one or more structured lists. Each structured list may comprise a list of one or more sections. Each of the sections may comprise a list of one or more items.","In an example, the source system may receive an indication to render enhanced content in a web browser associated with the user. The indication may be received from the provider system or a client system hosting the web browser. In an example, indication may be triggered in response to a loading of the web page in the web browser associated with the consumer. In another example, the indication may be triggered in response to a selection of an element on a web page in the web browser associated with the consumer. The source system may transmit the indicated enhanced content to the provider system or to the client system for rendering in the web browser.","In an example, the source system may transmit to the client system a Java Script for rendering the enhanced content in the web browser. Transmitting the selected enhanced content may comprise transmitting at least one of a list, a section of the list, or an item of the section. The list, section of the list, or an item of the section may be formatted according to one or more specifications of the provider system.","In an example, the source system may determine whether to deliver the enhanced content to a provider system based on a merchant-specified publication identifier associated with the provider system. When the merchant-specified publication identifier associated with the provider system is set to true, the source system may deliver the enhanced content to the provider system. When the merchant-specified publication identifier associated with the provider system is set to false, the source system may refrain from delivering the enhanced content to the provider system.","It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.","Methods and systems for enabling merchants to have their business listed in the so-called \u201corganic search results\u201d on a large number of directories (including Web sites, mobile apps, etc.) through a single product\/system are provided. As used herein, the term \u201corganic search results\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, listings on search engine results pages that appear because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to their being advertisements. In contrast, non-organic search results may include pay per click advertising.","A merchant is permitted to list promotional material comprising enhanced content associated with a listing through, among other things, highlighted content in search results and more complete content in the business profile on the service provider. In some embodiments, a URL is provided to permit the merchant to see their promoted listing on each search service provider's Web site. The merchant is permitted to update their information (e.g., when they move or when their phone number changes) and enhance their listing (e.g., by adding or modifying photos, text descriptions, special offers, hours, menus, bios, products and services, events, etc., i.e., enhanced content) from a single point substantially in real-time or near real-time.","The term \u201ccomputer\u201d or \u201ccomputer platform\u201d is intended to include any data processing device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a handheld device, a digital signal processor (DSP), an embedded processor (an example of which is described in connection with  hereinbelow), or any other device able to process data. The computer\/computer platform is configured to include one or more microprocessors communicatively connected to one or more non-transitory computer-readable media and one or more networks. The term \u201ccommunicatively connected\u201d is intended to include any type of connection, whether wired or wireless, in which data may be communicated. The term \u201ccommunicatively connected\u201d is intended to include, but not limited to, a connection between devices and\/or programs within a single computer or between devices and\/or separate computers over a network. The term \u201cnetwork\u201d is intended to include, but not limited to, OTA (over-the-air transmission, ATSC, DVB-T), packet-switched networks (TCP\/IP, e.g., the Internet), satellite (microwave, MPEG transport stream or IP), direct broadcast satellite, analog cable transmission systems (RF), and digital video transmission systems (ATSC, HD-SDI, HDMI, DVI, VGA), etc.","The one or more computer readable media may be used for storing the instructions to be executed by the one or more processors, including an optional operating system, such as the Windows or the Linux operating system.

The provider API searcher  is configured to accommodate existing APIs  provided that it meets system standards. In certain circumstances, a provider may need to modify their API  so that it may operate properly with the source system . The provider listing update APIs  are configured to receive information about new and updated listings to display from the listing delivery engine . Should a provider not be able to supply a provider listing update API , the provider may supply a periodic feed receiver  for processing periodic data updates generated by the source system  containing listings that should contain enhanced content. These are modules designed by each of the providers. They are generally designed to accommodate a source system enhanced listings format. The provider directory site\/mobile app\/etc.  is a module that serves the directory sites with which a consumer interacts, e.g., MapQuest.com, the MapQuest iPhone app, etc.","The modules , , ,  are, in turn, are communicatively connected to a plurality of user devices running some form of communication software, preferably in a consumer Web browser  over a network, such as the Internet , and a provider database -. In an example, the computer platform  may be communicatively connected to each of the plurality of user devices via a PowerListings JavaScript  running in the consumer Web browser  when enhanced content is pulled directly from a consumer Web browser  or device, rather than passing through a service provider computer platform (e.g., ) (to be described hereinbelow in connection with ). In such circumstances, the PowerListings JavaScript  (either provided by the system provider or written by the service provider and included within a Web page) calls the real-time content server  and obtains the needed enhanced content. Alternatively, the PowerListings JavaScript  may be replaced with, for example, a mobile application or some other non-Web application. In such circumstances, the mobile or external application may communicate directly with the real-time content server  to obtain the real-time content updates. However, in an example, a request typically passes through a service provider computer platform (e.g., ) rather than having a direct connection between the application running on the consumer's device and the real-time content server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","34","34","32","402","32","38","404","34","34","406","34","34","408","410","412","414","38","40","416","34","34"],"i":["a","n ","a","n","a","n","a","n "]},"In one example, when the listing identification data provided automatically or overridden by either the merchant  or the human system operator  is determined to be valid identification data, the source system  delivers the one or more enhanced listings to the one or more provider systems -with the provider-supplied external identifier as an indication to the one or more provider systems -to update the one or more enhanced listings with enhanced content.

In Step , the provider API searcher  employs a method to determine which of the returned results matches the listing identification data supplied by the merchant , if any, and a measure of certainty of a match for the provider system . Each potential match is given a score that indicates the system's level of certainty that the potential match listings corresponds with the listing identification data supplied by the merchant. To calculate this score, the system normalizes the core listing information supplied by the merchant and returned with each potential match. Then the system assigns up to one point for similarity of each of the following data fields: name, address (including city, state, and postal code), and primary phone number. The system also assigns points for matches of non-primary phone numbers and merchant URL. If a match has at least three points\u2014which can happen only if the name, address, and primary phone number match exactly, or if two of the three match and the other fields match exactly\u2014the listing is considered to be so perfect a match that it can be recorded as a listing match without merchant verification (i.e., equal to or above a predetermined level of certainty). If it has a match of at least one point, then it is considered a possible match and can be presented to the merchant as such. Otherwise, it is considered that there are no possible matches.","In Step , if a match is found that equals or exceed a predetermined level or more of certainty, then in Step , the provider API searcher  records a provider-supplied \u201cExternal ID\u201d for the listing along with returned listing data (e.g., the name, address, telephone number, and URL associated with the listing found on the provider system ) in the system database ; otherwise, processing proceeds to step . As used herein, an External ID refers to a unique identifier that each of the provider systems -has assigned to a listing for their own purposes. This contrasts with a system-provided \u201cListing ID\u201d that is a unique identifier assigned by the source system  to the same listing on a per provider\/per listing (e.g., per business physical location) basis. In step , a matching process is conducted by the source system , wherein an attempt is made to determine the External ID of the listing on the provider's system that most closely matches the listing with the system-provided Listing ID. The purpose of the matching process is to ascertain whether there is a corresponding listing on the server provider's side. If, in step , a match is found, then in step , the provider-supplied External ID is associated with the system-supplied Listing ID in the system database  for the provider system (e.g., ). If, in Step , no match was returned, then in Step , the provider API searcher  records \u201cno match found\u201d in the system database  for the provider system . Also, a \u201cno External ID corresponding to the Listing ID\u201d in question is recorded in the database  for the provider system ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","32","38","34","602","102","38","34","34","34","604","612"],"i":["a ","a","n ","a"]},"In Step , if a probable match was found, then in Step , the PowerListings Web application  displays the returned listing data (e.g., the name, address, and phone number) as supplied by the provider system , and prompts the merchant  to confirm that the correct returned listing data was identified. If, in Step , the merchant  confirms a matching returned listing data, then in Step , the returned listing data is recorded by the source system  in the system database  along with an indication that the returned listing data is \u201cready to be delivered to the provider system\u201d as described hereinbelow. If, in Step , the merchant  indicates that the returned listing data is incorrect, or if no probable match of returned listing data from the provider system was found, then in Step , the merchant  searches directly for their listing on the provider systems via queries made through the PowerListings Web application , the provider API searcher , and the provider API  of the provider system .

Rather than including PowerListings JavaScript , the provider system -may include a custom-written JavaScript that makes calls directly to the real-time content server . A provider supplied JavaScript may be preferable when the provider system -has a JavaScript included in its own applications and it is desirable for the provider system -to integrate the call to the real-time content server  within the existing logic of the provider system -","In an example, the JavaScript mechanism for real-time content updates described above can be used by provider systems either when displaying search results, which may include one or more enhanced listings mixed with regular listings (which may include less information concerning each) or when displaying a page with detailed information for a single enhanced listing. In the latter case, the information that is pulled from the real-time content server  may include an extensive set of the content fields associated with the enhanced listing (e.g., a specified structured list selected by the consumer ), so that all or nearly all of the information supplied with the enhanced listing is served directly from the source system's real-time content server  without being processed by the provider system directly.","In an example, rather than passing a JavaScript to a consumer Web browser , the provider directory site  may request the most up-to-date enhanced content for each enhanced listing in server-to-server communication with the real-time content server  on demand, and then may render the enhanced content, including the promotional message or \u201ctag line,\u201d and a specified structured list selected by the consumer in the consumer Web browser . (Although other information associated with the listing may be supplied through the real-time mechanism as well, the tag line, i.e. promotional message, is the one that is most time-sensitive because it often contains promotional deals, e.g., \u201c$20 off a refrigerator today only!\u201d).","In an example, if the listings are not rendered in a consumer Web browser , but via a mobile application, navigation application, etc., the device hosting the application may not be operable to employ JavaScript.

The term \u201cmachine-readable storage medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media.","The components and other features described herein can be implemented as discrete hardware components or integrated in the functionality of hardware components such as ASICs, FPGAs, DSPs or similar devices. In addition, these components can be implemented as firmware or functional circuitry within hardware devices. Further, these components can be implemented in any combination of hardware devices and software components.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the above discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cenabling\u201d, \u201ctransmitting\u201d, \u201crequesting\u201d, \u201cidentifying\u201d, \u201cquerying\u201d, \u201cretrieving\u201d, \u201cforwarding\u201d, \u201cdetermining\u201d, \u201cpassing\u201d, \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201cdisabling\u201d, or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","Embodiments of the present invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memory devices including universal serial bus (USB) storage devices (e.g., USB key devices) or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each of which may be coupled to a computer system bus.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will be apparent from the description above. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.","The present invention has several advantages over prior art business listings and local search engines\/systems. For example, existing search service providers provide a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly feed for updating listings of local merchant data, which may be the only way of updating content. Existing listings services rely on the recipient of the listing information (provider systems) to attempt any matching of their own listings (e.g., some provider systems accept only an advertised listing from a single source. As a result, there may be duplicate listing of the same merchant with no attempt by the provider systems to remove the duplicate entries). As of this writing, search service providers do not perform matching from a central server system  and do not provide each provider system -with its ID for a listing. Still further, there are no known instances of service providers providing a combination of accepting data in a periodic feed, serving content with special markers based on this data, and having this data augmented with a JavaScript-based call back to the original central server system , which solves an apparent latency problem for updating content in a number of domains. There are also no known instances of a service provider accepting listing information from a merchant and delivering it to multiple provider systems via a real-time API. There are also no known instances of a service provider accepting listing information from a merchant and then distributing it to multiple providers using a combination of these mechanisms based on the capabilities of each provider system in order to minimize the latency of distribution new listing information as far as possible. There are also no known instances of such a listings service using automated mechanisms to ascertain whether the listings sent out to provider systems are correctly added and correctly updated.","A merchant is provided with the most up-to-date information possible associated with their business listings. Provider systems each have different capabilities and mechanisms for the support of the adding and updating of merchant listings. Some of them have systems that can operate only on a daily or multi-day cycle through the use of \u201cfeed\u201d files that contain listing information and are processed daily. Others are able to process \u201cfeed\u201d files more frequently, and still others have assorted miscellaneous mechanisms allowing for faster updates. Methods and systems according to certain embodiments of the present invention provide a way to make use of each of the existing mechanisms available with each provider system in the most efficient manner possible to effect updates to listings in a manner as near to real-time as possible. Provider systems that can process \u201cfeed\u201d updates only infrequently to nevertheless display certain elements of the enhanced content-in real time or near real-time. Embodiments of the present invention provide a means for those provider systems with proper technical capacity to implement a mechanism through which, from a single source system, all content on any provider listings can be updated in real time or near real-time.","It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description.
