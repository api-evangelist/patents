The subject matter of the following U.S. patent applications and U.S. patents are incorporated into the present application in their entireties by reference: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/227,382, filed concurrently herewith, and entitled \u201cACTIVATION SYSTEMS FOR INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS;\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/170,079, filed Jun. 27, 2011, and entitled \u201cSENSORS FOR DETECTING RAPID DECELERATION\/ACCELERATION EVENTS;\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/086,134, filed Apr. 13, 2011, and entitled \u201cSTITCH PATTERNS FOR RESTRAINT-MOUNTED AIRBAGS AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND METHODS;\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,350; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,442,807.","The following disclosure relates generally to buckle connectors for inflatable personal restraint systems and associated methods of use and manufacture.","Various types of seat belt and airbag systems have been used to protect passengers in automobiles, aircraft and other vehicles. In automobiles, airbags typically deploy from the steering column, dashboard, side panel, and\/or other fixed location. During a rapid deceleration event (e.g., a collision), a sensor detects the event and transmits a corresponding signal to an initiation device (e.g., a pyrotechnic device) on an airbag inflator. Initiation causes the inflator to release compressed gas into the airbag via a hose, thereby rapidly inflating the airbag. There are a number of different types of inflators known in the art. Some inflators contain compressed gas (e.g., air, nitrogen, helium, argon, etc.). Other inflators (e.g., gas generating devices) provide high pressure gas via chemical reaction of an energetic propellant.","Airbags can be deployed in a number of positions around the vehicle passenger or driver. Airbags positioned in the steering column, for example, can inflate in front of the driver to cushion his head and torso from forward impact. Airbags can also reduce the likelihood of whiplash.","Although airbags that deploy from stationary locations (e.g., a steering column) may be effective in automobiles, they may not be as effective in other types of vehicles having other seating arrangements. Seats in commercial passenger aircraft, for example, can be configured in a variety of layouts that provide different spacing between succeeding rows and adjacent seats. Moreover, such layouts may lack the availability of stationary structures upon which to mount airbags. Additionally, seatbacks in aircraft may rotate forward and downward during a crash or similar event, and thus may be unsuitable for airbag storage. As a result, airbags have been developed that deploy from seat belts to accommodate occupants in aircraft and other vehicles. Such airbags can deploy from, for example, a lap belt and\/or a shoulder belt to provide additional protection during a crash or other rapid deceleration event. Such airbag systems are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,350, which is owned by the assignee of the present application and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","Some airbag systems include wiring coupled to the seat belt connector that transmits electrical signals about the status (e.g., open or closed) of the seat belt buckle. Repeated flexing of the seat belt and the wires during use can subject the wires to stress and strain. Accordingly, it could be desirable to reduce this stress and strain.","The present disclosure describes various embodiments and aspects of buckle connectors for inflatable personal restraint systems and associated systems and methods. In one embodiment, a personal restraint system includes a web configured to restrain an occupant in a seat, a connector attached to a distal end portion of the web, an airbag carried by the web, and an airbag cover at least partially enclosing the airbag and engaging a portion of the connector. In some embodiments, the connector can include a housing having one or more recesses that receive an end portion of the airbag cover to retain the cover in position and provide strain relief for any associated wiring to the connector. Certain details are set forth in the following description and in  to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Other details describing well-known structures and systems often associated with airbags, buckle assemblies, restraint systems, etc., have not been set forth below to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the disclosure.","Many of the details, dimensions, angles and other features shown in  are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments can add other details, dimensions, angles and features without departing from the spirit or scope of the present technology. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that further embodiments of the technology can be practiced without several of the details described below. The discussion related to  includes a broad description of inflatable personal restraint systems. The discussion related to  describes several features more specific to connector portions of inflatable personal restraint systems configured in accordance with the present technology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["112","100","100","112","112","112","114","112","118"]},"In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the restraint system  includes an airbag assembly  carried by a seat belt . More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment the seat belt  includes a first web portion and a corresponding second web portion . A proximal end portion of the first web portion can be fixably attached to the seat-mounting structure  by means of a hook  or other suitable device known in the art. The proximal end portion of the second web portion can be similarly attached to the mounting structure  on the opposite side of the seat . The distal end portion of the first web portion can carry a first coupler, such as a connector assembly or connector  having a tongue portion. Similarly, the distal end portion of the second web portion can carry a corresponding second coupler, such as a buckle assembly or buckle  configured to receive and releasably engage the tongue portion of the connector  to couple the two web portions  together around a seat occupant (not shown) in a conventional manner. In certain embodiments, the connector  and the buckle  can be configured to engage and disengage in a manner that is at least generally similar to conventional connector\/buckle assemblies found on conventional seat belts. As described in greater detail below, in other embodiments the connector  and the buckle  can include features that preclude the connector  or the buckle  from being inadvertently joined to a different buckle or connector, respectively.","In a further aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag assembly  includes an airbag  that is attached to the first web portion generally proximate the connector . In one embodiment, for example, the airbag  can be fastened to the first web portion using the methods and systems disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/086,134, which was filed Apr. 13, 2011, and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In , the airbag  is illustrated in the nondeployed configuration in which it is folded and stowed neatly beneath a flexible and durable cover . The cover  encloses the airbag  and the first web portion , and extends from a back shell  on the connector  to proximate the hook . The cover  includes one or more tear seams (not shown) which are designed to rupture upon airbag inflation enabling the airbag  to fully inflate. In some embodiments, the cover  can comprise a segment of material, such as leather, having edges that contact one another along a longitudinal seam to form a cylindrical sheath.","In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag assembly  further includes an inflator hose  having a first end portion in fluid communication with the interior of the airbag  and a second end portion that carries a coupling . The coupling  is configured to be operably (e.g., threadably) engaged with an outlet of an airbag inflator . Various types of inflators can be used with the airbag systems described herein. In certain embodiments, the inflator  can include a stored gas canister that contains compressed gas (e.g., compressed air, nitrogen, argon, helium, etc.) that can be released upon electrical initiation of a corresponding pyrotechnic device (e.g., a squib). Suitable inflators can be provided by, for example, Autoliv Inc. of Ogden Technical Center 3350 Airport Road Ogden, Utah, USA 84405. In other embodiments, other suitable inflator devices can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Such devices can include, for example, gas generator devices that generate high pressure gas through a rapid chemical reaction of an energetic propellant. Accordingly, the present disclosure is not limited to a particular type of inflator device.","In yet another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag assembly  includes a seat belt switch  (shown schematically in ) carried on the web connector . In the illustrated embodiment, the seat belt switch  is configured to change status when the connector  is suitably engaged with the buckle . For example, in one embodiment of the present technology the seat belt switch  can be a \u201cnormally closed\u201d switch (e.g., a normally closed reed switch) that \u201copens\u201d when the connector  is engaged with the buckle . The opening of the reed switch  can be effectuated by a magnet (not shown) carried on the buckle . When the connector  is properly engaged with the buckle , the reed switch  is moved into the field of the magnet, thereby causing the switch  to open. In some embodiments, the switch  can be at least generally similar in structure and function to those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/227,382 entitled, \u201cActivation Systems for Use in Inflatable Personal Restraint Systems\u201d, which has been filed concurrently herewith and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","When the seat belt switch  is closed (i.e., when the connector  is not engaged with the buckle ), the seat belt switch  completes a circuit comprised of a pair of wires including a first wire or lead and a second wire or lead . The first and second wires , terminate in an electrical connector . A second pair of wires , also terminates in the electrical connector . A distal end portion of the second pair of wires  carries an electrical connector  configured to be operably coupled to an igniter or bridge wire in the inflator . In other embodiments, the seat belt switch  can be a \u201cnormally open\u201d switch (e.g., a normally open reed switch), that is magnetically closed when the connector  is properly engaged with the buckle .","In one embodiment, the airbag system  includes an electronic module assembly (EMA)  for controlling initiation and deployment of the airbag  during a rapid deceleration event (e.g., a crash) of sufficient magnitude. The EMA  is operably coupled to the airbag assembly  via a cable assembly . The cable assembly  includes a first connector  that is plugged in to the EMA  and a second connector  that provides a receptacle for the airbag electrical connector . In the illustrated embodiment, the EMA  includes a microprocessor  that receives electrical power from a power source  (e.g., one or more lithium batteries). In certain embodiments, the cable assembly  can include a cable loop  that completes the circuit from the power source  to the microprocessor . When employed in, for example, a commercial aircraft, the EMA  can be mounted to a rigid structure beneath the seat .","In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the EMA  includes a sensor  that detects rapid deceleration along a particular axis (e.g., an axis of forward motion of the vehicle). Moreover, in this embodiment the sensor  can include two individual sensor switches aligned with a common axis for redundancy. The sensor switches can be virtually any type of suitable switch known in the art for responding to a rapid deceleration (or acceleration) event, including magnetically-activated reed switches and\/or hall effect switches. In one embodiment, for example, the sensor switches can be at least generally similar in structure and function to the sensor switches in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/170,079, filed Jun. 27, 2011, and entitled \u201cSENSORS FOR DETECTING RAPID DECELERATION\/ACCELERATION EVENTS,\u201d which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","In operation, if the vehicle experiences a crash or other rapid deceleration event above a preset magnitude, the sensor switches in the crash sensor  close and complete their corresponding circuits. One of the sensor switches causes the programmed processor  to detect the occurrence of a crash event. Upon confirming that the seat belt connector  is properly engaged with the buckle  (e.g., by confirming that the seat belt switch  is in the \u201copen\u201d position), the programmed processor  sends a corresponding signal to a deployment circuit . Upon receiving a signal from the programmed processor , the deployment circuit  applies a sufficient voltage to a circuit that includes the igniter, thereby causing the inflator associated with the seat to discharge its compressed gas into the airbag  via the hose . The compressed gas expands and causes the airbag  to inflate and provides the seat occupant (not shown) with additional protection during the crash event.","The foregoing discussion provides a high level overview of some of the structures and functions of the airbag restraint system  configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present technology. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various aspects and features of the buckle connectors and other airbag subsystems disclosed herein can be utilized in combination with other airbag systems without departing from the spirit or scope of the present technology.","Moreover, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that additional airbag assemblies  (e.g., a second and third airbag assembly) can be operably coupled to the EMA  for use with the other seats in the row adjacent to the seat . Accordingly, in one embodiment, if a row of seats in an aircraft includes three seats, each seat could be outfitted with a seatbelt airbag assembly as described above, with each of the airbag assemblies coupled to an individual inflator as illustrated in . All three of the airbag assemblies, however, can be initiated by the single EMA .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","126","217","122","126","221","221","221","219","122","124","124","221","126","122","122"],"i":["a","b ","a","b "]},"As previously mentioned, multiple airbag assemblies  can be installed in a row of seats in an aircraft. In other embodiments, however, an airbag assembly  may be installed in a seat adjacent to another seat having a conventional seat belt without an airbag. In such an embodiment, it is desirable to ensure that the connector  and the buckle  can only be engaged with each other, and not with a buckle or a connector of another seatbelt. In the illustrated embodiment, the connector  and the buckle  are \u201ckeyed\u201d to prevent either the connector  or the buckle  from being engaged with an unintended connector or buckle that is not keyed. For example, the connector backshell  includes a first back sloped or angled edge and a second back sloped edge . The buckle  includes a complimentary first forward sloped edge and a complimentary second forward sloped edge . The back sloped edges  and the forward sloped edges  are shaped to allow the tongue portion  to be fully inserted into the buckle . A seatbelt connector having vertical edges, or edges with other shapes, in place of the forward sloped edges  would prevent the full insertion of the corresponding tongue portion into the buckle . Similarly, a seatbelt buckle having vertical edges in place of the back sloped edges  would prevent the full insertion of the tongue portion  into the buckle. Accordingly, the keyed connector  and the keyed buckle  prevent inadvertent engagement of either the buckle  or the connector  with a non-keyed buckle or connectors.","Although the illustrated embodiment is keyed with the forward sloped edges  and the back sloped edges , other embodiments may include other features for preventing inadvertent engagement with foreign buckles or connectors. Raised portions on the tongue portion , for example, may engage a groove on the buckle . In another embodiment, an offset edge on the connector  can be engaged with a corresponding slot on the buckle . The offset edge and the corresponding slot can be configured in accordance with the systems and methods of U.S. Pat. No. 6,442,807, filed Mar. 13, 2000, and entitled, \u201cAIRBAG BUCKLE ASSEMBLY,\u201d which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Accordingly, other embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure may include keyed features that have differing shapes and\/or sizes.","As described above with reference to , the airbag  is attached to the first web portion generally proximate to the connector . The airbag cover  extends from the connector  and encloses the airbag and a length of the first web portion . In several embodiments, the cover  is made of a suitable material, such as leather or fabric (e.g., woven nylon). As will be discussed in more detail below with reference to , the airbag cover  can extend over, or enclose, a portion of the connector , and the back shell  can enclose a distal end portion of the airbag cover . In some embodiments, the back shell  can be made of metal, such as aluminum. In other embodiments, the back shell  can be made from a suitable plastic, such as injection molded plastic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3C","FIG. 3A","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","323","388","221","323","323","384","388","323","384","323","384","323","386","217","122"],"i":"a "},"The seat belt switch  is mounted to the base plate  and is operably connected to the wires , via the circuit card . More specifically, in some embodiments, the first wire can be connected to the switch  via a first portion of the circuit card  on one lateral side of the web aperture . The second wire can likewise be connected to the switch  via a second portion of the circuit card  on an opposite lateral side of the web aperture . The wires , can then extend proximally along the web (e.g., along the first web portion shown in ) to the electrical connector  (illustrated in ). As discussed above with reference to , in some embodiments the switch  can be a normally-closed reed switch. The wires , can provide for input and output communication with electrical systems related to the vehicle, the airbag, and\/or system diagnostics (e.g., the EMA  described above with reference to ). As will become more apparent below with reference to , a housing  at least partially surrounds or encloses the circuit card , the switch , an aft portion  of the base plate , and a length of the wires , ; and a distal end portion of the airbag cover  is secured around the housing .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["126","380","384","388","323","380","380","380","380","384","380","384","388","323","380","323","387","386","387","126"]},"The housing  can include a body portion  and an outwardly-extending sleeve portion . The sleeve portion  can at least partially surround or encase a length of the wires , adjacent to the circuit card  shown in . The sleeve portion  can be formed (e.g., molded) from the same material as the body portion , or can be another material (e.g., rubber, plastic, etc.) attached to the body portion . The sleeve portion  can provide support for the wires , where they join to the base plate  and reduce bending movement of the wires , where they join the circuit card. Accordingly, the sleeve portion  reduces the stress and strain on the wires , and acts as a \u201cstrain relief\u201d during use of the seat belt.","In the illustrated embodiment, the housing  can further include one or more grooves, channels, slots, or recesses  configured to receive and engage a distal end portion  of the airbag cover . In the illustrated embodiment, two transverse recesses  are positioned on the lateral edge portions of the body portion . In other embodiments, the recesses  can be positioned in alternate locations on the housing  and there can be more or fewer than two recesses . For example, in some embodiments, the housing  does not have any lateral grooves or recesses  and the cover  can be attached by fasteners, friction, or other mechanisms.","Referring now to  together, the cover  can extend from the recesses  and surround, or partially surround, a portion of the housing  proximal to the recesses , including a portion of the housing body  and the housing sleeve . The cover  can further enclose the wires , extending from the housing sleeve  along a length of the web (e.g., the web shown in ). The cover  can be secured in the recesses  by friction, a drawstring that circles the open end of the cover  tight around the housing , snaps, hooks, pinching, Velcro\u00ae, fasteners, or other connection features that engage the cover  with the housing . In further embodiments, the cover  can be secured to a smooth or otherwise non-recessed portion of the housing , by, e.g., any of the connection features described above. In one embodiment, the cover  has a first circumference Cat the distal end portion  and a second circumference C, greater than the first circumference C, at a cross-section spaced apart from the distal end portion . The narrower distal end  of the cover  can provide a tightly-secured frictional fit around the housing  at the recesses .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3C"],"b":["126","124","333","132","390","333","380","390","132","380","333","132","390","132","126","132","126","132","333","333","380","333","390"],"sub":"1 "},"As discussed above with reference to , the cover  can enclose at least a portion of the body and sleeve portions ,  of the housing , the circuit card , the aft portion  of the base plate , and a length of the wires , . The back shell  can be coupled to the housing  and extend over or enclose a portion of the cover . The back shell  and housing  can accordingly sandwich the cover  therebetween and, in combination with the recesses  or other attachment features, further secure the cover  in place.","Embodiments of the present technology offer several advantages over conventional systems. The systems disclosed herein can reduce stress and\/or strain in the wires , extending from the circuit card  by limiting the local bending of the wires. More specifically, the wires , can be surrounded at the proximal edge of the circuit card  by the sleeve portion  of the housing . The sleeve portion  can be less flexible than the wires , , and can therefore limit the bending movement of the wires , . Additional strain relief can be provided by the cover  which extends over a portion of the housing . Bending force applied to the housing  can accordingly be at least partially carried by the cover , instead of the wires , . In some cases, the durable cover  can tolerate more strain than the wires , . These improvements can extend the lifetime of the wires , and reduce repair and replacement costs.","The systems disclosed herein can additionally provide greater coverage for the seat occupant in the event of deployment. In previous systems, the connector  has been generally centered in the occupant's lap and the airbag  has been spaced apart from the connector . In some instances, this has caused the airbag  to be off-center relative to the occupant. In the present system, the cover  is attached to the connector , so the airbag  can be positioned closer to the connector  and closer to the center of the occupant.","From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the various embodiments of the disclosure. The recesses or grooves  in the housing , for example, can be located at different positions on the housing , and there can be more or fewer recesses or grooves . The cover  can be coupled to the recesses  or other portions of the connector  by fastening means other than friction. Additionally, the cover  can surround or partially surround more or less of the housing . Moreover, specific elements of any of the foregoing embodiments can be combined or substituted for elements in other embodiments. Also, the restraint systems described above can be incorporated in non-automobile or non-aircraft systems. Certain aspects of the disclosure are accordingly not limited to automobile or aircraft systems. Furthermore, while advantages associated with certain embodiments of the disclosure have been described in the context of these embodiments, other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages, and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the technology. Accordingly, the disclosure is not limited, except as by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 3A-3C"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
