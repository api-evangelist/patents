title: Multimedia timeline modification in networked client/server systems
abstract: Multimedia content is streamed over a network system from a server computer to a client computer. The client allows a user to enter a variable playback speed and varies the speed at which the multimedia content is rendered at the client. Time-scale modification technology is used to maintain the original pitch of any audio content, thereby maintaining its intelligibility.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/153,664, filed Sep. 15, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,622,171 issued Sep. 16, 2003, entitled \u201cMultimedia Timeline Modification in Networked Client\/Server Systems.\u201d","This invention relates to networked client\/server systems and to methods of streaming and rendering multimedia content in such systems.","Multimedia streaming\u2014the continuous delivery of synchronized media data like video, audio, text, and animation\u2014is a critical link in the digital multimedia revolution. Today, streaming media is primarily about video and audio, but a richer, broader digital media era is emerging with a profound and growing impact on the Internet and digital broadcasting.","Synchronized media means multiple media objects that share a common timeline. Video and audio are examples of synchronized media\u2014each is a separate data stream with its own data structure, but the two data streams are played back in synchronization with each other. Virtually any media type can have a timeline. For example, an image object can change like an animated .gif file: text can change and move, and animation and digital effects happen over time. This concept of synchronizing multiple media types is gaining greater meaning and currency with the emergence of more sophisticated media composition frameworks implied by MPEG-4, Dynamic HTML, and other media playback environments.","The term \u201cstreaming\u201d is used to indicate that the data representing the various media types is provided over a network to a client computer on a real-time, as-needed basis, rather than being pre-delivered in its entirety before playback. Thus, the client computer renders streaming data as it is received from a network server, rather than waiting for an entire \u201cfile\u201d to be delivered.","The widespread availability of streaming multimedia enables a variety of informational content that was not previously available over the Internet or other computer networks. Live content is one significant example of such content. Using streaming multimedia, audio, video, or audio\/visual coverage of noteworthy events can be broadcast over the Internet as the events unfold. Similarly, television and radio stations can transmit their live content over the Internet.","In comparison to text-based or paper-based presentations, streaming multimedia presentations are very effective in certain situations. Audio\/visual presentations, for example, are able to capture and convey many subtle factors that are not perceivable from paper-based documents. Even when the content is a spoken presentation, an audio\/visual recording captures gestures, facial expressions, and various speech nuances that cannot be discerned from text or even from still photographs.","Although streaming multimedia content compares favorably with textual content in most regards, one disadvantage is that it requires significant time for viewing. It cannot be \u201cskimmed\u201d like textual content. Thus, information consumers are forced to choose between the efficiency of the written word and the richness of the multimedia experience.","The invention described below addresses this disadvantage of prior art streaming multimedia content, allowing more efficient multimedia perusal of streaming multimedia presentations than has previously been possible.","The invention utilizes time-scale modification so that a user can vary the speed of streaming content without destroying its intelligibility. In accordance with the invention, a user selects multimedia content from a menu presented at a network client computer. In addition, the user selects a speed factor, indicating the speed at which the multimedia should be rendered relative to its default speed.","In response to these selections by the user, the network client contacts a network server and initiates a composite media stream from the server to the client. As it receives the media stream, the client processes the individual media streams of the composite stream, altering their timelines in accordance with the user's speed designation. Time-scale modification techniques are used to alter audio streams to maintain their original pitch.","In alternative embodiments, timelines are altered at the server, before streaming to the client. To accomplish this, the server either alters the timelines dynamically, as specific content is requested, or selects from a number of pre-stored media streams having pre-altered timelines.","The invention includes methods of adapting to limited bandwidth situations by composing or selecting composite streams having differing degrees of quality, and\/or by composing or selecting streams with timelines that are altered to closely correspond with whatever speed factor has been chosen. In one embodiment of the invention, certain media streams, such as audio streams, take precedence over other streams such as video streams. In this embodiment of the invention, the audio stream is sent with an unaltered timeline, at a rate sufficient to satisfy the consumption requirements of the client, given the current speed factor. The video is then degraded in quality to reduce its bandwidth, so that it can be streamed in whatever bandwidth is not require by the audio.","General Network Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","11","12"]},"Server computer  has access to streaming media content in the form of different composite media streams. Some composite media streams might be stored as files in a database or other file storage system . Other composite media streams might be supplied to the server on a \u201clive\u201d basis from other data source components through dedicated communications channels or through the Internet itself.","Streaming Media","In this discussion, the term \u201ccomposite media stream\u201d describes synchronized streaming data that represents a segment of multimedia content. The composite media stream has a timeline that establishes the speed at which the content is rendered. The composite media stream can be rendered to produce a plurality of different types of user-perceivable media, including synchronized audio or sound, video graphics or motion pictures, animation, textual content, command script sequences, or other media types that convey time-varying information or content in a way that can be sensed and perceived by a human. A composite media stream comprises a plurality of individual media streams representing the multimedia content. Each of the individual media streams corresponds to and represents a different media type and each of the media streams can be rendered by a network client to produce a user-perceivable presentation using a particular presentation medium. The individual media streams have their own timelines, which are synchronized with each other so that the media streams can be rendered simultaneously for a coordinated multimedia presentation.","There are various standards for streaming media content and composite media streams. The \u201cAdvanced Streaming Format\u201d (ASF) is an example of such a standard, including both accepted versions of the standard and proposed standards for future adoption. ASF specifies the way in which multimedia content is stored, streamed, and presented by the tools, servers, and clients of various multimedia vendors. ASF provides benefits such as local and network playback, extensible media types, component download, scalable media types, prioritization of streams, multiple language support, environment independence, rich inter-stream relationships, and expandability. Further details about ASF are available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Regardless of the streaming format used, an individual data stream contains a sequence of digital data units that are rendered individually, in sequence, to produce an image, sound, or some other stimuli that is perceived by a human to be continuously varying. For example, an audio data stream comprises a sequence of sample values that are converted to a pitch and volume to produce continuously varying sound. A video data stream comprises a sequence of digitally-specified graphics frames that are rendered in sequence to produce a moving picture.","Typically, the individual data streams of a composite media stream are interleaved in a single sequence of data packets. Various types of data compression might be used within a particular data format to reduce communications bandwidth requirements.","The sequential data units (such as audio sample values or video frames) are associated with both delivery times and presentation times, relative to an arbitrary start time. The delivery time of a data unit indicates when the data unit should be delivered to a rendering client. The presentation time indicates when the value should be actually rendered. Normally, the delivery time of a data unit precedes the presentation time.","The presentation times determine the actual speed of playback. For data streams representing actual events or performances, the presentation times correspond to the relative times at which the data samples were actually recorded. The presentation times of the various different individual data streams are consistent with each other so that the streams remain coordinated and synchronized during playback.","Exemplary Computer Environment","In the discussion below, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more conventional personal computers. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. In a distributed computer environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","10","11"]},"Computer  includes one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to processors .","The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within server computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . Computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by an SCSI interface  or some other appropriate interface. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, random access memories (RAMs) read only memories (ROM), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk  optical disk , ROM , or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices such as keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit  through an interface  that is coupled to the system bus. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as speakers and printers.","Computer  operates in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet. In the described embodiment of the invention, remote computer  executes an Internet Web browser program such as the \u201cInternet Explorer\u201d Web browser manufactured and distributed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","When used in a LAN networking environment, computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via a serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Generally, the data processors of computer  are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer. Programs and operating systems are typically distributed, for example, on floppy disks or CD-ROMs. From there, they are installed or loaded into the secondary memory of a computer. At execution, they are loaded at least partially into the computer's primary electronic memory. The invention described herein includes these and other various types of computer-readable storage media when such media contain instructions or programs for implementing the steps described below in conjunction with a microprocessor or other data processor. The invention also includes the computer itself when programmed according to the methods and techniques described below. Furthermore, certain sub-components of the computer may be programmed to perform the functions and steps described below. The invention includes such sub-components when they are programmed as described. In addition, the invention described herein includes data structures, described below, as embodied on various types of memory media.","For purposes of illustration, programs and other executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the computer, and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.","Client-Based Multimedia Time-Scale Modification","As shown in , a network system in accordance with the invention includes a network server  from which a plurality of composite media streams are available. In some cases, the composite media streams are actually stored by server . In other cases, server  obtains the composite media streams from other network sources or devices.","The system also includes network clients . Generally, the network clients are responsive to user input to select or request identified composite media streams. In response to a request for a composite media stream, server  streams the requested composite media stream to the network client in accordance with some known format such as ASF. The client renders the data streams to produce the multimedia content.","In accordance with the invention, a network client also accepts a speed designation from a human user. The speed designation is preferably a speed factor relative to the original or default playback speed of the selected multimedia stream. For example, a speed factor of 1.2 indicates that the composite media stream is to be rendered at 1.2 times its original or default speed, thereby achieving time compression. A speed factor of 0.8 indicates that the composite media stream is to be rendered at 0.8 times its original or default speed, thereby achieving time expansion.","In response to the speed designation from the user, the system modifies the timelines of the individual media streams of the composite media stream, while keeping the timelines synchronized with each other and while maintaining the original pitch of any audio produced from audio streams. In one embodiment of the invention, such timeline modification is performed by the network client. In other embodiments of the invention, the timeline modification can be performed at the network server, before the media streams are streamed to the network client.","Timeline modification changes the timeline of the received data streams in accordance with the user speed designation to achieve either time compression or time expansion. With some types of media, such as video streams, this involves either omitting selected frames or modifying the presentation times of the individual data units or video frames. In other cases, such as with audio streams, the time-modification is more difficult\u2014simply changing the presentation times would alter the pitch of the original audio and make it unintelligible. Accordingly, some type of audio processing technique is used to time-compress or time-expand audio streams, while maintaining the original pitch of the audio\u2014thereby maintaining the intelligibility of the audio.","There are various known methods of audio time modification, commonly referred to as \u201ctime-scale-modification,\u201d most of which concentrate on removing redundant information from the speech signal. In a method referred to as sampling, short segments are dropped from the speech signal at regular intervals. Cross fading or smoothing between adjacent segments improves the resulting sound quality.","Another method, referred to as synchronized overlap add method (SOLA or OLA), consists of shifting the beginning of a new speech segment over the end of the preceding segment to find the point of highest cross-correlation (i.e., maximum similarity). The overlapping frames are averaged, or smoothed together, as in the sampling method.","Sampling with dichotic presentation is a variant of the sampling method that takes advantage of the auditory system's ability to integrate information from both ears. In improves on the sampling method by playing the standard sampled signal to one ear and the \u201cdiscarded\u201d material to the other ear. Intelligibility and compression increase under this dichotic presentation condition when compared with standard presentation techniques.","The methods mentioned above are considered \u201clinear\u201d because all portions of the speech signal are compressed or expanded uniformly. Other methods are considered non-linear because they non-uniformly remove portions of the time signal. One example of a non-linear time-compression method is referred to as pause removal. When using this method, a speed processing algorithm attempts to identify and remove any pauses in a recording. The embodiments described herein implement linear time-scale modification, although non-linear time-scale modification techniques can also be utilized.","More information regarding audio time modification is given in an article that appeared in the March, 1997, issue of \u201cACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction\u201d (Volume 4, Number 1, pages 3-38) (1997). For purposes of this disclosure, it can be assumed that audio time modification involves some combination of changing individual data stream samples, dropping certain samples, and adjusting presentation times of any samples that are actually rendered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["11","10","101","11","10","11","101"]},"Each media stream has a timeline, and the timelines of the individual streams are synchronized with each other so that the streams can be rendered in combination to produce coordinated multimedia content at the network client . The original timelines correspond to the original recording or rendition of the multimedia material, so that rendering the streams according to their timelines results in presentation speeds that closely match the speed of the original event or performance. In the case of audio streams, the timelines preserve the original speed and pitch of the original audio content.","The client computer has a demultiplexer component  that receives the composite media stream and that separates out the individual media streams from the composite format in which the data is streamed (such as ASF). This results in an audio stream  and a video media stream . The individual media streams are sent to and received by respective decoders  and  that perform in accordance with the particular data format being employed. For example, the decoders might perform data decompression.","The decoded data streams are then sent to and received by time modification components: an audio timeline modification component  and a video timeline modification component . These components receive input from a human operator in the form of a speed designation as described above. The timeline modification components change the timelines of the received media streams in accordance with the user speed designation to achieve either linear time compression or linear time expansion. With some types of media, such as video streams, this involves either omitting selected frames or modifying the presentation times of the individual data units or video frames. In other cases, such as with audio streams, some type of audio processing technique as the SOLA technique described above is used to time-compress or time-expand audio streams, while maintaining the original pitch of the audio and to also retain the intelligibility of the audio.","The timeline modification components  and  produce individual media streams that are provided to and received by respective renderers  and . The rendering components render the streams in accordance with their modified timelines, as the streams continue to be streamed from the network server. In alternative embodiments of the invention, timeline modification components  and  might be eliminated and their functions performed by decoders  and .","Note that the speed designation, provided by the user, dictates the rate at which the network client consumes the composite data stream. Because of this, the client communicates the speed designation to the network server when requesting a particular composite media stream. The server responds by streaming the composite media stream at a rate that depends on or is proportional to the speed designation provided by the user. For example, for a speed factor of 2.0, the client consumes data at twice the normal rate. Accordingly, the server streams the composite media stream at twice its normal rate to meet the demands of the client.","In the described embodiment, the user is allowed to change the speed designation during rendering of the composite media stream. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to change the playback speed without interrupting the playback momentarily. If this is the case, playback resumes as soon as possible, beginning at a point that shortly precedes the point at which playback was discontinued. Thus, there is some overlap in the presentation\u2014when the presentation resumes, the overlap provides context for the new content that follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["11","10"]},"A step  comprises selecting multimedia content from the network server to be rendered at the network client. In most cases, a user performs this selection from a menu of available content or via a URL (uniform resource locator) selection. The content will normally be represented by a single composite media stream. In some cases, different media streams might be available for a particular content segment, varying perhaps in quality and in required bandwidth. Preferably, however, the user is unaware of anything except the simple act of selecting a single topic or composite stream.","A step  comprises accepting a speed designation from a human user. This step is independent of the previous step of selecting the content itself. Furthermore, the user can vary the speed designation at any time during presentation of the selected content, without having to re-select the content.","A step  comprises requesting the selected content from the server at a speed which will satisfy the requirements of the user's speed designation.","A step , performed by server , comprises identifying the particular composite media stream corresponding to the selected content. Step  comprises streaming the composite media stream to the client. In this embodiment, the composite media stream has its original timeline, which does not necessarily result in the speed that the user has designated for playback.","Step , performed by the client, comprises receiving the streaming content. Step  comprises modifying the timeline of the composite media stream in accordance with the speed designation provided by the user. As described above, this involves modifying the timelines of the individual media streams while maintaining their synchronization and intelligibility. Step  comprises rendering the composite media stream in accordance with its modified timeline.","User Experience","The functionality described above is exposed through an application program executed at network client , referred to herein as a streaming multimedia player. The streaming multimedia player may be incorporated into the operating system or run as a separate, self-contained application. In either case, the streaming multimedia player operates in a graphical user interface windowing environment such as provided by the \u201cWindows\u201d brand of operating systems, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["200","200","202","204","206","208","210","202"]},"Media screen  is the region of the UI within which the multimedia content is rendered. For video content, the video is displayed on screen . For non-visual content, screen  displays static or dynamic images representing the content. For audio content, for example, a dynamically changing frequency wave that represents an audio signal is displayed in media screen .","Shuttle controls  enable the user to control play of the multimedia content. Shuttle controls  include multiple play buttons (), (), and (), a stop button , a pause button , rewind buttons  and , and fast forward buttons  and .","Play buttons ()-() are associated with different playback speeds of the multimedia content. In this illustration, play button () corresponds to a normal playback speed (i.e., \u201c\u00d71.0\u201d), play button () corresponds to a faster playback speed with a speed up factor of 25% (i.e., \u201c\u00d71.25\u201d), and play button () corresponds to an even faster playback speed with a speed up factor of 50% (i.e., \u201c\u00d71.50\u201d). It is noted, however, that more or less than three buttons may be used (e.g., two, four, five, etc.) and may correspond to speeds both above and below the normalized speed of \u201c\u00d71.0\u201d.","The user can actuate one of the play buttons via a UI actuation mechanism, such as a pointer  or by tabbing to the desired play button and hitting the \u201center\u201d key. Upon selection of a play button, the multimedia player plays the multimedia content at the playback speed associated with the selected play button. For instance, if the user selects play button () with a 25% speedup factor, the multimedia player plays the content at a playback speed of 1.25 times the original or default playback speed.","Once the multimedia content is playing at one speed, the user is free to select a new speed by actuating another of the play buttons ()-(). Suppose the user decides to slow the content back to normal speed. The user can actuate the \u201c\u00d71.0\u201d play button () to return the media content to the normal speed. In response to speed changes, the multimedia player is configured to repeat a portion of the multimedia content at the new speed.","Content information space  lists information pertaining to the multimedia content being rendered on the media screen .

The user can position the slider  at the desired speed at which the multimedia player is to play the multimedia content.","In the  illustration, range  is a continuous range from a high playback speed (i.e., 2.5\u00d7) to a low playback speed (i.e., 0.5\u00d7).

As noted above, the user can select a new speed after the content has begun playing by invoking the menu and selecting the new speed. In response, the multimedia player repeats a portion of the multimedia content and begins playing at the new speed.","Server-Based Multimedia Time-Scale Modification","In various embodiments of the invention, the step of modifying the timeline of the requested multimedia content can be performed in the client as described above, in the server, or in both the client and server. In the network environment, it is desirable to avoid performing any significant timeline modification in the server. Otherwise, the server could quickly become overloaded with requests from multiple clients.","However, in some cases it may be desirable to store multiple versions of media streams at a server and to select particular versions of the media streams depending on the timeline requirements of the client, as designated by the user. One advantage of this method is that is can require comparatively less communications bandwidth between the server and client.","As a general example, a server might store a plurality of media streams having timelines modified by different factors. When a client requests a composite media stream, the server selects the version of the media stream whose timeline most closely accords with the speed designation set by the user. If the timeline does not exactly match the speed designation, the client can perform further timeline modification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["300","301","302"]},"The various individual data streams have timelines that are modified by different degrees. The speed factors are indicated in . In this embodiment, the audio and corresponding video streams are organized as pairs, each pair forming a composite media stream having a timeline that has been modified by a factor of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5.","When a client  requests multimedia content from server , the client identifies both the content and the speed factor. In response, the server selects the audio and video streams that have timelines most closely approximating the identified speed factor, and combines those individual media streams to form the composite media stream. The resulting composite media stream is then sent to the client. When the timeline is accelerated, this saves bandwidth in comparison to sending an unaltered composite media stream having a higher streaming rate to meet the accelerated consumption demands of the client.","As a further optimization, the server can store composite media streams having different degrees of timeline modification and different degrees of quality. Generally, a media stream of a lower quality will consume less communications bandwidth than a media stream of a higher quality. Before selecting an appropriate media stream, the server determines the available bandwidth between the server and the client. It then selects a combination of individual media streams that provides the best quality while requiring no more than the available bandwidth.","When the user changes the playback speed, the client requests a new media stream that most closely corresponds to the requested speed. Playback is resumed in the new stream at the same point (relative to the subject content) at which it was discontinued in the old stream. Thus, the new stream is initiated at some intermediate point rather than at the beginning. When the streams are linearly altered, it is not difficult to determine the appropriate presentation time in the new stream. Specifically, the point in the new timeline equals oldtime(oldfactor\/newfactor), where oldtime is the presentation time in the first media stream at which the speed change is to occur, oldfactor is the playback speed or factor of the old media stream, and newfactor is the playback speed or factor of the new media stream.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["310","311","312","313"]},"When a client  requests the multimedia content from server , the server determines or notes both the speed factor designated by the user and the available bandwidth.

At this speed factor, the client consumes audio data at twice the normal rate, which in this case is 32 Kbps. That leaves 24 Kbps of available bandwidth. Accordingly, the server selects the low bandwidth video stream with the timeline modified by a factor of 2.0, and combines it with the audio stream to form a composite media stream for streaming to the client. The total required communications bandwidth is 52 Kbps, which is within the limits of the available bandwidth.","Although the example give with reference to  is relatively specific, this method of bandwidth utilization can be generalized to include other types of media streams. Each stream is assigned a priority. Audio will generally have a high priority. The high-priority streams are given priority when allocating bandwidth. Thus, in the example above, the audio stream is streamed to the client at its full quality, while the video stream is reduced in quality to fit within the remaining bandwidth.","Furthermore, a stream such as a video stream can sometimes be timeline-modified dynamically at the server without incurring significant overhead. Accordingly, the server can adjust the timeline and quality of the video stream dynamically to match the available bandwidth, eliminating the need to store multiple video streams at the server. As an example of a situation where this might be easily accomplished, an MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group) video stream contains independent frames and several levels of dependent frames. One easy way to reduce bandwidth is to simply drop lower-level dependent frames from the video stream.","Conclusion","The described methods provide efficient ways to accomplish timeline modification in a networked client\/server environment. The invention provides a user with a degree of efficiency and convenience that has previously been unavailable. When using the invention, the user can browse or skim through streaming content, thereby reducing the time required to assimilate such content. Furthermore, the invention provides for efficient use of limited bandwidth, thereby maximizing the practical applications of the invention.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described. Rather, the specific features and steps are disclosed as preferred forms of implementing the claimed invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
