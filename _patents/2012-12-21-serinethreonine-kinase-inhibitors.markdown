No. 61\/579,227 filed Dec. 22, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to compounds which inhibit serine\/threonine kinases and which are useful for treating hyperproliferative and neoplastic diseases by inhibiting signal transduction pathways which commonly are overactive or over-expressed in cancerous tissue. The present compounds are inhibitors of group 1 p21-activated protein kinases (PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3). The present invention further relates to methods for treating cancer or hyperproliferative diseases with compounds within the scope of the present invention.","Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of specific tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues in proteins. Typically, such phosphorylation can dramatically change the function of the protein and thus protein kinases can be pivotal in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process, including metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival. The mechanism of these cellular processes provides a basis for targeting protein kinases to treat disease conditions resulting from or involving disorder of these cellular processes. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, cancer and diabetes.","Protein kinases can be broken into two types, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). Both PTKs and STKs can be receptor protein kinases or non-receptor protein kinases. PAK is a family of non-receptor STKs. The p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) family of serine\/threonine protein kinases plays important roles in cytoskeletal organization, cellular morphogenesis, cellular processes and cell survival (Daniels et al., 1999 24: 350-355; Sells et al., 1997 7:162-167). The PAK family consists of six members subdivided into two groups: PAK 1-3 (group I) and PAK 4-6 (group II) which are distinguished based upon sequence homologies and the presence of an autoinhibitory region in group I PAKs. p21-Activated kinases (PAKs) serve as important mediators of Rac and Cdc42 GTPase function as well as pathways required for Ras-driven tumorigenesis. (Manser et al., 1994 367:40-46; B. Dummler et al., 2009 28:51-63; R. Kumar et al., 2006 6:459-473).","Changes in the levels and activities of group 1 PAKs in particular, are frequently associated with human malignancies including, but not limited to bladder carcinoma, breast carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, primary breast adenocarcinoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer or a squamous head and necks cancer. (J. V. Kichina et al., 2010 14(7):703) PAK1 genomic amplification at 11q13 was prevalent in luminal breast cancer, and PAK1 protein expression was associated with lymph node metastasis. High expression of PAK2 in mammary invasive ductal carcinomas has been associated with increased survival and resistance of breast tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents (X. Li et al., 2011 286(25):2291) Squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), and head and neck squamous carcinomas have aberrant cytoplasmic expression of PAK1. (C. C. Ong et al., 2011 108(17):7177) Group 1 PAKs contribute to squamous NSCLC cell motility, survival and proliferation (C. C. Ong et al., 2011 2(6):491) and PAK2 has been linked to mitosis completion in response to various cell stimuli (M. R. Banko et al., 2011, Nov. 30, 2011)","There is a continuing need for new and novel therapeutic agents that can be used for cancer and hyperproliferative conditions. The PAK family are important signaling proteins frequently over-expressed and\/or overactive in many cancerous tissues. Design and development of new pharmaceutical compounds that inhibit or modulate their activity is essential.

That is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases \u201chaving at least\u201d or \u201cincluding at least\u201d. When used in the context of a process, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the process includes at least the recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or components, but may also include additional features or components.","The term \u201cindependently\u201d is used herein to indicate that a variable is applied in any one instance without regard to the presence or absence of a variable having that same or a different definition within the same compound. Thus, in a compound in which R\u2033 appears twice and is defined as \u201cindependently carbon or nitrogen\u201d, both R\u2033s can be carbon, both R\u2033s can be nitrogen, or one R\u2033 can be carbon and the other nitrogen.","When any variable (e.g., R, R, Ar, Xor Het) occurs more than one time in any moiety or formula depicting and describing compounds employed or claimed in the present invention, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.

In general, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20%.","As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus, for a variable which is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any integer value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable which is inherently continuous, the variable can be equal to any real value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an example, a variable which is described as having values between 0 and 2, can be 0, 1 or 2 for variables which are inherently discrete, and can be 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real value for variables which are inherently continuous.","Compounds of formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomer usually produces a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates while; in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto\/enol (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH-\u21c4-C(\u2014OH)\u2550CH\u2014), amide\/imidic acid (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NH-\u21c4-C(\u2014OH)\u2550N\u2014) and amidine (\u2014C(\u2550NR)\u2014NH-\u21c4-C(\u2014NHR)\u2550N\u2014) tautomers. The latter two are particularly common in heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings and the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds.","The compounds of formula I may contain an acidic or basic center and suitable salts are formed from acids or bases may form non-toxic salts which have similar antiviral activity. Examples of salts of inorganic acids include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate. Examples of salts of organic acids include acetate, fumarate, pamoate, aspartate, besylate, carbonate, bicarbonate, camsylate, D and L-lactate, D and L-tartrate, esylate, mesylate, malonate, orotate, gluceptate, methylsulfate, stearate, glucuronate, 2-napsylate, tosylate, hibenzate, nicotinate, isethionate, malate, maleate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, esylate, and pamoate salts.

Following the 30-minute incubation, the assay mixtures were quenched by the addition of 3 \u03bcL of 250 mM EDTA, and the substrate and phosphorylated product were separated by capillary electrophoresis and detected using LabChip\u00ae Caliper 3000 (Caliper Life Sciences).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0380","num":"0378"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"PAK1","MEK1(S298)",{},"PAK1","MEK1(S298)"]},{"entry":["Cpd.","inhibition","phosphorylation","Cpd.","inhibition","phosphorylation"]},{"entry":["No.","K(\u03bcM)","IC(\u03bcM)","No.","K(\u03bcM)","IC(\u03bcM)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["I-12","0.016","0.0455","1-35","0.003","N\/A"]},{"entry":["I-7\u2002","0.005","0.0684","1-33","0.494","N\/A"]},{"entry":["I-6\u2002","0.072","0.709","1.28","0.008","0.0531"]},{"entry":["I-4\u2002","0.060","0.325","1-16","0.022","0.0726"]},{"entry":["I-10","0.067","1.1","1-18","0.024","0.221"]},{"entry":["I-31","0.133","N\/A","1-24","0.052","0.191"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"1"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":["2","2 "]}}]}}]}}},"Group I PAKs (PAK1-3) are activated upon binding to the Rho GTPases, Rac 1 and Cdc42. Activated group I PAKs phosphorylate MEK1 at Serine 298 (S298), one of the two sites in the catalytic domain that is important for stable association between Raf and MEK1 and subsequent MAPK activation. The inhibition of group I PAKs in EBC1 cells is assessed by detecting changes in the level of MEK1 phosphorylation at S298 using homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF). Inhibitory activity was estimated by treating 2\u00d710EBC1 cells for 2 h with PAK inhibitors in media containing 0.1% FBS. Following inhibitor treatment, cells were lysed with 25 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 cellular kinase lysis buffer (Cisbio) containing 1\u00d7 cellular kinase blocking reagent (Cisbio). Cellular lysis was carried out at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 h with constant shaking before lysate (16 \u03bcL) was transferred to white 384-well ProxiPlates\u2122 (Perkin Elmer). Anti-total MEK1 antibody labeled with Europium cryptate donor (1 ng\/well) (Cell Signaling Technologies catalog number 2352) and anti-phospho MEK1 (S298) antibody labeled with d2 acceptor (Cell Signaling Technologies catalog number 9128) (10 ng\/well) were prepared in 1\u00d7 detection buffer (CisBio) and added to each well of the assay plate and allowed to incubate at RT overnight. The following day the fluorescence emission from each well was measured in EnVision\u00ae (Perkin Elmer) at an excitation of 330 nm and dual emission wavelengths of 615 nm and 665 nm. The signal in each well at 665 nm was multiplied by 10,000 and divided by the signal in the same well at 615 nm to obtain a ratio. Ratio values ([665*10,000]\u00f7615) were plotted as a function of the concentration of compound to determine ICvalues.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the subject Compounds for administration via several routes can be prepared as described in this Example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0383","num":"0381"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Ingredient","% wt.\/wt."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Active ingredient","20.0%"]},{"entry":[{},"Lactose","79.5%"]},{"entry":[{},"Magnesium stearate","\u20020.5%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The ingredients are mixed and dispensed into capsules containing about 100 mg each; one capsule would approximate a total daily dosage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0385","num":"0383"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Ingredient","% wt.\/wt."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Active ingredient","20.0%"]},{"entry":[{},"Magnesium stearate","\u20020.5%"]},{"entry":[{},"Crosscarmellose sodium","\u20022.0%"]},{"entry":[{},"Lactose","76.5%"]},{"entry":[{},"PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidine)","\u20021.0%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The ingredients are combined and granulated using a solvent such as methanol.
