title: Browser-plugin based method for advanced HTTPS data processing
abstract: The invention described here deals with implementing custom data processing of HTTPS based on a Browser-Plugin Method. Such custom data processing may include, but is not limited to, custom data compression, custom data encryption, data monitoring, data modification. There are two distinct methods to implement the Browser-Plugin Method for Advanced HTTPS Data Processing of the subject invention (BPAHDP). In both cases, BPAHDP provides the option of conducting custom data processing that co-exists with data compression, data encryption, or other types of data processing operations supported by the HTTP standard. Additionally, both BPAHDP methods ensure that the web-browser still implements and executes the underlying SSL/TLS channel setup and encryption operations. In both embodiments of BPAHDP, the most critical functionality is the ability to modify HTTP request/response headers and data sent over a TLS/SSL channel. In the regular HTTP case (HTTP over TCP) headers and data are sent as clear-text (i.e., as unencrypted data). Therefore, any HTTP proxy component can intercept and modify header/data as it choosesâ€”allowing custom data processing operations (including a custom compression operation) to be implemented. For HTTPS traffic, the data leaving a web-browser is encrypted. Therefore, a proxy cannot modify encrypted data, hence the novelty of the BPAHDP methodology. Both methods require specific implementation methods that are described. In particular, both embodiments of BPAHDP require specific techniques to facilitate the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer as a BPAHDP enabled web-browser. Microsoft COM (Component Object Model) interfaces and IE's Pluggable Protocol capabilities are utilized to meet all requirements of both BPAHDP embodiments.

No. 11\/313,771, filed on Dec. 22, 2005, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/637,767, filed on Dec. 22, 2004; the contents of application Ser. No. 11\/313,771 and of Application No. 60\/637,767 are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a novel method of utilizing a browser plugin that provides a technique for interception and further processing of data sent via the HTTPS protocol. The HTTPS protocol is defined as HTTP over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL), or HTTP over a Transport Layer Security (TLS). See A. Freier, P. Karlton and P. Kocher, \u201cInternet-Draft: The SSL Protocol Version 3.0,\u201d , November 1996, for a discussion of SSL, and T. Dierks and C. Allen, \u201cRequest for Comments: 2246\u2014The TLS Protocol,\u201d , January 1999 for a discussion of TLS. A potential application of the subject method can be to apply proprietary data compression methods to reduce the volume of data communication of HTTPS payload data and also to possibly reduce the data transmission time. It should be noted that the option of applying proprietary data processing in this case is available in addition to standard built-in HTTPS compression and encoding approaches such as \u2018Content-Encoding\u2019 methods: gzip, compress, deflate, described in section 3.5 of the article entitled \u201cRequest for Comments: 2616, Hypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1,\u201d , June 1999, by R. Fielding, J. Gettys, J. Mogul, H Frystyk, L. Masinter, P. Leach, and T. Berners-Lee.","Presently, large volumes of data are delivered over the Internet by server computers to client computing devices such as desktop computers, laptops and various handheld digital devices using a communication protocol called \u2018Hyper Text Transfer Protocol\u2019 (HTTP). The HTTP protocol strictly defines the interaction between a client device that sends requests for data, and a server that supplies the data. A client, after sending the request for data to the server, waits for the server's response, and then normally, upon receipt of data, delivers the data to the end user. In many cases, the client is implemented by a software component called a \u2018web-browser\u2019. The server is usually implemented by a software component called a \u2018web-server\u2019.","Rapid expansion in Internet usage by businesses, banking and direct consumer shopping led to the definition of a standard approach for sending encrypted HTTP data between HTTP clients and servers. This approach (also known as HTTPS) was first implemented by Netscape as HTTP over a Secure-Socket Layer (SSL) TCP\/IP connection. The HTTPS protocol allowed end-users and corporations to safely send credit-card and other sensitive information over the internet. More specifically, it prevents eavesdropping, message forgery and tampering of HTTP data sent between client\/server applications. The first implementations of HTTPS utilized 40-bit encryption while the latest standard (HTTP over TLS described in an article by E. Rescorla entitled \u201cRequest for Comments: 2818, HTTP over TLS,\u201d , May 2000), facilitates the use of powerful 128-bit encryption.","The underlying implementations of SSL and TLS are described in the article by A. Freier et al. and in the article by T. Dierks et al. respectively. Although the mechanisms are different, both SSL and TLS essentially involve several common stages:\n\n","It is imperative for SSL and TLS functionality to be implemented by the web-browser so that the SSL\/TLS \u2018channel\u2019 is established directly from the web-browser. This guarantees the encryption and security of all HTTP data originating from the web-browser and received from the web-server. Reference is made to  which depicts the aforementioned scenario.","Now consider the compression of HTTPS data (HTTP payload data sent over an SSL or TLS channel) in order to reduce the volume of data transmission. Content-encoding methods inherently present in the HTTP standard (section 3.5 of the article by R. Fielding et al.) can be used to reduce the volume of data sent in HTTPS transactions. These methods consist of a class of lossless compression algorithms such as gzip, compress and deflate which can be supported within web-browsers and web-servers.","Unfortunately, custom approaches (e.g., proprietary data-compression) or any other proprietary or custom data processing cannot be supported by HTTPS. HTTPS does not provide for a standard interface or mechanism to facilitate custom data transformation. More specifically, the encryption of HTTP data actually randomizes the original source HTTP data. In an information-theoretic sense, the entropy of the encrypted data is significantly higher than the original source data. Significant randomization of source data limits the effectiveness of data-compression. The encrypted data also makes it difficult to do many other types of desirable data processing operations such as data recording, data monitoring, or data alteration. Since SSL and TLS are designed to prevent data-tampering or \u201cman in the middle\u201d viewing, retrieving the original source HTTP data is extremely difficult.","There are two distinct methods to implement the Browser-Plugin Method for Advanced HTTPS Data Processing of the subject invention (BPAHDP). In both cases, BPAHDP provides the option of conducting custom data processing operations including data compression, data encryption, or other types of data processing operations supported by the HTTP standard. Additionally, both BPAHDP methods ensure that the web-browser still implements and executes the underlying SSL\/TLS channel setup and encryption operations. In both embodiments of BPAHDP, the most critical functionality is the ability to modify HTTP request\/response headers and data sent over a TLS\/SSL channel. In the regular HTTP case (HTTP over TCP) headers and data are sent as clear-text (i.e., as unencrypted data). Therefore, an HTTP proxy (an intermediary software entity that fetches HTTP data on behalf of a group of HTTP clients) component can intercept and modify header\/data as it chooses\u2014allowing custom data processing operations (including a custom compression operation) to be implemented. The subject of Performance Enhancing Proxies is discussed in a document (Request for Comments 3135, Network Working Group, June 2001) by J. Border, M. Kojo, J. Griner, G. Montenegro, and Z. Shelby, entitled, \u201cPerformance Enhancing Proxies Intended to Mitigate Link-Related (Degradations\u201d. For HTTPS traffic, the data leaving a web-browser is encrypted. Therefore, a proxy cannot modify encrypted data, hence the novelty of the BPAHDP methodology. Both BPAHDP methods require specific implementation methods. In particular, both embodiments of BPAHDP require specific techniques to facilitate the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer as a BPAHDP enabled web-browser. Microsoft COM (Component Object Model) interfaces and IE's Pluggable Protocol capabilities are utilized to meet all requirements of both BPAHDP embodiments.","Define WSA as a BPAHDP enabled web-server (a web-server that has implemented \u2018Advanced Processing\u2019 or custom data processing of HTTP payload data) that is able to accept HTTPS connections from standard web-browsers.
