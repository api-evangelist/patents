{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","NOTATION AND NOMENCLATURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Some software applications may utilize a computer network, such as the Internet, to exchange application data with a user. The network may comprise a plurality of devices, such as switches, routers, and computer systems, that are coupled together via a network topology, such as Ethernet and Token Ring. A web-server may establish network connections that reliably transfer the application data across the network. The network connections may facilitate the transfer of application data through one or more network protocols, such as transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP).","When an application and a user of the application are operating on the same computer system, it may be undesirable to utilize a web-server. The web-server may open computer ports and increase the vulnerability of the computer system that operates the application to computer-based attacks, such as denials of service and buffer overflows. In addition, the web-server may require additional processing that may be unnecessary, such as instantiating the TCP\/IP stack.","One exemplary embodiment may be a system that comprises a central processing unit (CPU), an application, and a facade server. The facade server may host the application without utilizing network protocols. A program executing on the CPU may create an interface between the facade server and a browser for exchanging data associated with the application.","Certain terms are used throughout the following description and claims to refer to particular system components. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, computer companies may refer to a component by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function.","In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are used in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to . . . \u201d Also, the verb \u201ccouple\u201d or \u201ccouples\u201d is intended to mean either an indirect or direct connection. Thus, if a first device couples to a second device, that connection may be through a direct connection, or through an indirect connection via other devices and connections.","The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. The embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted, or otherwise used, as limiting the scope of the disclosure unless otherwise specified. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure is limited to that embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","102","104","106","108","110","112","104"]},"The application  may be any type of web-based application that is capable of being hosted by a web-server, such as Apache\u00ae, Tomcat\u00ae, and Internet Information Server (IIS\u00ae). More specifically, the application  may comprise one or more software functions and\/or data files (not specifically shown) that may utilize web-based technologies, such as Perl, Java\u00ae, active server pages (ASP), hypertext preprocessing (PHP), and\/or hypertext markup language (HTML), to generate static and\/or dynamic content. The methods and systems described herein relate to one or more web-based applications that are operated by a user on the same computer system that is executing the applications.","The user may interact with the applications without utilizing network protocols, such as TCP\/IP and internet packet exchange (IPX), and without opening network ports. The facade server  may interact with the application  by creating one or more interfaces (not shown in ), such as application programming interface (APIs) and common gateway interfaces (CGIs), that may ordinarily be created by a web-server. The interfaces allow the application  to communicate with the facade server  in a substantially similar manner as the application  would communicate with a web-server.","However, the facade server  preferably does not use network protocols to communicate with a user of the application . Instead, the plugin  may exchange application data between the facade server  and the browser  through a local protocol that is supported by the system . The local protocol may facilitate the exchange of data via one or more software component models, such as Component Object Model (COM), named data pipes, memory mapped I\/O streams, data files, and other methods of locally transferring data between software components.","The browser  may be capable of rendering application data generated by the application  onto a display  via an input\/output (I\/O) interface . The browser  may be any type of web-browser, such as Internet Explorer\u00ae, Netscape\u00ae, and Mozilla\u00ae. The plugin  may be a web-browser plugin, such as a dynamic link library (DLL) using the asynchronous pluggable protocol (APP), a Java\u00ae applet, or any other type of plugin that may interact with the browser . Other components, such as a keyboard and pointing device (not specifically shown), may be included in system  as desired.","Referring now to , an exemplary data flow between the browser , the plugin , the facade server , and the application  of  is shown. While being executed by the CPU  (), the facade server  may send one or more requests  to the application . Each request  may include an input to the one or more software functions associated with the application . Upon receiving a request , the application  may service the request  by executing the appropriate software functions on the CPU  () and may generate a corresponding reply . The request  and corresponding reply  are transferred through one or more web-server interfaces .","The facade server  may be configured to perform the functions associated with a web-server, such as serving web-pages, parsing data files, and processing server side includes (SSI), without utilizing network protocols, such as TCP\/IP, to transfer application data. Instead, the plugin  may interact with the facade server  via an application programming interface (API) . The API  may comprise one or more software functions that facilitate the exchange of application data between the plugin  and the facade server .","To integrate the plugin  with the web browser , a local protocol  may be registered on the system  (). Registering a protocol integrates the protocol scheme and one or more protocol handlers with the browser . For example, many external protocols, such as file transfer protocol (FTP) and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), may be registered with a browser. The registration of the protocols allows the browser to handle protocol-specific schemes, such as FTP and HTTP. The handler of the protocol may be a program responsible for handling references using the protocol scheme. For example, an FTP reference (e.g., a URL having an \u201cftp:\/\/\u201d scheme, followed by a hostname such as \u201cmicrosoft,\u201d followed by an orqanization type, such as \u201c.com\u201d) may be handled by an FTP dynamic link library (DLL) that attempts to establish an FTP connection with a server (e.g., a commercial server associated with MICROSOFT\u00ae).","In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the local protocol , having a predetermined scheme, may be registered with the web browser  and may designate the plugin  as the handler of the predetermined scheme. The web browser  may submit a request  to the plugin  by referencing the registered scheme of the local protocol .","The request  may include several types of data. The request  may include form data that is generated from web-based forms that are rendered by the browser , universal resource indicator (URI) data that is generated when a user selects a hyperlink that uses the scheme of the local protocol, or data generated from any other means for exchanging information between a browser and an application through a local protocol. A corresponding reply  to the request  may be sent from the plugin  after the request  is processed by the facade server  and, if necessary, the application .","In alternative embodiments, the plugin , the facade server , and the application  may be combined into a single component that is executed by the CPU  when the local protocol  is referenced by the web browser . The plugin , the facade server , and the application  may remain distinct, utilizing different address spaces, or be combined to use a common address space.","In other embodiments, the web server interface  may comprise a plurality of interfaces that mimic various types of web-servers, such as Tomcat\u00ae, Apache\u00ae, and IIS\u00ae. To an application being hosted by the facade server , the web-server interface  may interact with the application in a substantially similar manner as the application would interact with the web-server being mimicked. Thus, multiple protocol handlers may be registered in the system , one for each type of web-server being mimicked by the web server interface .","In alternative embodiments, a web-server may be employed in conjunction with the facade server  to host one or more applications in a local-only mode and a network mode.  illustrates a computer system constructed in accordance with these embodiments of the invention. System  may be any type of computer system, such as a laptop computer, a personal computer, or a stand-alone computer operated as a server. The system may comprise a single central processing unit (CPU) , as illustrated in , or may comprise a plurality of CPUs arranged in a configuration where parallel computing may take place. The CPU  may couple to a memory  that may store a browser  program, a plugin  program, a facade server  program, a web-server  program, and an application . In addition, a control file  that controls the operational mode of the system  is stored in the memory . The memory  may comprise volatile memory and\/or non-volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), and a hard drive.","While operating in the local-only mode, the facade server  may handle local requests from the plugin , as previously described. While operating in the network mode, the web-server  may handle local and remote requests. The mode of operation may be determined by a setting a flag in the control file . The browser  may be capable of rendering application data generated by the application  onto a display  via an input\/output (I\/O) interface .","The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention. Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a detailed description of the embodiments of the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
